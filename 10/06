CuIn$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$Se$_2$ (CIGS) has been established as a mature\ntechnology for thin-film photovoltaics, however, its potential for\nSemi-Transparent Photovoltaics (STPV) is yet to be explored. In this paper, we\npresent its carrier transport physics explaining the trend seen in recently\npublished experiments. STPV requires deposition of films of only a few hundred\nnanometers to make them transparent and manifests several unique properties\ncompared to a conventional thin-film solar cell. Our analysis shows that the\nshort-circuit current, Jsc is dominated by carriers generated in the depletion\nregion, making it nearly independent of bulk and back-surface recombination.\nThe bulk recombination, which limits the open-circuit voltage Voc, appears to\nbe higher than usual attributable to numerous grain boundaries. When the\nabsorber layer is reduced below 500 nm, grain size reduces resulting in more\ngrain boundaries and higher resistance. This produces an inverse relationship\nbetween series resistance and absorber thickness. We also present a\nthickness-dependent model of shunt resistance showing its impact in these\nultra-thin devices. For various scenarios of bulk and interface recombinations,\nshunt and series resistances, AVT and composition of CuIn$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$Se$_2$,\nwe project the efficiency limit which - for most practical cases - is found to\nbe $\\leq$10% for AVT $\\geq$25%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 16:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Since these\ntechnologies present distinct advantages and tradeoffs compared to conventional\nDDR* SDRAM, such as higher bandwidth with lower capacity or vice versa, they\nare typically packaged alongside conventional SDRAM in a heterogeneous memory\narchitecture. To utilize the different types of memory efficiently, new data\nmanagement strategies are needed to match application usage to the best\navailable memory technology. However, current proposals for managing\nheterogeneous memories are limited because they either: 1) do not consider\nhigh-level application behavior when assigning data to different types of\nmemory, or 2) require separate program execution (with a representative input)\nto collect information about how the application uses memory resources.\n  This work presents a toolset for addressing the limitations of existing\napproaches for managing complex memories.

We first selected candidates\nby visual inspection of the image, and screened out artefacts which can mimic\nsuper-soft X-ray sources as well as bright foreground stars which create\noptical loading on the CCD image. We finally obtained 4 new super-soft X-ray\nsources for which we performed detailed X-ray timing and spectral analysis and\nsearched for possible optical counterparts to identify their nature. XMMU\nJ050452.0-683909 is identified as the central star of the planetary nebula SMP\nLMC21 in the LMC. We suggest XMMU J051854.8-695601 and XMMU J050815.1-691832 as\nnew soft intermediate polars from the nature of their X-ray spectrum. Their\nestimated absorption-corrected luminosities and the blackbody radii indicate\nthat they are located in our Galaxy, rather than the LMC. We discovered\ncoherent pulsations of 497 s from XMMU J044626.6-692011 which indicates a\nmagnetic cataclysmic variable nature of the source. The location of XMMU\nJ044626.6-692011 in the LMC or our Galaxy is less clear. It could either be a\nwhite dwarf in the LMC with nuclear burning on its surface near the Eddington\nlimit, or another soft intermediate polar in our Galaxy. The discovery of new\nsuper-soft X-ray sources makes a significant contribution to the known\npopulation in our own Galaxy. An observed higher density of sources in the\ndirection of the Magellanic Clouds can likely be explained by the relatively\nlow Galactic column density in their direction as well as a large number of\nexisting observations sensitive at low X-ray energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 16:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-29"}

While asynchronous training handles stragglers\nefficiently, it does not ensure privacy due to the incompatibility with the\nsecure aggregation protocols. A buffered asynchronous training protocol known\nas FedBuff has been proposed recently which bridges the gap between synchronous\nand asynchronous training to mitigate stragglers and to also ensure privacy\nsimultaneously. FedBuff allows the users to send their updates asynchronously\nwhile ensuring privacy by storing the updates in a trusted execution\nenvironment (TEE) enabled private buffer. TEEs, however, have limited memory\nwhich limits the buffer size. Motivated by this limitation, we develop a\nbuffered asynchronous secure aggregation (BASecAgg) protocol that does not rely\non TEEs. The conventional secure aggregation protocols cannot be applied in the\nbuffered asynchronous setting since the buffer may have local models\ncorresponding to different rounds and hence the masks that the users use to\nprotect their models may not cancel out. BASecAgg addresses this challenge by\ncarefully designing the masks such that they cancel out even if they correspond\nto different rounds.

While the role of lattice flexibility in the thermal response of\nperovskites has become increasingly evident, the description of\nthermally-induced distortions is still unclear. In this work, we provide a\nunified picture of thermal activation in CsPbBr3 across length scales, showing\nthat lattice symmetry does not increase at high temperatures. We combine\ntemperature-dependent XRD, Br K-edge XANES, ab initio MD simulations, and\ncalculations of the XANES spectra by first-principles, accounting for both\nthermal fluctuations and core hole final state effects. We find that the\noctahedral tilting of the Pb-Br inorganic framework statistically adopts\nmultiple local configurations over time - in the short-range. In turn, the\nstochastic nature of the local thermal fluctuations uplifts the longer-range\nperiodic octahedral tilting characterizing the low temperature structure, with\nthe statistical mean of the local configurations resulting in a cubic-like\ntime-averaged lattice. These observations can be rationalized in terms of\ndisplacive thermal phase transitions through the soft mode model, in which the\nphonon anharmonicity of the flexible inorganic framework causes the excess free\nenergy surface to change as a function of temperature. Our work demonstrates\nthat the effect of thermal dynamics on the XANES spectra can be effectively\ndescribed for largely anharmonic systems, provided ab initio MD simulations are\nperformed to determine the dynamically fluctuating structures, and core hole\nfinal state effects are included in order to retrieve an accurate XANES line\nshape. Moreover, it shows that the soft mode model, previously invoked to\ndescribe displacive thermal phase transitions in oxide perovskites, carries a\nmore general validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 17:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

This strengthens the identification of the reduced\nsteady state with the mean force Gibbs state. Additionally, we also compare our\nexpressions with another recent result obtained from a high temperature\nexpansion of the mean force Gibbs state. We observe numerically a good\nagreement for ultra strong coupling as well as for high temperatures. This\nconfirms the validity of all these results. In particular, we show that, in\nterm of coherences, all three results allow one to sketch the transition from\nultrastrong coupling to weak coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 17:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 16:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 08:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 10:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Anchoring works by first\ntransforming the input into a tuple consisting of an anchor point drawn from a\nprior distribution, and a combination of the input sample with the anchor using\na pretext encoding scheme. This encoding is such that the original input can be\nperfectly recovered from the tuple -- regardless of the choice of the anchor.\nTherefore, any predictive model should be able to predict the target response\nfrom the tuple alone (since it implicitly represents the input).

In solid state\nexperiments, DSF can be measured through neutron scatterings. However, it is in\ngeneral challenging to compute the spectral properties accurately via many-body\nsimulations. Currently, quantum simulation and computation constitute a\nthriving research field, which are believed to provide a very promising\nplatform for simulating quantum many-body systems. In this work, we establish a\nlink between the many-body dynamics and quantum simulations by studying the\nnon-equilibrium DSF (nDSF) measured on direct product states, which are\naccessible in contemporary quantum simulators with Rydberg atoms,\nsuperconducting qubits, etc. Based on the many-body calculations of transverse\nfield Ising chains, we find the nDSF can be used to sensitively probe the\nmulti-spinon continua associated with the two-spinon creation and the\nspinon-antispinon process, etc. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the\nlow-energy spinons can be confined -- forming spinon bound states -- under a\nfinite longitudinal field.

However, strong contextual\npriors can have detrimental implications like mistaking a pedestrian crossing\nthe street for a car. In this work, we focus on the importance of balancing\nglobal scene context and local geometry, with the goal of generalizing beyond\nthe contextual priors in the training set. In particular, we propose a \"mixing\"\ntechnique which creates new training samples by combining two augmented scenes.\nBy doing so, object instances are implicitly placed into novel out-of-context\nenvironments and therefore making it harder for models to rely on scene context\nalone, and instead infer semantics from local structure as well.

Many of the SF\ngalaxies with enhanced metallicities are found in the core regions of the\nphase-space diagram expected for virialized populations. We find a higher\nfraction of higher mass SF galaxies at R<R500 in clusters with active BCGs\ncompared to clusters with passive BCGs, a signal for galactic conformity. In\ncontrast, much higher fractions of AGNs and especially recently quenched\ngalaxies (RQGs) at R<R500 are found in clusters with passive BCGs in comparison\nto clusters with active BCGs. We deduce that strangulation is initiated in\nclusters with passive BCGs when SF satellite galaxies pass R200, by stopping\nthe pristine gas inflow which would otherwise dilute the ISM and would maintain\ntheir metallicities at values similar to those of field galaxies at similar\nredshifts. For galaxies with higher masses which survived to be SF when\ntravelling to R<R500 of clusters with passive BCGs, we assume that they suffer\na rapid quenching of star formation, likely due to AGNs triggered by the\nincreasing RPS toward the cluster center, which can compress the gas and fuel\nAGNs; these AGNs can rapidly quench and maintain quenched satellite galaxies.\nOn the other hand, we found that surviving SF massive satellite galaxies around\nactive BCGs are less affected by environment when they enter R<R500, since we\nobserve R<R500 SF galaxies with higher masses and with metallicities typical of\ncoeval field galaxies. This observed galactic conformity implies that active\nBCGs must maintain their activity over timescales of at least ~1Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 18:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

We performed simultaneous retrievals of\nstellar and planetary spectra for the archetypal planet WASP-43b in its\noriginal configuration and a non-transiting configuration to determine the\nefficacy of the PIE technique for characterizing the planet's nightside\natmospheric thermal structure and composition using typical out-of-transit JWST\nobservations. We found that using PIE with JWST should enable the stellar and\nplanetary spectra to be disentangled with no degeneracies seen between the two\nflux sources, thus allowing robust constraints on the planet's nightside\nthermal structure and water abundance to be retrieved. The broad wavelength\ncoverage achieved by combining spectra from NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI enables\nPIE retrievals that are within 10% of the precision attained using traditional\nsecondary eclipse measurements, although mid-IR observations with MIRI alone\nmay face up to 3.5 times lower precision on the planet's irradiation\ntemperature. For non-transiting planets with unconstrained radius priors, we\nwere able to identify and break the degeneracy between planet radius and\nirradiation temperature using data that resolved the peak of both the stellar\nand planetary spectra, thus potentially increasing the number of planets\namenable to atmospheric characterization with JWST and other future mission\nconcepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 18:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

However, measuring the chemical\nlikeness of stars using abundances directly is limited by systematic imprints\nof imperfect synthetic spectra in abundance derivation. We present a novel\ndata-driven model that is capable of identifying chemically similar stars from\nspectra alone. We call this Relevant Scaled Component Analysis (RSCA). RSCA\nfinds a mapping from stellar spectra to a representation that optimizes\nrecovery of known open clusters. By design, RSCA amplifies factors of chemical\nabundance variation and minimizes those of non-chemical parameters, such as\ninstrument systematics. The resultant representation of stellar spectra can\ntherefore be used for precise measurements of chemical similarity between\nstars. We validate RSCA using 185 cluster stars in 22 open clusters in the\nAPOGEE survey. We quantify our performance in measuring chemical similarity\nusing a reference set of 151,145 field stars. We find that our representation\nidentifies known stellar siblings more effectively than stellar abundance\nmeasurements. Using RSCA, 1.8% of pairs of field stars are as similar as birth\nsiblings, compared to 2.3% when using stellar abundance labels. We find that\nalmost all of the information within spectra leveraged by RSCA fits into a\ntwo-dimensional basis, which we link to [Fe/H] and alpha-element abundances. We\nconclude that chemical tagging of stars to their birth clusters remains\nprohibitive.

Tests on\nartificial and real graphs reveal that robustness modularity can be used to\nassess and compare the strength of the community structure of different\nnetworks.

Many current approaches customize existing\noff-policy RL algorithms, especially actor-critic algorithms in which policy\nevaluation and improvement are iterated. However, the convergence of such\napproaches is not guaranteed due to the use of complex non-linear function\napproximation and an intertwined optimization process. By contrast, we propose\na simple baseline algorithm for offline RL that only performs the policy\nevaluation step once so that the algorithm does not require complex\nstabilization schemes. Since the proposed algorithm is not likely to converge\nto an optimal policy, it is an appropriate baseline for actor-critic algorithms\nthat ought to be outperformed if there is indeed value in iterative\noptimization in the offline setting. Surprisingly, we empirically find that the\nproposed algorithm exhibits competitive and sometimes even state-of-the-art\nperformance in a subset of the D4RL offline RL benchmark. This result suggests\nthat future work is needed to fully exploit the potential advantages of\niterative optimization in order to justify the reduced stability of such\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 19:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Using these predictions, we\nformulate checkpoint optimization as an integer programming problem and propose\na scalable heuristic algorithm that meets the latency requirement of the\nproduction environment.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Phoebe in production workloads, and show\nthat we can free the temporary storage on hotspots by more than 70% and restart\nfailed jobs 68% faster on average with minimum performance impact.

Zero, one, or more\noperation implementations can be provided for any given representation, giving\nalgorithms the flexibility to use the most appropriate available\nimplementations for their purposes and enabling representations to be used in\nways that suit their capabilities. In this paper, we explain the general\napproach of implicitly defined representations and provide a variety of\nexamples of representations at varying degrees of abstraction. We also show how\na relatively small set of operations can serve to unify a variety of AI\nalgorithms. Finally, we discuss how algorithms can use policies to choose which\noperation implementations to use during execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 19:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Existing approaches explore the discrete nature of human\nintent before predicting continuous trajectories, to improve accuracy and\nsupport explainability. However, these approaches often assume the intent to\nremain fixed over the prediction horizon, which is problematic in practice,\nespecially over longer horizons. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nHYPER, a general and expressive hybrid prediction framework that models\nevolving human intent. By modeling traffic agents as a hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous system, our approach is capable of predicting discrete\nintent changes over time. We learn the probabilistic hybrid model via a maximum\nlikelihood estimation problem and leverage neural proposal distributions to\nsample adaptively from the exponentially growing discrete space. The overall\napproach affords a better trade-off between accuracy and coverage. We train and\nvalidate our model on the Argoverse dataset, and demonstrate its effectiveness\nthrough comprehensive ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 20:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Here, we\nunify them and propose a technique that can jointly perform both, showing that\nthese two tasks indeed benefit from each other. Recent attempts employ\nself-supervised learning, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC), where\nthe next frame is predicted given past context. However, CPC only looks at the\naudio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a\nsegmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework to model the signal\nstructure at a higher level, e.g., phone level. A convolutional neural network\nlearns frame-level representation from the raw waveform via noise-contrastive\nestimation (NCE). A differentiable boundary detector finds variable-length\nsegments, which are then used to optimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn\nsegment representations. The differentiable boundary detector allows us to\ntrain frame-level and segment-level encoders jointly. Experiments show that our\nsingle model outperforms existing phone and word segmentation methods on TIMIT\nand Buckeye datasets. We discover that phone class impacts the boundary\ndetection performance, and the boundaries between successive vowels or\nsemivowels are the most difficult to identify. Finally, we use SCPC to extract\nspeech features at the segment level rather than at uniformly spaced frame\nlevel (e.g., 10 ms) and produce variable rate representations that change\naccording to the contents of the utterance. We can lower the feature extraction\nrate from the typical 100 Hz to as low as 14.5 Hz on average while still\noutperforming the MFCC features on the linear phone classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 20:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 21:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Global fits\nto a sterile neutrino model find a strong preference for such a model over the\nmassive neutrino Standard Model. However, the fit results suffer from\ninconsistencies between datasets, referred to as tension. This motivates more\ncomplicated models for new physics. This thesis considers a model of unstable\nsterile neutrinos, where the heaviest mass state can decay. First, the\nphenomenology of unstable sterile neutrinos is explored in the IceCube\nexperiment, a gigaton neutrino detector located at the South Pole. Second,\nglobal fits to traditional and unstable sterile neutrino models are combined\nwith one year of data from IceCube. A preference for the unstable sterile\nneutrino model is found, as well as a reduction in tension. Lastly, a high\nstatistics search for unstable sterile neutrinos is performed in IceCube. The\nStandard Model is rejected with a $p$-value of 2.8% and the traditional sterile\nneutrino model is rejected with a $p$-value of 4.9%. The best-fit point is\n$\\Delta m_{41}^2 = 6.7^{+3.9}_{-2.5}$ eV$^{2}$, $\\sin^2 2 \\theta_{24} =\n0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $g^2 = 2.5 \\pi \\pm 1.5 \\pi$, where $g$ is the\ncoupling that mediates the neutrino decay. The best-fit corresponds to a\nlifetime of the heaviest neutrino of $\\tau_4/m_4 = 6\\times 10^{-16}$ s/eV. A\nBayesian analysis finds a best model with similar sterile parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 20:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Most\nof the existing literature on MARL concentrates on zero-sum Markov games but is\nnot applicable to general-sum Markov games. It is known that the best-response\ndynamics in general-sum Markov games are not a contraction. Therefore,\ndifferent equilibria in general-sum Markov games can have different values.\nMoreover, the Q-function is not sufficient to completely characterize the\nequilibrium. Given these challenges, model based learning is an attractive\napproach for MARL in general-sum Markov games.\n  In this paper, we investigate the fundamental question of \\emph{sample\ncomplexity} for model-based MARL algorithms in general-sum Markov games.

A\nmultiphase model of blood flow allows the resolution of locally varying density\nof red blood cells within a complex vessel geometrical domain, and haemodynamic\nconsequences of such build up. Methods: A novel computational fluid dynamics\nsolver for simulating multiphase flows is used for modelling blood flow using\nlevel set for a sharp interface representation. Single-phase simulations and\nreduced order models are used for pressure comparisons. The new solver is used\nfor numerically studying AHA type B lesions. The impact of hematocrit and\ndegree of stenosis on the haemodynamics of coronary arteries is investigated.\nResults: The comparisons with single-phase flow simulations indicate\ndifferences in pressure when considering red blood cell aggregation. Multiphase\nsimulations provide slightly lower pressure drop for the same stenosis severity\ncompared to the single-phase simulations. Secondary flow patterns and the\ninteractions between the two phases leads to the red blood cell aggregation at\nthe end of the diastole cycle, which significantly changes the red blood cell\ndistribution, the shear stresses and velocity in tubular lesions. Conclusions:\nNeither pressure drop nor mean velocity are not strongly changed in the\nmultiphase modelling, but particle buildup significantly changes which is only\nrevealed by the multiphase approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 20:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

The proposed training\nstrategy and novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called\nCollaborative Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA), can effectively overcome\nthe challenge. Multi-scale inputs can reduce the information loss due to the\npooling layers used in the network for feature extraction, while our proposed\nCADA is an interactive paradigm that presents an exquisite collaborative\nadaptation through both adversarial learning and ensembling weights at\ndifferent network layers. In particular, to produce a better prediction for the\nunlabeled target domain data, we simultaneously achieve domain invariance and\nmodel generalizability via adversarial learning at multi-scale outputs from\ndifferent levels of network layers and maintaining an exponential moving\naverage (EMA) of the historical weights during training. Without annotating any\nsample from the target domain, multiple adversarial losses in encoder and\ndecoder layers guide the extraction of domain-invariant features to confuse the\ndomain classifier.

In this work, we propose methodologies for measuring\nspectral bias in modern image classification networks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.\nWe find that these networks indeed exhibit spectral bias, and that\ninterventions that improve test accuracy on CIFAR-10 tend to produce learned\nfunctions that have higher frequencies overall but lower frequencies in the\nvicinity of examples from each class. This trend holds across variation in\ntraining time, model architecture, number of training examples, data\naugmentation, and self-distillation.

Here, we present a\nthree-dimensional characterization of the dust density, mass flux, and mean\nopacities in the envelope of sub-thermal and super-thermal mass planets. We\nsimulate the dynamics of multiple dust species in a global protoplanetary disk\nmodel accounting for dust feedback. We find that the meridional flows do not\neffectively stir dust grains at scales of the Bondi sphere. Thus the\ndust-settling driven by the stellar gravitational potential sets the\nlatitudinal dust density gradient within the planet envelope. Not only does the\nplanet's potential enhance this gradient, but also the spiral wakes serve as\nanother source of asymmetry. These asymmetries substantially alter the inferred\nmean Rosseland and Planck opacities. In cases with the moderate-to-strong dust\nsettling, the opacity gradient can range from a few percent to more than two\norders of magnitude between the mid-plane and the polar regions of the Bondi\nsphere. Finally, we show that this strong latitudinal opacity gradient can\nintroduce a transition between optically thick and thin regimes at the scales\nof the planet envelope. We suggest that this transition is likely to occur when\nthe equilibrium scale height of hundred-micron-sized particles is smaller than\nthe Hill radius of the forming planet.

In this case, the 4-manifold is always a\n4-ball. Milnor fibers of plane curve singularities and complexified real line\narrangements can be represented in this way. We give a presentation of the\nfundamental group of the complement of a subpolyhedron of such a shadow in the\n4-ball. The method is very similar to the Wirtinger presentation of links in\nknot theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 00:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 06:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 03:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

We define the spacetime topology and geometry of the\nmodel, calculate the geodesics of objects passing through the time machine, and\nprove that this model inevitably leads to paradoxes which cannot be resolved\nusing Novikov's conjecture, but can be resolved using multiple histories. An\nopen-source simulation of our new model using Mathematica is available for\ndownload on GitHub. We also provide additional arguments against the Novikov\nself-consistency conjecture by considering two new paradoxes, the switch\nparadox and the password paradox, for which assuming self-consistency\ninevitably leads to counter-intuitive consequences. Our new results provide\nmore substantial support to our claim that if time travel is possible, then\nmultiple histories or parallel timelines must also be possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 01:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 21:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 15:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

To these intermediate states, the space-time explanation on the raison\nd'etre of antiparticles by Feynman is applied, then putting on them an\ninterpretation using antiparticle that all events occur without reversal of\norder of events in all inertial systems. Assuming that a common ground-state of\nthese intermediate states approximate to the true ground-state of the system, a\nphysical vacuum which realizes dynamical symmetry breaking is derived. In the\nphysical vacuum, the condensed field-energy of the gauge field determines\nfermion's mass, and the condensed kinetic-energy of the massless Fermi field\ndetermines gauge-boson's mass. When a local excitation of the physical vacuum\npropagates in space, a Higgs-like boson appears.

In this work, we propose \\Name, the first\ntask-agnostic backdoor attack against the pre-trained NLP models. The key\nfeature of our attack is that the adversary does not need prior information\nabout the downstream tasks when implanting the backdoor to the pre-trained\nmodel.

An essential but rarely studied challenge in\nFL is label deficiency at the edge. This problem is even more pronounced in FL\ncompared to centralized training due to the fact that FL users are often\nreluctant to label their private data. Furthermore, due to the heterogeneous\nnature of the data at edge devices, it is crucial to develop personalized\nmodels. In this paper we propose self-supervised federated learning (SSFL), a\nunified self-supervised and personalized federated learning framework, and a\nseries of algorithms under this framework which work towards addressing these\nchallenges. First, under the SSFL framework, we demonstrate that the standard\nFedAvg algorithm is compatible with recent breakthroughs in centralized\nself-supervised learning such as SimSiam networks. Moreover, to deal with data\nheterogeneity at the edge devices in this framework, we have innovated a series\nof algorithms that broaden existing supervised personalization algorithms into\nthe setting of self-supervised learning. We further propose a novel\npersonalized federated self-supervised learning algorithm, Per-SSFL, which\nbalances personalization and consensus by carefully regulating the distance\nbetween the local and global representations of data. To provide a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis of all proposed algorithms, we also develop\na distributed training system and related evaluation protocol for SSFL. Our\nfindings show that the gap of evaluation accuracy between supervised learning\nand unsupervised learning in FL is both small and reasonable. The performance\ncomparison indicates the representation regularization-based personalization\nmethod is able to outperform other variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 02:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

In the more general\nall-targets version of the problem, we want the minimum number of coins summing\nto $j$, for every $j=0,\\ldots,t$. For example, the textbook dynamic programming\nalgorithms can solve the all-targets problem in $O(nt)$ time. Recently, Chan\nand He (SOSA'20) described a number of $O(t\\,\\textrm{polylog}\\,t)$-time\nalgorithms for the original (single-target) version of the change-making\nproblem, but not the all-targets version.\n  We obtain a number of new results on change-making and related problems,\nincluding:\n  1. A new algorithm for the all-targets change-making problem with running\ntime $\\tilde{O}(t^{4/3})$, improving a previous $\\tilde{O}(t^{3/2})$-time\nalgorithm.\n  2. A very simple $\\tilde{O}(u^2+t)$-time algorithm for the all-targets\nchange-making problem, where $u$ denotes the maximum coin value. The analysis\nof the algorithm uses a theorem of Erd\\H{o}s and Graham (1972) on the Frobenius\nproblem.

In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias\nreduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction\nremoves the $O(N^{-1})$ first order term from the small-sample bias of the\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator.

The traditional model only works for\ntrue topology optimisation, where it is used to approximate solid regions as\nareas with very small channel height and, thus, very high frictional\nresistance. It will be shown that if the channel height is allowed to vary\ncontinuously and/or the minimum channel height is relatively large and/or\nmeaning is attributed to intermediate design field values, then the predictions\nof the traditional model are wrong. To remedy this problem, this work\nintroduces an augmentation of the mass conservation equation to allow for\ncontinuously varying channel heights. The proposed planar model accurately\ndescribes fully-developed flow between two plates of varying channel height. It\nallows for a significant reduction in the number of degrees-of-freedom, while\ngenerally ensuring a high accuracy for low-to-moderate Reynolds numbers in the\nlaminar regime. The accuracy and limitations of both the traditional and\nproposed models are explored using in-depth parametric studies. The proposed\nmodel is used to optimise the height of the fluid channel between two parallel\nplates and, thus, the topography of the plates for a flow distribution problem.\nLastly, it is observed that the proposed model actually produces better\ntopological designs than the traditional model when applied to the topology\noptimisation of a flow manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 09:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Despite its importance, the\nexisting methods for gradient alignment either have a completely different\npurpose, ignore inter-task alignment, or aim to solve continual learning\nproblems in rather inefficient ways. As a result of the misaligned gradients\nbetween tasks, the model suffers from severe negative transfer in the form of\ncatastrophic forgetting of the knowledge acquired from the pretraining. To\novercome the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective method that can\nefficiently align gradients between tasks.

As\nsuch, a great deal of effort is dedicated to developing methods for noise\nreduction. One remarkable achievement in this direction is dynamical\ndecoupling; it details a clear set of instructions for counteracting the\neffects of quantum noise. Yet, the domain of its applicability remains limited\nto devices where exercising fast control is possible. In practical terms, this\nis highly limiting and there is a growing need for better noise reduction\ntools. Here we take a significant step in this direction, by identifying the\ncrucial ingredients required for noise suppression and the development of\nmethods that far outperform traditional dynamical decoupling techniques. Using\nresource theoretic methods, we show that the key resource responsible for the\nefficacy of dynamical decoupling, and related protocols, is non-Markovianity\n(or temporal correlations). Using this insight, we then propose two methods to\nidentify optimal pulse sequences for noise reduction. With an explicit example,\nwe show that our methods enable a more optimal exploitation of temporal\ncorrelations, and extend the timescales at which noise suppression is viable by\nat least two orders of magnitude.

Recent work has established that, if there is\ndistribution shift across different groups, models trained using the standard\nempirical risk minimization (ERM) objective suffer from poor performance on\nminority groups and that group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO)\nobjective is a better alternative. The starting point of this paper is the\nobservation that though Group-DRO performs better than ERM on minority groups\nfor some benchmark datasets, there are several other datasets where it performs\nmuch worse than ERM. Inspired by ideas from the closely related problem of\ndomain generalization, this paper proposes a new and simple algorithm that\nexplicitly encourages learning of features that are shared across various\ngroups. The key insight behind our proposed algorithm is that while Group-DRO\nfocuses on groups with worst regularized loss, focusing instead, on groups that\nenable better performance even on other groups, could lead to learning of\nshared/common features, thereby enhancing minority performance beyond what is\nachieved by Group-DRO. Empirically, we show that our proposed algorithm matches\nor achieves better performance compared to strong contemporary baselines\nincluding ERM and Group-DRO on standard benchmarks on both minority groups and\nacross all groups.

Hence, their key to construct a solution solely lies in the selection\nof the next node (customer) to visit excluding the selection of vehicle.\nHowever, vehicles in real-world scenarios are likely to be heterogeneous with\ndifferent characteristics that affect their capacity (or travel speed),\nrendering existing DRL methods less effective. In this paper, we tackle\nheterogeneous CVRP (HCVRP), where vehicles are mainly characterized by\ndifferent capacities. We consider both min-max and min-sum objectives for\nHCVRP, which aim to minimize the longest or total travel time of the vehicle(s)\nin the fleet. To solve those problems, we propose a DRL method based on the\nattention mechanism with a vehicle selection decoder accounting for the\nheterogeneous fleet constraint and a node selection decoder accounting for the\nroute construction, which learns to construct a solution by automatically\nselecting both a vehicle and a node for this vehicle at each step.

More\nprecisely, we present a method to iteratively approximate the eigenvalues of\nsuch delay eigenvalue problems closest to a given purely real or imaginary\nshift, while preserving the symmetries of the spectrum. To this end the\npresented method exploits the equivalence between the considered delay\neigenvalue problem and the eigenvalue problem associated with a linear but\ninfinite-dimensional operator. To compute the eigenvalues closest to the given\nshift, we apply a specifically chosen shift-invert transformation to this\nlinear operator and compute the eigenvalues with the largest modulus of the new\nshifted and inverted operator using an (infinite) Arnoldi procedure. The\nadvantage of the chosen shift-invert transformation is that the spectrum of the\ntransformed operator has a \"real skew-Hamiltonian\"-like structure. Furthermore,\nit is proven that the Krylov space constructed by applying this operator,\nsatisfies an orthogonality property in terms of a specifically chosen bilinear\nform. By taking this property into account during the orthogonalization\nprocess, it is ensured that even in the presence of rounding errors, the\nobtained approximation for, e.g., a simple, purely imaginary eigenvalue is\nsimple and purely imaginary.

They typically\nlearn representations by aggregating information from the $K$-hop neighborhood\nof individual vertices or from the enumerated walks in the graph. Prior studies\nhave demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating weighting schemes into\nGNNs; however, this has been primarily limited to $K$-hop neighborhood GNNs so\nfar. In this paper, we aim to design an algorithm incorporating weighting\nschemes into walk-aggregating GNNs and analyze their effect. We propose a novel\nGNN model, called AWARE, that aggregates information about the walks in the\ngraph using attention schemes. This leads to an end-to-end supervised learning\nmethod for graph-level prediction tasks in the standard setting where the input\nis the adjacency and vertex information of a graph, and the output is a\npredicted label for the graph. We then perform theoretical, empirical, and\ninterpretability analyses of AWARE.

For example, the various levels of government\nlegislation and compliance on information privacy worldwide have created a new\nera of digital divide in the privacy preservation domain. In this article, the\nconcept \"digital privacy divide (DPD)\" is introduced to describe the perceived\ngap in the privacy preservation of individuals based on the geopolitical\nlocation of different countries. To better understand the DPD phenomenon, we\ncreated an online questionnaire and collected answers from more than 700\nrespondents from four different countries (the United States, Germany,\nBangladesh, and India) who come from two distinct cultural orientations as per\nHofstede's individualist vs. collectivist society.

For example, individuals residing in Germany and\nBangladesh share similar privacy concerns, while there is a significant\nsimilarity among individuals residing in the United States and India. Moreover,\nwhile most respondents acknowledge the importance of privacy legislation to\nprotect their digital privacy, they do not mind their governments to allow\ndomestic companies and organizations collecting personal data on individuals\nresiding outside their countries, if there are economic, employment, and crime\nprevention benefits. These results suggest a social dilemma in the perceived\nprivacy preservation, which could be dependent on many other contextual factors\nbeyond government legislation and countries' cultural orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 11:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Our model\ndescribes the competition between effector T cells and non-effector T cells in\na tumour. By calibrating a small subset of parameters that control immune\ncheckpoint expression along with the patient's immune-system cancer readiness,\nour model is able to simulate either a complete absence of patient response to\ntreatment, a quick anti-tumour T cell response (within days) or a delayed\nresponse (within months).

Finally, simulations predict that the anti-tumour T cell\nstorm that breaks the delay is very short-lived compared to the length of time\nthe cancer is able to stay suppressed.

The extended\nLGM framework assumes that the data follow a specific parametric distribution,\nwhose unknown parameters are transformed using a multivariate link function and\nare then further modeled at the latent level in terms of fixed and random\neffects that have a joint Gaussian distribution. In the extremal context, we\nhere assume that the data level distribution is described in terms of a Poisson\npoint process likelihood, motivated by asymptotic extreme-value theory, and\nwhich conveniently exploits information from all threshold exceedances. This\ncontrasts with the more common data-wasteful approach based on block maxima,\nwhich are typically modeled with the generalized extreme-value (GEV)\ndistribution. When conditional independence can be assumed at the data level\nand latent random effects have a sparse probabilistic structure, fast\napproximate Bayesian inference becomes possible in very high dimensions, and we\nhere present the recently proposed inference approach called \"Max-and-Smooth\",\nwhich provides exceptional speed-up compared to alternative methods.

Our fitted model captures the spatial variability of\nextreme precipitation satisfactorily and our results show that the most intense\nprecipitation events are expected near the south-western part of Saudi Arabia,\nalong the Red Sea coastline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 12:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

The goal is to\nminimize the scaling factor. If the number of different radii is unbounded, the\nproblem does not admit a constant-factor approximation algorithm but it has\nbeen conjectured that such an algorithm exists if the number of radii is\nconstant. Yet, this is known only for the case of two radii. Our first\ncontribution is a simple black box reduction which shows that if one can handle\nthe variant of t-1 radii with outliers, then one can also handle t radii.\nTogether with an algorithm by Chakrabarty and Negahbani for two radii with\noutliers, this immediately implies a constant-factor approximation algorithm\nfor three radii, thus making further progress on the conjecture. Furthermore,\nusing algorithms for the k-center with outliers problem, that is the one radii\nwith outliers case, we also get a simple algorithm for two radii.\n  The algorithm by Chakrabarty and Negahbani uses a top-down approach, starting\nwith the larger radius and then proceeding to the smaller one. Our reduction,\non the other hand, looks only at the smallest radius and eliminates it, which\nsuggests that a bottom-up approach is promising.

Recently, researchers exploited adversarial perturbations to\nprotect image privacy from retrieval by intelligent models.

To prevent illegal or\nunauthorized access to sensitive image data such as human faces without\nimpeding legitimate users, the use of reversible adversarial attack techniques\nis increasing. The original image can be recovered from its reversible\nadversarial examples. However, existing reversible adversarial attack methods\nare designed for traditional imperceptible adversarial perturbations and ignore\nthe local visible adversarial perturbation. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod for generating reversible adversarial examples based on local visible\nadversarial perturbation. The information needed for image recovery is embedded\ninto the area beyond the adversarial patch by the reversible data hiding\ntechnique. To reduce image distortion, lossless compression and the B-R-G\n(bluered-green) embedding principle are adopted.

However, inputs may deviate from\nthe training dataset distribution in real deployments. This is a fundamental\nissue with using a finite dataset. Even worse, real inputs may change over time\nfrom the expected distribution. Taken together, these issues may lead deployed\nDNNs to mis-predict in production.\n  In this work, we present a runtime approach that mitigates DNN\nmis-predictions caused by the unexpected runtime inputs to the DNN. In contrast\nto previous work that considers the structure and parameters of the DNN itself,\nour approach treats the DNN as a blackbox and focuses on the inputs to the DNN.\nOur approach has two steps. First, it recognizes and distinguishes \"unseen\"\nsemantically-preserving inputs. For this we use a distribution analyzer based\non the distance metric learned by a Siamese network. Second, our approach\ntransforms those unexpected inputs into inputs from the training set that are\nidentified as having similar semantics. We call this process input reflection\nand formulate it as a search problem over the embedding space on the training\nset. This embedding space is learned by a Quadruplet network as an auxiliary\nmodel for the subject model to improve the generalization.\n  We implemented a tool called InputReflector based on the above two-step\napproach and evaluated it with experiments on three DNN models trained on\nCIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMINST image datasets.

It has long been known that the\neffect of cosmological expansion on a quantum field amounts to squeezing. Thus\nthe entropy of cosmological perturbations can be studied by treating them in\nthe framework of squeezed quantum systems. Entropy of a free quantum field is a\nseemingly simple yet subtle issue. In this paper, as different from previous\ntreatments, we tackle this issue with a fully developed nonequilibrium quantum\nfield theory formalism for such systems. We compute the covariance matrix\nelements of the parametric quantum field and solve for the evolution of the\ndensity matrix elements and the Wigner functions, and, from them, derive the\nvon Neumann entropy. We then show explicitly why the entropy for the squeezed\nyet closed system is zero, but is proportional to the particle number produced\nupon coarse-graining out the correlation between the particle pairs. We also\nconstruct the bridge between our quantum field-theoretic results and those\nusing probability distribution of classical stochastic fields by earlier\nauthors. From this we can see the clear advantages of the quantum\nfield-theoretical approach over the stochastic classical field treatment since\nthe latter misses out in some important quantum properties, such as\nentanglement and coherence, of the quantum field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 13:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

However, models that achieve better training\nperformance (e.g., lower MSE) are not necessarily better for control: an RL\nagent may seek out the small fraction of states where an accurate model makes\nmistakes, or it might act in ways that do not expose the errors of an\ninaccurate model. As noted in prior work, there is an objective mismatch:\nmodels are useful if they yield good policies, but they are trained to maximize\ntheir accuracy, rather than the performance of the policies that result from\nthem. In this work, we propose a single objective for jointly training the\nmodel and the policy, such that updates to either component increase a lower\nbound on expected return. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower\nbound for model-based RL that holds globally and can be efficiently estimated\nin continuous settings; it is the only lower bound that mends the objective\nmismatch problem. A version of this bound becomes tight under certain\nassumptions. Optimizing this bound resembles a GAN: a classifier distinguishes\nbetween real and fake transitions, the model is updated to produce transitions\nthat look realistic, and the policy is updated to avoid states where the model\npredictions are unrealistic. Numerical simulations demonstrate that optimizing\nthis bound yields reward maximizing policies and yields dynamics that (perhaps\nsurprisingly) can aid in exploration. We also show that a deep RL algorithm\nloosely based on our lower bound can achieve performance competitive with prior\nmodel-based methods, and better performance on certain hard exploration tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 13:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 21:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

A basic approach supposes that the customers have\ndeterministic utilities; then, the response of each customer is highly\nsensitive to price since it concentrates on the best offer. A second classical\napproach is to consider logit model to add a probabilistic behavior in the\ncustomers' choices. To circumvent the intrinsic instability of the former and\nthe resolution difficulties of the latter, we introduce a quadratically\nregularized model of customer's response, which leads to a quadratic program\nunder complementarity constraints (QPCC). This allows to robustify the\ndeterministic model, while keeping a strong geometrical structure.

We show that for sufficiently large networks the\ncontact distribution decays as a power law with exponent $2+T > 3$ for\ndurations $t > T$, while for $t < T$ it exhibits exponential-like decays. This\nresult holds irrespective of the expected degree distribution, as long as it\nhas a finite $T^{\\text{th}}$ moment. Otherwise, the contact distribution\ndepends on the expected degree distribution and we show that if the latter is a\npower law with exponent $\\gamma \\in (2, T+1]$, then the former decays as a\npower law with exponent $\\gamma+1 > 3$. On the other hand, the intercontact\ndistribution exhibits power-law decays with exponent $2-T \\in (0, 1)$ for $T\n\\in (1,2)$, while for $T > 2$ it displays linear decays with a slope that\ndepends on the observation interval. This result holds irrespective of the\nexpected degree distribution as long as it has a finite $T^{\\text{th}}$ moment\nif $T \\in (1,2)$, or a finite second moment if $T > 2$. Otherwise, the\nintercontact distribution depends on the expected degree distribution and if\nthe latter is a power law with exponent $\\gamma \\in (2, 3)$, then the former\ndecays as a power law with exponent $3-\\gamma \\in (0,1)$. Thus, hot random\nhyperbolic graphs can give rise to contact and intercontact distributions that\nboth decay as power laws. These power laws however are unrealistic for the case\nof the intercontact distribution, as their exponent is always less than one.\nThese results mean that hot random hyperbolic graphs are not adequate for\nmodeling real temporal networks, in stark contrast to cold random hyperbolic\ngraphs ($T < 1$). Since the configuration model emerges at $T \\to \\infty$,\nthese results also suggest that this is not an adequate null temporal network\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 14:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 17:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

We begin by studying smooth problems and partially\nnon-smooth problems in the form of Tikhonov denoising and Total Variation (TV)\ndenoising, respectively.\n  For Tikhonov denoising, we study an accelerated gradient method with adaptive\nrestart, which shows a very rapid convergence rate. However, it is not\nstraightforward to apply this fast algorithm to TV denoising, due to the\nnon-smoothness of its built-in regularisation. To tackle this issue, we propose\nto utilise duality to convert such a non-smooth problem into a smooth one so\nthat the accelerated gradient method with restart applies naturally.\n  However, we notice that both Tikhonov and TV regularisations have drawbacks,\nin the form of blurred image edges and staircase artefacts, respectively. To\novercome these drawbacks, we propose a novel adaption to Total Generalised\nVariation (TGV) regularisation called Total Smooth Variation (TSV), which\nretains edges and meanwhile does not produce results which contain staircase\nartefacts. To optimise TSV effectively, we then propose the Accelerated\nProximal Gradient Algorithm (APGA) which also utilises adaptive restart\ntechniques.

However, the\nend-to-end models, which primarily depend on the attention-based alignment, do\nnot offer an explicit provision to modify/incorporate the desired prosody while\nsynthesizing the signal. Moreover, the state-of-the-art end-to-end systems use\nautoregressive models for synthesis, making the prediction sequential.

This paper\nproposes Prosody-TTS, an end-to-end speech synthesis model that combines the\nadvantages of statistical parametric models and end-to-end neural network\nmodels. It also has a provision to modify or incorporate the desired prosody by\ncontrolling the fundamental frequency (f0) and the phone duration.

We explicitly model the duration of the\nphoneme and the f0 to have control over them during the synthesis. The model is\ntrained in an end-to-end fashion to directly generate the speech waveform from\nthe input text, which in turn depends on the auxiliary subtasks of predicting\nthe phoneme duration, f0, and mel spectrogram.

Masks are essentially\nair filters worn on the face, that should filter out as many of the dangerous\nparticles as possible. Here the dangerous particles are the droplets containing\nvirus that are exhaled by an infected person. Woven fabric is unlike the\nmaterial used in standard air filters. Woven fabric consists of fibres twisted\ntogether into yarns that are then woven into fabric. There are therefore two\nlengthscales: the diameters of: (i) the fibre and (ii) the yarn. Standard air\nfilters have only (i). To understand how woven fabrics filter, we have used\nconfocal microscopy to take three dimensional images of woven fabric. We then\nused the image to perform Lattice Boltzmann simulations of the air flow through\nfabric. With this flow field we calculated the filtration efficiency for\nparticles a micrometre and larger in diameter. In agreement with experimental\nmeasurements by others, we find that for particles in this size range,\nfiltration efficiency is low. For particles with a diameter of 1.5 micrometres\nour estimated efficiency is in the range 2.5 to 10%. The low efficiency is due\nto most of the air flow being channelled through relatively large (tens of\nmicrometres across) inter-yarn pores. So we conclude that fabric is expected to\nfilter poorly due to the hierarchical structure of woven fabrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 15:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 13:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 09:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Several\nstellar population properties in massive early-type galaxies have been shown to\ncorrelate with intrinsic galaxy properties like the galaxy's central velocity\ndispersion, suggesting that stars formed in an initial collapse of gas (z~2).\nHowever, stellar populations change as a function of galaxy radius, and it is\nnot clear how local gradients of individual galaxies are influenced by global\ngalaxy properties and galaxy environment. In this paper, we study the stellar\npopulations of eight early-type galaxies as a function of radius.

Some elemental abundances also correlate locally\nwith each other within a galaxy, suggesting a common production channel.

In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use\n8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit\noptimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and\nstability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise\nquantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently\nquantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster\noptimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and\nperformance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes:\n(1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for\nboth large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to\nreduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribution of\ninput tokens in language models.

To address this imbalance, an intrusion detection system\ncalled pretraining Wasserstein generative adversarial network intrusion\ndetection system (PWG-IDS) is proposed in this paper. This system is divided\ninto two main modules: 1) In this module, we introduce the pretraining\nmechanism in the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient\npenalty (WGAN-GP) for the first time, firstly using the normal network traffic\nto train the WGAN-GP, and then inputting the imbalance data into the\npre-trained WGAN-GP to retrain and generate the final required data. 2)\nIntrusion detection module: We use LightGBM as the classification algorithm to\ndetect attack traffic in IIoT networks. The experimental results show that our\nproposed PWG-IDS outperforms other models, with F1-scores of 99% and 89% on the\n2 datasets, respectively. And the pretraining mechanism we proposed can also be\nwidely used in other GANs, providing a new way of thinking for the training of\nGANs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 02:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

However, a) there are no well established methods to calculate\nHBDs from 3D meshes and b) there are no benchmarks to fairly compare results on\nthe HBDE task. Our contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we present a\nmethod to calculate right and left arm length, shoulder width, and inseam\n(crotch height) from 3D meshes with focus on potential medical, virtual try-on\nand distance tailoring applications. On the other hand, we use four additional\nbody dimensions calculated using recently published methods to assemble a set\nof eight body dimensions which we use as a supervision signal to our Neural\nAnthropometer: a convolutional neural network capable of estimating these\ndimensions. To assess the estimation, we train the Neural Anthropometer with\nsynthetic images of 3D meshes, from which we calculated the HBDs and observed\nthat the network's overall mean estimate error is $20.89$ mm (relative error of\n2.84\\%).

Although promising, existing\nmultimodal brain graph synthesis frameworks have several limitations. First,\nthey mainly tackle only one problem (intra- or inter-modality), limiting their\ngeneralizability to synthesizing inter- and intra-modality simultaneously.\nSecond, while few techniques work on super-resolving low-resolution brain\ngraphs within a single modality (i.e., intra), inter-modality graph\nsuper-resolution remains unexplored though this would avoid the need for costly\ndata collection and processing. More importantly, both target and source\ndomains might have different distributions, which causes a domain fracture\nbetween them. To fill these gaps, we propose a multi-resolution\nStairwayGraphNet (SG-Net) framework to jointly infer a target graph modality\nbased on a given modality and super-resolve brain graphs in both inter and\nintra domains. Our SG-Net is grounded in three main contributions: (i)\npredicting a target graph from a source one based on a novel graph generative\nadversarial network in both inter (e.g., morphological-functional) and intra\n(e.g., functional-functional) domains, (ii) generating high-resolution brain\ngraphs without resorting to the time consuming and expensive MRI processing\nsteps, and (iii) enforcing the source distribution to match that of the ground\ntruth graphs using an inter-modality aligner to relax the loss function to\noptimize. Moreover, we design a new Ground Truth-Preserving loss function to\nguide both generators in learning the topological structure of ground truth\nbrain graphs more accurately.

In this work, we develop a novel theory for\nunderstanding parametric tournament representations.

A monotonic chain of events occurs, for instance, in an article\nsharing dataset, where a ``follow'' action implies a ``like'' action, which in\nturn implies a ``view'' action. In this article, we develop a multistage\nrecommender system utilizing a two-level monotonic property characterizing a\nmonotonic chain of events for personalized prediction. Particularly, we derive\na large-margin classifier based on a nonnegative additive latent factor model\nin the presence of a high percentage of missing observations, particularly\nbetween stages, reducing the number of model parameters for personalized\nprediction while guaranteeing prediction consistency. On this ground, we derive\na regularized cost function to learn user-specific behaviors at different\nstages, linking decision functions to numerical and categorical covariates to\nmodel user-item-stage interactions. Computationally, we derive an algorithm\nbased on blockwise coordinate descent. Theoretically, we show that the\ntwo-level monotonic property enhances the accuracy of learning as compared to a\nstandard method treating each stage individually and an ordinal method\nutilizing only one-level monotonicity. Finally, the proposed method compares\nfavorably with existing methods in simulations and an article sharing dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 08:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The emergence of deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) and connected and automated vehicle technology\nprovides a possible solution to improve mobility and energy efficiency at\nfreeway bottlenecks through cooperative lane changing. Deep RL is a collection\nof machine-learning methods that enables an agent to improve its performance by\nlearning from the environment. In this study, a decentralized cooperative\nlane-changing controller was developed using proximal policy optimization by\nadopting a multi-agent deep RL paradigm. In the decentralized control strategy,\npolicy learning and action reward are evaluated locally, with each agent\n(vehicle) getting access to global state information. Multi-agent deep RL\nrequires lower computational resources and is more scalable than single-agent\ndeep RL, making it a powerful tool for time-sensitive applications such as\ncooperative lane changing. The results of this study show that cooperative lane\nchanging enabled by multi-agent deep RL yields superior performance to human\ndrivers in term of traffic throughput, vehicle speed, number of stops per\nvehicle, vehicle fuel efficiency, and emissions. The trained RL policy is\ntransferable and can be generalized to uncongested, moderately congested, and\nextremely congested traffic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 18:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

Neurological findings suggest\nthat early diagnosis of brain disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment\n(MCI), can prevent and even reverse its development into Alzheimer's disease\n(AD). In this context, recent studies aimed to predict the evolution of brain\nconnectivities over time by proposing machine learning models that work on\nbrain images. However, such an approach is costly and time-consuming. Here, we\npropose to use brain connectivities as a more efficient alternative for\ntime-dependent brain disorder diagnosis by regarding the brain as instead a\nlarge interconnected graph characterizing the interconnectivity scheme between\nseveral brain regions. We term our proposed method Recurrent Brain Graph Mapper\n(RBGM), a novel efficient edge-based recurrent graph neural network that\npredicts the time-dependent evaluation trajectory of a brain graph from a\nsingle baseline. Our RBGM contains a set of recurrent neural network-inspired\nmappers for each time point, where each mapper aims to project the ground-truth\nbrain graph onto its next time point. We leverage the teacher forcing method to\nboost training and improve the evolved brain graph quality. To maintain the\ntopological consistency between the predicted brain graphs and their\ncorresponding ground-truth brain graphs at each time point, we further\nintegrate a topological loss. We also use l1 loss to capture time-dependency\nand minimize the distance between the brain graph at consecutive time points\nfor regularization. Benchmarks against several variants of RBGM and\nstate-of-the-art methods prove that we can achieve the same accuracy in\npredicting brain graph evolution more efficiently, paving the way for novel\ngraph neural network architecture and a highly efficient training scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 09:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

However, classification methods based on deep learning are\nill-suited for such learning as they need large amounts of training data --let\nalone one-shot learning. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been\nintroduced to the field of network neuroscience, where the brain connectivity\nis encoded in a graph. However, with scarce neuroimaging datasets particularly\nfor rare diseases and low-resource clinical facilities, such data-devouring\narchitectures might fail in learning the target task. In this paper, we take a\nvery different approach in training GNNs, where we aim to learn with one sample\nand achieve the best performance --a formidable challenge to tackle.\nSpecifically, we present the first one-shot paradigm where a GNN is trained on\na single population-driven template --namely a connectional brain template\n(CBT). A CBT is a compact representation of a population of brain graphs\ncapturing the unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. It is\nanalogous to brain image atlases for neuroimaging datasets. Using a\none-representative CBT as a training sample, we alleviate the training load of\nGNN models while boosting their performance across a variety of classification\nand regression tasks. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperformed\nbenchmark one-shot learning methods with downstream classification and\ntime-dependent brain graph data forecasting tasks while competing with the\ntrain-on-all conventional training strategy.

In the present study, we extend the OP criterion to the WENO-Z-type\nschemes as the forementioned issue has also been extensively observed\nnumerically for these schemes. Firstly, we innovatively present the concept of\nthe generalized mapped WENO schemes by rewriting the Z-type weights in a\nuniform formula from the perspective of the mapping relation.

We draw the conclusion that, the convergence propoties of the proposed\nschemes are equivalent to the corresponding WENO-X schemes. The major benefit\nof the new schemes is that they have the capacity to achieve high resolutions\nand simultaneously remove spurious oscillations for long simulations. The new\nschemes have the additional benefit that they can greatly decrease the\npost-shock oscillations on solving 2D Euler problems with strong shock waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 09:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}
