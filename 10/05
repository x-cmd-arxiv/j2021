Thus,\ndiagnosis is usually possible until the markers are easy to identify, i.e., the\ndamage has already occurred. Early identification of glaucoma is generally made\nbased on functional, structural, and clinical assessments. However, due to the\nnature of the disease, researchers still debate which markers qualify as a\nconsistent glaucoma metric. Deep learning methods have partially solved this\ndilemma by bypassing the marker identification stage and analyzing high-level\ninformation directly to classify the data. Although favorable, these methods\nmake expert analysis difficult as they provide no insight into the model\ndiscrimination process. In this paper, we overcome this using deep generative\nnetworks, a deep learning model that learns complicated, high-dimensional\nprobability distributions. We train a Deep Feature consistent Variational\nAutoencoder (DFC-VAE) to reconstruct optic disc images. We show that a\nsmall-sized latent space obtained from the DFC-VAE can learn the\nhigh-dimensional glaucoma data distribution and provide discriminatory evidence\nbetween normal and glaucoma eyes.

In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based\noffline RL method that takes into account the confidence of the Q-value\nprediction and does not require any estimation or sampling of the data\ndistribution. We show that the clipped Q-learning, a technique widely used in\nonline RL, can be leveraged to successfully penalize OOD data points with high\nprediction uncertainties. Surprisingly, we find that it is possible to\nsubstantially outperform existing offline RL methods on various tasks by simply\nincreasing the number of Q-networks along with the clipped Q-learning. Based on\nthis observation, we propose an ensemble-diversified actor-critic algorithm\nthat reduces the number of required ensemble networks down to a tenth compared\nto the naive ensemble while achieving state-of-the-art performance on most of\nthe D4RL benchmarks considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 16:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 05:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

The algorithms' complexity grows as\nso-called treewidth, which is closely related to the connectivity of a given\nlinear-optical circuit. Using the algorithms, we study approximated simulations\nfor local Haar-random linear-optical circuits. For equally spaced initial\nsources, we show that when the circuit depth is less than the quadratic in the\nlattice spacing, the efficient simulation is possible with an exponentially\nsmall error. Notably, right after this depth, photons start to interfere each\nother and the algorithms' complexity becomes sub-exponential in the number of\nsources, implying that there is a sharp transition of its complexity. Finally,\nwhen a circuit is sufficiently deep enough for photons to typically propagate\nto all modes, the complexity becomes exponential as generic sampling\nalgorithms. We numerically implement a likelihood test with a recent Gaussian\nboson sampling experiment and show that the treewidth-based algorithm with a\nlimited treewidth renders a larger likelihood than the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 17:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 16:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Human faces are non-rigid, so facial\nexpression leads to deformation of face shape, and head pose also affects the\nface observed in 2D images. A key challenge in face transfer is to match the\nface with unobserved new contexts, adapting the face appearance to different\nposes and expressions accordingly. In this work, we find a way to provide prior\nknowledge for generative models to reason about the appropriate appearance of a\nhuman face in response to various expressions and poses.

The pre-change observations\nare assumed to be stationary with a known distribution, while the post-change\nobservations are allowed to be non-stationary with some possible parametric\nuncertainty in their distribution. In particular, it is assumed that the\ncumulative Kullback-Leibler divergence between the post-change and the\npre-change distributions grows in a certain manner with time after the\nchange-point. For the case where the post-change distributions are known, a\nuniversal asymptotic lower bound on the delay is derived, as the false alarm\nrate goes to zero.

The large-scale\nemission presents an ultra-steep spectrum with $\\alpha_{54}^{144}\\sim3.2$. The\nradio emission inside and outside the cluster core have strictly different\nproperties, as there is a net change in spectral index and they follow\ndifferent radio-X-ray surface brightness correlations. We argue that the\nlarge-scale diffuse emission is generated by particles re-acceleration after a\nminor merger. While for the central mini halo we suggest that it could be\ngenerated by secondary electrons and positrons from hadronic interactions of\nrelativistic nuclei with the dense cool-core gas, as an alternative to\nre-acceleration models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

Previous\nmodelling assumes that the disc behaves like a classical Keplerian accretion\ndisc out to a radius where the photoevaporative outflow is launched. There is\nthen an abrupt change in the angular velocity profile, and the outflow is\nmodelled by forcing the fluid parcels to conserve their specific angular\nmomenta. Instead, we model externally photoevaporating discs using the slim\ndisc formalism. The slim disc approach self consistently includes the advection\nof radial and angular momentum as well as angular momentum redistribution by\ninternal viscous torques. Our resulting models produce a smooth transition from\na rotationally supported Keplerian disc to a photoevaporative driven outflow,\nwhere this transition typically occurs over ~4-5 scale heights. The penetration\nof UV photons predominately sets the radius of the transition and the\nviscosity's strength plays a minor role. By studying the entrainment of dust\nparticles in the outflow, we find a rapid change in the dust size and surface\ndensity distribution in the transition region due to the steep gas density\ngradients present. This rapid change in the dust properties leaves a\npotentially observable signature in the continuum spectral index of the disc at\nmm wavelengths. Using the slim disc formalism in future evolutionary\ncalculations will reveal how both the gas and dust evolves in their outer\nregions and the observable imprints of the external photoevaporation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We present, for the first time, a model to consistently\npredict both halo concentration, $c$, and this additional `shape' parameter,\n$\\alpha$, for a halo of given mass and redshift for a specified cosmology.\nFollowing recent studies, we recast the dependency on mass, redshift, and\ncosmology to a dependence on `peak height'. We show that, when adopting the\nstandard definition of peak height, which employs the so-called spherical top\nhat (STH) window function, the concentration--peak height relation has a strong\nresidual dependence on cosmology (i.e., it is not uniquely determined by peak\nheight), whereas the $\\alpha$--peak height relation is approximately universal\nwhen employing the STH window function. Given the freedom in the choice of\nwindow function, we explore a simple modification of the STH function,\nconstraining its form so that it produces universal relations for concentration\nand $\\alpha$ as a function of peak height using a large suite of cosmological\nsimulations. It is found that universal relations for the two density profile\nparameters can indeed be derived and that these parameters are set by the\nlinear power spectrum, $P(k)$, filtered on different scales.

Overfitting is a common problem here. The standard\napproaches to prevent overfitting are dimensionality reduction and\nregularization. But dimensionality reduction loses information, while\nregularization requires the user to choose a norm, or a prior, or a distance\nmetric. We propose an algorithm called RoLin that needs no user choice and\napplies to a large class of loss functions. RoLin combines reliable information\nfrom the top principal components with a robust optimization to extract any\nuseful information from unreliable subspaces. It also includes a new robust\ncross-validation that is better than existing cross-validation methods in the\nlimited-data setting. Experiments on $25$ real-world datasets and three\nstandard loss functions show that RoLin broadly outperforms both dimensionality\nreduction and regularization. Dimensionality reduction has $14\\%-40\\%$ worse\ntest loss on average as compared to RoLin. Against $L_1$ and $L_2$\nregularization, RoLin can be up to 3x better for logistic loss and 12x better\nfor squared hinge loss.

First, we establish that SGD's iterates will\neither globally converge to a stationary point or diverge under nearly\narbitrary nonconvexity and noise models. Under a slightly more restrictive\nassumption on the joint behavior of the non-convexity and noise model that\ngeneralizes current assumptions in the literature, we show that the objective\nfunction cannot diverge, even if the iterates diverge. As a consequence of our\nresults, SGD can be applied to a greater range of stochastic optimization\nproblems with confidence about its global convergence behavior and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 19:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 23:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

However,\nCATE corresponds to the comparison on the first moment alone, and as such may\nbe insufficient in reflecting the full picture of treatment effects. As an\nalternative, estimating the full potential outcome distributions could provide\ngreater insights. However, existing methods for estimating treatment effect\npotential outcome distributions often impose restrictive or simplistic\nassumptions about these distributions. Here, we propose Collaborating Causal\nNetworks (CCN), a novel methodology which goes beyond the estimation of CATE\nalone by learning the full potential outcome distributions. Estimation of\noutcome distributions via the CCN framework does not require restrictive\nassumptions of the underlying data generating process. Additionally, CCN\nfacilitates estimation of the utility of each possible treatment and permits\nindividual-specific variation through utility functions. CCN not only extends\noutcome estimation beyond traditional risk difference, but also enables a more\ncomprehensive decision-making process through definition of flexible\ncomparisons. Under assumptions commonly made in the causal literature, we show\nthat CCN learns distributions that asymptotically capture the true potential\noutcome distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adjustment approach that is\nempirically effective in alleviating sample imbalance between treatment groups\nin observational data. Finally, we evaluate the performance of CCN in multiple\nsynthetic and semi-synthetic experiments. We demonstrate that CCN learns\nimproved distribution estimates compared to existing Bayesian and deep\ngenerative methods as well as improved decisions with respects to a variety of\nutility functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 19:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 03:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

The question then\narises: Is the system's steady state still the Gibbs state? And if not, how may\nthe steady state depend on the interaction details? Here we provide an overview\nof recent progress on answering these questions. We expand on the\nstate-of-the-art along two general avenues: First we take the static\npoint-of-view which postulates the so-called mean force Gibbs state. This view\nis commonly adopted in the field of strong coupling thermodynamics, where\nmodified laws of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium fluctuation relations are\nestablished on the basis of this modified state.

However, galaxies\nare biased tracers of the DM, and the bias can vary over host halo and galaxy\nproperties as well as time. We precisely calibrate the velocity bias, b_v --\ndefined as the ratio of galaxy and DM velocity dispersions -- as a function of\nredshift, host halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass threshold (Mstarsat), for\nmassive halos (M200c > 1e13.5 msun) from five cosmological simulations:\nIllustrisTNG, Magneticum, Bahamas + Macsis, The Three Hundred Project, and\nMultiDark Planck-2. We first compare scaling relations for galaxy and DM\nvelocity dispersion across simulations; the former is estimated using a new\nensemble velocity likelihood method that is unbiased for low galaxy counts per\nhalo, while the latter uses a local linear regression. The simulations show\nconsistent trends of b_v increasing with M200c and decreasing with redshift and\nMstarsat.

In Dobbels et al. (2020), we show that these two sections\nare strongly related, and we can predict the global dust properties from the\nintegrated UV to mid-infrared emission with the help of machine learning\ntechniques. We investigate if these machine learning techniques can also be\nextended to resolved scales. Our aim is to predict resolved maps of the\nspecific dust luminosity, specific dust mass, and dust temperature starting\nfrom a set of surface brightness images from UV to mid-infrared wavelengths. We\nused a selection of nearby galaxies retrieved from the DustPedia sample, in\naddition to M31 and M33. These were convolved and resampled to a range of pixel\nsizes, ranging from 150 pc to 3 kpc. We trained a random forest model which\nconsiders each pixel individually. We find that the predictions work well on\nresolved scales, with the dust mass and temperature having a similar root mean\nsquare error as on global scales (0.32 dex and 3.15 K on 18\" scales\nrespectively), and the dust luminosity being noticeably better (0.11 dex). We\nfind no significant dependence on the pixel scale. Predictions on individual\ngalaxies can be biased, and we find that about two-thirds of the scatter can be\nattributed to scatter between galaxies (rather than within galaxies). A machine\nlearning approach can be used to create dust maps, with its resolution being\nonly limited to the input bands, thus achieving a higher resolution than\nHerschel. These dust maps can be used to improve global estimates of dust\nproperties, they can lead to a better estimate of dust attenuation, and they\ncan be used as a constraint on cosmological simulations that trace dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 20:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

It relates the spatial\nposition of the electron probe to the spectral data associated with it. In the\ncase of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), frame-based hyperspectral\nacquisition is much slower than the achievable rastering time of the scan unit\n(SU), which sometimes leads to undesirable effects in the sample, such as\nelectron irradiation damage, that goes unperceived during frame acquisition. In\nthis work, we have developed an event-based hyperspectral EELS by using a\nTimepix3 application-specific integrated circuit detector with two\nsupplementary time-to-digital (TDC) lines embedded. In such a system, electron\nevents are characterized by their positional and temporal coordinates, but TDC\nevents only by temporal ones. By sending reference signals from the SU to the\nTDC line, it is possible to reconstruct the entire spectral image with\nSU-limited scanning pixel dwell time and thus acquire, with no additional cost,\na hyperspectral image at the same rate as that of a single channel detector,\nsuch as annular dark-field. To exemplify the possibilities behind event-based\nhyperspectral EELS, we have studied the decomposition of calcite (CaCO$_3$)\ninto calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) under the electron beam\nirradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 20:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 06:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

A\nfundamental challenge of learning in such a strategic setup is that the buyer\nwill naturally have incentives to manipulate his responses in order to induce\nmore favorable learning outcomes for him. To understand the limits of the\nseller's learning when facing such a strategic and possibly manipulative buyer,\nwe study a natural yet powerful buyer manipulation strategy. That is, before\nthe pricing game starts, the buyer simply commits to \"imitate\" a different\nvalue function by pretending to always react optimally according to this\nimitative value function.\n  We fully characterize the optimal imitative value function that the buyer\nshould imitate as well as the resultant seller revenue and buyer surplus under\nthis optimal buyer manipulation. Our characterizations reveal many useful\ninsights about what happens at equilibrium. For example, a seller with concave\nproduction cost will obtain essentially 0 revenue at equilibrium whereas the\nrevenue for a seller with convex production cost is the Bregman divergence of\nher cost function between no production and certain production. Finally, and\nimportantly, we show that a more powerful class of pricing schemes does not\nnecessarily increase, in fact, may be harmful to, the seller's revenue. Our\nresults not only lead to an effective prescriptive way for buyers to manipulate\nlearning algorithms but also shed lights on the limits of what a seller can\nreally achieve when pricing in the dark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 20:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

However, the drive can cause resonator\nand qubit leakage, the physics of which cannot be fully captured using either\nthe existing Jaynes-Cummings or Kerr models. In this paper, we adopt an\nab-initio model based on Josephson nonlinearity for transmon qubits. The\nab-initio analysis agrees well with the Kerr model in terms of capturing the\neffective $ZZ$ interaction in the weak-drive dispersive regime.

Unsupervised analysis of NDD can be used to\nautomatically detect different patterns from the driver and vehicle data. In\nthis paper, we propose a methodology to understand changes in driver's\nphysiological responses within different driving patterns. Our methodology\nfirst decomposes a driving scenario by using a Bayesian Change Point detection\nmodel. We then apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method on both driver\nstate and behavior data to detect patterns. We present two case studies in\nwhich vehicles were equipped to collect exterior, interior, and driver\nbehavioral data. Four patterns of driving behaviors (i.e., harsh brake, normal\nbrake, curved driving, and highway driving), as well as two patterns of\ndriver's heart rate (HR) (i.e., normal vs. abnormal high HR), and gaze entropy\n(i.e., low versus high), were detected in these two case studies. The findings\nof these case studies indicated that among our participants, the drivers' HR\nhad a higher fraction of abnormal patterns during harsh brakes, accelerating\nand curved driving. Additionally, free-flow driving with close to zero\naccelerations on the highway was accompanied by more fraction of normal HR as\nwell as a lower gaze entropy pattern.

These\nnovel features are constructed by applying a coordinate transformation based on\nthe recent Functional Data Analysis theory for anomaly detection. The\nassociated signal decomposition is an exact hierarchical tensor product\nexpansion with known optimality properties for approximating stochastic\nprocesses (random fields) with finite dimensional function spaces. In principle\nthese low dimensional spaces can capture most of the stochastic behavior of\n`underlying signals' in a given nominal class, and can reject signals in\nalternative classes as stochastic anomalies. Using a hierarchical finite\ndimensional expansion of the nominal class, a series of orthogonal nested\nsubspaces is constructed for detecting anomalous signal components. Projection\ncoefficients of input data in these subspaces are then used to train a Machine\nLearning (ML) classifier. However, due to the split of the signal into nominal\nand anomalous projection components, clearer separation surfaces of the classes\narise. In fact we show that with a sufficiently accurate estimation of the\ncovariance structure of the nominal class, a sharp classification can be\nobtained.

The joint optimization of\nenergy hubs and buildings' energy management systems can result in higher\nenergy savings.

One nonreciprocal device that has been demonstrated in the fields of\nacoustics and electromagnetism is the circulator, which achieves unirotational\ntransmission through a network of ports. This work investigates an elastic wave\ncirculator composed of a thin elastic ring with three semi-infinite elastic\nwaveguides attached, creating a three-port network. Nonreciprocity is achieved\nfor both longitudinal and transverse waves by modulating the elastic modulus of\nthe ring in a rotating fashion.

Most existing methods solve\nthis problem with a self-reconstruction framework, which tends to learn an\nidentity mapping and reduces the sensitivity to anomalies. To mitigate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel Proxy-bridged Image Reconstruction\nNetwork (ProxyAno) for anomaly detection in medical images. Specifically, we\nuse an intermediate proxy to bridge the input image and the reconstructed\nimage. We study different proxy types, and we find that the superpixel-image\n(SI) is the best one. We set all pixels' intensities within each superpixel as\ntheir average intensity, and denote this image as SI. The proposed ProxyAno\nconsists of two modules, a Proxy Extraction Module and an Image Reconstruction\nModule. In the Proxy Extraction Module, a memory is introduced to memorize the\nfeature correspondence for normal image to its corresponding SI, while the\nmemorized correspondence does not apply to the abnormal images, which leads to\nthe information loss for abnormal image and facilitates the anomaly detection.\nIn the Image Reconstruction Module, we map an SI to its reconstructed image.\nFurther, we crop a patch from the image and paste it on the normal SI to mimic\nthe anomalies, and enforce the network to reconstruct the normal image even\nwith the pseudo abnormal SI. In this way, our network enlarges the\nreconstruction error for anomalies. Extensive experiments on brain MR images,\nretinal OCT images and retinal fundus images verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod for both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 00:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

We show that the effective potential, the energy, and the\nangular momentum of a test particle moving in the spacetime of such a black\nhole strongly depend on the central black hole parameters. We also evaluate the\ninnermost stable circular orbit radii of test particles and show how the\nspacetime parameters can act on them. Further, we show the results for the\nfundamental frequencies of test particles moving at small distances from the\ncircular orbits in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate that change in the\nRastall parameter $\\kappa \\lambda$, can make the radial epicyclic frequency to\nbecome zero at larger distances from the central source. We also notice that\nfor the vertical epicyclic frequencies, in the case of the\nKerr-Newman-NUT-Kiselev black hole in the Rastall theory of gravity lower\nfrequencies are observed as compared to the frequencies observed in the case of\nthe Kerr black hole. Finally, we show that for the Kerr-Newman-NUT-Kiselev\nblack hole in the Rastall gravity, the Keplerian frequencies are almost\nidentical with the frequencies noticed in the case of the Kerr black hole and\nthe difference between the two can only be observed in the regions in a very\nclose vicinity to the central black hole, studied in the present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 01:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

With the development\nof automotive radar technologies in recent years, instance segmentation becomes\npossible by using automotive radar. Its data contain contexts such as radar\ncross section and micro-Doppler effects, and sometimes can provide detection\nwhen the field of view is obscured. The outcome from instance segmentation\ncould be potentially used as the input of trackers for tracking targets. The\nexisting methods often utilize a clustering-based classification framework,\nwhich fits the need of real-time processing but has limited performance due to\nminimum information provided by sparse radar detection points. In this paper,\nwe propose an efficient method based on clustering of estimated semantic\ninformation to achieve instance segmentation for the sparse radar detection\npoints. In addition, we show that the performance of the proposed approach can\nbe further enhanced by incorporating the visual multi-layer perceptron. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results on the\npopular RadarScenes dataset, achieving 89.53% mean coverage and 86.97% mean\naverage precision with the IoU threshold of 0.5, which is superior to other\napproaches in the literature.

While recent work in spatiotemporal prediction has\nleveraged deep sequential models that substantially improve over classical\napproaches, these models are prone to overfitting when the observation is\nextremely sparse, as in the task of crime event prediction. To overcome these\nsparsity issues, we present Multi-axis Attentive Prediction for Sparse Event\nData (MAPSED). We propose a purely attentional approach to extract both\nshort-term dynamics and long-term semantics of event propagation through two\nobservation angles. Unlike existing temporal prediction models that propagate\nlatent information primarily along the temporal dimension, the MAPSED\nsimultaneously operates over all axes (time, 2D space, event type) of the\nembedded data tensor. We additionally introduce a novel Frobenius norm-based\ncontrastive learning objective to improve latent representational\ngeneralization.Empirically, we validate MAPSED on two publicly accessible urban\ncrime datasets for spatiotemporal sparse event prediction, where MAPSED\noutperforms both classical and state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Diabetes patients are at risk of\ndeveloping foot ulcer that usually leads to limb amputation. In order to\ndevelop a self monitoring mobile application, in this work, we propose a novel\ndeep subspace analysis pipeline for semi-supervised diabetic foot ulcer\nmulit-label classification. To avoid any chance of over-fitting, unlike recent\nstate of the art deep semi-supervised methods, the proposed pipeline dose not\ninclude any data augmentation. Whereas, after extracting deep features, in\norder to make the representation shift invariant, we employ variety of data\naugmentation methods on each image and generate an image-sets, which is then\nmapped into a linear subspace. Moreover, the proposed pipeline reduces the cost\nof retraining when more new unlabelled data become available. Thus, the first\nstage of the pipeline employs the concept of transfer learning for feature\nextraction purpose through modifying and retraining a deep convolutional\nnetwork architect known as Xception. Then, the output of a mid-layer is\nextracted to generate an image set representer of any given image with help of\ndata augmentation methods. At this stage, each image is transferred to a linear\nsubspace which is a point on a Grassmann Manifold topological space. Hence, to\nperform analyse them, the geometry of such manifold must be considered. As\nsuch, each labelled image is represented as a vector of distances to number of\nunlabelled images using geodesic distance on Grassmann manifold. Finally,\nRandom Forest is trained for multi-label classification of diabetic foot ulcer\nimages. The method is then evaluated on the blind test set provided by DFU2021\ncompetition, and the result considerable improvement compared to using\nclassical transfer learning with data augmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 03:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

These systems, however, typically rely on optical fiber based fronthaul\nfor the communication between the central processing unit (CPU) and the\ndistributed access points (APs), which increases the infrastructure cost, leads\nto high installation time, and limits the deployment flexibility and\nadaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two\narchitectures for cell-free massive MIMO systems based on wireless fronthaul\nthat is operating at a \\textit{higher-band} compared to the access links: (i) A\nwireless-only fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a wireless fronthaul\nlink to each AP, and (ii) a mixed-fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a\nwireless link to each cluster of APs that are connected together via optical\nfibers. These dual-band architectures ensure high-data rate fronthaul and\nprovide high capability to synchronize the distributed APs. Further, the\nwireless fronthaul reduces the infrastructure cost and installation time, and\nenhances the flexibility, adaptability, and scalability of the network\ndeployment. To investigate the achievable data rates with the proposed\narchitectures, we formulate the end-to-end data rate optimization problem\naccounting for the various practical aspects of the fronthaul and access links.\nThen, we develop a low-complexity yet efficient joint beamforming and resource\nallocation solution for the proposed architectures based on user-centric AP\ngrouping. With this solution, we show that the proposed architectures can\nachieve comparable data rates to those obtained with optical fiber-based\nfronthaul under realistic assumptions on the fronthaul bandwidth, hardware\nconstraints, and deployment scenarios. This highlights a promising path for\nrealizing the cell-free massive MIMO gains in practice while reducing the\ninfrastructure and deployment overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 03:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 04:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 01:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

By measuring\nsecond-harmonic Hall resistance of Ni81Fe19/IrO2 bilayers, we find both\ndampinglike and fieldlike SOTs. The former is larger than the latter, enabling\neasier control of magnetization. We also observe that the dampinglike SOT\nefficiency has a significant dependence on IrO2 thickness, which is well\ndescribed by the drift-diffusion model based on the bulk spin Hall effect.

Despite this\nfact, our ability to visualize and alter surfaces on the atomic scale is\nseverely hampered by the strict conditions under which the related methods are\noperated to achieve high spatial resolution. In particular, the two prominent\nmethods utilized to achieve atomic-resolution imaging - scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) - are\ntypically performed under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and often at low temperatures.\nPerhaps more importantly, results obtained under such well-controlled, pristine\nconditions bear little relevance for the great majority of processes and\napplications that often occur under ambient conditions. As such, a method that\ncan robustly image surfaces on the atomic scale under ambient conditions has\nlong been thought of as a \"holy grail\" of surface science. Here, by way of a\nproof-of-principle measurement on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), we report that\nthe method of conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) can be utilized to\nachieve true atomic-resolution imaging under ambient conditions as proven by\nthe imaging of a single atomic vacancy, without any control over the\noperational environment or elaborate sample preparation.

The isolation forest (or iForest) approach is a well-known technique\nfor detecting anomalies. It is, however, ineffective when dealing with dynamic\nstreaming data, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in a wide variety of\napplication areas these days. In this work, we extend our previous work by\nproposed an efficient iForest based approach for anomaly detection using cube\nsampling that is effective on streaming data. Cube sampling is used in the\ninitial stage to choose nearly balanced samples, significantly reducing storage\nrequirements while preserving efficiency. Following that, the streaming nature\nof data is addressed by a sliding window technique that generates consecutive\nchunks of data for systematic processing. The novelty of this paper is in\napplying Cube sampling in iForest and calculating inclusion probability.

Query-efficient\nblack-box attacks rely on effectively estimated gradients towards maximizing\nthe probability of misclassifying the target video. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that such effective gradients can be searched for by parameterizing\nthe temporal structure of the search space with geometric transformations.\nSpecifically, we design a novel iterative algorithm Geometric TRAnsformed\nPerturbations (GEO-TRAP), for attacking video classification models. GEO-TRAP\nemploys standard geometric transformation operations to reduce the search space\nfor effective gradients into searching for a small group of parameters that\ndefine these operations.

While typical\ncontemporary neural models with attention mechanisms can generate fluent output\ndescriptions for this task, they often generate factually incorrect\ndescriptions. We propose a computational model with a truth-conditional\narchitecture which first runs small learned programs on the input time series,\nthen identifies the programs/patterns which hold true for the given input, and\nfinally conditions on only the chosen valid program (rather than the input time\nseries) to generate the output text description. A program in our model is\nconstructed from modules, which are small neural networks that are designed to\ncapture numerical patterns and temporal information. The modules are shared\nacross multiple programs, enabling compositionality as well as efficient\nlearning of module parameters.

However, LMs are usually trained to maximize the likelihood of correct\nword sequences, not to detect ASR errors. We propose an ASR rescoring method\nfor directly detecting errors with ELECTRA, which is originally a pre-training\nmethod for NLP tasks. ELECTRA is pre-trained to predict whether each word is\nreplaced by BERT or not, which can simulate ASR error detection on large text\ncorpora. To make this pre-training closer to ASR error detection, we further\npropose an extended version of ELECTRA called phone-attentive ELECTRA\n(P-ELECTRA).

The compact binary\ncoalescence (CBC) search pipelines perform the matched filter between the GW\ndetector's data and a large set of analytical waveforms. However, the\ncomputational cost of performing matched filter is very high as the required\nnumber of the analytical waveforms is also high. Recently, various deep\nlearning-based methods have been deployed to identify a GW signal in the\ndetector output as an alternative to computationally expensive matched\nfiltering techniques. In past work, the researchers have considered the\ndetection of GW signal mainly as a classification problem, in which they train\nthe deep learning-based architecture by considering the noise and the GW signal\nas two different classes. However, in this work, for the first time, we have\ncombined the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and matched filter methods to\nreduce the computational cost of the search by reducing the number of matched\nfiltering operations. We have implemented the CNN based architecture not only\nfor classification of the signal but also to identify the location of the\nsignal in the intrinsic parameter space. Identifying the location in which the\ndetected signal lies enables us to perform the matched filter operations\nbetween the data and the analytical waveforms generated for the smaller region\nof the parameter space only - thereby reducing the computational cost of the\nsearch.

While\nareas within the urban space (metropolitan mobile space) are being developed,\nrural areas are left behind. Due to challenges of low population density, low\nincome, difficult terrain, non-existent infrastructure, lack of power grid,\nremote areas have low digital penetration. This situation makes remote areas\nless attractive towards investments and to operate connectivity networks, thus\nfailing to achieve universal access to the Internet. In addressing this issue,\nthis paper proposes a new BS deployment and resource management method for\nremote and rural areas. Here, two MN operators share their resources towards\nthe procurement and deployment of green energy-powered BSs equipped with\ncomputing capabilities. Then, the network infrastructure is shared between the\nmobile operators, with the main goal of enabling energy-efficient\ninfrastructure sharing, i.e., BS and its co-located computing platform. Using\nthis resource management strategy in rural communication sites guarantees a\nQuality of Service (QoS) comparable to that of urban communication sites. The\nperformance evaluation conducted through simulations validates our analysis as\nthe prediction variations observed shows greater accuracy between the harvested\nenergy and the traffic load. Also, the energy savings decrease as the number of\nmobile users (50 users in our case) connected to the remote site increases.\nLastly, the proposed algorithm achieves 51% energy savings when compared with\nthe 43% obtained by our benchmark algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates\nsuperior performance over the benchmark algorithm as it uses foresighted\noptimization where the harvested energy and the expected load are predicted\nover a given short-term horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 10:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

Particularly interesting are the cognitive constraints\nassociated with the interactions between the ego and the members of their ego\nnetwork, which limit individuals to maintain meaningful interactions with no\nmore than 150 people, on average, and to arrange such relationships along\nconcentric circles of decreasing engagement. In this work, we focus on the ego\nnetworks of journalists on Twitter, considering 17 different countries, and we\ninvestigate whether they feature the same characteristics observed for other\nrelevant classes of Twitter users, like politicians and generic users. Our\nfindings are that journalists are generally more active and interact with more\npeople than generic users, regardless of their country. Their ego network\nstructure is very aligned with reference models derived in anthropology and\nobserved in general human ego networks. Remarkably, the similarity is even\nhigher than the one of politicians and generic users ego networks. This may\nimply a greater cognitive involvement with Twitter for journalists than for\nother user categories. From a dynamic perspective, journalists have stable\nshort-term relationships that do not change much over time. In the longer term,\nthough, ego networks can be pretty dynamic, especially in the innermost\ncircles. Moreover, the ego-alter ties of journalists are often\ninformation-driven, as they are mediated by hashtags both at their inception\nand during their lifetime. Finally, we found that relationships between\njournalists are assortative in popularity: journalists tend to engage with\nother journalists of similar popularity, in all layers but especially in their\ninnermost ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 10:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

The presented\nprocessor is not only capable of processing arbitrary size kernels, but the\nkernel coefficients can be any arbitrary positive or negative floating number.\nFindings- The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated on a FPGA\nplatform. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metric is used to measure the\ncomputation error for different images, filters, and illuminations. Finally,\nthe power consumption of the circuit in different operation conditions is\npresented. Originality/Value- The presented processor array can be used for\nhigh speed kernel convolution image processing tasks including arbitrary size\nedge detection and sharpening functions which require negative and fractional\nkernel values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 11:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

In the case of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs\nequation, which includes an adversary controlling the environment and\nminimizing the reward, the obtained policy is also robust to perturbations of\nthe dynamics. In this paper we propose continuous fitted value iteration (cFVI)\nand robust fitted value iteration (rFVI). These algorithms leverage the\nnon-linear control-affine dynamics and separable state and action reward of\nmany continuous control problems to derive the optimal policy and optimal\nadversary in closed form.

Although normalization methods spurred the\ndevelopment of increasingly deep and efficient architectures, they also\nincrease the vulnerability with respect to noise and input corruptions. In most\napplications, however, noise is ubiquitous and diverse; this can often lead to\ncomplete failure of machine learning systems as they fail to cope with\nmismatches between the input distribution during training- and test-time. The\nmost common normalization method, batch normalization, reduces the distribution\nshift during training but is agnostic to changes in the input distribution\nduring test time. This makes batch normalization prone to performance\ndegradation whenever noise is present during test-time. Sample-based\nnormalization methods can correct linear transformations of the activation\ndistribution but cannot mitigate changes in the distribution shape; this makes\nthe network vulnerable to distribution changes that cannot be reflected in the\nnormalization parameters.

Pair programming (PP) has been found to increase student interest in\nComputer Science, particularly so for women, and would therefore appear to be a\nway to help remedy their under-representation, which could be partially\nmotivated by gender stereotypes applied to software engineers, assuming that\nmen perform better than their women peers. If this same bias is present in pair\nprogramming, it could work against the goal of improving gender balance.\n  Objective. In a remote setting in which students cannot directly observe\ntheir peers, we aim to explore whether they behave differently when the\nperceived gender of their remote PP partners changes, searching for differences\nin (i) the perceived productivity compared to solo programming; (ii) the\npartner's perceived technical competency compared to their own; (iii) the\npartner's perceived skill level; (iv) the interaction behavior, such as the\nfrequency of source code additions, deletions, etc.; and (v) the type and\nrelative frequencies of dialog messages in a chat window.\n  Method. Using the twincode platform, several behaviors are automatically\nmeasured during the remote PP process, together with two questionnaires and a\nsemantic tagging of the pairs' chats. A series of experiments to identify the\neffect, if any, of possible gender bias shall be performed. The control group\nwill have no information about their partner's gender, whereas the treatment\ngroup will receive such information but will be selectively deceived about\ntheir partner's gender. For each response variable we will (i) compare control\nand experimental groups for the score distance between two in-pair tasks; then,\nusing the data from the experimental group only, we will (ii) compare scores\nusing the partner's perceived gender as a within-subjects variable; and (iii)\nanalyze the interaction between the partner's perceived gender and the\nsubject's gender.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 11:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

When the alphabet size is large\ncompared to number of samples, a portion of the distribution is highly likely\nto be unobserved or sparsely observed. The missing mass, defined as the sum of\nprobabilities $\\text{Pr}(x)$ over the missing letters $x$, and the Good-Turing\nestimator for missing mass have been important tools in large-alphabet\ndistribution estimation. In this article, given a positive function $g$ from\n$[0,1]$ to the reals, the missing $g$-mass, defined as the sum of\n$g(\\text{Pr}(x))$ over the missing letters $x$, is introduced and studied. The\nmissing $g$-mass can be used to investigate the structure of the missing part\nof the distribution. Specific applications for special cases such as\norder-$\\alpha$ missing mass ($g(p)=p^{\\alpha}$) and the missing Shannon entropy\n($g(p)=-p\\log p$) include estimating distance from uniformity of the missing\ndistribution and its partial estimation.

The attraction range is known to affect\ncritical gas-liquid behavior (liquid-liquid in protein and colloidal systems),\nbut the effect of attraction on melting in 2D systems remains unstudied\nsystematically. Here, we reveal how the attraction range affects the phase\ndiagrams and melting scenarios in a 2D system. Using molecular dynamics\nsimulations we considered the generalized Lennard-Jones system with a fixed\nrepulsion branch and different power indices of attraction, from long-range\ndipolar to short-range sticky-spheres-like. A drop in the attraction range has\nbeen found to reduce the temperature of the gas-liquid critical point, bringing\nit closer to the gas-liquid-solid triple point. At high-temperatures,\nattraction does not affect the melting scenario that proceeds through the\ncascade of solid-hexatic (Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless) and hexatic-liquid\n(first-order) phase transitions. In the case of dipolar attraction, we observed\n\\emph{two triple points}, inherent in a 2D system: hexatic-liquid-gas and\ncrystal-hexatic-gas, the temperature of the crystal-hexatic-gas triple point is\n\\emph{below} the hexatic-liquid-gas triple point. This observation may have\nfar-reaching consequences for future studies, since phase diagrams determine\npossible routes of self-assembly in molecular, protein, and colloidal systems,\nwhereas the attraction range can be adjusted with complex solvents and external\nelectric or magnetic fields. The results obtained may be widely used in\ncondensed matter, chemical physics, materials science, and soft matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 12:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

We continue the study of\nthese codes by first establishing new lower bounds on the rate of lifted\nReed-Solomon codes for any number of variables $m$, which improve upon the\nknown bounds for any $m\\ge 4$. Next, we use these results to provide lower\nbounds on the rate and distance of lifted multiplicity codes obtained from\npolynomials in an arbitrary number of variables, which improve upon the known\nresults for any $m\\ge 3$.\n  Specifically, we investigate a subcode of a lifted multiplicity code formed\nby the linear span of $m$-variate monomials whose restriction to an arbitrary\nline in $\\mathbb{F}_q^m$ is equivalent to a low-degree univariate polynomial.\nWe find the tight asymptotic behavior of the fraction of such monomials when\nthe number of variables $m$ is fixed and the alphabet size $q=2^\\ell$ is large.\nUsing these results, we give a new explicit construction of batch codes\nutilizing lifted Reed-Solomon codes.

Additionally, we present a new\nlocal self-correction algorithm for lifted multiplicity codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 12:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

While\nprosocial punishment can help increase cooperation, anti-social punishment --\nwhere defectors punish cooperators -- causes its downfall in both experimental\nand theoretical studies.\n  In this paper, we introduce social norms that allow agents to condition their\nbehaviour to the reputation of their peers. We benchmark this both with respect\nto the standard optional public goods game and to the variant where all types\nof punishment are allowed. We find that a social norm imposing a more moderate\nreputational penalty for opting out than for defecting, increases cooperation.\nWhen, besides reputation, punishment is also possible, the two mechanisms work\nsynergically under all social norms that do not assign to loners a strictly\nworse reputation than to defectors. Under this latter setup, the high levels of\ncooperation are sustained by conditional strategies, which largely reduce the\nuse of pro-social punishment and almost completely eliminate anti-social\npunishment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 13:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

The information is stored in a high resistive state (logcial\n'0', HRS) and a low resistive state (logcial '1', LRS). It can also be operated\nin two different writing schemes, namely a unipolar switching mode (LRS and HRS\nare written at the same voltage polarity) and a bipolar switching mode (LRS and\nHRS are written at opposite voltage polarities). VCM, however, still suffers\nfrom a large variability during writing operations and also faults occur, which\nare not yet fully understood and, therefore, require a better understanding of\nthe underlying fault mechanisms. In this study, a new intrinsic failure\nmechanism is identified, which prohibits RESET times (transition from LRS to\nHRS) faster than 400 ps and possibly also limits the endurance. We demonstrate\nthis RESET speed limitation by measuring the RESET kinetics of two valence\nchange memory devices (namely Pt/TaO$_\\mathrm{x}$/Ta and\nPt/ZrO$_\\mathrm{x}$/Ta) in the time regime from 50 ns to 50 ps, corresponding\nto the fastest writing time reported for VCM. Faster RESET times were achieved\nby increasing the applied pulse voltage. Above a voltage threshold it was,\nhowever, no longer possible to reset both types of devices. Instead a unipolar\nSET (transition from HRS to LRS) event occurred, preventing faster RESET times.\nThe occurrence of the unipolar SET is attributed to an oxygen exchange at the\ninterface to the Pt~electrode, which can be suppressed by introducing an oxygen\nblocking layer at this interface, which also allowed for 50 ps fast RESET\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 13:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 08:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

As a special kind of graph data, the tree has a\nsimpler data structure and can provide rich hierarchical information for text\nclassification. Inspired by the structural entropy, we construct the coding\ntree of the graph by minimizing the structural entropy and propose HINT, which\naims to make full use of the hierarchical information contained in the text for\nthe task of text classification. Specifically, we first establish a dependency\nparsing graph for each text. Then we designed a structural entropy minimization\nalgorithm to decode the key information in the graph and convert each graph to\nits corresponding coding tree. Based on the hierarchical structure of the\ncoding tree, the representation of the entire graph is obtained by updating the\nrepresentation of non-leaf nodes in the coding tree layer by layer.

The traditional model is a multilevel linear regression of\nstudent current achievement on student prior achievement, background\ncharacteristics, and a school random intercept effect. The predicted random\neffect aims to measure the mean academic progress students make in each school.\nIn this article, we argue that much is to be gained by additionally studying\nthe variance in student progress in each school. We therefore extend the\ntraditional model to allow the residual variance to vary as a log-linear\nfunction of the student covariates and a new school random effect to predict\nthe influence of schools on the variance in student progress.

The\ncounter-intuitive influence of even a single photon to control the output of a\nbeam splitter illuminated by any field, be it a coherent or even a noisy\nthermal field, demonstrates the extraordinary power of non-classicality. The\ncanonical example of total destructive interference of quantum amplitudes\nleading to the absence of coincidence counts from a 50/50 beam splitter is the\ncelebrated HOM effect, characterized by the vanishing of the joint probability\nof detecting singe photons in each of the output beams.

ZwCl 2341+0000 is a double-relic merging galaxy cluster;\nprevious studies have shown that half of the S relic is associated with an\nX-ray surface brightness discontinuity, while the other half not. The\ndiscontinuity was believed to be a shock front. Therefore, it is a mysterious\ncase of an only partial shock-relic connection. By using the 206.5 ks deep\nChandra observations, we aim to investigate the nature of the S discontinuity.\nMeanwhile, we aim to explore new morphological and thermodynamical features. In\naddition, we utilize the GMRT and JVLA images to compute radio spectral index\n(SI) maps. In the deep observations, the previously reported S surface\nbrightness discontinuity is better described as a sharp change in slope or as a\nkink, which is likely contributed by the disrupted core of the S subcluster.\nThe radio SI maps show spectral flattening at the SE edge of the S relic,\nsuggesting that the location of the shock front is 640 kpc away from the kink.\nWe update the radio shock Mach number to be $2.2\\pm0.1$ and $2.4\\pm0.4$ for the\nS and N radio relics, respectively, based on the injection SI. We also put a 3\nsigma lower limit on the X-ray Mach number of the S shock to be >1.6.\nMeanwhile, the deep observations reveal that the N subcluster is in a perfect\ncone shape, with a ~400 kpc linear cold front on each side. This type of conic\nsubcluster has been predicted by simulations but is observed here for the first\ntime. It represents a transition stage between a blunt-body cold front and a\nslingshot cold front. Strikingly, we found a 400 kpc long gas trail attached to\nthe apex of the cone, which could be due to the gas stripping. In addition, an\nover-pressured hot region is found in the SW flank of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 14:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

This is in contrast to the general setting, in which a\nprojective measurement in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is optimal\nregardless of temperature. In the general multi-mode case, and unlike the\ngeneral unrestricted scenario where joint measurements are not helpful for\nthermometry (nor for any parameter estimation task), it is open whether joint\nGaussian measurements provide an advantage over local ones. We conjecture that\nthey are not useful for thermal systems, supported by partial analytical and\nnumerical evidence. We further show that Gaussian measurements become optimal\nin the limit of large temperatures, while on/off photo-detection-like\nmeasurements do it for when the temperature tends to zero.

While asking domain experts to\nannotate only one or a few of the cohort's images is feasible, annotating all\navailable images is impractical. This issue is further exacerbated when\npre-trained deep networks are exposed to a new image dataset from an unfamiliar\ndistribution. Using available open-source data for ad-hoc transfer learning or\nhand-tuned techniques for data augmentation only provides suboptimal solutions.\nMotivated by atlas-based segmentation, we propose a novel volumetric\nself-supervised learning for data augmentation capable of synthesizing\nvolumetric image-segmentation pairs via learning transformations from a single\nlabeled atlas to the unlabeled data. Our work's central tenet benefits from a\ncombined view of one-shot generative learning and the proposed self-supervised\ntraining strategy that cluster unlabeled volumetric images with similar styles\ntogether. Unlike previous methods, our method does not require input volumes at\ninference time to synthesize new images. Instead, it can generate diversified\nvolumetric image-segmentation pairs from a prior distribution given a single or\nmulti-site dataset. Augmented data generated by our method used to train the\nsegmentation network provide significant improvements over state-of-the-art\ndeep one-shot learning methods on the task of brain MRI segmentation.

Our contributions are based on the enlargement of the\nconvolutional receptive fields through the introduction of spatio-temporal\nsize-varying segments of videos, as well as the discovery of the local feature\nrelevance over the entire video sequence. The resulting extracted features\nencapsulate information that includes the importance of local features across\nmultiple temporal durations, as well as the entire video sequence.\n  Subsequently, we study how we can better handle variations between classes of\nactions, by enhancing their feature differences over different layers of the\narchitecture. The hierarchical extraction of features models variations of\nrelatively similar classes the same as very dissimilar classes. Therefore,\ndistinctions between similar classes are less likely to be modelled. The\nproposed approach regularises feature maps by amplifying features that\ncorrespond to the class of the video that is processed.

Ternary logic uses less connections than binary logic,\nand less voltage changes are required for the same amount of data transmission.\nCarbon nanotube transistors have advantages over MOSFETs, such as the same\nmobility for electrons and holes, the ability to adjust the threshold voltage\nby changing the nanotube diameter, and less leakage power. The proposed half\nadder has lower power consumption, delay, and fewer transistors compared to\nrecent ternary half adders that use similar design methods. The proposed 1-trit\nmultiplier also has a lower delay than other designs. Moreover, these\nadvantages are achieved over a wide supply voltage range, operating\ntemperatures, and output loads. The design is also more robust to process\nvariations than the nearest design in terms of PDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 11:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

We\nconstruct the Seiberg-Witten map for the gauge parameter, the gauge field and\nthe strength tensor to the first order in the noncommutativity parameter\n$\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$. Prescription for the generalization of the map to higher\norders is also given. Interestingly, the associativity of the covariant star\nproduct both in the first and second orders requires the same constraints,\nnamely, on the $\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ and on the space-time connection. This fact\nsuggests that the same constraints could be enough to ensure the associativity\nin all orders. The resulting Seiberg-Witten map applies both to the internal\nand space-time gauge theories.

Moreover, we are more interested in electrical\ndefects as opposed to logic bugs.\n  We present SiliFuzz, a work-in-progress system that finds CPU defects by\nfuzzing software proxies, like CPU simulators or disassemblers, and then\nexecuting the accumulated test inputs (known as the corpus) on actual CPUs on a\nlarge scale. The major difference between this work and traditional software\nfuzzing is that a software bug fixed once will be fixed for all installations\nof the software, while for CPU defects we have to test every individual core\nrepeatedly over its lifetime due to wear and tear. In this paper we also\nanalyze four groups of CPU defects that SiliFuzz has uncovered and describe\npatterns shared by other SiliFuzz findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 03:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

However, the Bode-Fano criterion\ndefines the trade-off between bandwidth and efficiency for all passive, linear,\ntime-invariant systems. In this letter, we propose a broadband absorber beyond\nthe Bode-Fano limit by creating an energy trap using time-modulated\nswitch/diodes. This work starts with an ideal circuit model to prove the\nconcept, followed by two EM realizations - a freuqnecy selective surface (FSS)\napproach for general bandwidth broadening and a low-profile PCB design. The\nprototype of the latter is built and measured, demonstrating a Bode-Fano\nintegral larger than one. This approach paves a way to many practical\nultra-wide band absorber designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 22:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

It is based on a two-fold\nclustering of the blendshape face model. Our method focuses exclusively on the\nunderlying space of deformation and produces clusters in both the mesh space\nand the controller space -- something that was not investigated in previous\nliterature. This segmentation finds intuitive and meaningful connections\nbetween groups of vertices on the face and deformation controls, and further\nthese segments can be observed independently. A separate model for solving the\ninverse rig problem is then learned for each segment. Our method is completely\nunsupervised and highly parallelizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 07:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Latent variable models, such as variation\nautoencoders and Gaussian mixture models, are often trained with\nlikelihood-based approaches. In scope of Goodhart's law, when a metric becomes\na target it ceases to be a good metric and therefore we should not use\nlikelihood to assess the quality of the fit of these models. The solution we\npropose is a new metric for model comparison or regularization that relies on\nmoments. The concept is to study the difference between the data moments and\nthe model moments using a matrix norm, such as the Frobenius norm. We show how\nto use this new metric for model comparison and then for regularization. It is\ncommon to draw samples from the fitted distribution when evaluating latent\nvariable models and we show that our proposed metric is faster to compute and\nhas a smaller variance that this alternative.
