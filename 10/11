Here we argue that, while $\\lambda_{\\text A}$ exists\nin QCD, a high-$T$ state is not an insulator in such an analogy. Rather, it is\na critical state arising due to a new singular mobility edge at $\\lambda_{\\text\nIR}=0$. This new mobility edge appears upon the transition into the recently\nproposed IR phase. As a key part of such a metal-to-critical scenario, we\npresent evidence using pure-glue QCD that deeply infrared Dirac modes in the IR\nphase extend to arbitrarily long distances. This is consistent with our\nprevious suggestion that the IR phase supports scale invariance in the\ninfrared.

We first\nintroduce the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning in two player zero\nsum simultaneous action games and discuss the unique challenges this type of\ngame poses. Then we introduce two novel agents that attempt to handle these\nchallenges by using joint action Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The first agent, called\nthe Best Response AgenT (BRAT), builds an explicit model of its opponent's\npolicy using imitation learning, and then uses this model to find the best\nresponse to exploit the opponent's strategy. The second agent, Meta-Nash DQN,\nbuilds an implicit model of its opponent's policy in order to produce a context\nvariable that is used as part of the Q-value calculation. An explicit minimax\nover Q-values is used to find actions close to Nash equilibrium.

To confirm this result, we derive the equation\nfor the second moment and find that it is subdiffusive in the long time limit.\nAnalyses of two simpler models are also included, which demonstrate the\ndominance of the Mittag-Leffler rest state leading to subdiffusion. The\nobservation that transient superdiffusion occurs in an eventually subdiffusive\nsystem is a useful feature for application in stochastic biological transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 17:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

To illustrate the practical value of the\nmixture representations, we address the problem of density estimation for\nlikelihood ratio ordered distributions. In particular, we propose a\nnonparametric Bayesian solution which takes advantage of the mixture\nrepresentations. The prior distribution is constructed from Dirichlet process\nmixtures and has large support on the space of pairs of densities satisfying\nthe monotone ratio constraint. With a simple modification to the prior\ndistribution, we can test the equality of two distributions against the\nalternative of likelihood ratio ordering.

However, the\nproblem of identity ambiguity remains unsolved, which usually occurs when the\ncontour is too vague to provide reliable identity information (e.g., when its\nresolution is extremely low). Thus feasible solutions of image restoration\ncould be infinite. In this work, we propose a novel framework that takes the\ncontour and an extra image specifying the identity as the inputs, where the\ncontour can be of various modalities, including the low-resolution image,\nsketch, and semantic label map. Concretely, we propose a novel dual-encoder\narchitecture, in which an identity encoder extracts the identity-related\nfeature, accompanied by a main encoder to obtain the rough contour information\nand further fuse all the information together. The encoder output is\niteratively fed into a pre-trained StyleGAN generator until getting a\nsatisfying result.

However, their\nheuristically designed architecture impose huge computational costs during\ninference. This work aims on challenging the common design philosophy of the\nVision Transformer (ViT) model with uniform dimension across all the stacked\nblocks in a model stage, where we redistribute the parameters both across\ntransformer blocks and between different structures within the block via the\nfirst systematic attempt on global structural pruning. Dealing with diverse ViT\nstructural components, we derive a novel Hessian-based structural pruning\ncriteria comparable across all layers and structures, with latency-aware\nregularization for direct latency reduction. Performing iterative pruning on\nthe DeiT-Base model leads to a new architecture family called NViT (Novel ViT),\nwith a novel parameter redistribution that utilizes parameters more\nefficiently. On ImageNet-1K, NViT-Base achieves a 2.6x FLOPs reduction, 5.1x\nparameter reduction, and 1.9x run-time speedup over the DeiT-Base model in a\nnear lossless manner. Smaller NViT variants achieve more than 1% accuracy gain\nat the same throughput of the DeiT Small/Tiny variants, as well as a lossless\n3.3x parameter reduction over the SWIN-Small model.

Taking this as a fundamental premise and inspired by\nquantum information theory, here we build an axiomatization for quantum realism\n-- a notion of realism compatible with quantum theory. Our strategy consists of\nlisting some physically-motivated principles able to characterize quantum\nrealism in a ``metric'' independent manner. We introduce some criteria defining\nmonotones and measures of realism and then search for potential candidates\nwithin some celebrated information theories -- those induced by the von\nNeumann, R\\'enyi, and Tsallis entropies. We explicitly construct some classes\nof entropic quantifiers that are shown to satisfy (almost all of) the proposed\naxioms and hence can be taken as faithful estimates for the degree of reality\n(or definiteness) of a given physical observable.

To this aim, we\npropose the first approach that considers a multi-view context by combining\nexisting adversarial patches with a perspective geometric transformation in\norder to simulate the effect of view angle changes.

The experiments show that view angle\nsignificantly affects the performance of adversarial patches, where in some\ncases the patch loses most of its effectiveness. We believe that these results\nmotivate taking into account the effect of view angles in future adversarial\nattacks, and open up new opportunities for adversarial defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 19:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

In the current article, we set out to\nprovide an explanation for this Bose-Einstein statistics.

With a modelled ideally expanded mean flow as input, an\napproximation of the shock-cell structure is obtained from the parabolised\nstability equations (PSE) at zero frequency. This solution is then used to\ndefine a new shock-containing mean flow, which is a function of the shock-cell\nwavenumber at each streamwise station. Linearisation of the Navier-Stokes\nequations around this quasi-periodic mean flow allows us to postulate a\nsolution based on the Floquet ansatz, and further manipulation of the equations\nleads to a system called the parabolised Floquet equations (PFE) that bears\nseveral similarities to PSE. The modulation wavenumbers are marched spatially\ntogether with the central Kelvin-Helmholtz wavenumber, leading to a modulated\nwavepacket as the final solution. The limitations of PFE are highlighted, and\nthe method is applied to two sample cases: a canonical slowly diverging jet at\nlow supersonic Mach number and an overexpanded jet, for which large-eddy\nsimulation (LES) data is available. Overall, good agreement is observed between\nthe wavepackets predicted by PFE and the leading spectral proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (SPOD) modes from the LES, suggesting that the method is able to\ncapture the underlying physical mechanism associated with wavepacket\nmodulation: the extraction of energy from the mean flow by the Kelvin-Helmholtz\nmode and a redistribution of energy to modulation wavenumbers due to the\ninteraction with the shock-cell structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 22:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

We\npropose a novel morphable detector (MD), that simply \"morphs\" some of its\nchangeable parameters online estimated from the few samples, so as to detect\nnovel classes without any extra training. The MD has two sets of parameters,\none for the feature embedding and the other for class representation (called\n\"prototypes\").

In addition, we derive the\ncorresponding rate of convergence, depending on the KL exponent and the\nsuitably selected diminishing step sizes. When the KL exponent lies in\n$[0,\\frac12]$, the convergence is at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ with $t$\ncounting the iteration number.

This paper makes a\nfirst comprehensive evaluation of deep transfer learning (DTL) for identifying\ncommon weeds specific to cotton production systems in southern United States. A\nnew dataset for weed identification was created, consisting of 5187 color\nimages of 15 weed classes collected under natural lighting conditions and at\nvaried weed growth stages, in cotton fields during the 2020 and 2021 field\nseasons. We evaluated 27 state-of-the-art deep learning models through transfer\nlearning and established an extensive benchmark for the considered weed\nidentification task. DTL achieved high classification accuracy of F1 scores\nexceeding 95%, requiring reasonably short training time (less than 2.5 hours)\nacross models. ResNet101 achieved the best F1-score of 99.1% whereas 14 out of\nthe 27 models achieved F1 scores exceeding 98.0%. However, the performance on\nminority weed classes with few training samples was less satisfactory for\nmodels trained with a conventional, unweighted cross entropy loss function. To\naddress this issue, a weighted cross entropy loss function was adopted, which\nachieved substantially improved accuracies for minority weed classes.\nFurthermore, a deep learning-based cosine similarity metrics was employed to\nanalyze the similarity among weed classes, assisting in the interpretation of\nclassifications. Both the codes for model benchmarking and the weed dataset are\nmade publicly available, which expect to be be a valuable resource for future\nresearch in weed identification and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 01:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

In general,\nthe Koopman operator is a linear infinite dimensional operator, which means\nthat the derived linear state space model of the rigid body dynamics will be\ninfinite-dimensional, which is not suitable for modeling and control design\npurposes. Recently, finite approximations of the operator computed by means of\nmethods like the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) have shown\npromising results for different classes of problems. However, without using an\nappropriate set of observables in the EDMD approach, there can be no guarantees\nthat the computed approximation of the nonlinear dynamics is sufficiently\naccurate. The major challenge in using the Koopman operator for constructing a\nlinear state space model is the choice of observables. State-of-the-art methods\nin the field compute the approximations of the observables by using neural\nnetworks, standard radial basis functions (RBFs), polynomials or heuristic\napproximations of these functions.

It is observed that high confidence\nlabels during training cause the overfitting problem and DL selects disturb\nlabels at random regardless of the confidence of labels. To solve this\nshortcoming of DL, we propose Directional DisturbLabel (DDL) a novel\nregularization technique that makes use of the class probabilities to infer the\nconfident labels and using these labels to regularize the model. This active\nregularization makes use of the model behavior during training to regularize it\nin a more directed manner.

Here we report the analysis of the Casimir\neffect for parallel plates separated by a distance of $L$ using a Lorentz\ninvariant scalar theory in a non-commutative space-time (DFR space-time), both\nat zero and finite temperatures. This is done in two ways; one when the\nadditional space-dimensions introduced in DFR space-time are treated as extra\ndimensions but on par with usual space-dimension and in the second way, the\nadditional dimensions are treated as compact dimensions. Casimir force obtained\nin the first approach coincides with the result in the extra-dimensional\ncommutative space-time and this is varying as $\\frac{1}{L^5}$. In the second\napproach, we derive the corrections to the Casimir force, which is dependent on\nthe separation between the plate, $L$ and on the size of the extra compactified\ndimension, $R$. Since correction terms are very small, keeping only the most\nsignificant terms of these corrections, we show that for certain values of the\nR, the corrections due to non-commutativity makes the force between the\nparallel plates more attractive, and using this, we find lower bound on the\nvalue of $R$.

Regarding code-based cryptography, the original approach for PoK\nbased signatures is the Stern protocol which allows to prove the knowledge of a\nsmall weight vector solving a given instance of the Syndrome Decoding (SD)\nproblem over F2. It features a soundness error equal to 2/3. This protocol was\nimproved a few years later by V\\'eron who proposed a variation of the scheme\nbased on the General Syndrome Decoding (GSD) problem which leads to better\nresults in term of communication. A few years later, the AGS protocol\nintroduced a variation of the V\\'eron protocol based on Quasi-Cyclic (QC)\nmatrices. The AGS protocol permits to obtain an asymptotic soundness error of\n1/2 and an improvement in term of communications. In the present paper, we\nintroduce the Quasi-Cyclic Stern PoK which constitutes an adaptation of the AGS\nscheme in a SD context, as well as several new optimizations for code-based\nPoK. Our main optimization on the size of the signature can't be applied to GSD\nbased protocols such as AGS and therefore motivated the design of our new\nprotocol. In addition, we also provide a special soundness proof that is\ncompatible with the use of the Fiat-Shamir transform for 5-round protocols.\nThis approach is valid for our protocol but also for the AGS protocol which was\nlacking such a proof. We compare our results with existing signatures including\nthe recent code-based signatures based on PoK leveraging the MPC in the head\nparadigm. In practice, our new protocol is as fast as AGS while reducing its\nassociated signature length by 20%. As a consequence, it constitutes an\ninteresting trade-off between signature length and execution time for the\ndesign of a code-based signature relying only on the difficulty of the SD\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 05:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 18:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Second,\ntowards understanding the robustness of SSL, we hypothesize that SSL learns\nricher features from frequent data: it may learn\nlabel-irrelevant-but-transferable features that help classify the rare classes\nand downstream tasks. In contrast, supervised learning has no incentive to\nlearn features irrelevant to the labels from frequent examples.

The BTP methods are categorised into two types: Non-NN and\nNN-learned. Non-NN methods use a neural network (NN) as a feature extractor,\nbut the BTP part is based on a non-NN algorithm, whereas NN-learned methods\nemploy a NN to learn a protected template from the unprotected template.

However, the core process of the electron symmetry filtering\nbreaks down under applied bias, dramatically reducing the TMR above 0.5 V. This\nstrongly hampers the application range of MTJs. To circumvent the problem,\nresonant tunneling between ferromagnetic electrodes through quantum well states\nin thin layers has been used so far. This mechanism, however, is mainly\neffective at low temperatures. Here, a fundamentally different approach is\ndemonstrated, providing a strong TMR boost under applied bias in\nV/MgO/Fe/MgO/Fe/Co hybrids. This pathway uses spin orbit coupling (SOC)\ncontrolled interfacial states in vanadium, which contrary to the V(001) bulk\nstates are allowed to tunnel to Fe(001) at low biases. The experimentally\nobserved strong increase of TMR with bias is modelled using two nonlinear\nresistances in series, with the low bias conductance of the first (V/MgO/Fe)\nelement being boosted by the SOC-controlled interfacial states, while the\nconductance of the second (Fe/MgO/Fe) junctions controlled by the relative\nalignment of the two ferromagnetic layers. These results pave a way to\nunexplored and fundamentally different spintronic device schemes, with\ntunneling magnetoresistance uplifted under applied electric bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 07:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

To overcome this difficulty and to avoid\nthe expensive mesh generation, geometrically unfitted methods, i.e. the\nnumerical methods using the simple computational meshes that do not fit the\nboundary of the domain, and/or the internal interfaces, have been widely\ndeveloped. In the present work, we investigate the performances of an unfitted\nmethod called $\\phi$-FEM that converges optimally and uses classical finite\nelement spaces so that it can be easily implemented using general FEM\nlibraries.

Furthermore, we develop a surrogate that can be\nefficiently computed in linear time and space and prove that it is\nasymptotically equivalent to the kernel diffusion density function.

Unlike most other machines, they can traverse extremely\ncomplex environments at high speeds. To date, only expert human pilots have\nbeen able to fully exploit their capabilities. Autonomous operation with\non-board sensing and computation has been limited to low speeds.\nState-of-the-art methods generally separate the navigation problem into\nsubtasks: sensing, mapping, and planning. While this approach has proven\nsuccessful at low speeds, the separation it builds upon can be problematic for\nhigh-speed navigation in cluttered environments. Indeed, the subtasks are\nexecuted sequentially, leading to increased processing latency and a\ncompounding of errors through the pipeline. Here we propose an end-to-end\napproach that can autonomously fly quadrotors through complex natural and\nman-made environments at high speeds, with purely onboard sensing and\ncomputation. The key principle is to directly map noisy sensory observations to\ncollision-free trajectories in a receding-horizon fashion. This direct mapping\ndrastically reduces processing latency and increases robustness to noisy and\nincomplete perception. The sensorimotor mapping is performed by a convolutional\nnetwork that is trained exclusively in simulation via privileged learning:\nimitating an expert with access to privileged information. By simulating\nrealistic sensor noise, our approach achieves zero-shot transfer from\nsimulation to challenging real-world environments that were never experienced\nduring training: dense forests, snow-covered terrain, derailed trains, and\ncollapsed buildings.

This is especially true for high-stakes areas such as real\nestate valuation. Unfortunately, the methods applied there often exhibit a\ntrade-off between accuracy and explainability.\n  One explainable approach is case-based reasoning (CBR), where each decision\nis supported by specific previous cases. However, such methods can be wanting\nin accuracy. The unexplainable machine learning approaches are often observed\nto provide higher accuracy but are not scrutable in their decision-making.\n  In this paper, we apply evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to CBR predictors in\norder to improve their performance.

The goal of this\ncontribution to Offshell-2021 is to explore consequence of assuming a\nlong-lived gluon-dominated phase, which we shall denote a gluon plasma (GP). As\nthese consequences are naturally enhanced in a large systems, we assume and\nexplore the extreme scenario in which a GP would be created in AA collisions\nand exist for significant time before the formation of a\nchemically-equilibrated quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The GP and its formation\nwould be impossible to probe with light-quark hadrons, which are first produced\nlater in this scenario. As charm quarks are produced early in the collision,\nthey can circumvent the limitations of light quarks and we propose charm\nbalance functions as an effective tool to test this idea and constrain the\ndynamics of the GP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 10:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

But in many practical\napplications, these environments may differ. For instance, in control systems,\nthe robot(s) on which a policy is learned might differ from the robot(s) on\nwhich a policy will run. It can be caused by different internal factors (e.g.,\ncalibration issues, system attrition, defective modules) or also by external\nchanges (e.g., weather conditions). There is a need to develop RL methods that\ngeneralize well to variations of the training conditions. In this article, we\nconsider the simplest yet hard to tackle generalization setting where the test\nenvironment is unknown at train time, forcing the agent to adapt to the\nsystem's new dynamics. This online adaptation process can be computationally\nexpensive (e.g., fine-tuning) and cannot rely on meta-RL techniques since there\nis just a single train environment. To do so, we propose an approach where we\nlearn a subspace of policies within the parameter space. This subspace contains\nan infinite number of policies that are trained to solve the training\nenvironment while having different parameter values. As a consequence, two\npolicies in that subspace process information differently and exhibit different\nbehaviors when facing variations of the train environment.

The most\nwidely used approach to couple quantum emitters to optical antennas is based on\nthe Purcell effect.

Compared to iteration based saliency methods, single backward pass\nbased saliency methods benefit from faster speed, and they are widely used in\ndownstream visual tasks. Thus, we focus on single backward pass based methods.\nHowever, existing methods in this category struggle to uccessfully produce\nfine-grained saliency maps concentrating on specific target classes.

The tight infrared-radio correlation offers the\npossibility of using radio emission as a dust-unobscured star formation\ndiagnostic. However, the physics governing the link between radio emission and\nstar formation is poorly understood, and recent studies have pointed to\ndifferences in the exact calibration required when radio is to be used as a\nstar formation tracer. We improve the calibration of the relation of the local\nradio luminosity--SFR and to test whether there are nonlinearities in it. We\nused a sample of Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS)\nsources and investigated their radio luminosity, which was derived using the\nNRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm\n(FIRST) maps. We stacked the bins of infrared luminosity and SFR and accounted\nfor bins with no detections in the stacked images using survival analysis\nfitting. This approach was tested using Monte Carlo simulations. After removing\nsources from the sample that have excess radio emission, which is indicative of\nnuclear radio activity, we found no deviations from linearity of the mean\nrelations between radio luminosity and either SFR or infrared luminosity. We\nanalyzed the link between radio emission and SFR or infrared luminosity using a\nlocal sample of star-forming galaxies without evidence of nuclear radio\nactivity and found no deviations from linearity, although our data are also\nconsistent with the small nonlinearity reported by some recent analyses. The\nnormalizations of these relations are intermediate between those reported by\nearlier works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 12:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Although\nthis damage is commonly ascribed to the volumetric expansion of water upon\nfreezing, it is usually driven by suction of water towards growing ice\ncrystals. The freezing of this additional water can cause a large build up of\nstress. Here, we study this process by producing a stable ice/water interface\nin a controlled temperature gradient, and measuring the deformation of the\nconfining boundary. Analysis of the deformation field reveals stresses applied\nto the boundary with $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu\\mathrm{m})$ resolution. Globally,\nstresses increase steadily over time as liquid water is transported to more\ndeeply undercooled regions. Locally, stresses increase until ice growth is\nstalled by the confining stresses. In accordance with the Clapeyron equation,\nthe local limiting stress is proportional to the local undercooling.

Cross-identification of radio sources with optical host galaxies\nis challenging for this extended population, due to their morphological\ncomplexity and multiple potential counterparts. In the first data release of\nthe Low-frequency array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR1) the automated\nlikelihood ratio for compact sources was supplemented by a citizen science\nvisual identification process for extended sources. In this paper we present a\nnovel method for automating the host identification of extended sources by\nusing ridgelines, which trace the assumed direction of fluid-flow through the\npoints of highest flux density. Applying a new code, RL-Xid, to LoTSS DR1, we\ndemonstrate that ridgelines are versatile; by providing information about\nspatial structure and brightness distributions, they can be used both for\noptical host identification and morphological studies in radio surveys. RL-Xid\ndraws ridgelines for 85 per cent of sources brighter than 10 mJy and larger\nthan 15 arcsec, with an improved performance of 96 per cent for the subset >30\nmJy and >60 arcsec. Using a sample of sources with known hosts from LoTSS DR1,\nwe demonstrate that RL-Xid successfully identifies the host for 98 per cent of\nthe sources with successfully drawn ridgelines, and performs at a comparable\nlevel to visual identification via citizen science.

Recently, the\ndesign of adaptive intersection control algorithms that take advantage of this\ninformation evoked a lot of research, typically assuming a perfect\ncommunication. In this study, we explore possible effects of a temporal\ndecrease in the reliability of the communication channel, on a throughput of a\nsignalized intersection. We model road traffic and DSRC-VANET communication by\nintegrating the well-established traffic and communication simulation tools\n(Vissim and OMNeT++). Comparisons of the perfect communication conditions with\nchallenging, but realistic conditions involving communication distortions show\nthat the adaptive intersection control may suffer from significantly increased\naverage delays of vehicles. The level of delays is largely independent of\nwhether the communication distortions affect all or only a single intersection\napproach. For some signal groups, the average vehicle delays are significantly\nincreased, while for the others they are decreased, leading to the disbalance\nand unfairness. We show that the data received in the previous time intervals\nand simple assumptions about the vehicle movements can be used to estimate the\nlost data. The compensation of the communication distortions affecting a single\nintersection approach decreases the average vehicle delays. When the\ncommunication distortions impacting all the intersection approaches are\ncompensated for, the vehicle delays are even set back to the levels comparable\nwith the perfect communication conditions. Overall, the results demonstrate\nthat the impact of the communication distortions should be considered in the\ndesign of the adaptive intersection control algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 13:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

A fully decentralized architecture\nlike Swarm Learning allows peer-to-peer communication among distributed nodes,\nwithout the central server. One of the most challenging issues in decentralized\ndeep learning is that data owned by each node are usually non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID), causing time-consuming convergence of model\ntraining. To this end, we propose a decentralized learning model called\nHomogeneous Learning (HL) for tackling non-IID data with a self-attention\nmechanism. In HL, training performs on each round's selected node, and the\ntrained model of a node is sent to the next selected node at the end of each\nround. Notably, for the selection, the self-attention mechanism leverages\nreinforcement learning to observe a node's inner state and its surrounding\nenvironment's state, and find out which node should be selected to optimize the\ntraining. We evaluate our method with various scenarios for an image\nclassification task. The result suggests that HL can produce a better\nperformance compared with standalone learning and greatly reduce both the total\ntraining rounds by 50.8% and the communication cost by 74.6% compared with\nrandom policy-based decentralized learning for training on non-IID data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 14:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

In non-magnetic hot stars, the LDI\nleads to the formation of an inhomogeneous wind consisting of small-scale,\nspatially separated clumps that can have great effects on observational\ndiagnostics. However, for magnetic hot stars the LDI generated structures, wind\ndynamics, and effects on observational diagnostics have not been directly\ninvestigated so far. We investigated the non-linear development of LDI\ngenerated structures and dynamics in a magnetic line-driven wind of a typical\nO-supergiant. We employed two-dimensional axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of the LDI using the Smooth Source Function approximation for\nevaluating the assumed one-dimensional line force. To facilitate the\ninterpretation of these magnetic models, they were compared with a\ncorresponding non-magnetic LDI simulation as well as a magnetic simulation\nneglecting the LDI. A central result obtained is that the wind morphology and\nwind clumping properties change strongly with increasing wind-magnetic\nconfinement. Most notably, in magnetically confined flows, the LDI leads to\nlarge-scale, shellular sheets ('pancakes') that are quite distinct from the\nspatially separate, small-scale clumps in non-magnetic line-driven winds. We\ndiscuss the impact of these findings for observational diagnostic studies and\nstellar evolution models of magnetic hot stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 14:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Recently, training 3D fault segmentation using sparse manual 2D\nslices is thought to yield promising results, but manual labeling has many\nfalse negative labels (abnormal annotations), which is detrimental to training\nand consequently to detection performance. Motivated to train 3D fault\nsegmentation networks under sparse 2D labels while suppressing false negative\nlabels, we analyze the training process gradient and propose the Mask Dice (MD)\nloss. Moreover, the fault is an edge feature, and current encoder-decoder\narchitectures widely used for fault detection (e.g., U-shape network) are not\nconducive to edge representation. Consequently, Fault-Net is proposed, which is\ndesigned for the characteristics of faults, employs high-resolution propagation\nfeatures, and embeds MultiScale Compression Fusion block to fuse multi-scale\ninformation, which allows the edge information to be fully preserved during\npropagation and fusion, thus enabling advanced performance via few\ncomputational resources. Experimental demonstrates that MD loss supports the\ninclusion of human experience in training and suppresses false negative labels\ntherein, enabling baseline models to improve performance and generalize to more\nsurveys.

In this\nstudy, we considered a new theoretical model of a cluster of ligand-receptor\nbonds between two soft elastic bodies, in which the rebinding rates of ligands\nto receptors are described, for the first time, by considering the deformation\nof the overall system under the influence of bond distributions.

We resolve this issue efficiently\nutilizing auto-differentiation on Tensorflow. We test our algorithm by finding\nsmooth control pulses to implement single-qubit and two-qubit gates for\nsuperconducting transmon qubits with always-on interaction, which remains a\nchallenge of quantum control in various qubit systems. Our algorithm provides a\npromising optimal quantum control approach that is friendly to complex and\noptional physical constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 14:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 04:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Non-autoregressive image captioning with continuous iterative\nrefinement, which eliminates the sequential dependence in a sentence\ngeneration, can achieve comparable performance to the autoregressive\ncounterparts with a considerable acceleration. Nevertheless, based on a\nwell-designed experiment, we empirically proved that iteration times can be\neffectively reduced when providing sufficient prior knowledge for the language\ndecoder. Towards that end, we propose a novel two-stage framework, referred to\nas Semi-Autoregressive Image Captioning (SAIC), to make a better trade-off\nbetween performance and speed. The proposed SAIC model maintains autoregressive\nproperty in global but relieves it in local.

The framework suggests five SME\ntypes based on their characteristics and specific security needs: cybersecurity\nabandoned SME, unskilled SME, expert-connected SME, capable SME, and\ncybersecurity provider SME. In addition to describing the five classes, the\nstudy explains the framework's usage in sampled SMEs. The framework proposes\nsolutions for each class to approach cybersecurity awareness and competence\nmore consistent with SME needs.

Numerous weighting schemes have been proposed. Some schemes take the\neasy-first mode, whereas some others take the hard-first one. Naturally, an\ninteresting yet realistic question is raised. Which samples should be learned\nfirst given a new learning task, easy or hard? To answer this question, both\ntheoretical analyses and experimental verification are conducted. First, a\ngeneral optimized objective function is proposed, revealing the relationship\nbetween the difficulty distribution and the difficulty-based sample weights.\nSecond, on the basis of the optimized objective function, theoretical answers\nare obtained. Besides the easy-first and hard-first modes, there are two other\npriority modes, namely, medium-first and two-ends-first. The prior mode does\nnot necessarily remain unchanged during the training process. Third, an\neffective and universal solution is proposed to select the optimal priority\nmode when there is no prior knowledge or theoretical clues. The four modes,\nnamely, easy/medium/hard/two-ends-first, can be flexibly switched in the\nproposed solution. Fourth, a wide range of experiments is conducted under\nvarious scenarios to further compare the weighting schemes in different modes.\nOn the basis of these works, reasonable and comprehensive answers are obtained.\nFactors including the distribution of samples' learning difficulties and the\nvalidation data determine which samples should be learned first in a learning\ntask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 03:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 13:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 05:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

In machine learning, the\nfamily of methods that use the 'extra' information is called hierarchical\nclassification. However, applied to audio classification, this remains\nrelatively unexplored. Here we focus on how to integrate the hierarchical\ninformation of a problem to learn embeddings representative of the hierarchical\nrelationships. Previously, triplet loss has been proposed to address this\nproblem, however it presents some issues like requiring the careful\nconstruction of the triplets, and being limited in the extent of hierarchical\ninformation it uses at each iteration. In this work we propose a rank based\nloss function that uses hierarchical information and translates this into a\nrank ordering of target distances between the examples. We show that rank based\nloss is suitable to learn hierarchical representations of the data. By testing\non unseen fine level classes we show that this method is also capable of\nlearning hierarchically correct representations of the new classes. Rank based\nloss has two promising aspects, it is generalisable to hierarchies with any\nnumber of levels, and is capable of dealing with data with incomplete\nhierarchical labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 10:32:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 17:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

An alternative approach is to solve the frequency domain Helmholtz\nequation, since it offers a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per\nfrequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz\nsolvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these\napproaches computationally infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high\nfrequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer\ninformation gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a\nbottleneck for applications like full waveform inversion where repeated\nmodeling is necessary. Therefore, recently a new approach based on the emerging\nparadigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve\nthe Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several\nchallenging associated with the conventional algorithms, including flexibility\nto model additional physics and the use of transfer learning to speed up\ncomputations. However, the approach still needs further developments to be\nfully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence\nspeed and reduced accuracy, especially in presence of sharp heterogeneities in\nthe velocity model. Therefore, with an eye on exploring how improved\nconvergence can be obtained for the PINN Helmholtz solvers, we study different\nactivation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the\nswish activation function - a variant of ReLU that has shown improved\nperformance on a number of data science problems. Through a comparative study,\nwe find that swish yields superior performance compared to the other activation\nfunctions routinely used in the PINN literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 11:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

Compared to the fourth-order GKS-based traditional\nfinite volume (FV) method, the proposed method realizes compactness effectively\nby subdividing each cell into a set of subcells or control volumes (CVs) and\nselecting only face-neighboring cells for high-order compact reconstruction.\nBecause a set of CVs share a solution polynomial, the reconstruction is more\nefficient than that for traditional FV-GKS, where each CV needs to be\nseparately reconstructed. Unlike in the single-stage third-order SCFV-GKS, both\naccuracy and efficiency are improved significantly by two-stage fourth-order\ntemporal discretization, for which only a second-order gas distribution\nfunction is needed to simplify the construction of the flux function and reduce\ncomputational costs. For viscous flows, it is not necessary to compute the\nviscous term with GKS. Compared to the fourth-stage Runge--Kutta method, one\nhalf of the stage is saved for achieving fourth-order time accuracy, which also\nhelps to improve the efficiency. Therefore, a new high-order method with\ncompactness, efficiency, and robustness is proposed by combining the SCFV\nmethod with the two-stage gas-kinetic flux. Several benchmark cases were tested\nto demonstrate the performance of the method in compressible flow simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 01:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Finally, we offer detailed\nanalysis and discussion, which should be useful for researchers aiming to\nexplore the utility of contrastive loss in NLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 16:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Rumors can notably\ncause severe damage on individuals and the society. Therefore, rumor detection\non social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. Most rumor\ndetection approaches focus on rumor feature analysis and social features, i.e.,\nmetadata in social media. Unfortunately, these features are data-specific and\nmay not always be available, e.g., when the rumor has just popped up and not\nyet propagated. In contrast, post contents (including images or videos) play an\nimportant role and can indicate the diffusion purpose of a rumor. Furthermore,\nrumor classification is also closely related to opinion mining and sentiment\nanalysis. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, exploiting images and sentiments\nis little investigated.Considering the available multimodal features from\nmicroblogs, notably, we propose in this paper an end-to-end model called\ndeepMONITOR that is based on deep neural networks and allows quite accurate\nautomated rumor verification, by utilizing all three characteristics: post\ntextual and image contents, as well as sentiment. deepMONITOR concatenates\nimage features with the joint text and sentiment features to produce a\nreliable, fused classification. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale, real-world datasets. The results show that deepMONITOR achieves a\nhigher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 07:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Nevertheless, social\ninteractions can affect private opinions and behaviours. This paper builds an\nagent-based model of interactions between consumers heterogeneous in their\nsociability, initial opinions and behaviours related to food waste and\nwillingness to consider different opinions, in order to assess how social\ninteractions can affect private behaviours. Compared to existing models of\nopinion dynamics, we innovate by including a range of ``cognitive dissonance''\nbetween stated opinions and actual behaviours that consumers are willing to\naccept before changing one of the two. We calibrate the model using\nquestionnaire data on household food waste in Italy. We find that a limited\ndegree of mixing between different socio-demographic groups, namely adult and\nyoung consumers, is enough to trigger change, but a certain openness of mind is\nrequired from more wasteful individuals. Equally, a small group of\nenvironmentally committed consumers can attract a sizeable share of the\npopulation towards low-waste behaviours if they show a certain variability of\nopinions and are willing to compromise with individuals in their close\nneighbourhood in terms of opinions. These findings can help design effective\ninterventions to promote pro-environmental behaviours, taking advantage of the\nbeneficial network effects while anticipating negative externalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

It is important to identify these\ndifferent topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the\ninsights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to\nimprove public image and reputation of the administering agency and the\nCOVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine\nlearning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an\nanalysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of\nnational public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of\na multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five\ndifferent classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT\ntopic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that\nany type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public\nopinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an\nunsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal\nthat 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics.\nSuch negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the\nPhilippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries.\nAdditionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Facebook posts by the\nsame agency -- without any humorous content -- suggest that the reactors of\nthese posts tend to react the way they do, not because of what the posts are\nabout but because of who posted them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 11:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

The description and acquisition of inputs and\noutputs (IO) of geographic models is a key issue in constructing and using\nmodel web services. These approaches for describing and acquiring the data\nformats of the IO of geographic models can be classified into two categories,\ni.e., intermediate-data-format-based and native-data-format-based. Nonetheless,\nthese two categories mainly consider the description of the IO of geographical\nmodels but relatively pay little attention to the acquisition. To address this\nissue, this paper proposes an approach for automatically parsing data formats\nof the IO utilizing the relationship between the IO and source codes. This\nproposed approach can utilize such a strict and coupling relationship and the\nexpression form of the data formats in the source codes to retrospectively\nderive the IO data format and automatically generate data format documentation.\nThe feasibility of the proposed approach has been verified via a geographical\nmodel coded in the FORTRAN language, which shows that it significantly improves\nthe efficiency of writing data format specifications and promotes sharing\ngeographic models as model web services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 13:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}
