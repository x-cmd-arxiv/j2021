The process is assumed to be\ndeveloped along one direction, across two homogeneous and isotropic materials.\nAnalytical and numerical solutions are obtained under continuity conditions at\nthe interface, that is a perfect assembly. The lateral side is assumed to be\nisolated and a constant thermal source is located at the left-boundary while\nthe right-end stays free allowing the heat to transfer to the surrounding fluid\nby a convective process. The differences between the analytic solution and\ntemperature measurements at any point on the right would indicate the presence\nof discontinuities. The greater these differences, the greater the\ndiscontinuity in the interface due to thermal resistances, providing a measure\nof its propagation from the interface and they could be modeled as temperature\nperturbations. The problem of interest may be described by a parabolic equation\nwith initial, interface and boundary conditions, where the thermal properties,\nthe conductivity and diffusivity coefficients, are piecewise constant\nfunctions. The analytic solution is derived by using Fourier methods. Special\nattention is given to the Sturm-Liouville problem that arises when deriving the\nsolution, since a complicated eigenvalue equation must to be solved.

Although the ultimate goal of URLs is similar across various\nscenarios, the related algorithms differ widely in different tasks because they\nwere separately designed according to a specific URL task or data. For example,\ndimension reduction methods, t-SNE, and UMAP, optimize pair-wise data\nrelationships by preserving the global geometric structure, while\nself-supervised learning, SimCLR, and BYOL, focus on mining the local\nstatistics of instances under specific augmentations. From a general\nperspective, we summarize and propose a unified similarity-based URL framework,\nGenURL, which can adapt to various URL tasks smoothly and efficiently. Based on\nthe manifold assumption, we regard URL tasks as different implicit constraints\non the data geometric structure or content that help to seek an optimal\nlow-dimensional representation for the high-dimensional data. Therefore, our\nmethod has two key steps to learning task-agnostic representation in URL: (1)\ndata structural modeling and (2) low-dimensional transformation. Specifically,\n(1) provides a simple yet effective graph-based submodule to model data\nstructures adaptively with predefined or constructed graphs; and based on\ndata-specific pretext tasks, (2) learns compact low-dimensional embeddings.\nMoreover, (1) and (2) are successfully connected and benefit mutually through\nour novel objective function.

So my overarching main question is: can DES be associated to\nthe local gauge symmetries, acting solely on subsystems? In local gauge\ntheories, any quantity with physical significance must be a gauge-invariant\nquantity. To attack the question of DES from this gauge-invariant angle, we\nrequire a split of the state into its physical and its representational\ncontent: a split that is relative to a representational convention, or a\ngauge-fixing.

To address this issue, previous work has proposed to\ncontrastively learn the world model, but the performance tends to be inferior\nin the absence of distractions. In this paper, we seek to enhance robustness to\ndistractions for MBRL agents.

We propose Geometric Sensitivity\nDecomposition (GSD) which decomposes the norm of a sample feature embedding and\nthe angular similarity to a target classifier into an instance-dependent and an\ninstance-independent component. The instance-dependent component captures the\nsensitive information about changes in the input while the instance-independent\ncomponent represents the insensitive information serving solely to minimize the\nloss on the training dataset.

A concrete example,\nstrictly obeying the identical energy and momentum conservation used to derive\nthe Betz's law, is given that violates Betz's law by achieving our higher 2/3\nbound.

The transition level (which we call the jovicline) is\nevident in the MWR 11.5 cm channel, which samples the 5-14 bar range when using\nthe limb-darkening at all emission angles. The transition is located between 4\nand 10 bars, and implies that belts change with depth from being\nNH$_3$-depleted to NH$_3$-enriched, or from physically-warm to physically-cool,\nor more likely a combination of both. The change in character occurs near the\nstatically stable layer associated with water condensation. The implications of\nthe transition are discussed in terms of ammonia redistribution via meridional\ncirculation cells with opposing flows above and below the water condensation\nlayer, and in terms of the `mushball' precipitation model, which predicts\nsteeper vertical ammonia gradients in the belts versus the zones. We show via\nthe moist thermal wind equation that both the temperature and ammonia\ninterpretations can lead to vertical shear on the zonal winds, but the shear is\n$\\sim50\\times$ weaker if only NH$_3$ gradients are considered.

Due to these channels' distinct characteristic\ntimescales (rCCSNe: prompt, NSMs: delayed), measuring $r$-process enrichment in\ngalaxies of similar mass, but differing star-formation durations might prove\ninformative. Two recently discovered disrupted dwarfs in the Milky Way's\nstellar halo, Kraken and \\textit{Gaia}-Sausage Enceladus (GSE), afford\nprecisely this opportunity: both have $M_{\\star}\\approx10^{8}M_{\\rm{\\odot}}$,\nbut differing star-formation durations of ${\\approx}2$ Gyrs and ${\\approx}3.6$\nGyrs. Here we present $R\\approx50,000$ Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for 31 stars\nfrom these systems, detecting the $r$-process element Eu in all stars.

With simple\nmodels we argue NSM enrichment must be delayed by $500-1000$ Myrs to produce\nthis difference. rCCSNe must also contribute, especially at early epochs,\notherwise stars formed during the delay period would be Eu-free. In this\npicture, rCCSNe account for $\\approx50\\%$ of the Eu in Kraken, $\\approx25\\%$ in\nGSE, and $\\approx15\\%$ in dwarfs with extended star-formation durations like\nSagittarius. The inferred delay time for NSM enrichment is $10-100\\times$\nlonger than merger delay times from stellar population synthesis -- this is not\nnecessarily surprising because the enrichment delay includes time taken for NSM\nejecta to be incorporated into subsequent generations of stars.

According to Hawking's original\nargument, the radiation is thermal and its entropy thus increases monotonically\nas the black hole evaporates. Conversely, due to the reversibility of time\nevolution according to quantum theory, the radiation entropy should start to\ndecrease after a certain time, as predicted by the Page curve. This decrease\nhas been confirmed by new calculations based on the replica trick, which also\nexhibit its geometrical origin: spacetime wormholes that form between the\nreplicas. Here we analyse the discrepancy between these and Hawking's original\nconclusions from a quantum information theory viewpoint, using in particular\nthe quantum de Finetti theorem. The theorem implies the existence of extra\ninformation, $W$, which is neither part of the black hole nor the radiation,\nbut plays the role of a reference. The entropy obtained via the replica trick\ncan then be identified to be the entropy $S(R|W)$ of the radiation conditioned\non the reference $W$, whereas Hawking's original result corresponds to the\nnon-conditional entropy $S(R)$. The entropy $S(R|W)$, which mathematically is\nan ensemble average, gains an operational meaning in an experiment with $N$\nindependently prepared black holes: For large $N$, it equals the normalised\nentropy of their joint radiation, $S(R_1 \\cdots R_N)/N$. The discrepancy\nbetween this entropy and $S(R)$ implies that the black holes are correlated.\nThe replica wormholes may thus be interpreted as the geometrical representation\nof this correlation.

A distribution is compatible with a given causal structure if\nit can be realized by a process respecting these dependencies. Deciding whether\na distribution is compatible with a structure is a practically and\nfundamentally relevant, yet very difficult problem. Only recently has a general\nclass of algorithms been proposed: These so-called inflation techniques\nassociate to any causal structure a hierarchy of increasingly strict\ncompatibility tests, where each test can be formulated as a computationally\nefficient convex optimization problem. Remarkably, it has been shown that in\nthe classical case, this hierarchy is complete in the sense that each\nnon-compatible distribution will be detected at some level of the hierarchy. An\ninflation hierarchy has also been formulated for causal structures that allow\nfor the observed classical random variables to arise from measurements on\nquantum states - however, no proof of completeness of this quantum inflation\nhierarchy has been supplied. In this paper, we construct a first version of the\nquantum inflation hierarchy that is provably convergent. From a technical point\nof view, convergence proofs are built on de Finetti Theorems, which show that\ncertain symmetries (which can be imposed in convex optimization problems) imply\nindependence of random variables (which is not directly a convex constraint).

The answer to the second question has long been expected\nto be Page time, a quantity associated with the lifetime of the black hole. We\nanswer the first by evaluating an infinite number of `ladder of ladders'\nFeynman diagrams to all orders in $M_{Pl}/M_{BH}$.

Since an extensional flow has an unstable eigendirection, a drop\nlocated at the flow stagnation point will have a tendency to escape. This\nunstable dynamics can however be stabilised using, e.g., a modulation of the\nrotation rates of the cylinders. Here we use Reinforcement Learning, a branch\nof Machine Learning devoted to the optimal selection of actions based on\ncumulative rewards, in order to devise a stabilisation algorithm for the\nfour-roll mill flow. The flow is modelled as the linear superposition of four\ntwo-dimensional rotlets and the drop is treated as a rigid spherical particle\nsmaller than all other length scales in the problem. Unlike previous attempts\nto devise control, we take a probabilistic approach whereby speed adjustments\nare drawn from a probability density function whose shape is improved over time\nvia a form of gradient ascent know as Actor-Critic method. With enough\ntraining, our algorithm is able to precisely control the drop and keep it close\nto the stagnation point for as long as needed. We explore the impact of the\nphysical and learning parameters on the effectiveness of the control and\ndemonstrate the robustness of the algorithm against thermal noise.

On segmented telescopes in particular, aberrations\ninduced by cophasing errors lead to a light leakage through the coronagraph,\ndeteriorating the imaging performance. These need to be limited in order to\nfacilitate the direct imaging of exoEarths. Aims: We perform a laboratory\nvalidation of an analytical tolerancing model that allows us to determine\nwavefront error requirements in the $10^{-6} - 10^{-8}$ contrast regime, for a\nsegmented pupil with a classical Lyot coronagraph. We intend to compare the\nresults to simulations, and we aim to establish an error budget for the\nsegmented mirror on the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes\n(HiCAT) testbed. Methods: We use the Pair-based Analytical model for Segmented\nTelescope Imaging from Space (PASTIS) to measure a contrast influence matrix of\na real high contrast instrument, and use an analytical model inversion to\ncalculate per-segment wavefront error tolerances. We validate these tolerances\non the HiCAT testbed by measuring the contrast response of segmented mirror\nstates that follow these requirements. Results: The experimentally measured\noptical influence matrix is successfully measured on the HiCAT testbed, and we\nderive individual segment tolerances from it that correctly yield the targeted\ncontrast levels. Further, the analytical expressions that predict a contrast\nmean and variance from a given segment covariance matrix are confirmed\nexperimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The entanglement can arise only if the force between\nthe two spatially superposed masses is occurring via the exchange of a\nmediating virtual graviton. In this paper, we examine a possible improvement of\nthe QGEM setup by introducing a third mass with an embedded qubit, so that\nthere are now 3 qubits to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.\nWe compare the entanglement generation for different experimental setups with 2\nand 3 qubits and find that a 3-qubit setup where the superpositions are\nparallel to each other leads to the highest rate of entanglement generation\nwithin $\\tau = 5 $ s.

Similar to 2D, however, the saturated\nturbulent energy levels and the integral scale follow clear power-laws that\ndepend on the thermal diffusivity, temperature gradient, and buoyancy\nfrequency.

In this paper, the approach based on the Koopman\noperator named deep direct Koopman (DDK) is proposed to identify the model of\nthe autonomous vehicle and the identified model is a linear time-invariant\n(LTI) version, which is convenient for motion planning and controller design.\nIn the approach, the Koopman eigenvalues and system matrix are considered as\ntrainable tensors with the original states of the autonomous vehicle being\nconcatenated to a part of the Koopman eigenfunctions so that a physically\ninterpretable subsystem can be extracted from the identified latent dynamics.\nSubsequently, the process of the identification model is trained under the\nproposed method based on the dataset which consists of about 60km of data\ncollected with a real electric SUV while the effectiveness of the identified\nmodel is validated.

Methods: The approach alternates\nbetween improving the SP, using bias-accelerated subset selection, and\nimproving parameters of the VN, using ADAM with monotonicity verification. The\nalgorithm learns an effective pair: an SP that captures fewer k-space samples\ngenerating undersampling artifacts that are removed by the VN reconstruction.\nThe proposed approach was tested for stability and convergence, considering\ndifferent initial SPs. The quality of the VNs and SPs was compared against\nother approaches, including joint learning methods and VN learning with fixed\nvariable density Poisson-disc SPs, using two different datasets and different\nacceleration factors (AF).

Protecting its emergent spatiotemporal order\nnecessitates a mechanism that hinders the spreading of defects, such as\nlocalization of domain walls in disordered quantum spin chains. In this work,\nwe establish the effectiveness of a different mechanism arising in clean spin\nchains: the confinement of domain walls into ``mesonic'' bound states. We\nconsider translationally invariant quantum Ising chains periodically kicked at\narbitrary frequency, and discuss two possible routes to domain-wall\nconfinement: longitudinal fields and interactions beyond nearest neighbors. We\nstudy the impact of confinement on the order parameter evolution by\nconstructing domain-wall-conserving effective Hamiltonians and analyzing the\nresulting dynamics of domain walls. On the one hand, we show that for arbitrary\ndriving frequency the symmetry-breaking-induced confining potential gets\neffectively averaged out by the drive, leading to deconfined dynamics. On the\nother hand, we rigorously prove that increasing the range $R$ of spin-spin\ninteractions $J_{i,j}$ beyond nearest neighbors enhances the order-parameter\nlifetime \\textit{exponentially} in $R$. Our theory predictions are corroborated\nby a combination of exact and matrix-product-state simulations for finite and\ninfinite chains, respectively. The long-lived stability of spatiotemporal order\nidentified in this work does not rely on Floquet prethermalization nor on\neigenstate order, but rather on the nonperturbative origin of vacuum-decay\nprocesses.

Their stature as new\nhadron states has often been challenged by proposals that the peaks arise from\ntriangle singularities instead, because they appear in three-body reactions and\noften satisfy the special kinematic conditions of the Coleman-Norton theorem.\nTo experimentally decide, we should like to resort to different reactions\nerasing the kinematic coincidence, and see whether each peak survives. We\nobserve that the most universal \"eraser\" is the medium created in Heavy Ion\nCollisions, because its high temperature often affects the masses and widths of\nthe particles participating in the reaction: if additionally the triangle\nreaction is completed during the lifetime of the fireball, our computations in\nthermal field theory show that the triangle singularities do not survive the\nhot hadron phase (much less the hotter quark-gluon plasma).

This article aims to shed some light on these issues by\nexploring new methodology for subgroup analysis in image-based disease\ndetection models. We utilize two publicly available chest X-ray datasets,\nCheXpert and MIMIC-CXR, to study performance disparities across race and\nbiological sex in deep learning models. We explore test set resampling,\ntransfer learning, multitask learning, and model inspection to assess the\nrelationship between the encoding of protected characteristics and disease\ndetection performance across subgroups. We confirm subgroup disparities in\nterms of shifted true and false positive rates which are partially removed\nafter correcting for population and prevalence shifts in the test sets. We\nfurther find a previously used transfer learning method to be insufficient for\nestablishing whether specific patient information is used for making\npredictions. The proposed combination of test-set resampling, multitask\nlearning, and model inspection reveals valuable new insights about the way\nprotected characteristics are encoded in the feature representations of deep\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 08:56:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 15:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The nature of anisotropy and geometry of the magnetic\nfluctuations play a fundamental role in dissipation processes and in the\ntransport of energetic particles in space. Using PSP data, we present\nmeasurements of geometry and anisotropy of the inner heliosphere magnetic\nfluctuations, from fluid to kinetic scales. The results are surprising and\ndifferent from 1 au observations. We find that fluctuations evolve\ncharacteristically with size scale. However, unlike 1 au solar wind, at the\nouter scale, the fluctuations are dominated by wavevectors quasi-parallel to\nthe local magnetic field. In the inertial range, average wave vectors become\nless field-aligned, but still remain more field aligned than near-Earth solar\nwind. In the dissipation range, the wavevectors become almost perpendicular to\nthe local magnetic field in the dissipation range, to a much higher degree than\nthose indicated by 1 au observations. We propose that this reduced degree of\nanisotropy in the outer scale and inertial range is due to the nature of\nlarge-scale forcing outside the solar corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

However, high-quality demonstrations from\nhuman experts can be expensive to obtain in large numbers. On the other hand,\nit is often much easier to obtain large quantities of suboptimal or\ntask-agnostic trajectories, which are not useful for direct imitation, but can\nnevertheless provide insight into the dynamical structure of the environment,\nshowing what could be done in the environment even if not what should be done.\nWe ask the question, is it possible to utilize such suboptimal offline datasets\nto facilitate provably improved downstream imitation learning? In this work, we\nanswer this question affirmatively and present training objectives that use\noffline datasets to learn a factored transition model whose structure enables\nthe extraction of a latent action space. Our theoretical analysis shows that\nthe learned latent action space can boost the sample-efficiency of downstream\nimitation learning, effectively reducing the need for large near-optimal expert\ndatasets through the use of auxiliary non-expert data. To learn the latent\naction space in practice, we propose TRAIL (Transition-Reparametrized Actions\nfor Imitation Learning), an algorithm that learns an energy-based transition\nmodel contrastively, and uses the transition model to reparametrize the action\nspace for sample-efficient imitation learning.

Recently proposed contrastive learning heavily\nrelies on data augmentation, especially positive data augmentation. However,\ngenerating clinically-accurate data augmentations for medical images is\nextremely difficult because the common data augmentation methods in computer\nvision, such as sharp, blur, and crop operations, can severely alter the\nclinical settings of medical images. In this paper, we proposed a novel and\nsimple data augmentation method based on patient metadata and supervised\nknowledge to create clinically accurate positive and negative augmentations for\nchest X-rays. We introduce an end-to-end framework, SCALP, which extends the\nself-supervised contrastive approach to a supervised setting.

In addition,\nit uses ResNet-50 along with the triplet-attention mechanism to identify\ncardiopulmonary diseases, and Grad-CAM++ to highlight the abnormal regions. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that SCALP outperforms existing baselines\nwith significant margins in both classification and localization tasks.\nSpecifically, the average classification AUCs improve from 82.8% (SOTA using\nDenseNet-121) to 83.9% (SCALP using ResNet-50), while the localization results\nimprove on average by 3.7% over different IoU thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 21:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

In this\narticle, we resolve this conundrum by presenting a universal theory of averaged\nlight scattering of randomly oriented objects. Specifically, we derive formulas\nof orientation-and-polarization-averaged absorption cross section, scattering\ncross section and asymmetry parameter, for single or collection of objects of\narbitrary shape, that can be solved by any electromagnetic scattering method.\nThese three parameters can be directly integrated into traditional unpolarized\nradiative energy transfer modelling, enabling a practical tool to predict\nmultiple scattering and light transport in disordered nanostructured materials.\nNotably, the formulas of average light scattering can be derived under the\nprinciples of fluctuational electrodynamics, allowing analogous mathematical\ntreatment to the methods used in thermal radiation, non-equilibrium\nelectromagnetic forces, and other associated phenomena.

The input here is a\nhypergraph $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative hyperedge costs. A subset $F$ of\nhyperedges is a $k$-cut-set if the number of connected components in $G - F$ is\nat least $k$ and it is a minimum $k$-cut-set if it has the least cost among all\n$k$-cut-sets. For fixed $k$, we call the problem of finding a minimum\n$k$-cut-set as Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and the problem of enumerating all minimum\n$k$-cut-sets as Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut. The special cases of\nHypergraph-$k$-Cut and Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut restricted to graph inputs are\nwell-known to be solvable in (randomized as well as deterministic) polynomial\ntime. In contrast, it is only recently that polynomial-time algorithms for\nHypergraph-$k$-Cut were developed. The randomized polynomial-time algorithm for\nHypergraph-$k$-Cut that was designed in 2018 (Chandrasekaran, Xu, and Yu, SODA\n2018) showed that the number of minimum $k$-cut-sets in a hypergraph is\n$O(n^{2k-2})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input hypergraph, and\nthat they can all be enumerated in randomized polynomial time, thus resolving\nEnum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut in randomized polynomial time. A deterministic\npolynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut was subsequently designed in\n2020 (Chandrasekaran and Chekuri, FOCS 2020), but it is not guaranteed to\nenumerate all minimum $k$-cut-sets. In this work, we give the first\ndeterministic polynomial-time algorithm to solve Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut (this\nis non-trivial even for $k = 2$). Our algorithms are based on new structural\nresults that allow for efficient recovery of all minimum $k$-cut-sets by\nsolving minimum $(S,T)$-terminal cuts.

One issue with methods\nlike Q-Learning is that the value update introduces bias when predicting the TD\ntarget of a unfamiliar state. Estimation noise becomes a bias after the max\noperator in the policy improvement step, and carries over to value estimations\nof other states, causing Q-Learning to overestimate the Q value. Algorithms\nlike Soft Q-Learning (SQL) introduce the notion of a soft-greedy policy, which\nreduces the estimation bias via soft updates in early stages of training.\nHowever, the inverse temperature $\\beta$ that controls the softness of an\nupdate is usually set by a hand-designed heuristic, which can be inaccurate at\ncapturing the uncertainty in the target estimate.

To this end, we\nintroduce Targeted Neural Dynamical Modeling (TNDM), a nonlinear state-space\nmodel that jointly models the neural activity and external behavioural\nvariables. TNDM decomposes neural dynamics into behaviourally relevant and\nbehaviourally irrelevant dynamics; the relevant dynamics are used to\nreconstruct the behaviour through a flexible linear decoder and both sets of\ndynamics are used to reconstruct the neural activity through a linear decoder\nwith no time lag.

Adversarial training, which augments data with the worst-case\nadversarial examples, has been widely demonstrated to improve model's\nrobustness against adversarial attacks and generalization ability. However,\nwhile the previous adversarial training generally focuses on protecting GNNs\nfrom spiteful attacks, it remains unclear how the adversarial training could\nimprove the generalization abilities of GNNs in the graph analytics problem. In\nthis paper, we investigate GNNs from the lens of weight and feature loss\nlandscapes, i.e., the loss changes with respect to model weights and node\nfeatures, respectively. We draw the conclusion that GNNs are prone to falling\ninto sharp local minima in these two loss landscapes, where GNNs possess poor\ngeneralization performances. To tackle this problem, we construct the\nco-adversarial perturbation (CAP) optimization problem in terms of weights and\nfeatures, and design the alternating adversarial perturbation algorithm to\nflatten the weight and feature loss landscapes alternately. Furthermore, we\ndivide the training process into two stages: one conducting the standard\ncross-entropy minimization to ensure the quick convergence of GNN models, the\nother applying our alternating adversarial training to avoid falling into\nlocally sharp minima. The extensive experiments demonstrate our CAP can\ngenerally improve the generalization performance of GNNs on a variety of\nbenchmark graph datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 02:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

A fundamental problem for graph representation\nlearning is how to effectively learn representations without human labeling,\nwhich is usually costly and time-consuming. Graph contrastive learning (GCL)\naddresses this problem by pulling the positive node pairs (or similar nodes)\ncloser while pushing the negative node pairs (or dissimilar nodes) apart in the\nrepresentation space.

The object has a common true quality, good or bad, which is ex-ante\nunknown to everyone. Each agent holds an informative, yet noisy, private signal\nabout the quality. To make a correct allocation decision the planner attempts\nto learn the object quality by truthfully eliciting agents' signals.

Recent works on robust model compression address these\nchallenges by combining model compression techniques with adversarial training.\nBut these methods are unable to improve throughput (frames-per-second) on\nreal-life hardware while simultaneously preserving robustness to adversarial\nperturbations. To overcome this problem, we propose the method of Generalized\nDepthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution -- an efficient, universal,\npost-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution.

For example, if a system waits X min for an event to occur, then it\nautomatically learns what would have happened if it waited <X min, because time\nhas a cumulative property. This feedback tells us about alternative decisions,\nand can be used to improve the system policy. However, leveraging implicit\nfeedback is difficult because it tends to be one-sided or incomplete, and may\ndepend on the outcome of the event. As a result, existing practices for using\nfeedback, such as simply incorporating it into a data-driven model, suffer from\nbias.\n  We develop a methodology, called Sayer, that leverages implicit feedback to\nevaluate and train new system policies. Sayer builds on two ideas from\nreinforcement learning -- randomized exploration and unbiased counterfactual\nestimators -- to leverage data collected by an existing policy to estimate the\nperformance of new candidate policies, without actually deploying those\npolicies. Sayer uses implicit exploration and implicit data augmentation to\ngenerate implicit feedback in an unbiased form, which is then used by an\nimplicit counterfactual estimator to evaluate and train new policies. The key\nidea underlying these techniques is to assign implicit probabilities to\ndecisions that are not actually taken but whose feedback can be inferred; these\nprobabilities are carefully calculated to ensure statistical unbiasedness. We\napply Sayer to two production scenarios in Azure, and show that it can evaluate\narbitrary policies accurately, and train new policies that outperform the\nproduction policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 04:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

A backdoor is often embedded in the target DNNs through injecting a\nbackdoor trigger into training examples, which can cause the target DNNs\nmisclassify an input attached with the backdoor trigger. Existing backdoor\ndetection methods often require the access to the original poisoned training\ndata, the parameters of the target DNNs, or the predictive confidence for each\ngiven input, which are impractical in many real-world applications, e.g.,\non-device deployed DNNs. We address the black-box hard-label backdoor detection\nproblem where the DNN is fully black-box and only its final output label is\naccessible. We approach this problem from the optimization perspective and show\nthat the objective of backdoor detection is bounded by an adversarial\nobjective. Further theoretical and empirical studies reveal that this\nadversarial objective leads to a solution with highly skewed distribution; a\nsingularity is often observed in the adversarial map of a backdoor-infected\nexample, which we call the adversarial singularity phenomenon. Based on this\nobservation, we propose the adversarial extreme value analysis(AEVA) to detect\nbackdoors in black-box neural networks. AEVA is based on an extreme value\nanalysis of the adversarial map, computed from the monte-carlo gradient\nestimation. Evidenced by extensive experiments across multiple popular tasks\nand backdoor attacks, our approach is shown effective in detecting backdoor\nattacks under the black-box hard-label scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 04:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:57:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 23:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

To understand what controls temporal and spatial\ndistributions of ring star formation, we run semi-global, hydrodynamic\nsimulations of nuclear rings subject to time-varying and/or asymmetric mass\ninflow rates. These controlled variations in the inflow lead to variations in\nthe star formation, while the ring orbital period ($18\\,{\\rm Myr}$) and radius\n($600\\,{\\rm pc}$) remain approximately constant.

In addition, it offers a clear calculational advantage with respect to\nso called `gauge fixed' treatments that distinguish tangential and normal\nmodes, as it emphasizes the symmetries of the geometric models that describe\nthe brane dynamics. We restrict our attention to a brane action that depends at\nmost on first derivatives of the embedding functions of the worldvolume spanned\nby the brane in its evolution.

A literature search was performed for\nrelevant studies published from 1 January 2020 till 27 March 2021. Out of 4050\nresearch papers available in reputed publishers, a full-text review of 440\narticles was done based on the keywords of AI, COVID-19, ML, forecasting, DL,\nX-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT). Finally, 52 articles were included in the\nresult synthesis of this paper. As part of the review, different ML regression\nmethods were reviewed first in predicting the number of confirmed and death\ncases. Secondly, a comprehensive survey was carried out on the use of ML in\nclassifying COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, different datasets on medical imaging\nwere compared in terms of the number of images, number of positive samples and\nnumber of classes in the datasets. The different stages of the diagnosis,\nincluding preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction were also\nreviewed. Fourthly, the performance results of different research papers were\ncompared to evaluate the effectiveness of DL methods on different datasets.\nResults: Results show that residual neural network (ResNet-18) and densely\nconnected convolutional network (DenseNet 169) exhibit excellent classification\naccuracy for X-ray images, while DenseNet-201 has the maximum accuracy in\nclassifying CT scan images. This indicates that ML and DL are useful tools in\nassisting researchers and medical professionals in predicting, screening and\ndetecting COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 06:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

With the\nrise of IoT technology, which is one of the most used technologies, billions of\nIoT devices are interconnected over the Internet. However, DoS/DDoS attacks are\nthe most frequent and perilous threat to this growing technology. New types of\nDDoS attacks are highly advanced and complicated, and it is almost impossible\nto detect or mitigate by the existing intrusion detection systems and\ntraditional methods. Fortunately, Big Data, Data mining, and Machine Learning\ntechnologies make it possible to detect DDoS traffic effectively. This paper\nsuggests a DDoS detection model based on data mining and machine learning\ntechniques. For writing this paper, the latest available Dataset, CICDDoS2019,\nexperimented with the most popular machine learning algorithms and specified\nthe most correlated features with predicted classes are being used. It is\ndiscovered that AdaBoost and XGBoost were extraordinarily accurate and\ncorrectly predicted the type of network traffic with 100% accuracy. Future\nresearch can be extended by enhancing the model for multiclassification of\ndifferent DDoS attack types and testing hybrid algorithms and newer datasets on\nthis model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 06:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Feature fusion could make similarity computing more efficient by\nincluding target object information. However, most existing LiDAR-based\napproaches directly use the extracted point cloud feature to compute similarity\nwhile ignoring the attention changes of object regions during tracking. In this\npaper, we propose a feature fusion network based on transformer architecture.\nBenefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the transformer encoder captures\nthe inter- and intra- relations among different regions of the point cloud. By\nusing cross-attention, the transformer decoder fuses features and includes more\ntarget cues into the current point cloud feature to compute the region\nattentions, which makes the similarity computing more efficient.

The significance to the \"old\" and new results collected\nin this review is enhanced by the fact that the systems of coupled equations\nfor two- and multicomponent order parameters, addressed in the article, apply\nequally well to modeling thermal convection, multimode light propagation in\nnonlinear optics, and binary Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 08:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-exit-based\nfederated edge learning (ME-FEEL) framework, where the deep model can be\ndivided into several sub-models with different depths and output prediction\nfrom the exit in the corresponding sub-model. In this way, the devices with\ninsufficient computational power can choose the earlier exits and avoid\ntraining the complete model, which can help reduce computational latency and\nenable devices to participate into aggregation as much as possible within a\nlatency threshold.

However, it is costly to perform data annotation that\nprovides ground truth labels for training the supervised algorithms, and the\nhigh variance of data that comes from different domains tends to severely\ndegrade system performance over cross-site or cross-modality datasets. To\nmitigate this problem, a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method\nnamed dispensed Transformer network (DTNet) is introduced in this paper. Our\nnovel DTNet contains three modules. First, a dispensed residual transformer\nblock is designed, which realizes global attention by dispensed interleaving\noperation and deals with the excessive computational cost and GPU memory usage\nof the Transformer. Second, a multi-scale consistency regularization is\nproposed to alleviate the loss of details in the low-resolution output for\nbetter feature alignment. Finally, a feature ranking discriminator is\nintroduced to automatically assign different weights to domain-gap features to\nlessen the feature distribution distance, reducing the performance shift of two\ndomains. The proposed method is evaluated on large fluorescein angiography (FA)\nretinal nonperfusion (RNP) cross-site dataset with 676 images and a wide used\ncross-modality dataset from the MM-WHS challenge.

To ensure completeness, financial\nregulators spend a huge amount of time for carefully checking every financial\ndocument based on the relevant content requirements, which prescribe the\ninformation types to be included in financial documents (e.g., the description\nof shares' issue conditions). Although several techniques have been proposed to\nautomatically detect certain types of information in documents in various\napplication domains, they provide limited support to help regulators\nautomatically identify the text chunks related to financial information types,\ndue to the complexity of financial documents and the diversity of the sentences\ncharacterizing an information type. In this paper, we propose FITI, an\nartificial intelligence (AI)-based method for tracing content requirements in\nfinancial documents. Given a new financial document, FITI selects a set of\ncandidate sentences for efficient information type identification. Then, FITI\nuses a combination of rule-based and data-centric approaches, by leveraging\ninformation retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques that analyze\nthe words, sentences, and contexts related to an information type, to rank\ncandidate sentences. Finally, using a list of indicator phrases related to each\ninformation type, a heuristic-based selector, which considers both the sentence\nranking and the domain-specific phrases, determines a list of sentences\ncorresponding to each information type. We evaluated FITI by assessing its\neffectiveness in tracing financial content requirements in 100 financial\ndocuments. Experimental results show that FITI provides accurate identification\nwith average precision and recall values of 0.824 and 0.646, respectively.\nFurthermore, FITI can detect about 80% of missing information types in\nfinancial documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 09:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

These two classifications of\nbright boulders have different size distributions and spectral trends. In this\nstudy, we measured the spectra of 79 bright boulders and investigated their\ndetailed spectral properties. Analyses obtained a number of important results.\nFirst, S-type bright boulders on Ryugu have spectra that are similar to those\nfound for two different ordinary chondrites with different initial spectra that\nhave been experimentally space weathered the same way. This suggests that there\nmay be two populations of S-type bright boulders on Ryugu, perhaps originating\nfrom two different impactors that hit its parent body. Second, the model\nspace-weathering ages of meter-size S-type bright boulders, based on spectral\nchange rates derived in previous experimentally irradiated ordinary chondrites,\nare 0.1-1 Myr, which is consistent with the crater retention age (<Myr) of the\n~1-m deep surface layer on Ryugu. This agreement strongly suggests that the\nRyugu surface is extremely young, implying that the samples acquired from the\nRyugu surface should be fresh. Third, the lack of a serpentine absorption in\nthe S-type clast embedded in one of the large brecciated boulders indicates\nthat fragmentation and cementation that created the breccias occurred after the\ntermination of aqueous alteration. Fourth, C-type bright boulders exhibit a\ncontinuous spectral trend similar to the heating track of low-albedo\ncarbonaceous chondrites, such as CM and CI.

The low and room\n($T$=300 K) temperature RS spectra consist of six Raman peaks identified with\nthe help of Density Fuctional Theory (DFT) calculations: A$^1_{\\textrm{g}}$,\nA$^2_{\\textrm{g}}$, A$^3_{\\textrm{g}}$, A$^4_{\\textrm{g}}$,\nB$^1_{\\textrm{1g}}$, and B$^2_{\\textrm{1g}}$, which polarization properties are\nstudied under four different excitation energies.

The\nsimultaneous observations with NuSTAR in 2017 provide a broad-band look\nencompassing NUV, FUV, soft and hard X-rays. Captured in three different\nbroadband spectral states in three observations, the X-ray spectrum is found to\nbe the hardest during 2018, while the high-energy-end of the simultaneous\noptical-FUV spectrum shows a steepening that is modeled with a broken power-law\nspectrum. The spectral energy distribution (SED) in 2017 shows a relatively\nflatter optical-FUV and soft X-ray spectra, implying an additional emission\ncomponent. The 2020 optical-FUV spectrum is harder than in 2017 and 2018, with\nan extremely soft X-ray spectrum and a hardening above $\\sim$1 GeV, similar to\nthe SEDs of High-energy-peaked BL Lac objects (HBL), thereby establishing that\nthis additional emission component has HBL-like properties.

However, the\nadoption of UAV-assisted applications will strongly rely on the provision of\nreliable systems that allow managing UAV operations at high levels of safety\nand security. Recently, the concept of UAV traffic management (UTM) has been\nintroduced to support safe, efficient, and fair access to low-altitude airspace\nfor commercial UAVs. A UTM system identifies multiple cooperating parties with\ndifferent roles and levels of authority to provide real-time services to\nairspace users. However, current UTM systems are centralized and lack a clear\ndefinition of protocols that govern a secure interaction between authorities,\nservice providers, and end-users. The lack of such protocols renders the UTM\nsystem unscalable and prone to various cyber attacks. Another limitation of the\ncurrently proposed UTM architecture is the absence of an efficient mechanism to\nenforce airspace rules and regulations. To address this issue, we propose a\ndecentralized UTM protocol that controls access to airspace while ensuring high\nlevels of integrity, availability, and confidentiality of airspace operations.\nTo achieve this, we exploit key features of the blockchain and smart contract\ntechnologies. In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) mechanism to\nseamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern the UAV\noperations. The solution is implemented on top of the Etheruem platform and\nverified using four different smart contract verification tools. We also\nprovided a security and cost analysis of our solution. For reproducibility, we\nmade our implementation publicly available on Github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 09:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Speckles are due to a combination of\nfast, slow and static wavefront aberrations introduced by atmospheric\nturbulence and instrument optics. While wavefront control techniques developed\nover the last decade have shown promise in minimizing fast atmospheric\nresiduals, slow and static aberrations such as non-common path aberrations\n(NCPAs) remain a key limiting factor for exoplanet detection. NCPA are not seen\nby the wavefront sensor (WFS) of the adaptive optics (AO) loop, hence the\ndifficulty in correcting them. We propose to improve the identification and\nrejection of those aberrations. The algorithm DrWHO, performs frequent\ncompensation of static and quasi-static aberrations to boost image contrast. By\nchanging the WFS reference at every iteration of the algorithm, DrWHO changes\nthe AO point of convergence to lead it towards a compensation of the static and\nslow aberrations. References are calculated using an iterative lucky-imaging\napproach, where each iteration updates the WFS reference, ultimately favoring\nhigh-quality focal plane images. We validate this concept through numerical\nsimulations and on-sky testing on the SCExAO instrument at the 8.2-m Subaru\ntelescope. Simulations show a rapid convergence towards the correction of 82%\nof the NCPAs. On-sky tests are performed over a 10-minute run in the visible\n(750 nm). We introduce a flux concentration (FC) metric to quantify the point\nspread function (PSF) quality and measure a 15.7% improvement. The DrWHO\nalgorithm is a robust focal-plane wavefront sensing calibration method that has\nbeen successfully demonstrated on sky. It does not rely on a model nor requires\nwavefront sensor calibration or linearity. It is compatible with different\nwavefront control methods, and can be further optimized for speed and\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 10:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

We present experimental results showing that even in\na model-free setup and with a simple reactive control architecture, the learned\npolicies can generate realistic and energy-efficient locomotion gaits for a\nbipedal and a quadrupedal robot.

In other words, there is no distinction between\nobjective and subjective probability.

However, there\nremain two limitations of previous studies. First, with the continuation of\ntime, the prediction error at each time step increases significantly, causing\nthe final displacement error to be impossible to ignore. Second, the prediction\nresults of multiple pedestrians might be impractical in the prediction horizon,\ni.e., the predicted trajectories might collide with each other. To overcome\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel trajectory prediction method\ncalled CSR, which consists of a cascaded conditional variational autoencoder\n(CVAE) module and a socially-aware regression module. The cascaded CVAE module\nfirst estimates the future trajectories in a sequential pattern. Specifically,\neach CVAE concatenates the past trajectories and the predicted points so far as\nthe input and predicts the location at the following time step. Then, the\nsocially-aware regression module generates offsets from the estimated future\ntrajectories to produce the socially compliant final predictions, which are\nmore reasonable and accurate results than the estimated trajectories. Moreover,\nconsidering the large model parameters of the cascaded CVAE module, a slide\nCVAE module is further exploited to improve the model efficiency using one\nshared CVAE, in a slidable manner. Experiments results demonstrate that the\nproposed method exhibits improvements over state-of-the-art method on the\nStanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY of approximately 38.0% and 22.2%,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 10:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting.\nRecently, several incremental learning methods are proposed to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting for object detection. Despite the effectiveness, these\nmethods require co-occurrence of the unlabeled base classes in the training\ndata of the novel classes. This requirement is impractical in many real-world\nsettings since the base classes do not necessarily co-occur with the novel\nclasses. In view of this limitation, we consider a more practical setting of\ncomplete absence of co-occurrence of the base and novel classes for the object\ndetection task. We propose the use of unlabeled in-the-wild data to bridge the\nnon co-occurrence caused by the missing base classes during the training of\nadditional novel classes. To this end, we introduce a blind sampling strategy\nbased on the responses of the base-class model and pre-trained novel-class\nmodel to select a smaller relevant dataset from the large in-the-wild dataset\nfor incremental learning. We then design a dual-teacher distillation framework\nto transfer the knowledge distilled from the base- and novel-class teacher\nmodels to the student model using the sampled in-the-wild data. Experimental\nresults on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that our proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental object\ndetection methods when there is no co-occurrence between the base and novel\nclasses during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 10:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Although these methods achieve promising results, such a\nlearning fashion severely prevents from the usage of deeper neural network\narchitectures (e.g., ResNet), leading to the limited representation abilities\nof the models. In this paper, we propose a new deep subspace clustering\nframework, motivated by the energy-based models. In contrast to previous\napproaches taking the weights of a fully connected layer as the self-expressive\ncoefficients, we propose to learn an energy-based network to obtain the\nself-expressive coefficients by mini-batch training. By this means, it is no\nlonger necessary to load all data into one batch for learning, and it thus\nbecomes a reality that we can utilize deeper neural network models for subspace\nclustering. Considering the powerful representation ability of the recently\npopular self-supervised learning, we attempt to leverage self-supervised\nrepresentation learning to learn the dictionary.

In a complex\ncommunication system, this can be used to switch between detection and stealth\nmode. The mechanism of the absorber is investigated. The simulated results show\nthat the antenna with this absorber has monostatic and bistatic RCS reduction\nbands from 2.0 GHz to 18.0 GHz, a maximum RCS reduction of 35 dB with an\naverage RCS reduction of 13.28 dB. The antenna's operating band is 100 MHz.\nWithout ethanol, the antenna has a realized gain of 12.1 dBi, and it drops by 2\ndB when the lossy ethanol is injected. The measured results agree well with the\nsimulated ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The goal of this paper is to introduce a framework for obtaining\n$n^{O(\\sqrt{k})}$ time algorithms for a family of graph modification problems\nthat includes problems that can be seen as generalized cycle hitting problems.\n  Our starting point is the Node Unique Label Cover problem (that is, given a\nCSP instance where each constraint is a permutation of values on two variables,\nthe task is to delete $k$ variables to make the instance satisfiable). We\nintroduce a variant of the problem where $k$ vertices have to be deleted such\nthat every 2-connected component of the remaining instance is satisfiable. Then\nwe extend the problem with cardinality constraints that restrict the number of\ntimes a certain value can be used (globally or within a 2-connected component\nof the solution). We show that there is an $n^{O(\\sqrt{k})}$ time algorithm on\nplanar graphs for any problem that can be formulated this way, which includes a\nlarge number of well-studied problems, for example, Odd Cycle Transversal,\nSubset Feedback Vertex Set, Group Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Group Feedback\nVertex Set, Vertex Multiway Cut, and Component Order Connectivity.\n  For those problems that admit appropriate (quasi)polynomial kernels (that\nincrease the parameter only linearly and preserve planarity), our results\nimmediately imply $2^{O(\\sqrt{k}\\cdot\\operatorname{polylog}(k))}n^{O(1)}$ time\nparameterized algorithms on planar graphs.

Objective: To address these\nchallenges, we designed an artificial intelligence assistant to help primary\nhealthcare providers in lower-resource areas document demographic and medical\nsign/symptom data and to record and share diagnostic data in real-time with a\ncentralized database. Design: We trained our system using multiple data sets,\nincluding US-based electronic medical records (EMRs) and open-source medical\nliterature and developed an adaptive, general medical assistant system based on\nmachine learning algorithms.

While many domain adaptation techniques have\nbeen proposed for images, the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in\nvideos remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Contrast and\nMix (CoMix), a new contrastive learning framework that aims to learn\ndiscriminative invariant feature representations for unsupervised video domain\nadaptation. First, unlike existing methods that rely on adversarial learning\nfor feature alignment, we utilize temporal contrastive learning to bridge the\ndomain gap by maximizing the similarity between encoded representations of an\nunlabeled video at two different speeds as well as minimizing the similarity\nbetween different videos played at different speeds. Second, we propose a novel\nextension to the temporal contrastive loss by using background mixing that\nallows additional positives per anchor, thus adapting contrastive learning to\nleverage action semantics shared across both domains. Moreover, we also\nintegrate a supervised contrastive learning objective using target\npseudo-labels to enhance discriminability of the latent space for video domain\nadaptation.

Historically, this style of\ninference problem would be computationally infeasible due to the large number\nof planet models required; however, we make use of a novel atmospheric\nevolution emulator which utilises neural networks to provide three orders of\nmagnitude in speedup. First, we provide proof-of-concept for this emulator on a\nreal problem, by inferring the initial atmospheric conditions to the TOI-270\nmulti-planet system.

Thus, it appears the\nexoplanet population is consistent with the idea that close-in exoplanets\ninitially acquired large massive atmospheres, the majority of which is lost\nduring disc dispersal; before the final population is sculpted by atmospheric\nloss over 100~Myr to Gyr timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 14:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 21:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 00:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Such a property is important in many related to applied\nproblems. If a nonlinear mapping of Hilbert spaces is smooth and regular, it\nimplies convexity of the image of balls and has profound geometric properties\nof the underlying space and the preservation of convexity via linear\napproximations. The present study is focused on the analysis of the mild\nsufficient conditions for a nonlinear mapping of Banach spaces to be locally\nconvex. In contrast to the Hilbert space case, when the local convexity is\nbased on the strong convexity of the ball% %$B_{r}(a)\\subset X$ , in the case\nof a Banach space the local convexity property is based on much more subtle\nproperties both of a mapping and a Banach space under regard. Special attention\nis paid to the locally convex functions between Banach spaces. In this part of\npaper we address a suitably reformulated local convexity problem for Banach\nspaces. The problem is solved in terms of the interplay between the modulus of\nsmoothness of the function $f$ and the modulus of convexity of the Banach space\nupon thorough study of the local regularity properties of the nonlinear\nmappings and the related Banach space convexity characteristics. Some of the\nresults presented in the work appear to be interesting and novel even for\nfinite-dimensional problems. Open problems related to the local convexity\nproperty for nonlinear mapping of Banach spaces are also formulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 14:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

We assume that the number density of the\ngranular gas is much smaller than that of the surrounding molecular gas, so\nthat the latter is not affected by the presence of solid particles. In this\nsituation, the molecular gas may be treated as a thermostat (or bath) of\nelastic hard spheres at a fixed temperature. This system (granular gas\nthermostated by a bath of elastic hard spheres) can be considered as a reliable\nmodel for describing the dynamic properties of particle-laden suspensions. The\nBoltzmann kinetic equation is the starting point of the present work. First\nstep is to characterise the reference state in the perturbation scheme, namely\nthe homogeneous state. Theoretical results for the granular temperature and\nkurtosis obtained in the homogeneous steady state are compared against Monte\nCarlo simulations showing a good agreement. Then, the Chapman-Enskog method is\nemployed to solve the Boltzmann equation to first order in spatial gradients.\nAs expected, the Navier-Stokes-Fourier transport coefficients of the granular\ngas are given in terms of the solutions of a coupled set of linear integral\nequations which are approximately solved by considering the leading terms in a\nSonine polynomial expansion.

When the granular particles are much more heavier\nthan the gas particles (Brownian limit) the expressions of the transport\ncoefficients are consistent with those previously derived from the\nFokker-Planck equation.

A recent attempt to\ncategorize OOD data introduces the concept of near and far OOD detection.\nSpecifically, prior works define characteristics of OOD data in terms of\ndetection difficulty. We propose to characterize the spectrum of OOD data using\ntwo types of distribution shifts: covariate shift and concept shift, where\ncovariate shift corresponds to change in style, e.g., noise, and concept shift\nindicates a change in semantics. This characterization reveals that sensitivity\nto each type of shift is important to the detection and confidence calibration\nof OOD data. Consequently, we investigate score functions that capture\nsensitivity to each type of dataset shift and methods that improve them. To\nthis end, we theoretically derive two score functions for OOD detection, the\ncovariate shift score and concept shift score, based on the decomposition of\nKL-divergence for both scores, and propose a geometrically-inspired method\n(Geometric ODIN) to improve OOD detection under both shifts with only\nin-distribution data. Additionally, the proposed method naturally leads to an\nexpressive post-hoc calibration function which yields state-of-the-art\ncalibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.\nWe are the first to propose a method that works well across both OOD detection\nand calibration and under different types of shifts.

Elastic scattering of the photoexcited electrons and holes is taken into\naccount. The absorption bleaching at high intensity is shown to be strongly\nsuppressed by the elastic scattering. The linear-circular dichroism of one- and\ntwo-photon absorption in surface states, emerging in the nonlinear in intensity\nregime, decreases due to the elastic scattering of photocarriers. Absorption in\nthe edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators also depends on the\nelastic scattering rate being suppressed when it is stronger that the energy\nrelaxation rate. The linear dichroism - a dependence of the absorption length\non the polarization plane orientation - is studied at arbitrary light\nintensities. We show that a degree of the linear dichroism is governed by the\nratio of the elastic and inelastic relaxation times.

With electric gating from both the top and bottom sides, the\nsuperconductivity was found to be closely associated to two conditions: the\nfinite broken mirror symmetry and carrier concentrations between two to three\ncarriers per moir\\'e unite cell. Both conditions may be achieved by\ngraphene-metal contacts where charge transfers and interfacial electric fields\nare generated to balance work function mismatch. In this study, we explore the\nsuperconductivity of MATTG when contacting a metal, through self-consistently\nsolving the interfacial charge transfer with a highly electric-field-dependent\nband structure of MATTG. The predicted TC of MATTG-metal contacts forms two\ndomes as a function of the work function difference over the interface, with a\nmaximum over 2 K. Our work provides a constructive reference for graphene\nexperiments and industrial applications with graphene-metal and\ngraphene-semiconductor contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 23:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 06:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Such structured domains\ncan often be partitioned into distinct process steps, e.g., packaging or\ntransporting. Each process step can have a different prior distribution over\nactivity classes, e.g., standing or walking, and different system dynamics.\nHere, we show how such context information can be integrated systematically\ninto a deep neural network-based HAR system. Specifically, we propose a hybrid\narchitecture that combines a deep neural network-that estimates high-level\nmovement descriptors, attributes, from the raw-sensor data-and a shallow\nclassifier, which predicts activity classes from the estimated attributes and\n(optional) context information, like the currently executed process step. We\nempirically show that our proposed architecture increases HAR performance,\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show that HAR\nperformance can be further increased when information about process steps is\nincorporated, even when that information is only partially correct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 06:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Naturally, strict instances of this phenomenon, such as the\nstates of complete synchronization are favored, or even ensured, in networks\nwith a high density of connections. Conversely, in sparse networks, the system\nstate-space is often shared by a variety of coexistent solutions. Consequently,\nthe convergence to complete synchronized states is far from being certain. In\nthis scenario, we report the surprising phenomenon in which completely\nsynchronized states are made the sole attractor of sparse networks by removing\nnetwork links, the sparsity-driven synchronization. This phenomenon is observed\nnumerically for nonlocally coupled Kuramoto networks and verified analytically\nfor locally coupled ones. In addition, we reduce the network equations to a\none-dimension dynamical system to unravel the bifurcation scenario underlying\nthe network transition to completely synchronized behavior. Furthermore, we\npresent a simple procedure, based on the bifurcations in the thermodynamic\nlimit, that determines the minimum number of links to be removed in order to\nensure complete synchronization. Finally, we propose an application of the\nreported phenomenon as a control scheme to drive complete synchronization in\nhigh connectivity networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 06:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}
