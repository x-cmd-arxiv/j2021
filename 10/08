Despite\ntheir success, their cost is still a challenge. One of the most expensive\ncomponents of EVs is lithium-ion batteries, which became the standard for\nenergy storage in a wide range of applications. Precisely estimating the\nRemaining Useful Life (RUL) of battery packs can open to their reuse and thus\nhelp to reduce the cost of EVs and improve sustainability. A correct RUL\nestimation can be used to quantify the residual market value of the battery\npack. The customer can then decide to sell the battery when it still has a\nvalue, i.e., before it exceeds its end of life of the target application and\ncan still be reused in a second domain without compromising safety and\nreliability. In this paper, we propose to use a Deep Learning approach based on\nLSTMs and Autoencoders to estimate the RUL of li-ion batteries.

We make three contributions.\nFirst, we observe that feature-level attacks provide useful classes of inputs\nfor studying representations in models. Second, we show that these adversaries\nare uniquely versatile and highly robust. We demonstrate that they can be used\nto produce targeted, universal, disguised, physically-realizable, and black-box\nattacks at the ImageNet scale.

Our results suggest that feature-level attacks are a\npromising approach for rigorous interpretability research.

First, they\nadopt a siamese dual-encoder architecture to encode queries and documents\nindependently for fast indexing and searching, while neglecting the\nfiner-grained term-wise interactions. This results in a sub-optimal recall\nperformance. Second, their model training highly relies on a negative sampling\ntechnique to build up the negative documents in their contrastive losses. To\naddress these challenges, we present Adversarial Retriever-Ranker (AR2), which\nconsists of a dual-encoder retriever plus a cross-encoder ranker. The two\nmodels are jointly optimized according to a minimax adversarial objective: the\nretriever learns to retrieve negative documents to cheat the ranker, while the\nranker learns to rank a collection of candidates including both the\nground-truth and the retrieved ones, as well as providing progressive direct\nfeedback to the dual-encoder retriever. Through this adversarial game, the\nretriever gradually produces harder negative documents to train a better\nranker, whereas the cross-encoder ranker provides progressive feedback to\nimprove retriever.

Spatiotemporal recurrences of the system hint\nto the presence of a low-dimensional manifold containing the high-dimensional\nclimate trajectory that could make the problem more tractable. Here we argue\nthat reproducing the geometrical and topological properties of the\nlow-dimensional attractor should be a key target for models used in climate\nprojections. In doing so, we propose a general data-driven framework to\ncharacterize the climate attractor and showcase it in the tropical Pacific\nocean using a reanalysis as observational proxy and two state-of-the-art\nmodels. The analysis spans four variables simultaneously over the periods\n1979-2019 and 2060-2100. At each time t, the system can be uniquely described\nby a state space vector parameterized by N variables and their spatial\nvariability. The dynamics is confined on a manifold with dimension lower than\nthe full state space that we characterize through manifold learning algorithms,\nboth linear and nonlinear. The local geometry and local stability of the\nhigh-dimensional, multi-variable climate attractor are quantified through the\nlocal dimension and persistence metrics.

However, in light of the pandemic,\nschools require customized schedules that can address the health concerns and\nsafety of the students considering classroom sizes, air conditioning equipment,\nclassroom systems, e.g., self-contained or compartmentalized. To solve this\nissue, we developed the School-Virus-Infection-Simulator (SVIS) for teachers\nand education policymakers. SVIS simulates the spread of infection at a school\nconsidering the students' lesson schedules, classroom volume, air circulation\nrates in classrooms, and infectability of the students. Thus, teachers and\neducation policymakers can simulate how their school schedules can impact\ncurrent health concerns. We then demonstrate the impact of several school\nschedules in self-contained and departmentalized classrooms and evaluate them\nin terms of the maximum number of students infected simultaneously and the\npercentage of face-to-face lessons. The results show that increasing classroom\nventilation rate is effective, however, the impact is not stable compared to\ncustomizing school schedules, in addition, school schedules can differently\nimpact the maximum number of students infected depending on whether classrooms\nare self-contained or compartmentalized. It was found that one of school\nschedules had a higher maximum number of students infected, compared to\nschedules with a higher percentage of face-to-face lessons.

Furthermore, we find that federated dropout\nenables a set of smaller sub-models within the larger model to independently\nhave low word error rates, making it easier to dynamically adjust the size of\nthe model deployed for inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 17:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

In a microscopic\ndescription of the propagation of a disease over the complex network of human\ncontacts, the probability that an individual is in a given state (susceptible,\ninfectious, recovered etc) depends on the state of its neighbors in the\nnetwork. Thus it depends on the state of pairs of nodes, which in turns depends\non triples, in a hierarchy of dynamical dependencies. In order to produce\nmodels that are at the same time reliable and manageable, one has to understand\nhow to truncate such a hierarchy, and how the chosen order of approximation\naffects the ability of the model to forecast the real temporal evolution of an\nepidemics. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of the reliability\n(under different hypotheses on the quantity and quality of available data) of\nthe predictions obtained by truncating the hierarchy either at the level of\nindividuals or at the level of pairs. We find that pair-based models are\nreliable tools both for estimating the epidemiological parameters and for\nforecasting the temporal evolution of the epidemics, under all conditions taken\ninto account in our work. However, a pair-based approach provides a much better\nprediction of an individual-based one, only if better data, namely information\non the state of node pairs, are available. Overall, our results suggest that\nmore refined mathematical models need to be informed by improved contact\ntracing techniques to better support decision on policies and containment\nmeasures to adopt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 17:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

However, finding\nthe optimal agent design for a given function is extremely challenging since\nthe problem is inherently combinatorial and the design space is prohibitively\nlarge. Additionally, it can be costly to evaluate each candidate design which\nrequires solving for its optimal controller. To tackle these problems, our key\nidea is to incorporate the design procedure of an agent into its\ndecision-making process. Specifically, we learn a conditional policy that, in\nan episode, first applies a sequence of transform actions to modify an agent's\nskeletal structure and joint attributes, and then applies control actions under\nthe new design. To handle a variable number of joints across designs, we use a\ngraph-based policy where each graph node represents a joint and uses message\npassing with its neighbors to output joint-specific actions. Using policy\ngradient methods, our approach enables joint optimization of agent design and\ncontrol as well as experience sharing across different designs, which improves\nsample efficiency substantially. Experiments show that our approach,\nTransform2Act, outperforms prior methods significantly in terms of convergence\nspeed and final performance.

In this\npaper, we present ATISS, a novel autoregressive transformer architecture for\ncreating diverse and plausible synthetic indoor environments, given only the\nroom type and its floor plan. In contrast to prior work, which poses scene\nsynthesis as sequence generation, our model generates rooms as unordered sets\nof objects. We argue that this formulation is more natural, as it makes ATISS\ngenerally useful beyond fully automatic room layout synthesis. For example, the\nsame trained model can be used in interactive applications for general scene\ncompletion, partial room re-arrangement with any objects specified by the user,\nas well as object suggestions for any partial room.

In this paper we study\nmagnitude-based pruning as a way to compress the wavefunction representation in\nan RBM, focusing on RBMs trained on data from the transverse-field Ising model\nin one dimension. We find that pruning can reduce the total number of RBM\nweights, but the threshold at which the reconstruction accuracy starts to\ndegrade varies significantly depending on the phase of the model. In a gapped\nregion of the phase diagram, the RBM admits pruning over half of the weights\nwhile still accurately reproducing relevant physical observables.

Towards this\ngoal, we develop a novel approach by solely focusing on the effective\ninformation exchange between burst frames, such that the degradations get\nfiltered out while the actual scene details are preserved and enhanced.

We find that mass loss strips\nnear-surface regions faster than magnetic fields can diffuse through them. As a\nresult, observations of surface magnetism directly probe the frozen-in remains\nof the convective dynamo. This explains the slow evolution of magnetism in\nstars with very weak fields: these dynamo-\\emph{generated} magnetic fields\nevolve on the time-scale of the mass loss, not that of the dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

We present a general phenomenological model\nof reflectivity from Floquet materials, which takes into account parametric\ngeneration of excitation pairs. We find a universal phase diagram of drive\ninduced features in reflectivity which evidence a competition between driving\nand dissipation.

Filter stability refers to the correction of\nan incorrectly initialized filter for a partially observed stochastic dynamical\nsystem (controlled or control-free) with increasing measurements. This problem\nhas been studied extensively in the control-free context, and except for the\nstandard machinery for linear Gaussian systems involving the Kalman Filter, few\nstudies exist for the controlled setup. One of the main differences between\ncontrol-free and controlled partially observed Markov chains is that the filter\nis always Markovian under the former, whereas under a controlled model the\nfilter process may not be Markovian since the control policy may depend on past\nmeasurements in an arbitrary (measurable) fashion. This complicates the\ndependency structure and therefore results from the control-free literature do\nnot directly apply to the controlled setup. In this paper, we study the filter\nstability problem for controlled stochastic dynamical systems, and provide\nsufficient conditions for when a falsely initialized filter merges with the\ncorrectly initialized filter over time. These stability results are applied to\nrobust stochastic control problems: under filter stability, we bound the\ndifference in the expected cost incurred for implementing an incorrectly\ndesigned control policy compared to an optimal policy. A conclusion is that\nfilter stability leads to stronger robustness results to incorrect priors\n(compared with setups without controlled filter stability). Furthermore, if the\noptimum cost is that same for each prior, the cost of mismatch between the true\nprior and the assumed prior is zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 18:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

Recently, researchers have been advocating the adoption of\nmeta-heuristic algorithms for t-way testing strategies (where t points the\ninteraction strength among parameters). Although helpful, no single\nmeta-heuristic based t-way strategy can claim dominance over its counterparts.\nFor this reason, the hybridization of meta-heuristic algorithms can help to\nascertain the search capabilities of each by compensating for the limitations\nof one algorithm with the strength of others. Consequently, a new\nmeta-heuristic based t-way strategy called Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony\n(HABCSm) strategy, based on merging the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony\n(ABC) algorithm with the advantages of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nalgorithm is proposed in this paper. HABCSm is the first t-way strategy to\nadopt Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (HABC) algorithm with Hamming distance as\nits core method for generating a final test set and the first to adopt the\nHamming distance as the final selection criterion for enhancing the exploration\nof new solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that HABCSm provides\nsuperior competitive performance over its counterparts.

To overcome this shortcoming, two constraints are\nproposed. These include applying hard boundary constraints on the number of\nmodified points and on the point perturbation norms. Due to the restrictive\nnature of the problem, the search space contains many local maxima. The\nproposed method addresses this issue by using a high step-size at the beginning\nof the algorithm to search the main surface of the point cloud fast and\neffectively. Then, in order to converge to the desired output, the step-size is\ngradually decreased. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it is\nrun on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets by employing the\nstate-of-the-art point cloud classification models; including PointNet,\nPointNet++, and DGCNN. The obtained results show that it can perform successful\nattacks and achieve state-of-the-art results by only a limited number of point\nmodifications while preserving the appearance of the point cloud. Moreover, due\nto the effective search algorithm, it can perform successful attacks in just a\nfew steps. Additionally, the proposed step-size scheduling algorithm shows an\nimprovement of up to $14.5\\%$ when adopted by other methods as well. The\nproposed method also performs effectively against popular defense methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 18:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

While traditional recommender systems are impactful enough on\ntheir own, they are not optimized.

MPNNs are appealing for being efficient and scalable,\nhow-ever their expressiveness is upper-bounded by the 1st-order\nWeisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test (1-WL). In response, prior works propose\nhighly expressive models at the cost of scalability and sometimes\ngeneralization performance. Our work stands between these two regimes: we\nintroduce a general framework to uplift any MPNN to be more expressive, with\nlimited scalability overhead and greatly improved practical performance. We\nachieve this by extending local aggregation in MPNNs from star patterns to\ngeneral subgraph patterns (e.g.,k-egonets):in our framework, each node\nrepresentation is computed as the encoding of a surrounding induced subgraph\nrather than encoding of immediate neighbors only (i.e. a star). We choose the\nsubgraph encoder to be a GNN (mainly MPNNs, considering scalability) to design\na general framework that serves as a wrapper to up-lift any GNN. We call our\nproposed method GNN-AK(GNN As Kernel), as the framework resembles a\nconvolutional neural network by replacing the kernel with GNNs. Theoretically,\nwe show that our framework is strictly more powerful than 1&2-WL, and is not\nless powerful than 3-WL. We also design subgraph sampling strategies which\ngreatly reduce memory footprint and improve speed while maintaining\nperformance. Our method sets new state-of-the-art performance by large margins\nfor several well-known graph ML tasks; specifically, 0.08 MAE on ZINC,74.79%\nand 86.887% accuracy on CIFAR10 and PATTERN respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 19:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 05:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 23:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

We benchmark the performance of the\nproposed paging scheme against similar solutions available in the literature.\nOur extended SC-PTM framework is energy efficient and guarantees low service\nlatency, as demonstrated both analytically and by simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 19:40:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 08:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

However,\nimplementation of traditional AL methodologies in practical scenarios is\naccompanied by multiple challenges due to the inherent assumptions. There are\nseveral hindrances, such as unavailability of labels for the AL algorithm at\nthe beginning; unreliable external source of labels during the querying\nprocess; or incompatible mechanisms to evaluate the performance of Active\nLearner. Inspired by these practical challenges, we present a hybrid query\nstrategy-based AL framework that addresses three practical challenges\nsimultaneously: cold-start, oracle uncertainty and performance evaluation of\nActive Learner in the absence of ground truth. While a pre-clustering approach\nis employed to address the cold-start problem, the uncertainty surrounding the\nexpertise of labeler and confidence in the given labels is incorporated to\nhandle oracle uncertainty. The heuristics obtained during the querying process\nserve as the fundamental premise for accessing the performance of Active\nLearner. The robustness of the proposed AL framework is evaluated across three\ndifferent environments and industrial settings. The results demonstrate the\ncapability of the proposed framework to tackle practical challenges during AL\nimplementation in real-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 20:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

BOFiP\ndecomposes the original, high dimensional, space into several sub-spaces\ndefined by non-overlapping sets of dimensions. These sets are randomly\ngenerated at the start of the algorithm, and they form a partition of the\ndimensions of the original space. BOFiP searches the original space with\nalternating BO, within sub-spaces, and information exchange among sub-spaces,\nto update the sub-space function evaluation. The basic idea is to distribute\nthe high dimensional optimization across low dimensional sub-spaces, where each\nsub-space is a player in an equal interest game. At each iteration, BO produces\napproximate best replies that update the players belief distribution. The\nbelief update and BO alternate until a stopping condition is met.\n  High dimensional problems are common in real applications, and several\ncontributions in the BO literature have highlighted the difficulty in scaling\nto high dimensions due to the computational complexity associated to the\nestimation of the model hyperparameters. Such complexity is exponential in the\nproblem dimension, resulting in substantial loss of performance for most\ntechniques with the increase of the input dimensionality.\n  We compare BOFiP to several state-of-the-art approaches in the field of high\ndimensional black box optimization.

A neural network architecture design problem is tested with 42 up\nto 911 nodes in 6 up to 92 layers, respectively, resulting into networks with\n500 up to 10,000 weights.

The\nferroquadrupolar transition, a realization of Ising nematicity, can be tuned to\na quantum critical point using a magnetic field oriented along the $c$-axis of\nthe tetragonal crystal lattice, which acts as an effective transverse field for\nthe Ising-nematic order. In small magnetic fields, the thermal phase transition\ncan be well-described using a semi-classical mean field treatment of the\ntransverse field Ising model. However, in higher magnetic fields, closer to the\nfield-tuned quantum phase transition, subtle deviations from this\nsemi-classical behavior are observed due to quantum fluctuations. Although the\nphase transition is driven by the local $4f$ degrees of freedom, the crystal\nlattice still plays a crucial role, both in terms of mediating the interactions\nbetween the local quadrupoles, and in determining the critical scaling\nexponents, even though the phase transition itself can be described via mean\nfield. In particular, bilinear coupling of the nematic order parameter to\nacoustic phonons changes the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the former in\na fundamental way, resulting in different critical behavior of the nematic\ntransverse-field Ising model as compared to the usual case of the magnetic\ntransverse-field Ising model.

Here, inspired by the finding that\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Sudoku matrices exhibit higher average Shannon entropy\nthan 2D random matrix counterparts, we propose high-Shannon-entropy alloys\n(HSEA), whose structures are based on 3D Sudoku matrices. Despite the\nconstraints on the atomic arrangements to form a 3D Sudoku 4 x 4 x 4 matrix, we\nfind that, a prototypical HSEA, NbMoTaW has a lower energy than the same HEA\nwith a random structure due to the smaller lattice distortion.

We find that a range of large energies\nare required to generate such vacancies, which depend on the location and\nspecies of missing atoms.

The process results from buoyancy-coupled Darcy flow\nand solute transport. Proper theoretical modeling of the process should\nconsider in the transport equation a diffusive term accounting for\nhydrodynamics (or, mechanical) dispersion, with an effective diffusion\ncoefficient that is proportional to the local interstitial velocity. A few\ntwo-dimensional (2D) numerical studies, and three-dimensional (3D) experimental\ninvestigations, have investigated the impact of hydrodynamic dispersion on\nconvection dynamics, with contradictory conclusions. Here, we investigate\nsystematically the impact of the dispersion strength $S$ (relative to molecular\ndiffusion), and of the anisotropy $\\alpha$ of its tensor, on convective\ndissolution in 2D and 3D geometries. We use a new numerical model and analyze\nthe solute fingers' number density (FND), penetration depth and maximum\nvelocity; the onset time of convection; the dissolution flux in the\nquasi-constant flux regime; the mean concentration of the dissolved CO2; and\nthe scalar dissipation rate. The efficiency of convective dissolution over long\ntimes is observed to be mostly controlled by the onset time of convection. For\nmost natural porous media ($\\alpha = 0.1$), the onset time is found to increase\nas a function of $S$, in agreement with previous experimental findings and in\nstark contrast to previous numerical findings. However, if $\\alpha$ is\nsufficiently large this behavior is reversed. Furthermore, results in 3D are\nfully consistent with the 2D results on all accounts, except that in 3D the\nonset time is slightly smaller, the dissolution flux in the quasi-constant flux\nregime is slightly larger, and the dependence of the FND on the dispersion\nparameters is impacted by $Ra$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 21:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

We examine this scenario in viscoelastic fluids, and identify\nnew mechanisms by which significant vorticity perturbations can be generated in\nboth inertialess and elasto-inertial channel flows. We focus on the case where\nthe lengthscale of the surface distortion is much longer than the channel\ndepth, where we find significant departure from plane shear (Page & Zaki, J.\nFluid Mech. 801 2016) due to the non-monotonic base-flow streamwise-normal\nelastic stress. In inertialess flows, a purely elastic response results in\nstreamlines deforming to match the bottom topography in the lower half the\nchannel. However, the vanishing stress at the centreline introduces a blocking\neffect, and the associated $O(1)$ jump in normal velocity is balanced by a\nnarrow, large amplitude streamwise-oscillating `jet', resulting in a localised,\nchevron-shaped vorticity perturbation field. In elasto-inertial flows,\nresonance between the frequency of elasto-inertial `Alfven' waves and the\nfrequency apparent to an observer moving with the fluid results in vorticity\namplification in a pair of critical layers on either side of the channel. The\nvorticity in both layers is equal in magnitude and as such the perturbation\nvorticity field penetrates the full channel depth even when inertia is\ndominant. The results demonstrate that long-wave distortions - which are\nrelatively innocuous in Newtonian fluids - can drive a significant flow\ndistortion in viscoelastic fluids for a wide range of parameter values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 22:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

In order to understand and contextualize their findings, it is\nimportant to assess the quality of the selected secondary studies. Objective:\nThis paper aims to provide a state of the art on the assessment of secondary\nstudies' quality as conducted in tertiary studies in the area of software\nengineering, reporting the frameworks used as instruments, the facets examined\nin these frameworks, and the purposes of the quality assessment. Method: We\ndesigned this study as a systematic mapping responding to four research\nquestions derived from the objective above. We applied a rigorous search\nprotocol over the Scopus digital library, resulting in 47 papers after\napplication of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The extracted data was\nsynthesised using content analysis. Results: A majority of tertiary studies\nperform quality assessment. It is not often used for excluding studies, but to\nsupport some kind of investigation. The DARE quality assessment framework is\nthe most frequently used, with customizations in some cases to cover missing\nfacets. We outline the first steps towards building a new framework to address\nthe shortcomings identified. Conclusion: This paper is a step forward\nestablishing a foundation for researchers in two different ways. As authors of\ntertiary studies, understanding the different possibilities in which they can\nperform quality assessment of secondary studies. As readers, having an\ninstrument to understand the methodological rigor upon which tertiary studies\nmay claim their findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 22:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

In this paper, we address this gap\nvia a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on\nthe robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the\nfollowing key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not\nnecessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage\n(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial\nrobustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal\narchitectural configuration for adversarial robustness.

One such use case\nis the construction of external control arms for evaluation of efficacy in\nsingle-arm trials, particularly in cases where randomization is either\ninfeasible or unethical. However, it is well known that treated patients in\nnon-randomized studies may not be comparable to control patients -- on either\nmeasured or unmeasured variables -- and that the underlying population\ndifferences between the two groups may result in biased treatment effect\nestimates as well as increased variability in estimation. To address these\nchallenges for analyses of time-to-event outcomes, we developed a meta-analytic\nframework that uses historical reference studies to adjust a log hazard ratio\nestimate in a new external control study for its additional bias and\nvariability. The set of historical studies is formed by constructing external\ncontrol arms for historical RCTs, and a meta-analysis compares the trial\ncontrols to the external control arms. Importantly, a prospective external\ncontrol study can be performed independently of the meta-analysis using\nstandard causal inference techniques for observational data. We illustrate our\napproach with a simulation study and an empirical example based on reference\nstudies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Precise mass determination is fundamental to restrict planetary\ndensities and thus infer planetary compositions. In this work, we present\nNauyaca, a Python package dedicated to find planetary masses and orbital\nelements through the fitting of observed mid-transit times from a N-body\napproach. The fitting strategy consists in performing a sequence of\nminimization algorithms (optimizers) that are used to identify high probability\nregions in the parameter space. These results from optimizers are used for\ninitialization of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, using an adaptive\nParallel-Tempering algorithm. A set of runs are performed in order to obtain\nposterior distributions of planetary masses and orbital elements. In order to\ntest the tool, we created a mock catalog of synthetic planetary systems with\ndifferent number of planets where all of them transit. We calculate their\nmid-transit times to give them as an input to Nauyaca, testing statistically\nits efficiency in recovering the planetary parameters from the catalog.

While\nconvolutional neutral networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable progress in this\ntask, most of existing solutions are still incapable of effectively capturing\nglobal dependencies to counteract the inductive bias caused by limited\nreceptive fields. Recently, transformers have been proposed as a promising tool\nfor global context modeling by employing a powerful global attention mechanism,\nbut one of their main shortcomings when applied to segmentation tasks is that\nthey cannot effectively extract sufficient local details to tackle ambiguous\nboundaries.

In the\nmany-to-many on-orbit repairing scenario, several servicing spacecrafts and\ntarget satellites are located in GEO orbits which have different inclination,\nRAAN and true anomaly. Each servicing spacecraft need to rendezvous with target\nsatellites to perform repairing missions under limited fuel. The mission\nobjective is to find the optimal servicing sequence and orbit rendezvous time\nof every servicing spacecraft to minimize total cost of all servicing\nspacecrafts with all target satellites repaired. Firstly, a time-dependent\norbital rendezvous strategy is proposed, which can handle the mission deadline\nconstraint. Besides, it is also cost-effective compared with the existing\nstrategy.

The key is\nto provide the model with a strong inductive bias to discover the compositional\nstructures of latent modes. To this end, we propose ModeRNN, which introduces a\nnovel method to learn structured hidden representations between recurrent\nstates. The core idea of this framework is to first extract various components\nof visual dynamics using a set of spatiotemporal slots with independent\nparameters. Considering that multiple space-time patterns may co-exist in a\nsequence, we leverage learnable importance weights to adaptively aggregate slot\nfeatures into a unified hidden representation, which is then used to update the\nrecurrent states.

It can\nalso increase the horizon of the plain LSTM's forecasting by almost two times.\nTo achieve this, an optimal range of the physical hyperparameter, analogous to\nan artificial bulk modulus, has been established through numerical experiments.\nThe efficacy of the proposed method in alleviating overfitting, and the\nphysical interpretability of the learning mechanism, are also discussed. Such\nan application of kinematically consistent LSTM networks for wave propagation\nlearning is presented here for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 05:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

Recovering a dense 3D structure of surgical scene using visual cues\nremains a challenge, and the online laparoscopic tracking primarily relies on\nexternal sensors, which increases system complexity. Methods: Here, we propose\na learning-driven framework, in which an image-guided laparoscopic localization\nwith 3D reconstructions of complex anatomical structures is obtained. To\nreconstruct the 3D structure of the whole surgical environment, we first\nfine-tune a learning-based stereoscopic depth perception method, which is\nrobust to the texture-less and variant soft tissues, for depth estimation.\nThen, we develop a dense visual reconstruction algorithm to represent the scene\nby surfels, estimate the laparoscope poses and fuse the depth maps into a\nunified reference coordinate for tissue reconstruction. To estimate poses of\nnew laparoscope views, we achieve a coarse-to-fine localization method, which\nincorporates our reconstructed 3D model. Results: We evaluate the\nreconstruction method and the localization module on three datasets, namely,\nthe stereo correspondence and reconstruction of endoscopic data (SCARED), the\nex-vivo phantom and tissue data collected with Universal Robot (UR) and Karl\nStorz Laparoscope, and the in-vivo DaVinci robotic surgery dataset, where the\nreconstructed 3D structures have rich details of surface texture with an\naccuracy error under 1.71 mm and the localization module can accurately track\nthe laparoscope with only images as input.

Considering the\nstatic solution to the multi-bodies problem corresponds to the minimum\npotential energy principle, we further assume that the distribution of the\nbodies is the most uniform when the potential energy is the smallest. To verify\nthe proposed assumptions, a dynamical evolutionary model (DEM) based on the\nminimum potential energy is established to find out the static solution. The\ncentral difference algorithm is adopted to solve the DEM and an evolutionary\niterative scheme is developed.

The device consists of a flat-bed scanner and\npinhole-array masks. For calibration, a projector projects a series of\nstructured light patterns in the device. The pinholes directionally decompose\nthe structured light, and only the projected rays that pass through the\npinholes hit the scanner plane.

Using a proof-of-concept prototype, we\ndemonstrate that our technique can calibrate projectors with different focusing\ndistances and aperture sizes at the same accuracy as a conventional method.\nFinally, we confirm that our technique can provide intrinsic parameters\naccurate enough for a dynamic PM application, even when a projector is placed\ntoo far from a projection target for a conventional method to calibrate the\nprojector using a fiducial object of reasonable size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 06:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

The main challenge is that connecting a large number of\nelectronic components under specific design rules involves a very large search\nspace. Early solutions are typically designed with hard-coded heuristics, which\nsuffer from problems of non-optimal solutions and lack of flexibility for new\ndesign needs. Although a few learning-based methods have been proposed\nrecently, they are typically cumbersome and hard to extend to large-scale\napplications. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for circuit routing,\nnamed Ranking Cost, which innovatively combines search-based methods (i.e., A*\nalgorithm) and learning-based methods (i.e., Evolution Strategies) to form an\nefficient and trainable router. In our method, we introduce a new set of\nvariables called cost maps, which can help the A* router to find out proper\npaths to achieve the global objective. We also train a ranking parameter, which\ncan produce the ranking order and further improve the performance of our\nmethod. Our algorithm is trained in an end-to-end manner and does not use any\nartificial data or human demonstration. In the experiments, we compare with the\nsequential A* algorithm and a canonical reinforcement learning approach, and\nresults show that our method outperforms these baselines with higher\nconnectivity rates and better scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 07:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

When CO$_2$ is injected in the geological formation, it\ndissolves partially in the interstitial brine, thus rendering it denser than\nthe CO$_2$-devoid brine below, which creates a convective instability. The\nresulting convection accelerates the rate of CO$_2$ perennial trapping by\ndissolution in the brine. The instability and resulting convection have been\nintensively discussed by numerical and theoretical approaches at the Darcy\nscale, but few experimental studies have characterized them quantitatively. By\nusing both refractive index matching and planar laser induced fluorescence, we\nmeasure for the first time the onset characteristics of the convective\ndissolution instability in a 3-D porous medium located below a gas compartment.\nOur results highlight that the dimensional growth rate of the instability\nremains constant when the CO$_2$ partial pressure in the compartment is varied,\nin clear discrepancy with the theoretical predictions.

To tackle the above challenges, we propose a\nMulti-Behavior recommendation framework with Graph Meta Network to incorporate\nthe multi-behavior pattern modeling into a meta-learning paradigm. Our\ndeveloped MB-GMN empowers the user-item interaction learning with the\ncapability of uncovering type-dependent behavior representations, which\nautomatically distills the behavior heterogeneity and interaction diversity for\nrecommendations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the\neffectiveness of MB-GMN by significantly boosting the recommendation\nperformance as compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing\nwork applies to low-dimensional settings with a fixed number of proxies and\nconfounders. In this work we consider linear models with many proxy controls\nand possibly many confounders. A key insight is that if each group of proxies\nis strictly larger than the number of confounding factors, then a matrix of\nnuisance parameters has a low-rank structure and a vector of nuisance\nparameters has a sparse structure. We can exploit the rank-restriction and\nsparsity to reduce the number of free parameters to be estimated.

This paper contributes to addressing this question by\nstudying the extent to which the distributed SGD algorithm, in the standard\nparameter-server architecture, can learn an accurate model despite (a) a\nfraction of the workers being malicious (Byzantine), and (b) the other\nfraction, whilst being honest, providing noisy information to the server to\nensure differential privacy (DP).

In recent years,\nreinforcement learning (RL) has shown great results for single-arm robotic\nmanipulation. However, research focusing on dual-arm manipulation is still\nrare. From a classical control perspective, solving such tasks often involves\ncomplex modeling of interactions between two manipulators and the objects\nencountered in the tasks, as well as the two robots coupling at a control\nlevel. Instead, in this work, we explore the applicability of model-free RL to\ndual-arm assembly. As we aim to contribute towards an approach that is not\nlimited to dual-arm assembly, but dual-arm manipulation in general, we keep\nmodeling efforts at a minimum. Hence, to avoid modeling the interaction between\nthe two robots and the used assembly tools, we present a modular approach with\ntwo decentralized single-arm controllers which are coupled using a single\ncentralized learned policy. We reduce modeling effort to a minimum by using\nsparse rewards only. Our architecture enables successful assembly and simple\ntransfer from simulation to the real world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe framework on dual-arm peg-in-hole and analyze sample efficiency and success\nrates for different action spaces. Moreover, we compare results on different\nclearances and showcase disturbance recovery and robustness, when dealing with\nposition uncertainties. Finally we zero-shot transfer policies trained in\nsimulation to the real world and evaluate their performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 09:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 15:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

If solved, this understanding would provide valuable\ninsights into the architecture, dynamics, and formation of exoplanetary\nsystems. Recent observations by ALMA have revealed an apparent paradox in this\nfield, the presence of radially narrow belts in protoplanetary discs that are\nlikely the birthplaces of planetesimals, and exoKuiper belts nearly four times\nas wide in mature systems. If the parent planetesimals of this type of debris\ndisc indeed form in these narrow protoplanetary rings via streaming instability\nwhere dust is trapped, we propose that this width dichotomy could naturally\narise if these dust traps form planetesimals whilst migrating radially, e.g. as\ncaused by a migrating planet. Using the dust evolution software DustPy, we find\nthat if the initial protoplanetary disc and trap conditions favour planetesimal\nformation, dust can still effectively accumulate and form planetesimals as the\ntrap moves. This leads to a positive correlation between the inward radial\nspeed and final planetesimal belt width, forming belts up to $\\sim$100 au over\n10 Myr of evolution. We show that although planetesimal formation is most\nefficient in low viscosity ($\\alpha = 10^{-4}$) discs with steep dust traps to\ntrigger the streaming instability, the large widths of most observed\nplanetesimal belts constrain $\\alpha$ to values $\\geq4\\times 10^{-4}$ at tens\nof au, otherwise the traps cannot migrate far enough. Additionally, the large\nspread in the widths and radii of exoKuiper belts could be due to different\ntrap migration speeds (or protoplanetary disc lifetimes) and different starting\nlocations, respectively. Our work serves as a first step to link exoKuiper\nbelts and rings in protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 10:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

As such contextual features are too diverse (across instances) to\nbe annotated, existing attempts simply exploit image labels as supervision to\nlearn them, resulting in various contextual tricks, such as features pyramid,\ncontext attention, etc. However, without carefully modeling the context's\nproperties, especially its relation to the object, their estimated context can\nsuffer from large inaccuracy. To amend this problem, we propose a novel\nContextual Latent Generative Model (Context-LGM), which considers the\nobject-context relation and models it in a hierarchical manner. Specifically,\nwe firstly introduce a latent generative model with a pair of correlated latent\nvariables to respectively model the object and context, and embed their\ncorrelation via the generative process. Then, to infer contextual features, we\nreformulate the objective function of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), where\ncontextual features are learned as a posterior distribution conditioned on the\nobject. Finally, to implement this contextual posterior, we introduce a\nTransformer that takes the object's information as a reference and locates\ncorrelated contextual factors.

The work is motivated by terrain covering applications in robotics, where\nthe goal is to find a set of efficient plans for a team of heterogeneous robots\nto cover a given area. Within this application, solving a polygon partitioning\nproblem is an essential stepping stone. Unlike previous work, the problem\nformulation proposed in this paper also considers a compactness metric of the\ngenerated sub-polygons, in addition to the area size constraints. Maximizing\nthe compactness of sub-polygons directly influences the optimality of any\ngenerated motion plans. Consequently, this increases the efficiency with which\nrobotic tasks can be performed within each sub-region. The proposed problem\nrepresentation is based on grid cell decomposition and a potential field model\nthat allows for the use of standard optimization techniques. A new algorithm,\nthe AreaDecompose algorithm, is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm\nincludes a number of existing and new optimization techniques combined with two\npost-processing methods. The approach has been evaluated on a set of randomly\ngenerated polygons which are then divided using different criteria and the\nresults have been compared with a state-of-the-art algorithm.

A common approach is to capture an impulse response in a\nhall and auralize it by convolving an input signal with the measured\nreverberant response. For immersive applications, it is typical to acquire\nspatial impulse responses using a spherical microphone array to capture the\nreverberant sound field. While this allows a listener to freely rotate their\nhead from the captured location during reproduction, delicate considerations\nmust be made to allow a full six degrees of freedom auralization. Furthermore,\nthe computational cost of convolution with a high-order Ambisonics impulse\nresponse remains prohibitively expensive for current real-time applications,\nwhere most of the resources are dedicated towards rendering graphics. For this\nreason, simplifications are often made in the reproduction of reverberation,\nsuch as using a uniform decay around the listener. However, recent work has\nhighlighted the importance of directional characteristics in the late\nreverberant sound field and more efficient reproduction methods have been\ndeveloped.

The CSI-free\nblind DNN detector mainly consists of two modules: one is the pre-processing\nmodule which is designed to address both the path loss and channel crosstalk\nissues caused by MIMO transmission, and the other is the feed-forward DNN\nmodule which is used for joint detection of spatial and constellation\ninformation by learning the statistics of both the input signal and the\nadditive noise.

We have followed the two-particle correlation (2PC) method to estimate\nthe elliptic flow ($v_2$) in different centrality classes in Pb-Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV for high-$S_0$, $S_0$-integrated and\nlow-$S_0$ events. We found that transverse spherocity successfully\ndifferentiates heavy-ion collisions event topology based on their geometrical\nshapes, i.e., high and low values of spherocity. The high-$S_0$ events have\nnearly zero elliptic flow, while the low-$S_0$ events contribute significantly\nto the elliptic flow of spherocity-integrated events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 12:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

In this work, we first\nprobe the previously unknown topology-imbalance issue, including its\ncharacteristics, causes, and threats to semi-supervised node classification\nlearning. We then provide a unified view to jointly analyzing the quantity- and\ntopology- imbalance issues by considering the node influence shift phenomenon\nwith the Label Propagation algorithm. In light of our analysis, we devise an\ninfluence conflict detection -- based metric Totoro to measure the degree of\ngraph topology imbalance and propose a model-agnostic method ReNode to address\nthe topology-imbalance issue by re-weighting the influence of labeled nodes\nadaptively based on their relative positions to class boundaries. Systematic\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method in\nrelieving topology-imbalance issue and promoting semi-supervised node\nclassification. The further analysis unveils varied sensitivity of different\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) to topology imbalance, which may serve as a new\nperspective in evaluating GNN architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 12:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

Giant planets are expected to form with near-zero obliquities. After its\nformation, some dynamical mechanism must therefore have tilted Saturn up to its\ncurrent obliquity of 26.7{\\deg}. This event is traditionally thought to have\nhappened more than 4 Gyrs ago during the late planetary migration because of\nthe crossing of a resonance between the spin-axis precession of Saturn and the\nnodal orbital precession mode of Neptune. Here, we show that the fast tidal\nmigration of Titan measured by Lainey et al. (2020) is incompatible with this\nscenario, and that it offers a new explanation for Saturn's current obliquity.\nA significant migration of Titan would prevent any early resonance,\ninvalidating previous constraints on the late planetary migration set by the\ntilting of Saturn. We propose instead that the resonance was encountered\nrecently, about 1 Gyr ago, forcing Saturn's obliquity to increase from a small\nvalue (possibly less than 3{\\deg}), up to its current state. This scenario\nsuggests that Saturn's normalised polar moment of inertia lies between 0.224\nand 0.237. Our findings bring out a new paradigm for the spin-axis evolution of\nSaturn, Jupiter, and possibly giant exoplanets in multiple systems, whereby\nobliquities are not settled once for all, but continuously evolve as a result\nof the migration of their satellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 13:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

Raman spectroscopy potentially provides such method,\ngiven the large amount of information about the state of the graphene that is\nencoded in its Raman spectrum.

Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we predict the carbon ejected\nin the winds and supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars at solar\nmetallicity. We find that binary-stripped stars are twice as efficient at\nproducing carbon (1.5-2.6 times, depending on choices on the slope of the\ninitial mass function and black hole formation).

The shrinking of the core disconnects\nthe outermost carbon-rich layers created during the early phase of helium\nburning from the more central burning regions. The same effect prevents carbon\ndestruction, even when the supernova shock wave passes.

The\nsyntactic foam under study here consists of hollow thermoplastic microspheres\n(HTMs) of two distinct grades (551 and 920), with distributions of mean-wall\nthicknesses and diameters, embedded inside a polyurethane matrix in various\nvolume fractions. Cyclic loading-unloading curves are recorded, revealing the\nlevel of viscoelasticity exhibited by the materials (which becomes a stronger\neffect with increasing volume fractions of HTMs) and indicating the level of\nrepeatability of loading under large strain. Samples are also subjected to\nmonotonic tensile loading in order to study their elongation at break. Higher\nvolume fractions of HTMs increase the stiffness of the material and whilst it\nis observed that the materials are highly elastic over a wide range of tensile\nstrains, damage arises at lower levels of strain for more highly filled\nmaterials. The HTM syntactic foams thus exhibit lower breaking strains compared\nto the neat matrix, which is attributed to matrix-microsphere interfacial\ndebonding. Furthermore, by employing optimization techniques, linear elastic\nproperties of the microspheres and an average shell thickness of the 551 grade\nare inferred by comparing experimental results to predictions from the\nGeneralized Self-Consistent Method, incorporating polydispersity data on the\nsize distribution of the microspheres.

They are\nfrequently developed with the intent of avoiding the outcome in question by\nintervening in response to estimated risks. Since risk scores are usually\ndeveloped in complex systems, interventions usually take the form of expert\nagents responding to estimated risks as they best see fit. In this case,\ninterventions may be complex and their effects difficult to observe or infer,\nmeaning that explicit specification of interventions in response to risk scores\nis impractical. Scope to modulate the aggregate model-intervention scheme so as\nto optimise an objective is hence limited. We propose an algorithm by which a\nmodel-intervention scheme can be developed by 'stacking' possibly unknown\nintervention effects. By repeatedly observing and updating the intervention and\nmodel, we show that this scheme leads to convergence or almost-convergence of\neventual outcome risk to an equivocal value for any initial value of\ncovariates. Our approach deploys a series of risk scores to expert agents, with\ninstructions to act on them in succession according to their best judgement.\nOur algorithm uses only observations of pre-intervention covariates and the\neventual outcome as input. It is not necessary to know or infer the effect of\nthe intervention, other than making a general assumption that it is\n'well-intentioned'. The algorithm can also be used to safely update risk scores\nin the presence of unknown interventions and concept drift. We demonstrate\nconvergence of expectation of outcome in a range of settings and show\nrobustness to errors in risk estimation and to concept drift. We suggest\nseveral practical applications and demonstrate a potential implementation by\nsimulation, showing that the algorithm leads to a fair distribution of outcome\nrisk across a population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 14:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 13:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

In the DDCS energy spectrum, electrons ejected through a\nbinary encounter collision result in peak at an energy predicted from momentum\nconservation.

However, theoretically, the\nbest known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum\ngames scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the\njoint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper\ninvestigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the\nsetting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and\n$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an\n$\\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\\max_{i\\le m} A_i / \\epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an\n$\\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\\max_{i\\le m} A_i^2 / \\epsilon^2)$ episodes.

Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an\nadversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along\nwith several novel designs in the outer loop.

To make full use of the multi-view data, multi-view learning\nplays an increasingly important role. Traditional multi-view learning methods\nrely on a large number of labeled and completed multi-view data. However, it is\nexpensive and time-consuming to obtain a large number of labeled multi-view\ndata in real-world applications. Moreover, multi-view data is often incomplete\nbecause of data collection failures, self-deficiency, or other reasons.\nTherefore, we may have to face the problem of fewer labeled and incomplete\nmulti-view data in real application scenarios. In this paper, a transductive\nsemi-supervised incomplete multi-view TSK fuzzy system modeling method\n(SSIMV_TSK) is proposed to address these challenges. First, in order to\nalleviate the dependency on labeled data and keep the model interpretable, the\nproposed method integrates missing view imputation, pseudo label learning of\nunlabeled data, and fuzzy system modeling into a single process to yield a\nmodel with interpretable fuzzy rules. Then, two new mechanisms, i.e. the\nbidirectional structural preservation of instance and label, as well as the\nadaptive multiple alignment collaborative learning, are proposed to improve the\nrobustness of the model. The proposed method has the following distinctive\ncharacteristics: 1) it can deal with the incomplete and few labeled multi-view\ndata simultaneously; 2) it integrates the missing view imputation and model\nlearning as a single process, which is more efficient than the traditional\ntwo-step strategy; 3) attributed to the interpretable fuzzy inference rules,\nthis method is more interpretable.

Therefore, we propose a multifocal approach to mitigate VAC in\nstereoscopic PM. Our primary technical contribution is to attach electrically\nfocus-tunable lenses (ETLs) to active shutter glasses to control both vergence\nand accommodation. Specifically, we apply fast and periodical focal sweeps to\nthe ETLs, which causes the \"virtual image'\" (as an optical term) of a scene\nobserved through the ETLs to move back and forth during each sweep period.

In this study, we\nsolve three technical issues that are unique to stereoscopic PM: (1) The 3D CG\nobject is displayed on non-planar and even moving surfaces; (2) the physical\nsurfaces need to be shown without the focus modulation; (3) the shutter glasses\nadditionally need to be synchronized with the ETLs and the projector.

Traditional inversion and data assimilation\nmethods are used to ingest this ERT data into hydrogeophysical models to\nestimate permeability. Due to ill-posedness and the curse of dimensionality,\nexisting inversion strategies provide poor estimates and low resolution of the\n3D permeability field. Recent advances in deep learning provide us with\npowerful algorithms to overcome this challenge. This paper presents a deep\nlearning (DL) framework to estimate the 3D subsurface permeability from\ntime-lapse ERT data. To test the feasibility of the proposed framework, we\ntrain DL-enabled inverse models on simulation data. Subsurface process models\nbased on hydrogeophysics are used to generate this synthetic data for deep\nlearning analyses. Results show that proposed weak supervised learning can\ncapture salient spatial features in the 3D permeability field. Quantitatively,\nthe average mean squared error (in terms of the natural log) on the strongly\nlabeled training, validation, and test datasets is less than 0.5. The R2-score\n(global metric) is greater than 0.75, and the percent error in each cell (local\nmetric) is less than 10%. Finally, an added benefit in terms of computational\ncost is that the proposed DL-based inverse model is at least O(104) times\nfaster than running a forward model. Note that traditional inversion may\nrequire multiple forward model simulations (e.g., in the order of 10 to 1000),\nwhich are very expensive. This computational savings (O(105) - O(107)) makes\nthe proposed DL-based inverse model attractive for subsurface imaging and\nreal-time ERT monitoring applications due to fast and yet reasonably accurate\nestimations of the permeability field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 04:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 17:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Yet in realistic situations the models are often\nunknown and what available are only measured time series. Meanwhile, many\nreal-world systems are dynamically stable, in the sense that the systems return\nto their equilibria in a short time after perturbations. This increases further\nthe difficulty of dynamics analysis, as many information of the system dynamics\nare lost once the system is settled onto the equilibrium states. The question\nwe ask is: given the transient time series of a complex dynamical system\nmeasured in the stable regime, can we infer from the data some properties of\nthe system dynamics and make predictions, e.g., predicting the critical point\nwhere the equilibrium state becomes unstable? We show that for the typical\ntransitions in system of coupled oscillators, including quorum sensing,\namplitude death and complete synchronization, this question can be addressed by\nthe technique of reservoir computing in machine learning. More specifically, by\nthe transient series acquired at several states in the stable regime, we\ndemonstrate that the trained machine is able to predict accurately not only the\ntransient behaviors of the system in the stable regime, but also the critical\npoint where the stable state becomes unstable. Considering the ubiquitous\nexistence of transient activities in natural and man-made systems, the findings\nmay have broad applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 03:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}
