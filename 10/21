This is key for M dwarfs, considering\nthat they manifest high activity levels and are primary targets for present and\nfuture searches of habitable Earth-like planets. Effective filtering of\nactivity is crucial to achieve the sensitivity required for small planet\ndetections. Here, we analyse the impact of selecting different line lists for\nleast-squares deconvolution on the dispersion in our RV data sets, to identify\nthe line list that most effectively reduces the jitter. We employ optical\nobservations of the active M dwarf EV Lac collected with ESPaDOnS and NARVAL,\nand study two line selection approaches: a parametric one based on line\nproperties and a randomised algorithm that samples the line combination space.\nWe test the latter further to find the line list that singles out the activity\nsignal from other sources of noise, and on AD Leo and DS Leo to examine its\nconsistency at mitigating jitter for different activity levels. The analysis is\ncomplemented with planetary injection tests. The parametric selection yields a\nRV RMS reduction of less than 10%, while the randomised selection a systematic\n>50% improvement, regardless of the activity level of the star examined.\nFurthermore, if activity is the dominant source of noise, this approach allows\nthe construction of lists containing mainly activity-sensitive lines, which\ncould be used to enhance the rotational modulation of the resulting data sets\nand determine the stellar rotation period more robustly. Finally, the output\nline lists allow the recovery of a synthetic planet (0.3-0.6 MJup on a 10 d\norbit) in the presence of both moderate (20 m/s semi-amplitude) and high (200\nm/s) activity levels, without affecting the planet signal substantially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In this\nframework, the exploration of two-nucleon transfer reactions in the 20Ne+116Cd\ncollision at energies above the Coulomb barrier is particularly relevant since\nthe 116Cd nucleus is a candidate for the double-beta decay. Methods: We\nmeasured the excitation energy spectra and absolute cross sections for the two\nreactions using the MAGNEX large acceptance magnetic spectrometer to detect the\nejectiles. We performed direct coupled reaction channels and sequential\ndistorted wave Born approximation calculations using the double folding S\\~ao\nPaulo potential to model the initial and final state interactions.

Further, such approaches may perform poorly when\napplied to unseen image domains. To cope with these limitations, both\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with full source supervision but without\ntarget supervision and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with partial supervision\nhave been proposed. While such methods are effective at aligning different\nfeature distributions, there is still a need to efficiently exploit unlabeled\ndata to address the performance gap with respect to fully-supervised methods.\nIn this paper we address semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for semantic\nsegmentation, where a large amount of labeled source data as well as a small\namount of labeled target data are available. We propose a novel and effective\ntwo-step semi-supervised dual-domain adaptation (SSDDA) approach to address\nboth cross- and intra-domain gaps in semantic segmentation. The proposed\nframework is comprised of two mixing modules. First, we conduct a cross-domain\nadaptation via an image-level mixing strategy, which learns to align the\ndistribution shift of features between the source data and target data. Second,\nintra-domain adaptation is achieved using a separate student-teacher network\nwhich is built to generate category-level data augmentation by mixing unlabeled\ntarget data in a way that respects predicted object boundaries. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two common\nsynthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks.

Dynamical properties of the MHD system involve\nnonlinear interactions of waves with multiple travelling speeds (the fast and\nslow magnetosonic waves, the Alfv\\'{e}n wave and the entropy wave). One\nintriguing topic is the shock phenomena accompanied by the magnetic field,\nwhich have been affirmed by astronomical observations. However, permitting the\nresidence of all above multi-speed waves, mathematically, whether one can prove\nshock formation for 3D MHD is still open. The multiple-speed nature of the MHD\nsystem makes it fascinating and challenging. In this paper, we give an\naffirmative answer to the above question. For 3D ideal compressible MHD, we\nconstruct examples of shock formation allowing the presence of all\ncharacteristic waves with multiple wave speeds. Building on our construction,\nwe further prove that the Cauchy problem for 3D ideal MHD is $H^2$ ill-posed.\nAnd this is caused by the instantaneous shock formation. In particular, when\nthe magnetic field is absent, we also provide a desired low-regularity\nill-posedness result for the 3D compressible Euler equations, and it is sharp\nwith respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity. Our proof for 3D MHD is\nbased on a coalition of a carefully designed algebraic approach and a geometric\napproach. To trace the nonlinear interactions of various waves, we\nalgebraically decompose the 3D ideal MHD equations into a $7\\times 7$\nnon-strictly hyperbolic system. Via detailed calculations, we reveal its hidden\nsubtle structures. With them we give a complete description of MHD dynamics up\nto the earliest singular event, when a shock forms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Strikingly, this trend allowed for the tuning of\nthe transition temperature down to room-temperature (300 K) whilst maintaining\na sharp transition in temperature, opening the door to the use of\nFe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ in functional devices. Crystallographic analysis through\nRietveld refinement of high-resolution x-ray diffraction data has showed that\narc-melted stoichiometric Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ is multi-phase regardless of\nannealing temperature with a minor phase of FeGa$_{3}$ decreasing in phase\nfraction at higher annealing temperature.

Coherent sets result\nfrom trajectories that stay closely together under the dynamics of the\nturbulent flow.

A detailed\nunderstanding of the physical processes involved in these layers is still\nlacking. For example, it is largely unknown why the outermost layer of the\nSun's atmosphere (the solar corona) is so much hotter than the photosphere by\nmillions of degrees. Astrophysicists think that the layer sandwiched between\nthe photosphere and the corona, known as the interface region, may hold the key\nto a better understanding of the nature of this enigma. With the help of\ncoordinated high-resolution, ground- and space-based observations from the\nSwedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) on La Palma, Spain, and NASA's Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), along\nwith the support from an advanced numerical simulation, I aim to unlock some of\nthe mysteries surrounding the dynamics of the interface region with a focus on\nsmall-scale jets, known as \"spicules\".

This motivates the central question of\nour work: how might we speed up such algorithms in spite of the impact of error\non NISQ computations? We demonstrate on quantum hardware that the estimation of\nexpectation values, a core subroutine of many quantum algorithms including VQE,\ncan be improved in terms of precision and accuracy by using a technique we call\nRobust Amplitude Estimation. Consequently, this method reduces the runtime to\nachieve the same mean-squared error compared to the standard\nprepare-and-measure estimation method. The surprising result is that by using\ndeeper, and therefore more error-prone, quantum circuits, we realize more\naccurate quantum computations in less time. As the quality of quantum devices\nimproves, this method will provide a proportional reduction in estimation\nruntime. This technique may be used to speed up quantum computations into the\nregime of early fault-tolerant quantum computation and aid in the realization\nof quantum advantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 17:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Recently, it has been shown that increasing a model's complexity\nby integrating an attention mechanism yields more expressive architectures.\nThis is majorly contributed to steering the nodes' representations only towards\nnodes that are more informative than others. Transformer models in combination\nwith GNNs result in architectures including Graph Transformer Layers (GTL),\nwhere layers are entirely based on the attention operation.

Much of computational chemistry\nfocuses on this very principle, but metallic materials are rarely analyzed\nusing these techniques owing to the assumption that they are delocalized and do\nnot possess inherent functionality. In this paper, we propose a methodology\nthat recovers functional groups in metallic materials from an energy\nperspective. We characterize neighborhoods associated with functional groups in\nmetals by observing the evolution of Bader energy of the central cluster as a\nfunction of cluster size. This approach can be used to conceptually decompose\nmetallic structure into meaningful chemical neighborhoods allowing for\nlocalization of energy-dependent properties. The generalizability of this\napproach is assessed by determining neighborhoods for crystalline materials of\ndifferent structure types, and significant structural defects such as grain\nboundaries and dislocations. In all cases, we observe that the neighborhood\nsize may be universal - around 2-3 atomic diameters. In its practical sense,\nthis approach opens the door to the application of chemical concepts, e.g.,\norbital methods, to investigate a broad range of metallurgical phenomena, one\nneighborhood at a time\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 17:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Stream interaction regions (SIRs) are a common cause of\neast-west flow deflections. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may be associated\nwith non-radial flows in at least two different ways: 1) the deflection of the\nsolar wind in the sheath region, especially close to the magnetic ejecta front\nboundary, may result in large non-radial flows, 2) the expansion of the\nmagnetic ejecta may include a non-radial component which should be easily\nmeasured when the ejecta is crossed away from its central axis.\n  In this work, we first present general statistics of non-radial solar wind\nflows as measured by STEREO/PLASTIC throughout the first 13 years of the\nmission, focusing on solar cycle variation. We then focus on the larger\ndeflection flow angles and determine that most of these are associated with\nSIRs near solar minimum and with CMEs near solar maximum.

The best-known heuristic quantum\nalgorithm for combinatorial optimization on gate-based devices, the Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), has been the subject of many\ntheoretical and empirical studies. Unfortunately, its application to specific\ncombinatorial optimization problems poses several difficulties: among these,\nfew performance guarantees are known, and the variational nature of the\nalgorithm makes it necessary to classically optimize a number of parameters. In\nthis work, we partially address these issues for a specific combinatorial\noptimization problem: diluted spin models, with MAX-CUT as a notable special\ncase. Specifically, generalizing the analysis of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nmodel by Farhi et al., we establish an explicit algorithm to evaluate the\nperformance of QAOA on MAX-CUT applied to random Erdos-Renyi graphs of expected\ndegree $d$ for an arbitrary constant number of layers $p$ and as the problem\nsize tends to infinity. This analysis yields an explicit mapping between QAOA\nparameters for MAX-CUT on Erdos-Renyi graphs of expected degree $d$, in the\nlimit $d \\to \\infty$, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and gives good\nQAOA variational parameters for MAX-CUT applied to Erdos-Renyi graphs. We then\npartially generalize the latter analysis to graphs with a degree distribution\nrather than a single degree $d$, and finally to diluted spin-models with\n$D$-body interactions ($D \\geq 3$). We validate our results with numerical\nexperiments suggesting they may have a larger reach than rigorously\nestablished; among other things, our algorithms provided good initial, if not\nnearly optimal, variational parameters for very small problem instances where\nthe infinite-size limit assumption is clearly violated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 17:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

The first\nscenario, Type I, requires a mathematically consistent Kaluza-Klein style\ntruncation down to a theory in the lower dimension, in which case solutions\npurely within that reduced theory exist. However, that situation is not a\ngenuine localisation of gravity because all such solutions have\nhigher-dimensional source extensions according to the Kaluza-Klein ansatz.\nAlso, there is no meaningful notion of Newton's constant for such Type I\nconstructions.\n  Types II and III admit coupling to genuinely localised sources in the\nhigher-dimensional theory, with corresponding solutions involving full sets of\nhigher-dimensional modes. Type II puts no specific boundary conditions near the\nworldvolume aside from regularity away from sources. In a case where the wave\nequation separated in the non-compact space transverse to the worldvolume\nadmits a normalisable zero mode, the Type III scenario requires boundary\nconditions near the worldvolume that permit the inclusion of that zero mode in\nmode expansions for gravitational wave fluctuations or potentials.

To promote DERs,\nfeed-in-tariff (FIT) is usually adopted by utilities to pay DER owners certain\nfixed rates for supplying energy to the grid. An alternative to FIT is a\nmarket-based approach; that is, consumers and DER owners trade energy in an\nauction-based peer-to-peer (P2P) market, and the rates are determined based on\nsupply and demand. However, the auction complexity and market participants'\nbounded rationality may invalidate many well-established theories on auction\ndesign and hinder market development.

Using this analogue, we show that assuming the Rich $2$-to-$1$\nGames Conjecture, (a) there is an $r$-ary CSP $\\mathcal{P}_r$ for which it is\nNP-hard to distinguish satisfiable instances of the CSP and instances that are\nat most $\\frac{2r+1}{2^r} + o(1)$ satisfiable, and (b) hardness of\ndistinguishing $3$-colorable graphs, and graphs that do not contain an\nindependent set of size $o(1)$.\n  2.

To automate the treatment\nplanning process, we propose a meta-optimization framework, called MetaPlanner\n(MP). Methods: Our MP algorithm automates planning by performing optimization\nof treatment planning hyperparameters. The algorithm uses a derivative-free\nmethod (i.e. parallel Nelder-Mead simplex search) to search for weight\nconfigurations that minimize a meta-scoring function. Meta-scoring is performed\nby constructing a tier list of the relevant considerations (e.g. dose\nhomogeneity, conformity, spillage, and OAR sparing) to mimic the clinical\ndecision-making process.

Results: The proposed MP method is evaluated on two\ndatasets (21 prostate cases and 6 head and neck cases) collected as part of\nclinical workflow.

MP in both IMRT and VMAT scenarios has\ncomparable or better performance than manual VMAT planning for all evaluated\nmetrics.

Registers are not addressable in the same way\nmemory is, which makes them immune from memory attacks and manipulation by\nother means. In this paper, we take advantage of this to provide a protection\nmechanism for critical program data; both active local variables and control\nobjects on the stack. This protection effectively eliminates the threat of\ncontrol- and data-oriented attacks, even by adversaries with full knowledge of\nthe active stack. Our solution RegGuard, is a compiler register allocation\nstrategy that utilises the available CPU registers to hold critical variables\nduring execution. Unlike conventional allocations schemes, RegGuard prioritises\nthe security significance of a program variable over its expected performance\ngain. Our scheme can deal effectively with saved registers to the stack, i.e.,\nwhen the compiler needs to free up registers to make room for the variables of\na new function call. With RegGuard, critical data objects anywhere on the\nentire stack are effectively protected from corruption, even by adversaries\nwith arbitrary read and write access. While our primary design focus is on\nsecurity, performance is very important for a scheme to be adopted in practice.\nRegGuard is still benefiting from the performance gain normally associated with\nregister allocations, and the overhead is within a few percent of other\nunsecured register allocation schemes for most cases.

We find that there are two circumbinary rings orbiting with\nprojected velocities of $84.6\\pm1.0$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ and\n$27.3\\pm0.6$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. Deprojecting these velocities from the\nline-of-sight, and using updated binary masses presented by\n\\cite{Porter2021GGPhotometry}, we find that the radii of the circumbinary rings\nare $2.8^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$\\,AU and $27^{+9}_{-10}$\\,AU for the inner ring and\nouter ring respectively. We find evidence of subtle dynamical change in the\ninner circumbinary ring over the 17 years spanned by the data, manifesting in\nvariability in the ratio of the intensity of the blueshifted peak to the\nredshifted peak of its emission lines and the central velocity becoming more\nblueshifted. We perform smoothed-particle hydrodynamic simulations of the\nsystem which suggest that these observed changes are consistent with pumping of\nthe eccentricity of a radially thin circumbinary ring by the inner binary.

However, the crucial evidence for enhancing\nthermoelectric-figure-of-merit (zT) by SF has not been reported until now. Here\nwe report evidence for such enhancement in the ferromagnetic CrTe. The SF leads\nto nearly 80% zT enhancement in ferromagnetic CrTe near and below TC~335 K. The\nferromagnetism in CrTe is originated from the collective electronic and\nlocalized magnetic moments. The field-dependent transport properties\ndemonstrate the profound impact of SF on the electrons and phonons. The SF\nsimultaneously enhances the thermopower and reduces the thermal conductivity.\nUnder an external magnetic field, the enhancement in thermopower is suppressed,\nand the thermal conductivity is enhanced, evidencing the existence of a strong\nSF near and below TC. The anomalous thermoelectric transport properties are\nanalyzed based on theoretical models, and a good agreement with experimental\ndata is found.

Chest X-Ray (CXR) is the first line imaging test for\nCOVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis as it is fast, cheap and easily accessible.\nInspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in computer vision, many\nDL-models have been proposed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia using CXR images.\nUnfortunately, these deep classifiers lack the transparency in interpreting\nfindings, which may limit their applications in clinical practice. The existing\ncommonly used visual explanation methods are either too noisy or imprecise,\nwith low resolution, and hence are unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. In this\nwork, we propose a novel explainable deep learning framework (CXRNet) for\naccurate COVID-19 pneumonia detection with an enhanced pixel-level visual\nexplanation from CXR images. The proposed framework is based on a new\nEncoder-Decoder-Encoder multitask architecture, allowing for both disease\nclassification and visual explanation. The method has been evaluated on real\nworld CXR datasets from both public and private data sources, including:\nhealthy, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia cases The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a\nsatisfactory level of accuracy and provide fine-resolution classification\nactivation maps for visual explanation in lung disease detection. The Average\nAccuracy, the Precision, Recall and F1-score of COVID-19 pneumonia reached\n0.879, 0.985, 0.992 and 0.989, respectively. We have also found that using lung\nsegmented (CXR) images can help improve the performance of the model. The\nproposed method can provide more detailed high resolution visual explanation\nfor the classification decision, compared to current state-of-the-art visual\nexplanation methods and has a great potential to be used in clinical practice\nfor COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 22:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

The main contribution of this paper is to achieve theoretical\nbounds on the performance of local mechanisms with different timing properties.\nWe show that an algorithm that waits to thicken the market, called the\n$\\textit{Patient}$ algorithm, is exponentially better than the\n$\\textit{Greedy}$ algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that matches agents greedily.\nThis means that waiting has substantial benefits on maximizing a matching over\na bipartite network.

However, adverse gravity conditions and challenging terrain\ngeometry expose the limitations of traditional robot designs, which are often\nforced to sacrifice one of mobility or manipulation capabilities to attain the\nother. Prospective climbing operations in these environments reveals a need for\nsmall, compact robots capable of versatile mobility and manipulation. We\npropose a novel robotic concept called ReachBot that fills this need by\ncombining two existing technologies: extendable booms and mobile manipulation.\nReachBot leverages the reach and tensile strength of extendable booms to\nachieve an outsized reachable workspace and wrench capability. Through their\nlightweight, compactable structure, these booms also reduce mass and complexity\ncompared to traditional rigid-link articulated-arm designs. Using these\nadvantages, ReachBot excels in mobile manipulation missions in low gravity or\nthat require climbing, particularly when anchor points are sparse. After\nintroducing the ReachBot concept, we discuss modeling approaches and strategies\nfor increasing stability and robustness.

In nature,\nthis process leads to temperature in a band exceeding the unstable stationary\ntemperature, above which the self-blown-up shear-heating process in the shear\nband occurs after finishing the PT. Without PT and TRIP, significant\ntemperature and strain rate increase is impossible. Due to the much smaller\nband thickness in the laboratory, heating within the band does not occur, and\nplastic flow after the PT is very limited.

In this paper, we propose class-discriminative\ncompression (CDC), which injects class discrimination in both pruning and\ndistillation to facilitate the CNNs training goal. We first study the\neffectiveness of a group of discriminant functions for channel pruning, where\nwe include well-known single-variate binary-class statistics like Student's\nT-Test in our study via an intuitive generalization. We then propose a novel\nlayer-adaptive hierarchical pruning approach, where we use a coarse class\ndiscrimination scheme for early layers and a fine one for later layers. This\nmethod naturally accords with the fact that CNNs process coarse semantics in\nthe early layers and extract fine concepts at the later. Moreover, we leverage\ndiscriminant component analysis (DCA) to distill knowledge of intermediate\nrepresentations in a subspace with rich discriminative information, which\nenhances hidden layers' linear separability and classification accuracy of the\nstudent. Combining pruning and distillation, CDC is evaluated on CIFAR and\nILSVRC 2012, where we consistently outperform the state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 02:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

The two references are digitally fused using carefully designed\ncontrol systems, attempting minimal or no changes to the baseline LISA mission\nhardware. The interferometer arm(s) provides the most stable reference\navailable in the LISA science band (0.1 mHz - 1 Hz), while the cavity sensor's\nwide-band and linear readout enables additional control system gain below and\nabove the LISA band. The main technical issue with this dual sensor approach is\nthe undesirable slow laser frequency pulling which couples into the control\nsystem with the imperfect knowledge of the Doppler shift of the light due to\nrelative spacecraft motion along the LISA arm. This paper outlines requirements\non the Doppler shift knowledge to maintain the cavity well within the resonance\nwhen activating the fused control system. Two Doppler shift estimation methods\nare presented that use the already on-board measurements, the inter-spacecraft\ninterferometer link (the main science measurement), and the absolute\ninter-spacecraft laser ranging system.

We show that when the source regions of different species\nare offset by a distance comparable to the size of the source regions, the\nobserved energetic particle composition He/H can be strongly variable over more\nthan two orders of magnitude, even if the source ratio is at the nominal value.\nAssuming a $^3$He/$^4$He source ratio of $10 \\%$ in impulsive $^3$He-rich\nevents and the same spatial offset of the source regions, the $^3$He/$^4$He\nratio at observation sites also vary considerably. The variability of the ion\ncomposition ratios depends on the radial distance, which can be tested by\nobservations made at different radial locations. We discuss the implication of\nthese results on the variability of ion composition of impulsive events and on\nfurther PSP and Solar Orbiter observations close to the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 03:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The products have qualities drawn i.i.d. from a common\nprior. The principal aims to choose the better product, but the quality of a\nproduct can only be estimated via a coarse-grained threshold test: for chosen\n$\\theta$, the principal learns whether a product's quality exceeds $\\theta$ or\nnot.\n  We study this problem under two types of interactions. In the first, the\nprincipal does the testing herself, and can choose tests from a class of\nallowable tests. We show that the optimum strategy for the principal is to\nadminister different tests to the two products: one which is passed with\nprobability $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the other with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. If,\nhowever, the principal is required to choose the tests in a symmetric manner\n(i.e., via an i.i.d.~distribution), then the optimal strategy is to choose\ntests whose probability of passing is drawn uniformly from $[\\frac{1}{4},\n\\frac{3}{4}]$.\n  In our second model, test difficulties are selected endogenously by the\nfirms. This corresponds to a setting in which the firms must commit to their\ntesting procedures before knowing the quality of their products. This\ninteraction naturally gives rise to a signaling game; we characterize the\nunique Bayes-Nash Equilibrium of this game, which happens to be symmetric. We\nthen calculate its Price of Anarchy in terms of the principal's probability of\nchoosing the worse product. Finally, we show that by restricting both firms'\nset of available thresholds to choose from, the principal can lower the Price\nof Anarchy of the resulting equilibrium; however, there is a limit, in that for\nevery (common) restricted set of tests, the equilibrium failure probability is\nstrictly larger than under the optimal i.i.d. distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 04:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Many existing matting\nmethods require a hand-made trimap to provide auxiliary information, which is\nvery expensive and limits the real world usage. Recently, some trimap-free\nmethods have been proposed, which completely get rid of any user input.\nHowever, their performance lag far behind trimap-based methods due to the lack\nof guidance information. In this paper, we propose a matting method that use\nFlexible Guidance Input as user hint, which means our method can use trimap,\nscribblemap or clickmap as guidance information or even work without any\nguidance input. To achieve this, we propose Progressive Trimap Deformation(PTD)\nscheme that gradually shrink the area of the foreground and background of the\ntrimap with the training step increases and finally become a scribblemap. To\nmake our network robust to any user scribble and click, we randomly sample\npoints on foreground and background and perform curve fitting. Moreover, we\npropose Semantic Fusion Module(SFM) which utilize the Feature Pyramid\nEnhancement Module(FPEM) and Joint Pyramid Upsampling(JPU) in matting task for\nthe first time.

Feature-based\ntime-series analysis can now be performed using many different feature sets,\nincluding hctsa (7730 features: Matlab), feasts (42 features: R), tsfeatures\n(63 features: R), Kats (40 features: Python), tsfresh (up to 1558 features:\nPython), TSFEL (390 features: Python), and the C-coded catch22 (22 features:\nMatlab, R, Python, and Julia). There is substantial overlap in the types of\nmethods included in these sets (e.g., properties of the autocorrelation\nfunction and Fourier power spectrum), but they are yet to be systematically\ncompared. Here we compare these seven sets on computational speed, assess the\nredundancy of features contained in each, and evaluate the overlap and\nredundancy between them. We take an empirical approach to feature similarity\nbased on outputs across a diverse set of real-world and simulated time series.\nWe find that feature sets vary across three orders of magnitude in their\ncomputation time per feature on a laptop for a 1000-sample series, from the\nfastest sets catch22 and TSFEL (~0.1ms per feature) to tsfeatures (~3s per\nfeature). Using PCA to evaluate feature redundancy within each set, we find the\nhighest within-set redundancy for TSFEL and tsfresh. For example, in TSFEL, 90%\nof the variance across 390 features can be captured with just four PCs.\nFinally, we introduce a metric for quantifying overlap between pairs of feature\nsets, which indicates substantial overlap. We found that the largest feature\nset, hctsa, is the most comprehensive, and that tsfresh is the most\ndistinctive, due to its incorporation of many low-level Fourier coefficients.\nOur results provide empirical understanding of the differences between existing\nfeature sets, information that can be used to better tailor feature sets to\ntheir applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 06:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

It creates a set of pseudo labels for the\ntarget domain to give explicit supervision. However, the pseudo labels are\nnoisy, sparse and do not provide any information about inter-pixel\ncorrelations. We regard inter-pixel correlation quite important because\nsemantic segmentation is a task of predicting highly structured pixel-level\noutputs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of transferring the\ninter-pixel correlations from the source domain to the target domain via a\nself-attention module. The module takes the prediction of the segmentation\nnetwork as an input and creates a self-attended prediction that correlates\nsimilar pixels. The module is trained only on the source domain to learn the\ndomain-invariant inter-pixel correlations, then later, it is used to train the\nsegmentation network on the target domain. The network learns not only from the\npseudo labels but also by following the output of the self-attention module\nwhich provides additional knowledge about the inter-pixel correlations. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our method significantly improves the\nperformance on two standard UDA benchmarks and also can be combined with recent\nstate-of-the-art method to achieve better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 06:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Experimental results demonstrate that CATRO achieves higher accuracy\nwith similar computation cost or lower computation cost with similar accuracy\nthan other state-of-the-art channel pruning algorithms.

In the context of recommender systems, a typical goal of such\npoisoning attacks is to promote the adversary's target items by interfering\nwith the training dataset and/or process. Hence, a common practice is to\nsubsume recommender systems under the decentralized federated learning\nparadigm, which enables all user devices to collaboratively learn a global\nrecommender while retaining all the sensitive data locally. Without exposing\nthe full knowledge of the recommender and entire dataset to end-users, such\nfederated recommendation is widely regarded `safe' towards poisoning attacks.\nIn this paper, we present a systematic approach to backdooring federated\nrecommender systems for targeted item promotion. The core tactic is to take\nadvantage of the inherent popularity bias that commonly exists in data-driven\nrecommenders. As popular items are more likely to appear in the recommendation\nlist, our innovatively designed attack model enables the target item to have\nthe characteristics of popular items in the embedding space. Then, by uploading\ncarefully crafted gradients via a small number of malicious users during the\nmodel update, we can effectively increase the exposure rate of a target\n(unpopular) item in the resulted federated recommender. Evaluations on two\nreal-world datasets show that 1) our attack model significantly boosts the\nexposure rate of the target item in a stealthy way, without harming the\naccuracy of the poisoned recommender; and 2) existing defenses are not\neffective enough, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local\nmodel poisoning attacks to federated recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 06:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

This arises the\nquestion: are current RL algorithms capable of solving MAB problems? We claim\nthat the surprising answer is no. In our experiments we show that in some\nsituations they fail to solve a basic MAB problem, and in many common\nsituations they have a hard time: They suffer from regression in results during\ntraining, sensitivity to initialization and high sample complexity. We claim\nthat this stems from variance differences between policies, which causes two\nproblems: The first problem is the \"Boring Policy Trap\" where each policy have\na different implicit exploration depends on its rewards variance, and leaving a\nboring, or low variance, policy is less likely due to its low implicit\nexploration. The second problem is the \"Manipulative Consultant\" problem, where\nvalue-estimation functions used in deep RL algorithms such as DQN or deep Actor\nCritic methods, maximize estimation precision rather than mean rewards, and\nhave a better loss in low-variance policies, which cause the network to\nconverge to a sub-optimal policy. Cognitive experiments on humans showed that\nnoised reward signals may paradoxically improve performance. We explain this\nusing the aforementioned problems, claiming that both humans and algorithms may\nshare similar challenges in decision making.\n  Inspired by this result, we propose the Adaptive Symmetric Reward Noising\n(ASRN) method, by which we mean equalizing the rewards variance across\ndifferent policies, thus avoiding the two problems without affecting the\nenvironment's mean rewards behavior. We demonstrate that the ASRN scheme can\ndramatically improve the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

It is found that the\nflare had a conjugate compact footpoint brightenings, which correspond to the\nfootpoints of the sigmoid. Furthermore, observational evidence of explosive\nevaporation is well diagnosed at the conjugate footpoint brightenings in the\nimpulsive phase of the flare. After the flare, continuous cool condensations\nformed at about the middle section of the sigmoid and then moved in opposite\ndirections along the sigmoid, eventually leading to the formation of the\nfilament. These observations suggest that magnetic reconnection not only can\nform the magnetic field structure of the filament, but also heat their\nchromospheric footpoints during their formation and drive chromospheric\nevaporation. As a result, the heated chromospheric plasma may be evaporated\ninto the magnetic field structure of the filament, where the accumulated hot\nplasma might suffer from thermal instability or thermal non-equilibrium,\ncausing catastrophic cooling and coronal condensation to form the cool dense\nmaterial of the filament.

In this paper, we propose a low latency\nand lightweight network for simultaneous face detection, landmark localization\nand head pose estimation. Inspired by the observation that it is more\nchallenging to locate the facial landmarks for faces with large angles, a pose\nloss is proposed to constrain the learning. Moreover, we also propose an\nuncertainty multi-task loss to learn the weights of individual tasks\nautomatically.

These datasets contain images from a ground level\nviewpoint, whereas an ideal view for intersection observation would be elevated\nhigher above the road surface. We develop an alternative approach using a\nweakly supervised method of fine tuning 3D object detectors for traffic\nobservation cameras; showing in the process that large existing autonomous\nvehicle datasets can be leveraged for pre-training. To fine-tune the monocular\n3D object detector, our method utilises multiple 2D detections from\noverlapping, wide-baseline views and a loss that encodes the subjacent\ngeometric consistency. Our method achieves vehicle 7DoF pose prediction\naccuracy on our dataset comparable to the top performing monocular 3D object\ndetectors on autonomous vehicle datasets.

We show that\nthis algorithm is essentially optimal by proving that the problem is\n$\\mathsf{W}_l[1]$-hard with parameter $k$.\n  We also consider the minimum-cost popular assignment problem when there are\nedge costs, and show its $\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness even when all edge costs are in\n$\\{0,1\\}$ and agents have strict preferences. By contrast, we propose a\npolynomial-time algorithm to the problem of deciding if there exists a popular\nassignment with a given set of forced/forbidden edges (this tractability holds\neven for partially ordered preferences). Our algorithms are combinatorial and\nbased on LP duality. They search for an appropriate witness or dual\ncertificate, and when a certificate cannot be found, we prove that the desired\nassignment does not exist in $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 08:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 10:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

(i.e.,\ndistributed differently between the peers) and (2) malicious, or Byzantine,\nattackers can share arbitrary model updates with other peers to subvert the\ntraining process.\n  We address these two challenges and present Bristle, middleware between the\nlearning application and the decentralized network layer. Bristle leverages\ntransfer learning to predetermine and freeze the non-output layers of a neural\nnetwork, significantly speeding up model training and lowering communication\ncosts. To securely update the output layer with model updates from other peers,\nwe design a fast distance-based prioritizer and a novel performance-based\nintegrator.

The framework\nconnects these principles to the decision theory and is applied to determine\nwhether such an approach can reproduce the following phenomena: When two\npedestrians travel on crossing paths, (a) their interaction is sensitive to\ninitial asymmetries, and (b) based on which, they rapidly resolve collision\nconflict by adapting their behaviors.

This is possible by phrasing (time-varying) graph learning\nas a composite optimization problem, where different functions regulate\ndifferent desiderata, e.g., data fidelity, sparsity or smoothness. Instrumental\nfor the findings is recognizing that the dependence of the majority (if not\nall) data-driven graph learning algorithms on the data is exerted through the\nempirical covariance matrix, representing a sufficient statistic for the\nestimation problem. Its user-defined recursive update enables the framework to\nwork in non-stationary environments, while iterative algorithms building on\nnovel time-varying optimization tools explicitly take into account the temporal\ndynamics, speeding up convergence and implicitly including a\ntemporal-regularization of the solution.

Building a powerful GNN model is not a trivial task,\nas it requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources,\nand human expertise in fine-tuning the model. Moreover, with the development of\nadversarial attacks, e.g., model stealing attacks, GNNs raise challenges to\nmodel authentication. To avoid copyright infringement on GNNs, verifying the\nownership of the GNN models is necessary.\n  This paper presents a watermarking framework for GNNs for both graph and node\nclassification tasks. We 1) design two strategies to generate watermarked data\nfor the graph classification task and one for the node classification task, 2)\nembed the watermark into the host model through training to obtain the\nwatermarked GNN model, and 3) verify the ownership of the suspicious model in a\nblack-box setting. The experiments show that our framework can verify the\nownership of GNN models with a very high probability (up to $99\\%$) for both\ntasks. Finally, we experimentally show that our watermarking approach is robust\nagainst a state-of-the-art model extraction technique and four state-of-the-art\ndefenses against backdoor attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 09:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 21:17:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 11:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 09:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 16:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Many authors have used fuzzy SBM and\nstochastic SBM to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, and many have used these\napproaches to deal with ambiguous and uncertain data. However, some ambiguous\nand uncertain data can not be taken as fuzzy logic and stochastic data due to\nthe huge set of rules which must be given to construct a conceptual method.

Historically, CNNs have demonstrated a strong dependency on powerful\nhardware for real-time classification, yet the need for deployment on weaker\nembedded devices is greater than ever. The work in this paper proposes a\nmethodology for reconstructing and tuning conventional image classification\nmodels, using EfficientNets, to decrease their parameterisation with no\ntrade-off in model accuracy and develops a pipeline through TensorRT for\naccelerating such models to run at real-time on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded\ndevice. The train-deployment discrepancy, relating how poor data augmentation\nleads to a discrepancy in model accuracy between training and deployment, is\noften neglected in many papers and thus the work is extended by analysing and\nevaluating the impact real world perturbations had on model accuracy once\ndeployed. The scope of the work concerns developing a more efficient variant of\nWasteNet, a collaborative recycling classification model. The newly developed\nmodel scores a test-set accuracy of 95.8% with a real world accuracy of 95%, a\n14% increase over the original.

With the recent\ndevelopment of deep learning and the publication of camera lane datasets and\nbenchmarks, camera lane detection networks (CLDNs) have been remarkably\ndeveloped. Unfortunately, CLDNs rely on camera images which are often distorted\nnear the vanishing line and prone to poor lighting condition. This is in\ncontrast with Lidar lane detection networks (LLDNs), which can directly extract\nthe lane lines on the bird's eye view (BEV) for motion planning and operate\nrobustly under various lighting conditions. However, LLDNs have not been\nactively studied, mostly due to the absence of large public lidar lane\ndatasets. In this paper, we introduce KAIST-Lane (K-Lane), the world's first\nand the largest public urban road and highway lane dataset for Lidar. K-Lane\nhas more than 15K frames and contains annotations of up to six lanes under\nvarious road and traffic conditions, e.g., occluded roads of multiple occlusion\nlevels, roads at day and night times, merging (converging and diverging) and\ncurved lanes.

LLDN-GFC exploits the\nspatial characteristics of lane lines on the point cloud, which are sparse,\nthin, and stretched along the entire ground plane of the point cloud. From\nexperimental results, LLDN-GFC achieves the state-of-the-art performance with\nan F1- score of 82.1%, on the K-Lane. Moreover, LLDN-GFC shows strong\nperformance under various lighting conditions, which is unlike CLDNs, and also\nrobust even in the case of severe occlusions, unlike LLDNs using the\nconventional CNN.

In this\npaper, we propose a methodical approach to analyze the affect of various\nparameters on rainfall. Our study uses $5$ years of meteorological data from a\nweather station located in the United States. The correlation and\ninterdependence among the collected meteorological features were obtained.\nAdditionally, we identified the most important meteorological features for\nrainfall prediction using a machine learning-based feature selection technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 11:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

To achieve\nthis, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic\nsemantic segmentation and collect DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset\nfor panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to\nstudy the Pinhole-to-Panoramic domain shift and accompanied with pinhole camera\ntraining examples obtained from Cityscapes.

Recently, several\nneural architecture search (NAS) algorithms have been proposed for HSI\nclassification, which further improve the accuracy of HSI classification to a\nnew level. In this paper, NAS and Transformer are combined for handling HSI\nclassification task for the first time. Compared with previous work, the\nproposed method has two main differences.

However, their reliability is heavily plagued by adversarial inputs:\nsmall input perturbations that cause the model to produce erroneous outputs.\nAdversarial inputs can occur naturally when the system's environment behaves\nrandomly, even in the absence of a malicious adversary, and are a severe cause\nfor concern when attempting to deploy neural networks within critical systems.\nIn this paper, we present a new statistical method, called Robustness\nMeasurement and Assessment (RoMA), which can measure the expected robustness of\na neural network model. Specifically, RoMA determines the probability that a\nrandom input perturbation might cause misclassification. The method allows us\nto provide formal guarantees regarding the expected frequency of errors that a\ntrained model will encounter after deployment. Our approach can be applied to\nlarge-scale, black-box neural networks, which is a significant advantage\ncompared to recently proposed verification methods. We apply our approach in\ntwo ways: comparing the robustness of different models, and measuring how a\nmodel's robustness is affected by the magnitude of input perturbation. One\ninteresting insight obtained through this work is that, in a classification\nnetwork, different output labels can exhibit very different robustness levels.\nWe term this phenomenon categorial robustness.

In this letter,\nwe consider the downlink transmission from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to\na single-antenna user, by exploiting the cooperative passive beamforming (CPB)\nand line-of-sight (LoS) path diversity gains of multi-IRS signal reflection.\nUnlike existing works where only one single multi-IRS reflection path from the\nBS to user is selected, we propose a new and more general multi-path beam\nrouting scheme. Specifically, the BS sends the user's information signal via\nmultiple orthogonal active beams (termed as active beam splitting), which point\ntowards different IRSs. Then, these beamed signals are subsequently reflected\nby selected IRSs via their CPB in different paths, and finally coherently\ncombined at the user's receiver (thus named {\\it \\textbf{passive beam\ncombining}}). For this scheme, we formulate a new multi-path beam routing\ndesign problem to jointly optimize the number of IRS reflection paths, the\nselected IRSs for each of the reflection paths, the active/passive beamforming\nat the BS/each selected IRS, as well as the BS's power allocation over\ndifferent active beams, so as to maximize the received signal power at the\nuser. To solve this challenging problem, we first derive the optimal BS/IRS\nbeamforming and BS power allocation for a given set of reflection paths. The\nclique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining\nmulti-path selection problem efficiently. Simulation results show that our\nproposed multi-path beam routing scheme significantly outperforms its\nconventional single-path beam routing special case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 12:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Measurement invariance is typically\nassessed by differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, i.e., detecting DIF\nitems whose response distribution depends on not only the latent trait measured\nby the instrument but also the group membership. DIF analysis is confounded by\nthe group difference in the latent trait distributions. Many DIF analyses\nrequire knowing several anchor items that are DIF-free to draw inferences on\nwhether each of the rest is a DIF item, where the anchor items are used to\nidentify the latent trait distributions. When no prior information on anchor\nitems is available, item purification methods and regularized estimation\nmethods can be used. The former iteratively purifies the anchor set by a\nstepwise model selection procedure, and the latter selects the DIF-free items\nby a LASSO-type regularization approach. Unfortunately, unlike the methods\nbased on a correctly specified anchor set, these methods are not guaranteed to\nprovide valid statistical inference (e.g., confidence intervals and\n$p$-values). In this paper, we propose a new method for DIF analysis under a\nmultiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) model for DIF. This method\nadopts a minimal $L_1$ norm condition for identifying the latent trait\ndistributions. Without requiring prior knowledge about an anchor set, it can\naccurately estimate the DIF effects of individual items and further draw valid\nstatistical inferences for quantifying the uncertainty. Specifically, the\ninference results allow us to control the type-I error for DIF detection, which\nmay not be possible with item purification and regularized estimation methods.\nThe proposed method is applied to analyzing the three personality scales of the\nEysenck personality questionnaire - revised (EPQ-R).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 12:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 11:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Mean-field theories of spin models on networks constitute a\nfundamental tool to tackle this problem and a cornerstone of statistical\nphysics, with an impressive number of applications in condensed matter,\nbiology, and computer science. In this work we derive the mean-field equations\nfor the equilibrium behavior of vector spin models on high-connectivity random\nnetworks with an arbitrary degree distribution and with randomly weighted\nlinks. We demonstrate that the high-connectivity limit of spin models on\nnetworks is not universal in that it depends on the full degree distribution.\nSuch nonuniversal behavior is akin to a remarkable mechanism that leads to the\nbreakdown of the central limit theorem when applied to the distribution of\neffective local fields. Traditional mean-field theories on fully-connected\nmodels, such as the Curie-Weiss, the Kuramoto, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nmodel, are only valid if the network degree distribution is highly concentrated\naround its mean degree. We obtain a series of results that highlight the\nimportance of degree fluctuations to the phase diagram of mean-field spin\nmodels by focusing on the Kuramoto model of synchronization and on the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin-glasses.

Motivated by the above, we employ the so-called Gross\nAnsatz (GA) approach to unravel the stationary and dynamical properties of the\nhomogeneous one-dimensional Bose-polaron for different impurity momenta and\nbath-impurity couplings. We explicate that the character of the equilibrium\nstate crossovers from the quasi-particle Bose polaron regime to the\ncollective-excitation stationary dark-bright soliton for varying impurity\nmomentum and interactions. Following an interspecies interaction quench the\ntemporal orthogonality catastrophe is identified, provided that bath-impurity\ninteractions are sufficiently stronger than the intraspecies bath ones, thus\ngeneralizing the results of the confined case. This catastrophe originates from\nthe formation of dispersive shock wave structures associated with the\nzero-range character of the bath-impurity potential. For initially moving\nimpurities, a momentum transfer process from the impurity to the dispersive\nshock waves via the exerted drag force is demonstrated, resulting in a final\npolaronic state with reduced velocity.

The relevance of tidal effects in a neutron star--black\nhole (NSBH) binary system depends crucially upon the mass and the spin of the\ncompanion BH. These effects become important predominantly when the binary\nsystem is of comparable mass and/or has large aligned spins. Depending upon the\nmasses and spins the NS can even get tidally disrupted before the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) is reached.

Peculiarly, they\nhave shown, however, an asymmetry in their ability to be doped by holes rather\nthan by electrons. Indeed, both structural defect-induced doping as well as\nextrinsic impurity-induced doping strangely result in a unipolar doping\n(dominantly p-type) with low free carriers concentration. This raises the\nquestion whether such doping limitations presents just a temporary setback due\nto insufficient optimization of the doping process, or perhaps this represents\nan intrinsic, physically-mandated bottleneck. In this paper we study three\nfundamental Design Principles (DP's) for ideal doping, applying them via\ndensity functional doping theory to these HP's, thus identifying the violated\nDP that explains the doping limitations and asymmetry in these HP's. Here, the\ntarget DP are: (i) requires that the thermodynamic transition level induced by\nthe dopants must ideally be energetically shallow both for donors (n-type) or\nacceptors (p-type); DP-(ii) requires that the 'Fermi level pinning energies'\nfor electrons and holes (being the limiting values of the Fermi level before a\nstructural defect that compensate the doping forms spontaneously) should\nideally be located inside the conduction band for n-type doping and inside the\nvalence band for p-type doping. DP-(iii) requires that the doping-induced\nequilibrium Fermi energy shifts towards the conduction band for n-type doping\n(shift towards the valence band, for p-type doping) to be sufficiently large.\nWe find that, even though in HP's based on Br and Cl there are numerous shallow\nlevel dopants that satisfy DP-(i), in contrast DP-(ii) is satisfied only for\nholes and DP-(iii) fail for both holes and electrons, being the ultimate\nbottleneck for the n-type doping in Iodine HP's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 14:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

A possible choice for the density path is\nproposed. A benchmark in the case of a simplified yet realistic nuclear system\nis shown to be successful, so that the method seems promising for future\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

These patient-specific covariates\nare often measured over multiple follow-up appointments. It is then of interest\nto predict survival based on the history of these longitudinal measurements,\nand to update predictions as more observations become available. The standard\napproaches to these so-called `dynamic prediction' assessments are joint models\nand landmark analysis. Joint models involve high-dimensional parametrisations,\nand their computational complexity often prohibits including multiple\nlongitudinal covariates. Landmark analysis is simpler, but discards a\nproportion of the available data at each `landmark time'. In this work we\npropose a `retarded kernel' approach to dynamic prediction that sits somewhere\nin between the two standard methods in terms of complexity. By conditioning\nhazard rates directly on the covariate measurements over the observation time\nframe, we define a model that takes into account the full history of covariate\nmeasurements but is more practical and parsimonious than joint modelling.\nTime-dependent association kernels describe the impact of covariate changes at\nearlier times on the patient's hazard rate at later times. Under the\nconstraints that our model (i) reduces to the standard Cox model for\ntime-independent covariates, and (ii) contains the instantaneous Cox model as a\nspecial case, we derive two natural kernel parameterisations. Upon application\nto three clinical data sets, we find that the predictive accuracy of the\nretarded kernel approach is comparable to that of the two existing standard\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 07:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Nevertheless, molecular systems with these properties are\nscarce because most of them suffer from aggregation caused quenching emission\n(ACQ). One approach to address this shortcoming is by inhibiting the molecular\nmotions/vibrations by employing a fixed matrix as afforded by a metal-organic\nframework (MOF). There, the organic chromophores are confined in a crystalline\nframework, and the structure-property relationship can be designed to get\nRTP/TADF. Inspired by this, the present work explores the relation between the\nlinker arrangement and the physicochemical properties of two isochemical MOFs\nwith different crystalline structures. The denser MOF exhibits a long-lived\ngreen RTP due to a hyperfine coupling of the linkers. On the other hand, the\nmore porous MOF presents a long-lived temperature-dependent turquoise emission,\nreflecting the influence of the TADF. Hence, this study provides a huge advance\nabout the potential of MOFs to undergo RTP and TADF emission, and at the same\ntime, demonstrates their potential applicability in a wide range of photonic\ntechnologies, including physical and chemical sensing and the first example of\na MOF-LED based on RTP-MOFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

As a consequence, a first polynomial propositional class in\nnon-clausal (NC) form has recently been proposed. Along these lines and towards\nmaking NC tractability applicable beyond propositional logic, firstly, we\ndefine the Regular many-valued Horn Non-Clausal class, or RH, obtained by\nsuitably amalgamating both regular classes: Horn and NC. Secondly, we\ndemonstrate that the relationship between (1) RH and the regular Horn class is\nthat syntactically RH subsumes the Horn class but that both classes are\nequivalent semantically; and between (2) RH and the regular non-clausal class\nis that RH contains all NC formulas whose clausal form is Horn. Thirdly, we\ndefine Regular Non-Clausal Unit-Resolution, or RUR-NC , and prove both that it\nis complete for RH and that checks its satisfiability in polynomial time. The\nlatter fact shows that our intended goal is reached since RH is many-valued,\nnon-clausal and tractable. As RH and RUR-NC are, both, basic in the DPLL\nscheme, the most efficient in propositional logic, and can be extended to some\nother non-classical logics, we argue that they pave the way for efficient\nnon-clausal DPLL-based approximate reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Whereas this energy scale is out of reach for currently\noperating and future planned particle accelerators, natural astrophysical\nphenomena are expected to produce antineutrinos with energies beyond the PeV\nscale. Here we report the detection by the IceCube neutrino observatory of a\ncascade of high-energy particles (a particle shower) consistent with being\ncreated at the Glashow resonance. A shower with an energy of $6.05 \\pm 0.72$\nPeV (determined from Cherenkov radiation in the Antarctic Ice Sheet) was\nmeasured. Features consistent with the production of secondary muons in the\nparticle shower indicate the hadronic decay of a resonant $W^-$ boson, confirm\nthat the source is astrophysical and provide improved directional localization.\nThe evidence of the Glashow resonance suggests the presence of electron\nantineutrinos in the astrophysical flux, while also providing further\nvalidation of the standard model of particle physics. Its unique signature\nindicates a method of distinguishing neutrinos from antineutrinos, thus\nproviding a way to identify astronomical accelerators that produce neutrinos\nvia hadronuclear or photohadronic interactions, with or without strong magnetic\nfields. As such, knowledge of both the flavour (that is, electron, muon or tau\nneutrinos) and charge (neutrino or antineutrino) will facilitate the\nadvancement of neutrino astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 02:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}
