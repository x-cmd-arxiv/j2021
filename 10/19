For\ninstance, Keldysh formalism shows that the dissipative transverse Ising (DTI)\nmodel exhibits a discontinuous transition at the upper critical dimension,\n$d_c= 3$, whereas the fluctuationless MF approach predicts a continuous\ntransition in infinite dimensions ($d_\\infty$). These two solutions cannot be\nreconciled because the MF solutions above $d_c$ should be identical. This\nnecessitates a numerical verification. However, numerical studies on large\nsystems may not be feasible because of the exponential increase in\ncomputational complexity as $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2N})$ with system size $N$. Here,\nwe note that because spins can be regarded as being fully connected at\n$d_\\infty$, the spin indices can be permutation invariant, and the number of\nquantum states can be considerably contracted with the computational complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. The Lindblad equation is transformed into a dynamic\nequation based on the contracted states. Applying the Runge--Kutta algorithm to\nthe dynamic equation, we obtain all the critical exponents, including the\ndynamic exponent $z\\approx 0.5$. Moreover, since the DTI model has\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, the hyperscaling relation has the form\n$2\\beta+\\gamma=\\nu(d+z)$, we obtain the relation $d_c+z=4$ in the MF limit.\nHence, $d_c\\approx 3.5$; thus, the discontinuous transition at $d=3$ cannot be\ntreated as an MF solution. We conclude that the permutation invariance at\n$d_\\infty$ can be used effectively to check the validity of an analytic MF\nsolution in quantum phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 16:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 13:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

CTP may be performed within the angio suite using flat detector\nCT (FDCT) to help reduce patient management time. In order to significantly\nimprove FDCT perfusion (FDCTP) imaging, data-processing algorithms need to be\nable to compensate for the higher levels of noise, slow rotation speed, and a\nlower frame rate of current FDCT devices. We performed a realistic simulation\nof FDCTP acquisition based on CTP data from seven subjects. We used the time\nseparation technique (TST) as a model-based approach for FDCTP data processing.\nWe propose a novel dimension reduction in which we approximate the time\nattenuation curves by a linear combination of trigonometric functions. Our goal\nwas to show that the TST can be used even without prior assumptions on the\nshape of the attenuation profiles. We first demonstrated that a trigonometric\nbasis is suitable for dimension reduction of perfusion data. Using simulated\nFDCTP data, we have shown that a trigonometric basis in the TST provided better\nresults than the classical straightforward processing even with additional\nnoise. Average correlation coefficients of perfusion maps were improved for\ncerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, mean transit time (MTT) maps.\nIn a moderate noise scenario, the average Pearson's coefficient for the CBF map\nwas improved using the TST from 0.76 to 0.81. For the MTT map, it was improved\nfrom 0.37 to 0.45. Furthermore, we achieved a total processing time from the\nreconstruction of FDCTP data to the generation of perfusion maps of under 5\nmin. In our study cohort, perfusion maps created from FDCTP data using the TST\nwith a trigonometric basis showed equivalent perfusion deficits to classic CT\nperfusion maps.

One of the difficulties stems from the\npossibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of\nthem have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited\nobserving periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified\nas non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into\nrepeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work,\nwe classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning,\nwithout relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating\nFRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and\nProjection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the\nunsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior\nknowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that\nnon-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognise the\nFRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a\ncorresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity\nMapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) database. We found that the\nunsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95\nper cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474\nnon-repeater sources.

This represents a challenge for theoretical\nmodels, which struggle to reproduce both features. We explore if a disk\nevolution model, including a dead zone and disk dispersal by X-ray\nphotoevaporation, can explain the high accretion rates and large gaps (or\ncavities) measured in transition disks. We implement a dead zone turbulence\nprofile and a photoevaporative mass loss profile into numerical simulations of\ngas and dust. We perform a population synthesis study of the gas component, and\nobtain synthetic images and SED of the dust component through radiative\ntransfer calculations. This model results in long lived inner disks and fast\ndispersing outer disks, that can reproduce both the accretion rates and gap\nsizes observed in transition disks. For a dead zone of turbulence $\\alpha_{dz}\n= 10^{-4}$ and extent $r_{dz}$ = 10 AU, our population synthesis study shows\nthat $63\\%$ of our transition disks are accreting with $\\dot{M}_g > 10^{-11}\nM_\\odot/yr$ after opening a gap. Among those accreting transition disks, half\ndisplay accretion rates higher than $5\\times10^{-10} M_\\odot/yr$ . The dust\ncomponent in these disks is distributed in two regions: in a compact inner disk\ninside the dead zone, and in a ring at the outer edge of the photoevaporative\ngap, which can be located between 20 AU and 100 AU. Our radiative transfer\ncalculations show that the disk displays an inner disk and an outer ring in the\nmillimeter continuum, a feature observed in some transition disks. A disk model\nconsidering X-ray photoevaporative dispersal in combination with dead zones can\nexplain several of the observed properties in transition disks including: the\nhigh accretion rates, the large gaps, and long-lived inner disks at\nmm-emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 16:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

A direct idea is to leverage the urban transfer learning paradigm to\nlearn the knowledge from a source city, then exploit it to predict charging\ndemands, and meanwhile determine locations and amounts of slow/fast chargers\nfor charging stations in the target city. However, the demand prediction and\ncharger planning depend on each other, and it is required to re-train the\nprediction model to eliminate the negative transfer between cities for each\nvaried charger plan, leading to the unacceptable time complexity. To this end,\nwe propose the concept and an effective solution of Simultaneous Demand\nPrediction And Planning (SPAP): discriminative features are extracted from\nmulti-source data, and fed into an Attention-based Spatial-Temporal City Domain\nAdaptation Network (AST-CDAN) for cross-city demand prediction; a novel\nTransfer Iterative Optimization (TIO) algorithm is designed for charger\nplanning by iteratively utilizing AST-CDAN and a charger plan fine-tuning\nalgorithm.

To this end, we develop\nPROTEUS, an AutoML pipeline to produce the surrogate model, specifically\ndesigned for feature selection on imbalanced datasets. The PROTEUS surrogate\nmodel can not only explain the training data, but also the out-of-sample\n(unseen) data. In other words, PROTEUS produces predictive explanations by\napproximating the decision surface of an unsupervised detector. PROTEUS is\ndesigned to return an accurate estimate of out-of-sample predictive performance\nto serve as a metric of the quality of the approximation. Computational\nexperiments confirm the efficacy of PROTEUS to produce predictive explanations\nfor different families of detectors and to reliably estimate their predictive\nperformance in unseen data. Unlike several ad-hoc feature importance methods,\nPROTEUS is robust to high-dimensional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 16:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

An\nHLPUF uses a classical PUF(CPUF), and encodes the output into non-orthogonal\nquantum states to hide the outcomes of the underlying CPUF from any adversary.\nHere we introduce a quantum lock to protect the HLPUFs from any general\nadversaries. The indistinguishability property of the non-orthogonal quantum\nstates, together with the quantum lockdown technique prevents the adversary\nfrom accessing the outcome of the CPUFs.

Nevertheless, there has been less attention given to the\nprincipled integration of these components, particularly in terms of the\ncharacterization and mitigation of cascading errors. This paper addresses the\nproblem of cascading errors by focusing on the coupling between the tracking\nand prediction modules. First, by using state-of-the-art tracking and\nprediction tools, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of how\nseverely errors stemming from tracking can impact prediction performance. On\nthe KITTI and nuScenes datasets, we find that predictions consuming tracked\ntrajectories as inputs (the typical case in practice) can experience a\nsignificant (even order of magnitude) drop in performance in comparison to the\nidealized setting where ground truth past trajectories are used as inputs. To\naddress this issue, we propose a multi-hypothesis tracking and prediction\nframework. Rather than relying on a single set of tracking results for\nprediction, our framework simultaneously reasons about multiple sets of\ntracking results, thereby increasing the likelihood of including accurate\ntracking results as inputs to prediction. We show that this framework improves\noverall prediction performance over the standard single-hypothesis\ntracking-prediction pipeline by up to 34.2% on the nuScenes dataset, with even\nmore significant improvements (up to ~70%) when restricting the evaluation to\nchallenging scenarios involving identity switches and fragments -- all with an\nacceptable computation overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

This paper pursues theoretical understanding\nfor an important type of interpolators: the minimum $\\ell_{1}$-norm\ninterpolator, which is motivated by the observation that several learning\nalgorithms favor low $\\ell_1$-norm solutions in the over-parameterized regime.\nConcretely, we consider the noisy sparse regression model under Gaussian\ndesign, focusing on linear sparsity and high-dimensional asymptotics (so that\nboth the number of features and the sparsity level scale proportionally with\nthe sample size).\n  We observe, and provide rigorous theoretical justification for, a curious\nmulti-descent phenomenon; that is, the generalization risk of the minimum\n$\\ell_1$-norm interpolator undergoes multiple (and possibly more than two)\nphases of descent and ascent as one increases the model capacity. This\nphenomenon stems from the special structure of the minimum $\\ell_1$-norm\ninterpolator as well as the delicate interplay between the over-parameterized\nratio and the sparsity, thus unveiling a fundamental distinction in geometry\nfrom the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm interpolator.

We study the problem of test time robustification, i.e.,\nusing the test input to improve model robustness. Recent prior works have\nproposed methods for test time adaptation, however, they each introduce\nadditional assumptions, such as access to multiple test points, that prevent\nwidespread adoption. In this work, we aim to study and devise methods that make\nno assumptions about the model training process and are broadly applicable at\ntest time. We propose a simple approach that can be used in any test setting\nwhere the model is probabilistic and adaptable: when presented with a test\nexample, perform different data augmentations on the data point, and then adapt\n(all of) the model parameters by minimizing the entropy of the model's average,\nor marginal, output distribution across the augmentations. Intuitively, this\nobjective encourages the model to make the same prediction across different\naugmentations, thus enforcing the invariances encoded in these augmentations,\nwhile also maintaining confidence in its predictions. In our experiments, we\nevaluate two baseline ResNet models, two robust ResNet-50 models, and a robust\nvision transformer model, and we demonstrate that this approach achieves\naccuracy gains of 1-8\\% over standard model evaluation and also generally\noutperforms prior augmentation and adaptation strategies.

However, existing\nwork either assume access to expert-constructed hierarchies, or use\nhierarchy-learning heuristics with no provable guarantees. To address this gap,\nwe analyze HRL in the meta-RL setting, where a learner learns latent\nhierarchical structure during meta-training for use in a downstream task.

Given a pretrained model and small-scale\nunlabeled target data, unsupervised finetuning is to adapt the representation\npretrained from the source domain to the target domain so that better transfer\nperformance can be obtained. This problem is more challenging than the\nsupervised counterpart, as the low data density in the small-scale target data\nis not friendly for unsupervised learning, leading to the damage of the\npretrained representation and poor representation in the target domain. In this\npaper, we find the source data is crucial when shifting the finetuning paradigm\nfrom supervise to unsupervise, and propose two simple and effective strategies\nto combine source and target data into unsupervised finetuning: \"sparse source\ndata replaying\", and \"data mixing\". The motivation of the former strategy is to\nadd a small portion of source data back to occupy their pretrained\nrepresentation space and help push the target data to reside in a smaller\ncompact space; and the motivation of the latter strategy is to increase the\ndata density and help learn more compact representation. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed ``unsupervised finetuning'' strategy, we conduct\nextensive experiments on multiple different target datasets, which show better\ntransfer performance than the naive strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Here, we show how the recently introduced notion of the pivot\nHamiltonian -- generating rotations between SPT phases -- facilitates such a\nconstruction. We demonstrate this approach by constructing a spin model on the\ntriangular lattice, which is midway between a trivial and SPT phase. The pivot\nHamiltonian generates a $U(1)$ pivot symmetry which helps to stabilize a direct\nSPT transition. The sign-problem free nature of the model -- with an additional\nIsing interaction preserving the pivot symmetry -- allows us to obtain the\nphase diagram using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find evidence for a\ndirect transition between trivial and SPT phases that is consistent with a\ndeconfined quantum critical point with emergent $SO(5)$ symmetry. The known\nanomaly of the latter is made possible by the non-local nature of the $U(1)$\npivot symmetry. Interestingly, the pivot Hamiltonian generating this symmetry\nis nothing other than the staggered Baxter-Wu three-spin interaction. This work\nillustrates the importance of $U(1)$ pivot symmetries and proposes how to\ngenerally construct sign-problem-free lattice models of SPT transitions with\nsuch anomalous symmetry groups for other lattices and dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 15:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Strong lensing mass measurements require the knowledge of the\nredshift of both the lens and the source galaxy. Traditionally, spectroscopic\nredshifts are used for this purpose.

One of the science goals of this survey\nis to demonstrate the ability of eROSITA to detect samples of clusters and\ngroups at the final depth of the eROSITA all-sky survey. Because of the\nsizeable point-spread function of eROSITA, high-redshift clusters of galaxies\nor compact nearby groups hosting bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be\nmisclassified as point sources by the source detection algorithms. A total of\n346 galaxy clusters and groups in the redshift range of 0.1<z<1.3 were\nidentified based on their red sequence in the point source catalog. We examine\nthe multiwavelength properties of these clusters and groups to understand the\npotential biases in our selection process and the completeness of the\nextent-selected sample. The majority of the clusters and groups in the point\nsource sample are indeed underluminous and compact compared to the\nextent-selected sample. Their faint X-ray emission, well below the flux limit\nof the extent-selected eFEDS clusters, and their compact X-ray emission are\nlikely to be the main reason for this misclassification.

To address these challenges, previous works derive\npoint-to-point correspondences between different views from epipolar geometry\nand utilize the correspondences to merge prediction heatmaps or feature\nrepresentations. Instead of post-prediction merge/calibration, here we\nintroduce a transformer framework for multi-view 3D pose estimation, aiming at\ndirectly improving individual 2D predictors by integrating information from\ndifferent views. Inspired by previous multi-modal transformers, we design a\nunified transformer architecture, named TransFusion, to fuse cues from both\ncurrent views and neighboring views.

Eliminating these reusable code snippets,\nknown as gadgets, has become one of the prime concerns of attack surface\nreduction. The aim is to break these chains of gadgets, thereby making such\ncode reuse attacks impossible or substantially less common. Previous work on\nattack surface reduction has typically tried to eliminate such attacks by\nsubsetting the application, e.g. via user-specified inputs, configurations, or\nfeatures, or by focusing on third-party libraries to achieve high gadget\nreductions with minimal interference to the application.\n  In this work we present a general, whole-program attack surface reduction\ntechnique called OCA that significantly reduces gadgets and has minor\nperformance degradation.

The inner, Neptune-class planet (TOI-216b) is near 0.12 au (orbital\nperiod $P_{\\rm b} \\simeq 17$ d) and has a substantial orbital eccentricity\n($e_{\\rm b} \\simeq 0.16$), and large libration amplitude ($A_\\psi \\simeq\n60^\\circ$) in the resonance. The outer planet (TOI-216c) is a gas giant on a\nnearly circular orbit. We carry out $N$-body simulations of planet migration in\na protoplanetary gas disk to explain the orbital configuration of TOI-216\nplanets. We find that TOI-216b's migration must have been halted near its\ncurrent orbital radius to allow for a convergent migration of the two planets\ninto the resonance. For the inferred damping-to-migration timescale ratio\n$\\tau_e/\\tau_a \\simeq 0.02$, overstable librations in the resonance lead to a\nlimit cycle with $A_\\psi \\simeq 80^\\circ$ and $e_{\\rm b}<0.1$. The system could\nhave remained in this configuration for the greater part of the protoplanetary\ndisk lifetime. If the gas disk was removed from inside out, this would have\nreduced the libration amplitude to $A_\\psi \\simeq 60^\\circ$ and boosted $e_{\\rm\nb}$ via the resonant interaction with TOI-216c. Our results suggest a\nrelatively fast inner disk removal ($\\sim 10^5$ yr). Another means of\nexplaining the large libration amplitude is stochastic stirring from a\n(turbulent) gas disk. For that to work, overstable librations would need to be\nsuppressed, $\\tau_e/\\tau_a \\simeq 0.05$, and very strong turbulent stirring (or\nsome other source of large stochastic forcing) would need to overcome the\ndamping effects of gas.

Despite advances in the design and analysis of\nCRTs, several challenges remain. First, there are many possible ways to specify\nthe causal effect of interest (e.g., at the individual-level or at the\ncluster-level). Second, the theoretical and practical performance of common\nmethods for CRT analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we present a general\nframework to formally define an array of causal effects in terms of summary\nmeasures of counterfactual outcomes. Next, we provide a comprehensive overview\nof CRT estimators, including the t-test, generalized estimating equations\n(GEE), augmented-GEE, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Using\nfinite sample simulations, we illustrate the practical performance of these\nestimators for different causal effects and when, as commonly occurs, there are\nlimited numbers of clusters of different sizes. Finally, our application to\ndata from the Preterm Birth Initiative (PTBi) study demonstrates the real-world\nimpact of varying cluster sizes and targeting effects at the cluster-level or\nat the individual-level. Specifically, the relative effect of the PTBI\nintervention was 0.81 at the cluster-level, corresponding to a 19% reduction in\noutcome incidence, and was 0.66 at the individual-level, corresponding to a 34%\nreduction in outcome risk. Given its flexibility to estimate a variety of\nuser-specified effects and ability to adaptively adjust for covariates for\nprecision gains while maintaining Type-I error control, we conclude TMLE is a\npromising tool for CRT analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 22:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 01:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:30:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 06:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

The mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) leverages the\ninformation from these repeated outcome measures, and is often used for the\nprimary analysis to estimate the average treatment effect at the primary\nendpoint. MMRM, however, can suffer from bias and precision loss when it models\nintermediate outcomes incorrectly, and hence fails to use the\npost-randomization information harmlessly. This paper proposes an extension of\nthe commonly used MMRM, called IMMRM, that improves the robustness and\noptimizes the precision gain from covariate adjustment, stratified\nrandomization, and adjustment for intermediate outcome measures. Under\nregularity conditions and missing completely at random, we prove that the IMMRM\nestimator for the average treatment effect is robust to arbitrary model\nmisspecification and is asymptotically equal or more precise than the analysis\nof covariance (ANCOVA) estimator and the MMRM estimator. Under missing at\nrandom, IMMRM is less likely to be misspecified than MMRM, and we demonstrate\nvia simulation studies that IMMRM continues to have less bias and smaller\nvariance.

A packet leaves the\nnetwork when it is disseminated to all nodes. The network is stable when it is\npositive recurrent; and when it is, the age of the oldest packet, referred to\nas Age-of-Information (AoI) is stochastically bounded. Under the Random-Useful\n(RU) discipline a node $u$ communicates on link $(u,v)$ a randomly chosen\navailable packet not present at $v$. RU discipline is known to have the maximum\nstability region for a single flow; we show that this extends to arbitrary\nnumber of flows.

Their statistical properties and connections with velocity\ndistribution ($\\textbf X$) are well studied and established. With $\\textbf H$\nbeing essentially the halo mass function, two limiting cases of $\\textbf H$\ndistribution are analyzed for large halos ($\\textbf H_\\infty$) and small halos\n($\\textbf H_s$), respectively. For large halos, $\\textbf H_\\infty$ is shown to\nalso be a maximum entropy distribution. For small halos, $\\textbf H_s$\napproximates the $\\textbf P$ distribution and recovers the Press-Schechter mass\nfunction. The full solution of $\\textbf H$ distribution is determined by the\nvelocity distribution ($\\textbf X$) that maximizes system entropy and the exact\nmodel of halo velocity dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 01:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 05:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

It has long\nbeen a recognized problem that many datasets contain significant levels of\nmissing numerical data. We introduce a mathematically principled stochastic\noptimization imputation method based on the theory of Kriging. This is shown to\nbe a powerful method for imputation. However, its computational effort and\npotential numerical instabilities produce costly and/or unreliable predictions,\npotentially limiting its use on large scale datasets. In this paper, we apply a\nrecently developed multi-level stochastic optimization approach to the problem\nof imputation in massive medical records. The approach is based on\ncomputational applied mathematics techniques and is highly accurate. In\nparticular, for the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) this multi-level\nformulation is exact, and is also significantly faster and more numerically\nstable. This permits practical application of Kriging methods to data\nimputation problems for massive datasets. We test this approach on data from\nthe National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data records, Healthcare Cost and\nUtilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\nNumerical results show the multi-level method significantly outperforms current\napproaches and is numerically robust.

In this paper, we contribute to the literature on the network\nresilience and robustness for targeted and random attacks and propose a MIP\nmodel considering graph-theoretical aspects of networks.

In previous studies, by comparing observed and\nmodeled spectra, it was suggested that the deviations of their spectral shapes\nfrom theoretical prediction are general characteristics. Here, we focus on the\ndust size in brown dwarf atmospheres to understand the observed spectra. We\nconfirm that changing the dust size changes the temperature-pressure structure\nof the atmosphere, with the shape of the spectrum changing accordingly. At the\nwavelength at which dust is the main absorber of radiation (the dust-dominated\nregime), a large dust opacity combined with a medium grain size, e.g., 0.1\n$\\mu$m, results in a low photospheric temperature, and thus a small flux.\nConversely, for the wavelength at which gas absorption is dominant (the\ngas-dominated regime), a large dust opacity modifies the temperature-pressure\nstructure, resulting in a high photospheric temperature, which corresponds to\nlarge flux emissions. Taking into account the size effect, we compare the model\nspectral fluxes in the wavelength range 1-5 $\\mu$m with the observational ones\nto constrain the main dust size in the atmosphere of each of the ten L dwarfs\nobserved with AKARI and SpeX or CGS4.

The current \"black-box\" attacks all heavily rely on the\nknowledge of prediction/confidence scores to craft effective adversarial\nexamples, which can be intuitively defended by service providers without\nreturning these messages. In this paper, we propose two novel adversarial\nattacks in more practical and rigorous scenarios. For commercial cloud speech\nAPIs, we propose Occam, a decision-only black-box adversarial attack, where\nonly final decisions are available to the adversary. In Occam, we formulate the\ndecision-only AE generation as a discontinuous large-scale global optimization\nproblem, and solve it by adaptively decomposing this complicated problem into a\nset of sub-problems and cooperatively optimizing each one. Our Occam is a\none-size-fits-all approach, which achieves 100% success rates of attacks with\nan average SNR of 14.23dB, on a wide range of popular speech and speaker\nrecognition APIs, including Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Tencent, iFlytek, and\nJingdong, outperforming the state-of-the-art black-box attacks. For commercial\nvoice control devices, we propose NI-Occam, the first non-interactive physical\nadversarial attack, where the adversary does not need to query the oracle and\nhas no access to its internal information and training data. We combine\nadversarial attacks with model inversion attacks, and thus generate the\nphysically-effective audio AEs with high transferability without any\ninteraction with target devices. Our experimental results show that NI-Occam\ncan successfully fool Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, iFlytek\nand Amazon Echo with an average SRoA of 52% and SNR of 9.65dB, shedding light\non non-interactive physical attacks against voice control devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 03:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 07:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Recently, Ho et al. used archival X-ray Chandra\nobservations separated by more than 10 years and determined that the total\nproper motion of PSR J1813--1749 is $\\sim66$~mas~yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a\nvelocity of $\\sim$1900 km s$^{-1}$ for a distance of 6.2 kpc.

A number of other new chemical model inputs and treatments are\nalso explored in depth, culminating in a final model that demonstrates\nexcellent agreement with gas-phase observational abundances for many molecules,\nincluding some (e.g. methoxymethanol) that could not be reproduced by\nconventional diffusive mechanisms. Observed ratios of structural isomers methyl\nformate, glycolaldehyde and acetic acid are well reproduced by the models. The\nmain temperature regimes are identified in which various complex organic\nmolecules (COMs) are formed. Nondiffusive chemistry advances the production of\nmany COMs to much earlier times and lower temperatures than in previous model\nimplementations. Those species may form either as by-products of simple-ice\nproduction, or via early photochemistry within the ices while external UV\nphotons can still penetrate. Cosmic ray-induced photochemistry is less\nimportant than in past models, although it affects some species strongly over\nlong timescales. Another production regime occurs during the high-temperature\ndesorption of solid water, whereby radicals trapped in the ice are released\nonto the grain/ice surface, where they rapidly react. Several recently-proposed\ngas-phase COM-production mechanisms are also introduced, but they rarely\ndominate. New surface/ice reactions involving CH and CH$_2$ are found to\ncontribute substantially to the formation of certain COMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 05:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 02:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

However, the influence of light, acquisition\nconditions and the inherent properties of materials, results in that the\nidentified endmembers can vary spectrally within a given image (construed as\nspectral variability). To address this issue, recent methods usually use a\npriori obtained spectral library to represent multiple characteristic spectra\nof the same object, but few of them extracted the spectral variability\nexplicitly. In this paper, a spectral variability augmented sparse unmixing\nmodel (SVASU) is proposed, in which the spectral variability is extracted for\nthe first time. The variable spectra are divided into two parts of intrinsic\nspectrum and spectral variability for spectral reconstruction, and modeled\nsynchronously in the SU model adding the regular terms restricting the sparsity\nof abundance and the generalization of the variability coefficient. It is noted\nthat the spectral variability library and the intrinsic spectral library are\nall constructed from the In-situ observed image.

The pinching action\nflattens the tapes to produce a localized bending region, resulting in a\nrevolute joint that can change its orientation by cable tension and its\nlocation on the tapes though friction-driven movement of the pinching\nmechanism. We present the design, implementation, kinematic modeling, stiffness\nbehavior of the revolute joint, and quasi-static performance of this\nmanipulator.

To solve these\nissues, in this paper, a novel DUN with persistent memory for CS is proposed,\ndubbed Memory-Augmented Deep Unfolding Network (MADUN).

Recently, the two-photon interference (TPI) of\nphase-randomized weak coherent states has played a key role in the realization\nof long-distance quantum communication based on the use of classical light\nsources.

By exploring response\ndifferences of different channels between real and fake images for a filter\nbank, Geo-DefakeHop learns the most discriminant channels and uses their soft\ndecision scores as features. Then, Geo-DefakeHop selects a few discriminant\nfeatures from each filter bank and ensemble them to make a final binary\ndecision. Geo-DefakeHop offers a light-weight high-performance solution to fake\nsatellite images detection. Its model size is analyzed, which ranges from 0.8\nto 62K parameters. Furthermore, it is shown by experimental results that it\nachieves an F1-score higher than 95\\% under various common image manipulations\nsuch as resizing, compression and noise corruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 08:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The data did not strongly prefer either fit, but\ncombined with a jet/counter-jet ratio analysis, an upper limit on the viewing\nangle to the inner jet region of $\\leq$35$^{\\circ}$ was found. This provides\nevidence for a variation of the viewing angle along the jet (and therefore a\nbent jet) within $\\sim$0.5 parsec of the jet launching region.

Results have been diverse and various views\nhave been presented. The empirical AGN SED derived by Symeonidis et al. (2016,\nhereafter S16) has more far-IR/sub-mm emission than other SEDs in the\nliterature, and thus it is contested by other works which argue that its\nluminosity in that part of the spectrum is overestimated. Here, I investigate\nthis topic and the concerns raised over the S16 AGN SED. I also examine the\ndifferences between the S16 AGN SED and other commonly-used empirical AGN SEDs.\nMy findings show that the reasons proposed by other works as to why the S16 AGN\nSED is not a reasonable representation of AGN emission in the far-IR/sub-mm, do\nnot hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Since many\ndaily activities are social in nature, support agents should understand a\nuser's social situation to offer comprehensive support. However, there are no\nsystematic approaches for developing support agents that are social situation\naware. We identify key requirements for a support agent to be social situation\naware and propose steps to realize those requirements. These steps are\npresented through a conceptual architecture centered on two key ideas: (1)\nconceptualizing social situation awareness as an instantiation of `general'\nsituation awareness, and (2) using situation taxonomies for such instantiation.\nThis enables support agents to represent a user's social situation, comprehend\nits meaning, and assess its impact on the user's behavior. We discuss empirical\nresults supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate\nhow the architecture can be used in support agents through two use cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:35:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 06:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 08:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Data folding and the\ncomputationally efficient analysis pipeline, {\\tt PyStoch}, enable us to\nperform the radiometer map-making at every frequency bin. We perform the search\nat 3072 {\\tt{HEALPix}} equal area pixels uniformly tiling the sky and in every\nfrequency bin of width $1/32$~Hz in the range $20-1726$~Hz, except for bins\nthat are likely to contain instrumental artefacts and hence are notched. We do\nnot find any statistically significant evidence for the existence of narrowband\ngravitational-wave signals in the analyzed frequency bins. Therefore, we place\n$95\\%$ confidence upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain for each\npixel-frequency pair, the limits are in the range $(0.030 - 9.6)\n\\times10^{-24}$. In addition, we outline a method to identify candidate\npixel-frequency pairs that could be followed up by a more sensitive (and\npotentially computationally expensive) search, e.g., a matched-filtering-based\nanalysis, to look for fainter nearly monochromatic coherent signals. The ASAF\nanalysis is inherently independent of models describing any spectral or spatial\ndistribution of power. We demonstrate that the ASAF results can be\nappropriately combined over frequencies and sky directions to successfully\nrecover the broadband directional and isotropic results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

It appears that an underlying decision problem,\ncharacterized by actions and a loss function, is required to define the notion\nof practical relevance, rendering it a decision theoretic concept. In the\ncontext of hypothesis-based analyses, the notion of practical relevance relates\nto specifying the hypotheses reasonably, such that the null hypothesis does not\ncontain only a single parameter null value, but also all parameter values that\nare equivalent to the null value on a practical level. In that regard, the\ndefinition of practical relevance is also extended into the context of\nhypotheses. The formal elaborations on the notion of practical relevance within\nthis paper indicate that, typically, a specific decision problem is implicitly\nassumed when dealing with the practical relevance of an effect or some results.\nAs a consequence, involving decision theoretic considerations into a\nstatistical analysis suggests itself by the mere nature of the notion of\npractical relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Previous studies define these\ngroups based on either demographic information (e.g. African, Asian etc.) or\nskin tone (e.g. lighter or darker skins). The use of such sensitive or broad\ngroup definitions has disadvantages for bias investigation and subsequent\ncounter-bias solutions design. By contrast, this study introduces an\nalternative racial bias analysis methodology via facial phenotype attributes\nfor face recognition. We use the set of observable characteristics of an\nindividual face where a race-related facial phenotype is hence specific to the\nhuman face and correlated to the racial profile of the subject. We propose\ncategorical test cases to investigate the individual influence of those\nattributes on bias within face recognition tasks. We compare our\nphenotype-based grouping methodology with previous grouping strategies and show\nthat phenotype-based groupings uncover hidden bias without reliance upon any\npotentially protected attributes or ill-defined grouping strategies.\nFurthermore, we contribute corresponding phenotype attribute category labels\nfor two face recognition tasks: RFW for face verification and VGGFace2 (test\nset) for face identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Nevertheless, the dynamic range of common\ndisplay devices is still limited, therefore tone mapping (TM) remains a key\nchallenge for image visualization. Recent work has demonstrated that neural\nnetworks can achieve remarkable performance in this task when compared to\ntraditional methods, however, the quality of the results of these\nlearning-based methods is limited by the training data. Most existing works use\nas training set a curated selection of best-performing results from existing\ntraditional tone mapping operators (often guided by a quality metric),\ntherefore, the quality of newly generated results is fundamentally limited by\nthe performance of such operators. This quality might be even further limited\nby the pool of HDR content that is used for training. In this work we propose a\nlearning-based self-supervised tone mapping operator that is trained at test\ntime specifically for each HDR image and does not need any data labeling. The\nkey novelty of our approach is a carefully designed loss function built upon\nfundamental knowledge on contrast perception that allows for directly comparing\nthe content in the HDR and tone mapped images. We achieve this goal by\nreformulating classic VGG feature maps into feature contrast maps that\nnormalize local feature differences by their average magnitude in a local\nneighborhood, allowing our loss to account for contrast masking effects. We\nperform extensive ablation studies and exploration of parameters and\ndemonstrate that our solution outperforms existing approaches with a single set\nof fixed parameters, as confirmed by both objective and subjective metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

HM-Net is significantly faster than state-of-the-art\nframe differencing and background subtraction-based methods, without\ncompromising detection and tracking performances. HM-Net follows the object\ncenter-based joint detection and tracking paradigm. Simple heat map-based\npredictions support an unlimited number of simultaneous detections.

The main reason is that\npast designs for replicated KV stores favor reducing network traffic and\nincreasing I/O size. Therefore, they perform costly compactions to reorganize\ndata in both the primary and backup nodes, which hurts overall system\nperformance.\n  In this paper, we design and implement Talos, an efficient rack-scale\nLSM-based KV store that aims to significantly reduce the I/O amplification and\nCPU overhead in backup nodes and make replication in the KV store practical. We\nrely on two observations: (a) the increased use of RDMA in the datacenter,\nwhich reduces CPU overhead for communication, and (b) the use of KV separation\nthat is becoming prevalent in modern KV stores. We use a primary-backup\nreplication scheme that performs compactions only on the primary nodes and\nsends the pre-built index to the backup nodes of the region, avoiding all\ncompactions in backups. Our approach includes an efficient mechanism to deal\nwith pointer translation across nodes in the region index.

The ability to solve Bongard problems is an example\nof such a test. It has also been postulated that the ability to rapidly\nconstruct novel abstractions is critical to being able to solve analogical\nproblems. Given an image, the ability to construct a program that would\ngenerate that image is one form of abstraction, as exemplified in the\nDreamcoder project. In this paper, we present a preliminary examination of\nwhether programs constructed by Dreamcoder can be used for analogical reasoning\nto solve certain Bongard problems. We use Dreamcoder to discover programs that\ngenerate the images in a Bongard problem and represent each of these as a\nsequence of state transitions. We decorate the states using positional\ninformation in an automated manner and then encode the resulting sequence into\nlogical facts in Prolog. We use inductive logic programming (ILP), to learn an\n(interpretable) theory for the abstract concept involved in an instance of a\nBongard problem. Experiments on synthetically created Bongard problems for\nconcepts such as 'above/below' and 'clockwise/counterclockwise' demonstrate\nthat our end-to-end system can solve such problems. We study the importance and\ncompleteness of each component of our approach, highlighting its current\nlimitations and pointing to directions for improvement in our formulation as\nwell as in elements of any Dreamcoder-like program synthesis system used for\nsuch an approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

In this model, the input is a probability distribution\naccessible via independently drawn samples from an oracle. The testing task is\nto distinguish a distribution that satisfies some property from a distribution\nthat is far from satisfying it in the $\\ell_1$ distance. The task of tolerant\ntesting imposes a further restriction, that distributions close to satisfying\nthe property are also accepted. This work focuses on the connection of the\nsample complexities of non-tolerant (\"traditional\") testing of distributions\nand tolerant testing thereof. When limiting our scope to label-invariant\n(symmetric) properties of distribution, we prove that the gap is at most\nquadratic. Conversely, the property of being the uniform distribution is indeed\nknown to have an almost-quadratic gap. When moving to general, not necessarily\nlabel-invariant properties, the situation is more complicated, and we show some\npartial results. We show that if a property requires the distributions to be\nnon-concentrated, then it cannot be non-tolerantly tested with $o(\\sqrt{n})$\nmany samples, where $n$ denotes the universe size. Clearly, this implies at\nmost a quadratic gap, because a distribution can be learned (and hence\ntolerantly tested against any property) using $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ many samples.\nBeing non-concentrated is a strong requirement on the property, as we also\nprove a close to linear lower bound against their tolerant tests. To provide\nevidence for other general cases (where the properties are not necessarily\nlabel-invariant), we show that if an input distribution is very concentrated,\nin the sense that it is mostly supported on a subset of size $s$ of the\nuniverse, then it can be learned using only $\\mathcal{O}(s)$ many samples. The\nlearning procedure adapts to the input, and works without knowing $s$ in\nadvance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 08:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

Its manifestations include prominence formation, coronal rain, and\nlong-period intensity pulsations in coronal loops. The recent observation of\nabundant periodic coronal rain associated with intensity pulsations by\nAuch\\`ere et al. allows to unify these two phenomena as the result of TNE\ncondensation and evaporation cycles. On the other hand, many intensity\npulsation events observed by Froment et al. show little to no coronal rain\nformation. Aims: Our goal is to understand why some TNE cycles produce such\nabundant coronal rain, while others produce little to no rain. Methods: We\nreconstruct the geometry of the event reported by Auch\\`ere et al., using\nimages from STEREO/SECCHI/EUVI and magnetograms from SDO/HMI. We then perform\n1D hydrodynamic simulations of this event, for different heating parameters and\nvariations of the loop geometry (9000 simulations in total). We compare the\nresulting behaviour to simulations of TNE cycles by Froment et al. that do not\nproduce coronal rain. Results: Our simulations show that both prominences and\nTNE cycles (with and without coronal rain) can form within the same magnetic\nstructure. We show that the formation of coronal rain during TNE cycles depends\non the asymmetry of the loop and of the heating. Asymmetric loops are overall\nless likely to produce coronal rain, regardless of the heating. In symmetric\nloops, coronal rain forms when the heating is also symmetric. In asymmetric\nloops, rain forms only when the heating compensates the asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The terminology comes from the\nfact that these algebras can also be realized as quotients of dimer algebras on\na disc. They are defined by a quiver with potential whose dual graph is a tree,\nand they are generally of wild representation type. Given such an algebra $B$,\nwe construct a polygon $\\mathcal{S}$ with a checkerboard pattern in its\ninterior, that defines a category $\\text{Diag}(\\mathcal{S})$. The\nindecomposable objects of $\\text{Diag}(\\mathcal{S})$ are the 2-diagonals in\n$\\mathcal{S}$, and its morphisms are certain pivoting moves between the\n2-diagonals.

However, most of the existing polar-coded SCMA (PC-SCMA)\nsystems suffer from high latency caused by the feedback iteration and list\ndecoding. In addition, the error performance of PC-SCMA systems is\nunsatisfactory for ultra-reliable transmission. Inspired by the compelling\nbenefits of non-binary polar codes, in this paper, we design a non-binary\npolar-coded SCMA (NB-PC-SCMA) system with a free order matching strategy to\naddress the issues of delay and reliability. Specifically, we first formulate a\njoint factor graph for NB-PC-SCMA and propose a non-binary successive\ncancellation list (NB-SCL) and damping based joint iterative detection and\ndecoding (NSD-JIDD) multiuser receiver to improve the BER and latency\nperformance. Then, a lazy-search based NB-SCL (L-NB-SCL) decoding is proposed\nto reduce the computational complexity by simplifying the path search pattern\nof the list decoder. After that, we modify the update of user nodes for SCMA\ndetection to improve the convergence error and finally propose the improved\nNSD-JIDD (ISD-JIDD) algorithm, which can avoid redundant operations by\nexploiting L-NB-SCL decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed\nNB-PC-SCMA system achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance and\nconsiderable latency gain when compared to its counterparts. In particular, the\nproposed ISD-JIDD can achieve similar BER performance of NSD-JIDD with less\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:51:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 14:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Existing numeric\nplanning systems for the problem often discretize numeric variables or impose\nconvex constraints on numeric variables, which harms the performance when\nsolving problems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm framework to\nsolve numeric planning problems mixed with logical relations and numeric\nchanges based on gradient descent. We cast the numeric planning with logical\nrelations and numeric changes as an optimization problem. Specifically, we\nextend syntax to allow parameters of action models to be either objects or\nreal-valued numbers, which enhances the ability to model real-world numeric\neffects. Based on the extended modeling language, we propose a gradient-based\nframework to simultaneously optimize numeric parameters and compute appropriate\nactions to form candidate plans. The gradient-based framework is composed of an\nalgorithmic heuristic module based on propositional operations to select\nactions and generate constraints for gradient descent, an algorithmic\ntransition module to update states to next ones, and a loss module to compute\nloss. We repeatedly minimize loss by updating numeric parameters and compute\ncandidate plans until it converges into a valid plan for the planning problem.\nIn the empirical study, we exhibit that our algorithm framework is both\neffective and efficient in solving planning problems mixed with logical\nrelations and numeric changes, especially when the problems contain obstacles\nand non-linear numeric effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 14:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 08:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Specifically, capturing the\nheterogeneous and anisotropic behaviour of cerebral white matter (WM) is\nextremely challenging and yet the data on WM at a spatial resolution relevant\nto tissue components are sparse. To investigate the time-dependent mechanical\nbehaviour of WM, and its dependence on local microstructural features when\nsubjected to small deformations, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nstress relaxation experiments on corpus callosum (CC), corona radiata (CR) and\nfornix (FO) of fresh ovine brain.

Hybrid gripper (soft actuators enhanced by\nrigid constraints) is a new trend in soft gripper design. With right structural\ncomponents actuated by soft actuators, they could achieve excellent grasping\nadaptability and payload, while also being easy to model and control with\nconventional kinematics. However, existing works were mostly focused on\nachieving superior payload and perception with simple planar workspaces,\nresulting in far less dexterity compared with conventional grippers. In this\nwork, we took inspiration from the human Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and\nproposed a new hybrid gripper design with 8 independent muscles.

Extreme observations\nare specified as values that exceed a threshold or as maximum values over\ndistinct blocks of time, and subsequent estimation procedures are motivated by\nasymptotic theory for extremes of random processes. For environmental data,\nnonstationary behavior in the bulk of the distribution, such as seasonality or\nclimate change, will also be observed in the tails. To accurately model such\nnonstationarity, it seems natural to use the entire dataset rather than just\nthe most extreme values. It is also common to observe different types of\nnonstationarity in each tail of a distribution. Most work on extremes only\nfocuses on one tail of a distribution, but for temperature, both tails are of\ninterest. This paper builds on a recently proposed parametric model for the\nentire probability distribution that has flexible behavior in both tails.

When a particle is embedded in a host solid near its\nbulk melting temperature, the latter may melt at the surface of the former in a\nprocess known as interfacial premelting. The thickness of the melt film depends\non the temperature, impurities, material properties and geometry. A temperature\ngradient is accompanied by a thermomolecular pressure gradient that drives the\ninterfacial liquid from high to low temperatures and hence the particle from\nlow to high temperatures, in a process called thermal regelation. When the host\nmaterial is ice and the embedded particle is a biological entity, one has a\nparticularly novel form of active matter, which addresses interplay between a\nwide range of problems, from extremophiles of both terrestrial and\nexobiological relevance to ecological dynamics in Earth's cryosphere. Of basic\nimportance in all such settings is the combined influence of biological\nactivity and thermal regelation in controlling the redistribution of\nbioparticles. Therefore, we re-cast this class of regelation phenomena in the\nstochastic framework of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics and make predictions\nrelevant to this and related problems of interest in biological and geophysical\nproblems.

Therefore, 2D GaS fills the void\nbetween 2D small-band-gap semiconductors and insulators, resulting of interest\nfor the realization of van der Waals type-I heterojunctions in photocatalysis,\nas well as the development of UV light-emitting diodes, quantum wells, and\nother optoelectronic devices.

In fact, the 2D morphology of the GaS\nflakes intrinsically minimizes the distance between the photogenerated charges\nand the surface area at which the redox reactions occur, limiting electron-hole\nrecombination losses.

We propose an\narchitecture that uses social cues to determine when a robot should provide\nassistance. Based on a multimodal fusion approach upon eye gaze and language\nmodalities, our architecture is trained and evaluated on data collected in a\nrobot-assisted Lego building task. By focusing on social cues, our architecture\nhas minimal dependencies on the specifics of a given task, enabling it to be\napplied in many different contexts. Enabling a social robot to recognize a\nuser's needs through social cues can help it to adapt to user behaviors and\npreferences, which in turn will lead to improved user experiences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 22:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

We validate SOSP-H by comparing\nit to our second method SOSP-I that uses a well-established Hessian\napproximation, and to numerous state-of-the-art methods. While SOSP-H performs\non par or better in terms of accuracy, it has clear advantages in terms of\nscalability and efficiency. This allowed us to scale SOSP-H to large-scale\nvision tasks, even though it captures correlations across all layers of the\nnetwork. To underscore the global nature of our pruning methods, we evaluate\ntheir performance not only by removing structures from a pretrained network,\nbut also by detecting architectural bottlenecks.

The feasibility of this scheme is\ndemonstrated through a demultiplexing experiment over the entire C-band (1530\nnm - 1550 nm), employing 24 Gbaud Nyquist QAM signals due to experimental\nconstraints on the transmitter side. However, the silicon Mach-Zehnder\nmodulator with a 3-dB bandwidth of only 16 GHz can demultiplex Nyquist pulses\nof 90 GHz optical bandwidth suggesting a possibility to reach symbol rates up\nto 90 GBd in an integrated Nyquist transceiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 12:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}
