Numerical solutions to transfer problems of polarized radiation in\nsolar and stellar atmospheres commonly rely on stationary iterative methods,\nwhich often perform poorly when applied to large problems. In recent times,\nstationary iterative methods have been replaced by state-of-the-art\npreconditioned Krylov iterative methods for many applications. However, a\ngeneral description and a convergence analysis of Krylov methods in the\npolarized radiative transfer context are still lacking. Aims. We describe the\npractical application of preconditioned Krylov methods to linear transfer\nproblems of polarized radiation, possibly in a matrix-free context. The main\naim is to clarify the advantages and drawbacks of various Krylov accelerators\nwith respect to stationary iterative methods. Methods. We report the\nconvergence rate and the run time of various Krylov-accelerated techniques\ncombined with different formal solvers when applied to a 1D benchmark transfer\nproblem of polarized radiation. In particular, we analyze the GMRES, BICGSTAB,\nand CGS Krylov methods, preconditioned with Jacobi, or (S)SOR. Results. Krylov\nmethods accelerate the convergence, reduce the run time, and improve the\nrobustness of standard stationary iterative methods. Jacobi-preconditioned\nKrylov methods outperform SOR-preconditioned stationary iterations in all\nrespects. In particular, the Jacobi-GMRES method offers the best overall\nperformance for the problem setting in use. Conclusions. Krylov methods can be\nmore challenging to implement than stationary iterative methods. However, an\nalgebraic formulation of the radiative transfer problem allows one to apply and\nstudy Krylov acceleration strategies with little effort. Furthermore, many\navailable numerical libraries implement matrix-free Krylov routines, enabling\nan almost effortless transition to Krylov methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 16:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Several numerical problems require the interpolation of discrete\ndata that present various types of discontinuities. The radiative transfer is a\ntypical example of such a problem. This calls for high-order well-behaved\ntechniques to interpolate both smooth and discontinuous data. Aims. The final\naim is to propose new techniques suitable for applications in the context of\nnumerical radiative transfer. Methods. We have proposed and tested two\ndifferent techniques. Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) techniques generate\nseveral candidate interpolations based on different substencils. The smoothest\ncandidate interpolation is determined from a measure for the local smoothness,\nthereby enabling the essential non-oscillatory property. Weighted ENO (WENO)\ntechniques use a convex combination of all candidate substencils to obtain\nhigh-order accuracy in smooth regions while keeping the essentially\nnon-oscillatory property. In particular, we have outlined and tested a novel\nwell-performing fourth-order WENO interpolation technique for both uniform and\nnonuniform grids. Results. Numerical tests prove that the fourth-order WENO\ninterpolation guarantees fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions of the\ninterpolated functions. In the presence of discontinuities, the fourth-order\nWENO interpolation enables the non-oscillatory property, avoiding oscillations.\nUnlike B\\'ezier and monotonic high-order Hermite interpolations, it does not\ndegenerate to a linear interpolation near smooth extrema of the interpolated\nfunction. Conclusions. The novel fourth-order WENO interpolation guarantees\nhigh accuracy in smooth regions, while effectively handling discontinuities.\nThis interpolation technique might be particularly suitable for several\nproblems, including a number of radiative transfer applications such as\nmultidimensional problems, multigrid methods, and formal solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 16:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

We show that a\ngeneralisation of the adiabatic transfer of averaged oscillations (ATAO)\nscheme, a numerical method previously developed without neutrino degeneracy and\nbased on the large separation of time scales in this problem, is sufficient to\nreach the same accuracy as the full quantum kinetic equation integration, but\nis notably faster. This approximation highlights the physics of synchronous\noscillations at play in the evolution of neutrino chemical potentials,\nespecially in the particular case with only two-neutrino mixing. In particular,\nit allows to understand what controls the beginning and the amplitude of\noscillations, but also why there is a subsequent regime of collective\noscillations with larger frequencies. We also find that it is very important to\nuse the full collision term instead of relying on damping-like approximations,\nin order not to overestimate how collisions reduce these synchronous\noscillations.

The article considers a simple iterative model of the evolution of black\nholes in a cyclic Universe, independent of specific cosmological theories. The\nmodel has two free parameters that determine the iterative decrease in the\nnumber of black holes and the increase in their individual mass. It is shown\nthat this model, with wide variations in the parameters, explains the observed\nnumber of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, as well as the\nrelationships between different classes of black holes. The mechanism of\naccumulation of relict black holes during repeated pulsations of the Universe\nmay be responsible for the black hole population detected by LIGO observations\nand probably responsible for the dark matter phenomenon. The number of black\nholes of intermediate masses corresponds to the number of globular clusters and\ndwarf satellite galaxies. These results argue for models of the oscillating\nUniverse, and at the same time impose substantial requirements on them. Models\nof a pulsating Universe should be characterized by a high level of relict\ngravitational radiation generated at the time of maximum compression of the\nUniverse and mass mergers of black holes, as well as solve the problem of the\nexistence of the largest black hole that is formed during this merger.

The seminal work of May in\n1972 and recent developments based on the theory of random matrices have shown\nthe existence of emergent universal patterns of both stability and feasibility\nin ecological dynamics. However, only a few studies have investigated the role\nof delay coupled with population dynamics in the emergence of feasible and\nstable states. In this work, we study the effects of delay on Generalized\nLoka-Volterra population dynamics of several interacting species in closed\necological environments. First, we investigate the relation between feasibility\nand stability of the modeled ecological community in the absence of delay and\nfind a simple analytical relation when intra-species interactions are dominant.\nWe then show how, by increasing the time delay, there is a transition in the\nstability phases of the population dynamics: from an equilibrium state to a\nstable non-point attractor phase. We calculate analytically the critical delay\nof that transition and show that it is in excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulations. Finally, we introduce a measure of stability that holds for out of\nequilibrium dynamics and we show that in the oscillatory regime induced by the\ndelay stability increases for increasing ecosystem diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 16:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

We introduce a method of synthesizing CSS codes that\nrealize a target logical diagonal gate at some level $l$ in the Clifford\nhierarchy. The method combines three basic operations: concatenation, removal\nof $Z$-stabilizers, and addition of $X$-stabilizers. It explicitly tracks the\nlogical gate induced by a diagonal physical gate that preserves a CSS code. The\nfirst step is concatenation, where the input is a CSS code and a physical\ndiagonal gate at level $l$ inducing a logical diagonal gate at the same level.\nThe output is a new code for which a physical diagonal gate at level $l+1$\ninduces the original logical gate. The next step is judicious removal of\n$Z$-stabilizers to increase the level of the induced logical operator. We\nidentify three ways of climbing the logical Clifford hierarchy from level $l$\nto level $l+1$, each built on a recursive relation on the Pauli coefficients of\nthe induced logical operators. Removal of $Z$-stabilizers may reduce distance,\nand the purpose of the third basic operation, addition of $X$-stabilizers, is\nto compensate for such losses. For the coherent noise model, we describe how to\nswitch between computation and storage of intermediate results in a\ndecoherence-free subspace by simply applying Pauli $X$ matrices. The approach\nto logical gate synthesis taken in prior work focuses on the code states, and\nresults in sufficient conditions for a CSS code to be fixed by a transversal\n$Z$-rotation. In contrast, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions by\nanalyzing the action of a transversal diagonal gate on the stabilizer group\nthat determines the code. The power of our approach is demonstrated by two\nproofs of concept: the $[[2^{l+1}-2,2,2]]$ triorthogonal code family, and the\n$[[2^m,\\binom{m}{r},2^{\\min\\{r,m-r\\}}]]$ quantum Reed-Muller code family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

For these problems, we propose an\nalternative approach that reuses the original optimization problem formulation\nand leads to better allocations than domain-specific heuristics. Our technique,\nPartitioned Optimization Problems (POP), randomly splits the problem into\nsmaller problems (with a subset of the clients and resources in the system) and\ncoalesces the resulting sub-allocations into a global allocation for all\nclients.

Among all the existing probes, of particular importance are the\nSupernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs): the former are\nconsidered among the best standard candles so far discovered but suffer from\nthe fact that can be observed until redshift $z=2.26$, while the latter are\npromising standardizable candles which have been observed up to $z=9.4$,\nsurpassing even the farthest quasar known to date, which is at $z=7.64$. The\nstandard candles can be used to test the cosmological models and to give the\nexpected values of cosmological parameters, in particular the Hubble constant\nvalue. The Hubble constant is affected by the so-called \\say{Hubble constant\ntension}, a discrepancy in more than 4 $\\sigma$ between its value measured with\nlocal probes and its value measured through the cosmological probes. The\nincrease in the number of observed SNe Ia, as well as the future\nstandardization of GRBs through their correlations, will surely be of help in\nalleviating the Hubble constant tension and in explaining the structure of the\nuniverse at higher redshifts. A promising class of GRBs for future\nstandardization is represented by the GRBs associated with Supernovae Ib/c,\nsince these present features similar to the SNe Ia class and obey a tight\ncorrelation between their luminosity at the end of the plateau emission in\nX-rays and the time at the end of the plateau in the rest-frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a\nquadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on\napproximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been\nmade in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work\nshows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for\nvisual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in\nkeeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically,\nconventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product\nbetween token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any\nsubsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a\nsoftmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in\nself-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product\nsimilarity without further normalization.

The dissociation of water vapour results in\nthe production of the hydroxyl radical (OH). While OH absorption is easily\nobserved in near-infrared spectra of M dwarfs, which have similar effective\ntemperatures as ultra-hot Jupiters, it is often not considered when studying\nthe atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. We use high-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations of a transit of WASP-76b obtained using CARMENES to study the\npresence of OH. After validating the OH line list, we generate model transit\nspectra of WASP-76b with petitRADTRANS. The data are corrected for stellar and\ntelluric contamination and cross-correlated with the model spectra. After\ncombining all cross-correlation functions from the transit, a detection map is\nconstructed. Constraints on the planet properties from the OH absorption are\nobtained from a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. OH is detected in the\natmosphere of WASP-76b with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 6.1. From the\nretrieval we obtain $K_p=232 \\pm 12$ km/s and a blueshift of $-13.2 \\pm 1.6$\nkm/s, which are offset from the expected velocities. Considering the fast spin\nrotation of the planet, the blueshift is best explained with the signal\npredominantly originating from the evening terminator and the presence of a\nstrong dayside-to-nightside wind. The increased $K_p$ over its expected value\n(196.5 km/s) is, however, a bit puzzling. The signal is found to be broad, with\na full width at half maximum of $16.8^{+4.6}_{-4.0}$ km/s. The retrieval\nresults in a weak constraint on the mean temperature of 2700-3700 K at the\npressure range of the OH signal. We show that OH is readily observable in the\ntransit spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters.

However, because of the absence of direct observational\nconstraints, the detailed IMF remains elusive. Nevertheless, numerical\nsimulations agree in broad terms that the first stars were typically massive\nand should often end their lives in violent, explosive deaths. These fates\ninclude extremely luminous pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) and bright\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the latter arising from the collapse of rapidly\nrotating progenitor stars into black holes. These high-redshift transients are\nexpected to be within the detection limits of upcoming space telescope\nmissions, allowing to place effective constraints on the shape of the\nprimordial IMF that is not easily accessible with other probes. This paper\npresents a framework to probe the Pop III IMF, utilizing the cosmological\nsource densities of high-redshift PISNe and GRBs. Considering these transients\nseparately could provide useful constraints on the Pop III IMF, but tighter\nbounds are obtainable by combining PISN and GRB counts. This combined\ndiagnostic is more robust as it is independent of the underlying Pop III star\nformation rate density, an unknown prior. Future surveys promise to capture\nmost high-redshift GRBs across the entire sky, but high-redshift PISN searches\nwith future telescopes, e.g. Roman Space Telescope, will likely be\nsubstantially incomplete. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that even such lower\nbounds on the PISN count will be able to provide key constraints on the\nprimordial IMF, in particular, if it is top-heavy or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 22:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The assembly history of the stellar component of a massive\nelliptical galaxy is closely related to that of its dark matter halo. Measuring\nhow the properties of galaxies correlate with their halo mass can help\nunderstand their evolution.\n  Aims. We investigate how the dark matter halo mass of elliptical galaxies\nvaries as a function of their properties, using weak gravitational lensing\nobservations. To minimise the chances of biases, we focus on galaxy properties\nthat can be determined robustly: the surface brightness profile and the colour.\n  Methods. We selected 2409 central massive elliptical galaxies from the SDSS\nspectroscopic sample. We first measured their surface brightness profile and\ncolours by fitting Sersic models to photometric data from the Kilo-Degree\nSurvey (KiDS). We fitted their halo mass distribution as a function of\nredshift, rest-frame $r-$band luminosity, half-light radius and rest-frame\n$u-g$ colour, using KiDS weak lensing data and a Bayesian hierarchical\napproach. For the sake of robustness to assumptions on the large-radii\nbehaviour of the surface brightness, we repeated the analysis replacing total\nluminosity and half-light radius with the luminosity within a 10~kpc aperture,\n$L_{r,10}$, and the light-weighted surface brightness slope, $\\Gamma_{10}$.\n  Results. We did not detect any correlation between halo mass and either\nhalf-light radius or colour, at fixed redshift and luminosity.\n  Conclusions. Our results indicate that the average star formation efficiency\nof massive elliptical galaxies has little dependence on their final size or\ncolour. This suggests that the origin of the diversity in the size and colour\ndistribution of these objects lies with properties other than halo mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 09:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In particular, measures of\npolarization based on opinion variance are known to decrease over time in\nframeworks such as the popular DeGroot model. Complementing recent work that\nseeks to resolve this apparent inconsistency by modifying opinion models, we\ninstead resolve the inconsistency by proposing changes to how polarization is\nquantified.\n  We present a natural class of group-based polarization measures that capture\nthe extent to which opinions are clustered into distinct groups. Using\ntheoretical arguments and empirical evidence, we show that these group-based\nmeasures display interesting, non-monotonic dynamics, even in the simple\nDeGroot model. In particular, for many natural social networks, group-based\nmetrics can increase over time, and thereby correctly capture perceptions of\nincreasing polarization.\n  Our results build on work by DeMarzo et al., who introduced a group-based\npolarization metric based on ideological alignment. We show that a central tool\nfrom that work, a limit analysis of individual opinions under the DeGroot\nmodel, can be extended to the dynamics of other group-based polarization\nmeasures, including established statistical measures like bimodality.\n  We also consider local measures of polarization that operationalize how\npolarization is perceived in a network setting.

Spectral line polarization is\nmodeled by solving the radiative transfer problem for polarized radiation,\nunder nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, taking PRD effects into\naccount, in static one-dimensional semi-empirical atmospheric models presenting\narbitrary magnetic fields. The problem is solved through a two-step approach.\nIn step 1, the problem is solved for intensity only, considering a multi-level\natom.

Conventional post-training pruning techniques lean towards\nefficient inference while overlooking the heavy computation for training.\nRecent exploration of pre-training pruning at initialization hints on training\ncost reduction via pruning, but suffers noticeable performance degradation. We\nattempt to combine the benefits of both directions and propose a policy that\nprunes as early as possible during training without hurting performance.\nInstead of pruning at initialization, our method exploits initial dense\ntraining for few epochs to quickly guide the architecture, while constantly\nevaluating dominant sub-networks via neuron importance ranking. This unveils\ndominant sub-networks whose structures turn stable, allowing conventional\npruning to be pushed earlier into the training. To do this early, we further\nintroduce an Early Pruning Indicator (EPI) that relies on sub-network\narchitectural similarity and quickly triggers pruning when the sub-network's\narchitecture stabilizes. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, we show\nthat EPI empowers a quick tracking of early training epochs suitable for\npruning, offering same efficacy as an otherwise ``oracle'' grid-search that\nscans through epochs and requires orders of magnitude more compute. Our method\nyields $1.4\\%$ top-1 accuracy boost over state-of-the-art pruning counterparts,\ncuts down training cost on GPU by $2.4\\times$, hence offers a new\nefficiency-accuracy boundary for network pruning during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 18:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Ram\\'irez C., Weak notions of\nnondegeneracy in nonlinear semidefinite programming, arXiv:2012.14810, 2020]\nthe classical notion of nondegeneracy (or transversality) and Robinson's\nconstraint qualification have been revisited in the context of nonlinear\nsemidefinite programming exploiting the structure of the problem, namely, its\neigendecomposition. This allows formulating the conditions equivalently in\nterms of (positive) linear independence of significantly smaller sets of\nvectors. In this paper we extend these ideas to the context of nonlinear\nsecond-order cone programming. For instance, for an $m$-dimensional\nsecond-order cone, instead of stating nondegeneracy at the vertex as the linear\nindependence of $m$ derivative vectors, we do it in terms of several statements\nof linear independence of $2$ derivative vectors.

Standard\nsynchrotron self-Compton models generally fail to reproduce the VHE emission,\nwhich has led to the suggestion that it might arise not from the blazar core,\nbut on kiloparsec scales from inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) photons by a still-relativistic jet (IC/CMB).

Fundamental differences between scalar and\nvector waves in both these aspects make their comprehension even more\nproblematic. Here we present an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the\norder-to-disorder transition in 2D resonant systems. We show with exact ab\ninitio numerical simulations in hyperuniform media that localization of 2D\nvector waves can occur in the presence of correlated disorder, in a regime of\nmoderate density of scatterers. On the contrary, no signature of localization\nis found for white noise disorder. This is in striking contrast with scalar\nwaves which localize at high density whatever the amount of correlation. For\ncorrelated materials, localization is associated with the formation of\npseudo-gap in the density of states. We develop two complementary models to\nexplain these observations. The first one uses an effective photonic\ncrystal-type framework and the second relies on a diagrammatic treatment of the\nmultiple scattering sequences. We provide explicit theoretical evaluations of\nthe density of states and localization length in good agreement with numerical\nsimulations.

Thus, directly utilizing\ncurrent GNNs on imbalanced data would generate coarse representations of nodes\nin minority classes and ultimately compromise the classification performance.\nThis therefore portends the importance of developing effective GNNs for\nhandling imbalanced graph data.

Since future learning algorithms will be required to deal with both\nhigh dimensional data and highly complex mechanisms governing the data, we\nultimately believe work on tractable inference for causality to be decisive.

Often, one observes data\non the nodes and the task is to learn the graph structure, or perform graphical\nmodel selection. While this is a well-studied problem with many popular\ntechniques, there are typically three major practical challenges: i) many\nexisting algorithms become computationally intractable in huge-data settings\nwith tens of thousands of nodes; ii) the need for separate data-driven\nhyperparameter tuning considerably adds to the computational burden; iii) the\nstatistical accuracy of selected edges often deteriorates as the dimension\nand/or the complexity of the underlying graph structures increase.

The procedure starts\nwith identifying the correct location (the cricothyroid membrane) for creating\nan incision to insert an endotracheal tube. This location is determined using a\ncombination of visual and palpation cues. Enabling robot-assisted remote\ncricothyrotomy may extend this life-saving procedure to injured soldiers or\npatients who may not be readily accessible for on-site intervention during\nsearch-and-rescue scenarios. As a first step towards achieving this goal, this\npaper explores the feasibility of palpation-assisted landmark identification\nfor cricothyrotomy. Using a cricothyrotomy training simulator, we explore\nseveral alternatives for in-situ remote localization of the cricothyroid\nmembrane.

Using the manually digitized\ncricothyroid membrane location as ground truth, we compare these four methods\nfor accuracy and repeatability of identifying the landmark for cricothyrotomy,\ntime of completion, and ease of use. These preliminary results suggest that the\naccuracy of remote cricothyrotomy landmark identification is improved when the\nuser is aided with visual and force cues.

Synthetic noise, though has clean structures which greatly enabled\nstatistical analyses, often fails to model real-world noise patterns. The\nrecent literature has observed several efforts to offer real-world noisy\ndatasets, yet the existing efforts suffer from two caveats: (1) The lack of\nground-truth verification makes it hard to theoretically study the property and\ntreatment of real-world label noise; (2) These efforts are often of large\nscales, which may result in unfair comparisons of robust methods within\nreasonable and accessible computation power. To better understand real-world\nlabel noise, it is crucial to build controllable and moderate-sized real-world\nnoisy datasets with both ground-truth and noisy labels. This work presents two\nnew benchmark datasets CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-100N, equipping the training datasets\nof CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 with human-annotated real-world noisy labels we\ncollected from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We quantitatively and qualitatively show\nthat real-world noisy labels follow an instance-dependent pattern rather than\nthe classically assumed and adopted ones (e.g., class-dependent label noise).\nWe then initiate an effort to benchmarking a subset of the existing solutions\nusing CIFAR-10N and CIFAR-100N.

We show indeed the real-world\nnoise patterns impose new and outstanding challenges as compared to synthetic\nlabel noise.

Healey puts forward the\ninterpretation as an alternative to realist quantum theories on the one hand\nsuch as Bohmian mechanics, spontaneous collapse theories, and many-worlds\ninterpretations, which are different proposals for describing what the quantum\nworld is like and what the basic laws of physics are, and non-realist\ninterpretations on the other hand such as quantum Bayesianism, which proposes\nto understand quantum theory as describing agents' subjective epistemic states.\nThe central idea of Healey's proposal is to understand quantum theory as\nproviding not a description of the physical world but a set of authoritative\nand objectively correct prescriptions about how agents should act. The book\nprovides a detailed development and defense of that idea, and it contains\ninteresting discussions about a wide range of philosophical issues such as\nrepresentation, probability, explanation, causation, objectivity, meaning, and\nfundamentality. Healey's project is at the intersection of physics and\nphilosophy. The book is divided into two parts. Part I of the book discusses\nthe foundational questions in quantum theory from the perspective of the\nprescriptive interpretation. In Part II, Healey discusses the philosophical\nimplications of the view. Both parts are written in a way that is largely\naccessible to non-specialists. In this brief book review, I will focus on two\nquestions: (1) How does Healey's idea work? (2) What reasons are there to\nbelieve in it?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

In the\nproposed scheme, the branch currents are the state variables, whereas the bus\nvoltages become the inputs which can vary freely with loads. As a result, the\nentire microgrids system can be partitioned into local areas, where neighbor\nareas share the common inputs. The proposed estimation scheme then can be\nimplemented in a distributed manner. A novel Kalman-based filtering method is\nderived to estimate both states and inputs simultaneously. Only information of\ncommon inputs is exchanged between neighboring estimators. Simulation results\nof the 13-bus Potsdam microgrid (New York State) are provided to prove the\nfeasibility and performances of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 04:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

However, image\nlevel perturbations violate the cluster assumption in the setting of\nsegmentation. Moreover, existing image level perturbations are hand-crafted\nwhich could be sub-optimal.

If the old knowledge interferes with the\nlearning of a new task, i.e., the forward knowledge transfer is negative, then\nprecisely remembering the old tasks will further aggravate the interference,\nthus decreasing the performance of continual learning. By contrast, biological\nneural networks can actively forget the old knowledge that conflicts with the\nlearning of a new experience, through regulating the learning-triggered\nsynaptic expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by the biological active\nforgetting, we propose to actively forget the old knowledge that limits the\nlearning of new tasks to benefit continual learning. Under the framework of\nBayesian continual learning, we develop a novel approach named Active\nForgetting with synaptic Expansion-Convergence (AFEC). Our method dynamically\nexpands parameters to learn each new task and then selectively combines them,\nwhich is formally consistent with the underlying mechanism of biological active\nforgetting. We extensively evaluate AFEC on a variety of continual learning\nbenchmarks, including CIFAR-10 regression tasks, visual classification tasks\nand Atari reinforcement tasks, where AFEC effectively improves the learning of\nnew tasks and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a plug-and-play way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 10:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 23:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

To this end, we propose a\nnovel dual shape guided network (DSGnet) to automatically delineate nine\nimportant OARs in head and neck CT images. To deal with the large shape\nvariation and unclear boundary of OARs in CT images, we represent the organ\nshape using an organ-specific unilateral inverse-distance map (UIDM) and guide\nthe segmentation task from two different perspectives: direct shape guidance by\nfollowing the segmentation prediction and across shape guidance by sharing the\nsegmentation feature. In the direct shape guidance, the segmentation prediction\nis not only supervised by the true label mask, but also by the true UIDM, which\nis implemented through a simple yet effective encoder-decoder mapping from the\nlabel space to the distance space. In the across shape guidance, UIDM is used\nto facilitate the segmentation by optimizing the shared feature maps. For the\nexperiments, we build a large head and neck CT dataset with a total of 699\nimages from different volunteers, and conduct comprehensive experiments and\ncomparisons with other state-of-the-art methods to justify the effectiveness\nand efficiency of our proposed method.

The influence of a user is monitored via two novel concepts: the\n$collapsed~power$ to measure the effect of user weakening, and the\n$anchored~power$ to measure the effect of user strengthening. We show that the\ntwo concepts can be naturally integrated such that a unified offline algorithm\nis proposed to compute both the collapsed and anchored followers for each user.\nWhen the network structure evolves, online techniques are designed to maintain\nthe users' followers, which is faster than redoing the offline algorithm by\naround 3 orders of magnitude.

The agents in deep structured teams are\ncoupled in dynamics, costs and measurements through a set of linear regressions\nof the states and actions (also called deep states and deep actions). The\ninformation structure is decentralized, where every agent observes a noisy\nmeasurement of its local state and the global deep state. Since the number of\nagents is often very large in deep structured teams, any naive approach to\nfinding an optimal Kalman filter suffers from the curse of dimensionality.\nMoreover, due to the decentralized nature of information structure, the\nresultant optimization problem is non-convex, in general, where non-linear\nstrategies can outperform linear ones.

Here we investigate the information transmission\nproperties of heteroclinic networks, studying them as communication channels.\nChoosing a tractable but representative system exhibiting a heteroclinic\nnetwork, we investigate the mutual information rate (MIR) between input signals\nand the resulting sequences of states as the level of noise varies.\nIntriguingly, MIR does not decrease monotonically with increasing noise.\nIntermediate noise levels indeed maximize the information transmission capacity\nby promoting an increased yet controlled exploration of the underlying network\nof states. Complementing standard stochastic resonance, these results highlight\nthe constructive effect of stochastic facilitation (i.e. noise-enhanced\ninformation transfer) on heteroclinic communication channels and possibly on\nmore general dynamical systems exhibiting complex trajectories in state-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 13:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Thus we finally introduce two\nnovel algorithms: Dynamic-Mirror Descent Model Predictive RL(DeMoRL), which\nuses the method of elite fractions for the inner loop and Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) as the off-policy RL for the outer loop and Dynamic-Mirror Descent Model\nPredictive Layer(DeMo Layer), a special case of the hierarchical framework\nwhich guides linear policies trained using Augmented Random Search(ARS). Our\nexperiments show faster convergence of the proposed DeMo RL, and better or\nequal performance compared to other Mf-Mb approaches on benchmark MuJoCo\ncontrol tasks. The DeMo Layer was tested on classical Cartpole and custom-built\nQuadruped trained using Linear Policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 15:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Theoretical accounts of predictive coding agree that neurons\ncomputing prediction error and the generative model exist at all levels of the\nprocessing hierarchy.

Here we investigated predictive processing\nwith respect to two independent concurrent generative models in the auditory\npathway using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

ZnO\nis one of the materials that has received a great deal of attention due to its\nunique properties of being a semiconductor with wide bandgap and piezoelectric\neffects. The simpler crystal growth mechanisms of ZnO have resulted in a lower\ncost of ZnO-based sensors. Different types of pressure sensors based on ZnO\nsensing elements have also been explored. A thin circular ZnO film was\nsimulated as a piezoelectric sensor employing the finite element method in\nCOMSOL. The pressure applied on the thin film surface was varied and a boundary\npoint probe was used to study the displacement field and voltage at the center\nof the membrane. The displacement field and voltage induced by pressure vary\nlinearly with increasing pressure on the ZnO layer. Also. the method used in\nthis paper was applied to different piezoelectric materials, such as barium\ntitanate (BaTiO3), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and gallium arsenide (GaAs)\nthat were studied by other groups, and similar conclusions were made. These\nsimulations can be used in the design of piezoelectric sensors and the\noptimization of the sensitivity and performance of the materials used in\npressure sensor applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

A follow-up observation in X-rays by the {\\it Swift}/XRT reveals that (1)\nthe X-ray emission level gradually decreases since 2005; and (2) the X-ray\nspectrum is soft in the optical \"turn-off\" state and hard in the \"turn-on\"\nstate.

The literature shows that the concept of planet\ndeveloped by scientists during the Copernican Revolution was theory-laden and\npragmatic for science. It included both primaries and satellites as planets due\nto their common intrinsic, geological characteristics. About two centuries\nlater the non-scientific public had just adopted heliocentrism and was\nmotivated to preserve elements of geocentrism including teleology and the\nassumptions of astrology. This motivated development of a folk concept of\nplanet that contradicted the scientific view. The folk taxonomy was based on\nwhat an object orbits, making satellites out to be non-planets and ignoring\nmost asteroids. Astronomers continued to keep primaries and moons classed\ntogether as planets and continued teaching that taxonomy until the 1920s. The\nastronomical community lost interest in planets ca. 1910 to 1955 and during\nthat period complacently accepted the folk concept. Enough time has now elapsed\nso that modern astronomers forgot this history and rewrote it to claim that the\nfolk taxonomy is the one that was created by the Copernican scientists.\nStarting ca. 1960 when spacecraft missions were developed to send back detailed\nnew data, there was an explosion of publishing about planets including the\nsatellites, leading to revival of the Copernican planet concept. We present\nevidence that taxonomical alignment with geological complexity is the most\nuseful scientific taxonomy for planets. It is this complexity of both primary\nand secondary planets that is a key part of the chain of origins for life in\nthe cosmos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 18:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}
