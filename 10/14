In this\npaper, we evaluate the performances of two pipelines suitable for the OCR of\nhistorical classical commentaries. Our results show that Kraken + Ciaconna\nreaches a substantially lower character error rate (CER) than Tesseract/OCR-D\non commentary sections with high density of polytonic Greek text (average CER\n7% vs. 13%), while Tesseract/OCR-D is slightly more accurate than Kraken +\nCiaconna on text sections written predominantly in Latin script (average CER\n8.2% vs. 8.4%).

Indeed, starting from a production molecular dynamics\ntrajectory, this method can estimate properties at one or more target levels of\ntheory from only a small number of additional fixed-geometry calculations,\nwhich are used to train a machine learning model. However, as MLPT is based on\nthermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT), inaccuracies might arise when the\nstarting point trajectory samples a configurational space which has a small\noverlap with that of the target approximations of interest. By considering case\nstudies of molecules adsorbed in zeolites and several different density\nfunctional theory approximations, in this work we assess the accuracy of MLPT\nfor ensemble total energies and enthalpies of adsorption. The problematic cases\nthat were found are analyzed and it is shown that, even without knowing exact\nreference results, pathological cases for MLPT can be detected by considering a\ncoefficient that measures the statistical imbalance induced by the TPT\nreweighting. For the most pathological examples we recover target level results\nwithin chemical accuracy by applying a machine learning-based Monte Carlo\n(MLMC) resampling. Finally, based on the ideas developed in this work, we\nassess and confirm the accuracy of recently published MLPT-based enthalpies of\nadsorption at the random phase approximation level, whose high computational\ncost would completely hinder a direct molecular dynamics simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

Specifically, in a conversation involving two speakers, we\nregard the utterances from one speaker as responses and those from the other as\nqueries. After understanding queries via our encoder with inner-query and\ninter-query encodings, our decoder reuses the hidden states of previously\ngenerated responses, instead of reconstructing these by the encoder, to\ngenerate a new response. Our empirical results show that PHAED outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art in both automatic and human evaluations.

While the\nnetwork structure serves as the backbone of the spreading, an accurate\nprediction can hardly be made without the knowledge of the dynamics on the\nnetwork. The temporal information in the spreading sequence captures many\nhidden features, but predictions based on sequence alone have their\nlimitations. Recent efforts start to explore the possibility of combining both\nthe network structure and the temporal feature. Here, we propose a new\nend-to-end prediction method CasSeqGCN in which the structure and temporal\nfeature are simultaneously taken into account. A cascade is divided into\nmultiple snapshots which record the network topology and the state of nodes.\nThe graph convolutional network (GCN) is used to learn the representation of a\nsnapshot. A novel aggregation method based on dynamic routing is proposed to\naggregate node representation and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is\nused to extract temporal information. CasSeqGCN predicts the future cascade\nsize more accurately compared with other state-of-art baseline methods. The\nablation study demonstrates that the improvement mainly comes from the design\nof the input and the GCN layer. We explicitly design an experiment to show the\nquality of the cascade representation learned by our approach is better than\nother methods.

Moreover, stimulus-dependent regulation of active transport is an\nimportant component of long-term synaptic plasticity, whereas the disruption of\nvesicular transport can lead to the onset of various neurodegenerative\ndiseases. In this paper we investigate how the discrete and stochastic nature\nof vesicular transport in axons contributes to fluctuations in the accumulation\nof resources within synaptic targets. We begin by solving the first passage\ntime problem of a single motor-cargo complex (particle) searching for synaptic\ntargets distributed along a one-dimensional axonal cable. We then use queuing\ntheory\n  to analyze the accumulation of synaptic resources under the combined effects\nof multiple search-and-capture events and degradation. In particular, we\ndetermine the steady-state mean and variance of the distribution of synaptic\nresources along the axon in response to the periodic insertion of particles.\nThe mean distribution recovers the spatially decaying distribution of resources\nfamiliar from deterministic population models. However, the discrete nature of\nvesicular transport can lead to Fano factors that are greater than unity\n(non-Poissonian) across the array of synapses, resulting in significant\nfluctuation bursts. We also find that each synaptic Fano factor is independent\nof the rate of particle insertion but increases monotonically with the amount\nof protein cargo in each vesicle. This implies that fluctuations can be reduced\nby increasing the injection rate while decreasing the cargo load of each\nvesicle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

The effort to uncover the origin of the GCE is\nhampered in particular by an incomplete understanding of diffuse emission of\nGalactic origin. This can lead to spurious features that make it difficult to\nrobustly differentiate smooth emission, as expected for a dark matter origin,\nfrom more \"clumpy\" emission expected for a population of relatively bright,\nunresolved point sources.

We also consider\nwhether the standard cosmological paradigm ($\\Lambda$CDM) can explain the\nobservations and review several previously published highly significant\nfalsifications of it. Our overall assessment considers both the extent to which\nthe data agree with each theory and how much flexibility each has when\naccommodating the data, with the gold standard being a clear $a~priori$\nprediction not informed by the data in question. Our conclusion is that MOND is\nfavoured by a wealth of data across a huge range of astrophysical scales,\nranging from the kpc scales of galactic bars to the Gpc scale of the local\nsupervoid and the Hubble tension, which is alleviated in MOND through enhanced\ncosmic variance. We also consider several future tests, mostly on scales much\nsmaller than galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 05:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 15:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 16:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 10:25:19 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 11:36:16 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 16:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 16:21:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

In this paper,\nwe describe its re-implementation in Python and compare the performance of\nthese two implementations. The results demonstrated major improvements in terms\nof efficiency, which allow FlexiTerm to transition from the proof of concept to\nthe production-grade application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:49:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 10:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

We propose to address these limitations by combining\nhaptic augmented reality, untethered haptic interaction, and an\nencountered-type haptic display. We attach a plate with the desired hardness on\nthe kinesthetic device's end-effector, which the user interacts with using an\nuntethered stylus. This method allows us to directly change the hardness of the\nend-effector based on the rendered object. In this paper, we evaluate how\nchanging the hardness of the end-effector can mask the device's stiffness and\naffect the user's perception. The results of our human subject experiment\nindicate that when the end-effector is made of a hard material, it is difficult\nfor users to perceive when the underlying stiffness being rendered by the\ndevice is changed, but this stiffness change is easy to distinguish while the\nend-effector is made of a soft material. These results show promise for our\napproach in avoiding the limitations of haptic devices when rendering hard\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

However, due to the nested structure of bilevel optimization, even\ngradient-based methods require second-order derivative approximations via\nJacobian- or/and Hessian-vector computations, which can be costly and\nunscalable in practice. Recently, Hessian-free bilevel schemes have been\nproposed to resolve this issue, where the general idea is to use zeroth- or\nfirst-order methods to approximate the full hypergradient of the bilevel\nproblem. However, we empirically observe that such approximation can lead to\nlarge variance and unstable training, but estimating only the response Jacobian\nmatrix as a partial component of the hypergradient turns out to be extremely\neffective. To this end, we propose a new Hessian-free method, which adopts the\nzeroth-order-like method to approximate the response Jacobian matrix via taking\ndifference between two optimization paths. Theoretically, we provide the\nconvergence rate analysis for the proposed algorithms, where our key challenge\nis to characterize the approximation and smoothness properties of the\ntrajectory-dependent estimator, which can be of independent interest. This is\nthe first known convergence rate result for this type of Hessian-free bilevel\nalgorithms.

Specialized algorithms to incorporate negatively\nlabeled samples generally focus on learning or readjusting the edge weights to\ndrive walks away from negatively-labeled nodes and toward positively-labeled\nnodes.

The Vlasov equations predict that in a\ncollisionless plasma with closed boundaries, BG entropy is formally conserved,\nalong with an infinite set of Casimir invariants; this provides a seemingly\nstrong constraint that may explain how plasmas maintain low entropy.\nNevertheless, it is commonly believed that entropy production is enabled by\nphase mixing or nonlinear entropy cascades. The question of whether such\nanomalous entropy production occurs, and of how to characterize it\nquantitatively, is a fundamental problem in plasma physics. We construct a new\ntheoretical framework for characterizing entropy production (in a generalized\nsense) based on ideally conserved dimensional quantities derived from the\nCasimir invariants; these are referred to as ``Casimir momenta'' and they\ngeneralize BG entropy. The growth of Casimir momenta relative to the average\nparticle momentum indicates entropy production. We apply this framework to\nquantify entropy production in particle-in-cell simulations of laminar flows\nand turbulent flows driven in relativistic plasma, where efficient nonthermal\nparticle acceleration is enabled. We demonstrate that a large amount of\nanomalous entropy is produced by turbulence despite nonthermal features. These\nresults have implications for reduced modeling of nonthermal particle\nacceleration and for diagnosing irreversible dissipation in collisionless\nplasmas such as the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. Dimensional\nrepresentations of generalized entropy analogous to Casimir momenta may be\nuseful for other problems in statistical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 20:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 20:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Recent works propose to use multivariate\nGaussian distributions as models of posterior distributions at different layers\nof the CNN (i.e., for low- and upper-level features), which leads to the\nconfidence scores based on the Mahalanobis distance. However, this procedure\ninvolves estimating probability density in high dimensional data using the\ninsufficient number of observations (e.g. the dimensionality of features at the\nlast two layers in the ResNet-101 model are 2048 and 1024, with ca. 1000\nobservations per class used to estimate density).

We explore the onset of such a\ntransition for each model in the parameter space of occupied volume fraction\nand P\\'eclet number via a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations\nat both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. We establish that one of the\nmodels, namely the mean-field model which assumes long-range repulsive\ninteractions, cannot explain the emergence of MIPS. In contrast, MIPS is\nobserved for the remaining three models that assume short-range interactions\nthat localize the interaction terms in space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 22:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 14:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 09:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 20:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Thus,\na resource can be matched to many different online vertices over a period of\ntime. While recent work on the problem have resolved the asymptotic case where\nwe have large starting inventory (i.e., many copies) of every resource, we\nconsider the (more general) case of $\\textit{unit inventory}$ and give the\nfirst algorithms that are provably better than the naive greedy approach which\nhas a competitive ratio of (exactly) 0.5.

While reranking\nresources frequently has the same worst case performance as greedy, we show\nthat reranking intermittently on a periodic schedule succeeds in addressing\nreusability of resources and performs significantly better than greedy in the\nworst case.

However, for efficient operation these structures require\nthree-dimensional nanoscale deterministic control of emitter positioning within\nthe device, which is a demanding task, esp. when emitter damage during\nfabrication is a major concern. To overcome this limitation, our deterministic\nroom-temperature in situ optical lithography protocol uses spatially modulated\nlight to position a plasmonic structure non-destructively on any selected\nsingle-emitter with three-dimensional nanoscale control. In this paper we\nanalyze the emission statistics of such plasmonic antennas that embed a\ndeterministically positioned single colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dot that\nhighlight acceleration and brightness of emission. We demonstrate that the\nantenna induces a 1000-fold increase in the emitter absorption cross-section,\nand under high pumping, these antennas show nonlinearly enhanced emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

Re-using the pilots,\nhowever, contaminates the CSI estimate at each base station (BS) by the channel\nof the users sharing the same pilot in other cells. The resulting inter-cell\ninterference does not vanish even when the number of BS antennas $M$ is large,\ni.e., $M\\rightarrow\\infty$, and thus the rates achieved by treating\ninterference as noise (TIN) saturate even if $M\\rightarrow\\infty$. In this\npaper, interference aware decoding schemes based on simultaneous unique\ndecoding (SD) and simultaneous non-unique decoding (SND) of the full\ninterference or a part of the interference (PD) are studied with two different\nlinear precoding techniques: maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero forcing\n(ZF). The resulting rates are shown to grow unbounded as $M\\rightarrow\\infty$.\nIn addition, the rates achievable via SD/SND/PD for finite $M$ are derived\nusing a worst-case uncorrelated noise technique, which are shown to scale as\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log M)$.

In this work, a\nfinite element simulation of the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process is\nused to predict the space- and time-dependent temperature field during the\nmulti-layer build process for Inconel 718 walls. The thermal model is validated\nusing the dynamic infrared (IR) images captured in situ during the DED builds,\nshowing good agreement with experimental measurements.

Recent experiments suggest that the cell\ncytoskeleton and its permeating cytosol, can be described as a poroelastic (PE)\nmaterial. Biot theory is the standard model used to describe PE materials. Yet,\nthis theory does not account for the fluid viscous stress, which can lead to\ninaccurate predictions of the mechanics in the dilute filamentous network of\nthe cytoskeleton. Here, we adopt a two-phase model that extends Biot theory by\nincluding the fluid viscous stresses in the fluid's momentum equation. We use\ngeneralized linear viscoelastic (VE) constitutive equations to describe the\npermeating fluid and the network stresses and assume a constant friction\ncoefficient that couples the fluid and network displacement fields. As the\nfirst step in developing a computational framework for solving the resulting\nequations, we derive closed-form general solutions of the fluid and network\ndisplacement fields in spherical coordinates. To demonstrate the applicability\nof our results, we study the motion of a rigid sphere moving under a constant\nforce inside a PE medium, composed of a linear elastic network and a Newtonian\nfluid. We find that the network compressibility introduces a slow relaxation of\nthe sphere and a non-monotonic network displacements with time along the\ndirection of the applied force. These novel features cannot be predicted if VE\nconstitutive equation is used for the medium. We show that our results can be\napplied to particle-tracking microrheology to differentiate between PE and VE\nmaterials and to independently measure the permeability and VE properties of\nthe fluid and the network phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 02:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

To tackle this problem, we\npropose a Region Semantically Aligned Network (RSAN), which maps local features\nof unseen classes to their semantic attributes. Instead of using global\nfeatures which are obtained by an average pooling layer after an image encoder,\nwe directly utilize the output of the image encoder which maintains local\ninformation of the image. Concretely, we obtain each attribute from a specific\nregion of the output and exploit these attributes for recognition. As a result,\nthe knowledge of seen classes can be successfully transferred to unseen classes\nin a region-bases manner.

It is usual that e-commerce companies face situations\nwhere they want to promote and sell new or discounted items. In these\nsituations, we have to consider a question: who are interested in the items and\nhow to find them? This paper answers this question by addressing a new problem\ncalled reverse maximum inner product search (reverse MIPS). Given a query\nvector and two sets of vectors (user vectors and item vectors), the problem of\nreverse MIPS finds a set of user vectors whose inner product with the query\nvector is the maximum among the query and item vectors. Although the importance\nof this problem is clear, its straightforward implementation incurs a\ncomputationally expensive cost. We therefore propose Simpfer, a simple, fast,\nand exact algorithm for reverse MIPS. In an offline phase, Simpfer builds a\nsimple index that maintains a lower-bound of the maximum inner product. By\nexploiting this index, Simpfer judges whether the query vector can have the\nmaximum inner product or not, for a given user vector, in a constant time.\nBesides, our index enables filtering user vectors, which cannot have the\nmaximum inner product with the query vector, in a batch. We theoretically\ndemonstrate that Simpfer outperforms baselines employing state-of-the-art MIPS\ntechniques. Furthermore, our extensive experiments on real datasets show that\nSimpfer is at least two orders magnitude faster than the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 03:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

SSM requires consistent\nshape representation across samples in shape cohort. Establishing this\nrepresentation entails a processing pipeline that includes anatomy\nsegmentation, re-sampling, registration, and non-linear optimization. These\nshape representations are then used to extract low-dimensional shape\ndescriptors that facilitate subsequent analyses in different applications.\nHowever, the current process of obtaining these shape descriptors from imaging\ndata relies on human and computational resources, requiring domain expertise\nfor segmenting anatomies of interest. Moreover, this same taxing pipeline needs\nto be repeated to infer shape descriptors for new image data using a\npre-trained/existing shape model. Here, we propose DeepSSM, a deep\nlearning-based framework for learning the functional mapping from images to\nlow-dimensional shape descriptors and their associated shape representations,\nthereby inferring statistical representation of anatomy directly from 3D\nimages. Once trained using an existing shape model, DeepSSM circumvents the\nheavy and manual pre-processing and segmentation and significantly improves the\ncomputational time, making it a viable solution for fully end-to-end SSM\napplications. In addition, we introduce a model-based data-augmentation\nstrategy to address data scarcity.

To address these issues, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE)\nNTM model that jointly reconstructs the sentence and document word counts using\ncombinations of bag-of-words (BoW) topical embeddings and pre-trained semantic\nembeddings.

It has disadvantages in that it is\nnonlinear, and its computational complexity and hardware resources are directly\nproportional to its window size. Thus far, several approximation methods and\nhardware implementations have been proposed to solve these problems. However,\nprocessing large-scale and high-resolution images in real time under severe\nhardware resource constraints remains a challenge.\n  This paper proposes a real-time image denoising system that uses an FPGA\nbased on the bilateral grid (BG). In the BG, a 2D image consisting of x- and\ny-axes is projected onto a 3D space called a \"grid,\" which consists of axes\nthat correlate to the x-component, y-component, and intensity value of the\ninput image. This grid is then blurred using the Gaussian filter, and the\noutput image is generated by interpolating the grid. Although it is possible to\nchange the window size in the BF, it is impossible to change it on the input\nimage in the BG. This makes it difficult to associate the BG with the BF and to\nobtain the property of suppressing the increase in hardware resources when the\nwindow radius is enlarged.\n  This study demonstrates that a BG with a variable-sized window can be\nrealized by introducing the window radius parameter wherein the window radius\non the grid is always 1. We then implement this BG on an FPGA in a fully\npipelined manner. Further, we verify that our design suppresses the increase in\nhardware resources even when the window size is enlarged and outperforms the\nexisting designs in terms of computation speed and hardware resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 07:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 05:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 01:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 03:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

The former is typically based on stacked message-passing\nlayers that share neighborhood information to transform node features into\npredictive embeddings. In contrast, the latter involves spreading label\ninformation to unlabeled nodes via a parameter-free diffusion process, but\noperates independently of the node features. Given then that the material\ndifference is merely whether features or labels are smoothed across the graph,\nit is natural to consider combinations of the two for improving performance. In\nthis regard, it has recently been proposed to use a randomly-selected portion\nof the training labels as GNN inputs, concatenated with the original node\nfeatures for making predictions on the remaining labels. This so-called label\ntrick accommodates the parallel use of features and labels, and is foundational\nto many of the top-ranking submissions on the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)\nleaderboard. And yet despite its wide-spread adoption, thus far there has been\nlittle attempt to carefully unpack exactly what statistical properties the\nlabel trick introduces into the training pipeline, intended or otherwise. To\nthis end, we prove that under certain simplifying assumptions, the stochastic\nlabel trick can be reduced to an interpretable, deterministic training\nobjective composed of two factors. The first is a data-fitting term that\nnaturally resolves potential label leakage issues, while the second serves as a\nregularization factor conditioned on graph structure that adapts to graph size\nand connectivity. Later, we leverage this perspective to motivate a broader\nrange of label trick use cases, and provide experiments to verify the efficacy\nof these extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 07:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

These nucleoid proteins act as regulators of gene\nexpression and influence the organization of the nucleoid by bridging, bending,\nor wrapping the DNA. These so-called architectural properties of nucleoid\nproteins are still poorly understood. For example, the reason why certain\nproteins compact the DNA coil in certain environments but make instead the DNA\nmore rigid in other environments is the matter of ongoing debates. Here, we\naddress the question of the impact of the self-association of nucleoid proteins\non their architectural properties and try to determine whether differences in\nself-association are sufficient to induce large changes in the organization of\nthe DNA coil. More specifically, we developed two coarse-grained models of\nproteins, which interact identically with the DNA but self-associate\ndifferently by forming either clusters or filaments in the absence of the DNA.\nWe showed through Brownian dynamics simulations that self-association of the\nproteins increases dramatically their ability to shape the DNA coil. Moreover,\nwe observed that cluster-forming proteins compact significantly the DNA coil\n(similar to the DNA-bridging mode of H-NS proteins), whereas filament-forming\nproteins increase instead significantly the stiffness of the DNA chain (similar\nto the DNA-stiffening mode of H-NS proteins). This work consequently suggests\nthat the knowledge of the DNA-binding properties of the proteins is in itself\nnot sufficient to understand their architectural properties. Rather, their\nself-association properties must also be investigated in detail, because they\nmight actually drive the formation of different DNA/protein complexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 07:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

However, a\nrealistic description of time-varying materials requires considering their\nmaterial dispersion. The combination thereof has barely been considered but is\ncrucial since dispersion accompanies materials suitable for dynamic modulation.\nAs a canonical scattering problem from which many general insights can be\nobtained, we develop and apply a self-consistent analytical theory of light\nscattering by a sphere made from a time-varying material exemplarily assumed to\nhave a Lorentzian dispersion. We discuss the eigensolutions of Maxwell's\nequations in the bulk and present a dedicated Mie theory. The proposed theory\nis verified with full-wave simulations. We disclose effects such as energy\ntransfer from the time-modulation subsystem to the electromagnetic field,\namplifying carefully structured incident fields. Since many phenomena can be\nstudied on analytical grounds with our formalism, it will be indispensable when\nexploring electromagnetic phenomena in time-varying and spatially structured\nfinite objects of other geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 07:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

In this paper, we propose a novel federated\nlearning architecture based on continual learning approaches to overcome the\ndifficulties above.

A particularly significant characteristic of alpine\nenvironments is the high variability in their topography and geomorphology\nwhich drives large lateral thermal and fluid fluxes. Additionally, harsh winds,\nextreme weather conditions, and various degrees of saturation have to be\nconsidered.

The focus lies on matrices with\na constant modulus constraint which typically represent a network of analog\nphase shifters in hybrid precoding/combining architectures. We interpret a\nmatrix with restricted isometry property as a mapping of points from a high- to\na low-dimensional hypersphere. We argue that points on the low-dimensional\nhypersphere, namely, in the range of the matrix, should be uniformly\ndistributed to increase robustness against measurement noise. This notion is\nformalized in an optimization problem which uses one of the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy metrics in the objective function.

Many existing results have focused on the regime of small\nperturbation with a small number of edge rewires. However, the number of edge\nrewires can be large in many applications.

Here we present a\ncomplementary study of a three-dimensional pressure-packed amorphous\nindium-oxide (InOx) powder where granularity controls the HSIT. Above a low\nthreshold pressure of ~0.2 GPa, vestiges of superconductivity are detected,\nalthough neither a true superconducting transition nor insulating behavior are\nobserved. Instead, a saturation at very high resistivity at low pressure is\nfollowed by saturation at very low resistivity at higher pressure. We identify\nboth as different manifestations of anomalous metallic phases dominated by\nsuperconducting fluctuations. By analogy with previous identification of the\nlow resistance saturation as a \"failed superconductor\", our data suggests that\nthe very high resistance saturation is a manifestation of a \"failed insulator\".\nAbove a threshold pressure of ~6 GPa, the sample becomes fully packed, and\nsuperconductivity is robust, with TC tunable with pressure. A quantum critical\npoint at PC~25 GPa marks the complete suppression of superconductivity. For a\nfinite pressure below PC, a magnetic field is shown to induce a HSIT from a\ntrue zero-resistance superconducting state to a weakly insulating behavior.\nDetermining the critical field, HC, we show that similar to the 2D behavior,\nthe insulating-like state maintains a superconducting character, which is\nquenched at higher field, above which the magnetoresistance decreases to its\nfermionic normal state value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 11:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 10:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Such techniques\nintrinsically rely on the uniform asymptotic stability properties of the\ndynamics that evolve in each time scale of the closed-loop system. When such\nproperties are absent, synthesizing multi-time scale Nash equilibrium-seeking\nalgorithms is more challenging and requires additional regularization\nmechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the synthesis and analysis of these\nmechanisms in the context of accelerated pseudogradient flows with time-varying\ndamping in non-cooperative games. Specifically, we introduce a new class of\ndistributed and hybrid Nash set-seeking (NSS) algorithms that synergistically\ncombine dynamic momentum-based flows with coordinated discrete-time resets. The\nreset mechanisms can be seen as restarting techniques that allow individual\nplayers to choose their own momentum restarting policy to achieve better\ntransient performance. The resulting closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid\ndynamic inclusion, which is analyzed using tools from hybrid dynamical system's\ntheory. Our algorithms are developed for potential games, as well as for\nmonotone games for which a potential function does not exist. They can be\nimplemented in games where players have access to gradient Oracles with full or\npartial information, as well as in games where players have access only to\nmeasurements of their costs. In the latter case, we use tools from hybrid\nextremum seeking control to achieve accelerated model-free Nash set seeking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 11:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 17:11:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 17:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

To avoid performance decrease caused by forgetting,\nprior studies exploit episodic memory (EM), which stores a subset of the past\nobserved samples while learning from new non-i.i.d. data. Despite the promising\nresults, since CL is often assumed to execute on mobile or IoT devices, the EM\nsize is bounded by the small hardware memory capacity and makes it infeasible\nto meet the accuracy requirements for real-world applications. Specifically,\nall prior CL methods discard samples overflowed from the EM and can never\nretrieve them back for subsequent training steps, incurring loss of information\nthat would exacerbate catastrophic forgetting. We explore a novel hierarchical\nEM management strategy to address the forgetting issue. In particular, in\nmobile and IoT devices, real-time data can be stored not just in high-speed\nRAMs but in internal storage devices as well, which offer significantly larger\ncapacity than the RAMs. Based on this insight, we propose to exploit the\nabundant storage to preserve past experiences and alleviate the forgetting by\nallowing CL to efficiently migrate samples between memory and storage without\nbeing interfered by the slow access speed of the storage. We call it Carousel\nMemory (CarM). As CarM is complementary to existing CL methods, we conduct\nextensive evaluations of our method with seven popular CL methods and show that\nCarM significantly improves the accuracy of the methods across different\nsettings by large margins in final average accuracy (up to 28.4%) while\nretaining the same training efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 11:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 03:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 07:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

We analyze the escape\ndynamics by means of the average escape time, the probability basins and the\naverage escape time distribution. We obtain that the main characteristics of\nthe scattering are different from the case of noisy open Hamiltonian systems.\nIn particular, the noise-enhanced trapping, which is ubiquitous in Hamiltonian\nsystems, does not play the main role in the escapes.

The topological field effect transition\nbetween the quantum spin Hall phase and the quantum valley Hall phase is\nanalyzed in detail using the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique\nwith the inclusion of momentum and phase relaxation, within the self-consistent\nBorn approximation. Details of the transition with applied electric field are\nelucidated for the ON-OFF characteristics with emphasis on the transport\nproperties along with the tomography of the current carrying edge states. We\nnote that for moderate momentum relaxation, the current carrying quantum spin\nHall edge states are still pristine and show moderate decay with propagation.\nTo facilitate our analysis, we introduce two metrics in our calculations, the\ncoherent transmission and the effective transmission. In elucidating the\nphysics clearly, we show that the effective transmission, which is derived\nrigorously from the quantum mechanical current operator is indeed the right\nquantity to analyze topological stability against dephasing. Exploring further,\nwe show that the insulating quantum valley Hall phase, as a result of dephasing\ncarries band-tails which potentially activates parasitic OFF currents, thereby\ndegrading the ON-OFF ratios. Our analysis sets the stage for realistic modeling\nof topological field effect devices for various applications, with the\ninclusion of scattering effects and analyzing their role in the optimization of\nthe device performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 11:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Different frequency bands in the trajectory spectrums\ncould hierarchically reflect agents' motion preferences at different scales.\nThe low-frequency and high-frequency portions could represent their coarse\nmotion trends and fine motion variations, respectively. Accordingly, we propose\na hierarchical network V$^2$-Net, which contains two sub-networks, to\nhierarchically model and predict agents' trajectories with trajectory\nspectrums. The coarse-level keypoints estimation sub-network first predicts the\n\"minimal\" spectrums of agents' trajectories on several \"key\" frequency\nportions.

However, precise error backpropagation is\ndifficult to justify in biologically realistic networks because it requires\nprecise weighted error backpropagation from layer to layer. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel network that solves this problem by propagating only the sign\nof the plasticity change (i.e., LTP/LTD) throughout the whole network, while\nneuromodulation controls the learning rate. Neuromodulation can be understood\nas a rectified error or relevance signal, while the top-down sign of the error\nsignal determines whether long-term potentiation or long-term depression will\noccur.

In this work, we define\nthis more challenging yet practical problem as Lifelong Few-shot Language\nLearning (LFLL) and propose a unified framework for it based on prompt tuning\nof T5. Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage of PT's strong few-shot\nlearning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as a task solver and a\ndata generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task type, LFPT5\ngenerates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and later\ngets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge as\nit learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to\nachieve label consistency between the previous and the current model. While\nadapting to a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt\nembeddings for the new task.

To this end, we use the FABLE simulations to investigate\nhow the hydrostatic mass bias is affected by mergers, turbulence, and feedback.\nFollowing in detail a single, massive cluster we find the bias varies\nsignificantly over cosmic time, rarely staying at the average value found at a\nparticular epoch. Variations of the bias at a given radius are contemporaneous\nwith periods where outflows dominate the mass flux, either due to mergers or\ninterestingly, at high redshift, AGN feedback.

For this purpose, a\nfrictional-collisional approach, combining a Coulomb model with the kinetic\ntheory of granular gases, is developed. The methodology is based on a\ncomparison with coupled fluid-discrete simulations, that classical kinetic\ntheory model fails to reproduce. In order to improve the continuum model, the\nfluctuating energy balance is computed in the discrete simulations and\nsystematically compared with the kinetic theory closure laws. Inter-particle\nfriction is shown to affect the radial distribution function and to increase\nthe energy dissipation, in agreement with previous observations in the\nliterature.

To this\nend, several techniques are investigated, optimized and systematically\nevaluated, including data augmentation, domain mixing, transfer learning and\ndomain adaptation.

The use of infrared (IR)\nnano-antennas and tip nanoprobes to study strong light-matter coupling of\nmolecular vibrations with the vacuum field can be exploited for IR quantum\ncontrol with nanometer and femtosecond resolution. In order to accelerate the\ndevelopment of molecule-based quantum nano-photonic devices in the mid-IR, we\ndevelop a generally applicable semi-empirical quantum optics approach to\ndescribe light-matter interaction in systems driven by mid-IR femtosecond laser\npulses. The theory is shown to reproduce recent experiments on the acceleration\nof the vibrational relaxation rate in infrared nanostructures, and also provide\nphysical insights for the implementation of coherent phase rotations of the\nnear-field using broadband nanotips. We then apply the quantum framework to\ndevelop general tip-design rules for the experimental manipulation of\nvibrational strong coupling and Fano interference effects in open infrared\nresonators. We finally propose the possibility of transferring the natural\nanharmonicity of molecular vibrational levels to the resonator near-field in\nthe weak coupling regime, to implement intensity-dependent phase shifts of the\ncoupled system response with strong pulses. Our semi-empirical quantum theory\nis equivalent to first-principles techniques based on Maxwell's equations, but\nits lower computational cost suggests its use a rapid design tool for the\ndevelopment of strongly-coupled infrared nanophotonic hardware for applications\nranging from quantum control of materials to quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The MTAs principle is the following: samples are diluted inside a\nfluid going through a microfluidic chamber composed of an array of a large\nnumber of traps. While following the fluid flow, samples can encounter traps\nthat isolate them or very small group of them from the others. However, it\noften appears that many traps stay empty, even after a long time which can\ndrastically reduce the number of exploitable samples. In this paper we built a\nComputational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Finite Element Model with a specific\nstreamlines analysis to investigate how the MTA geometry affects its trapping\nefficiency and how it is possible to optimize the MTA geometry in order to\nmaximize the trapping efficiency. Our results shows that optimization of MTA\ntrapping efficiency is a complex and non-intuitive process and is about finding\na compromise between combinations of geometric parameters values that can not\nbe achieved with a purely experimental approach. Streamlines analysis suggests\nthat the important feature is to deviate the particle trajectories that can be\ndone with: a diagonal pressure gradient, the use of low hydrodynamic resistance\nin strategic zones and with the proximity and size of inlet and outlet\nchannels. We showed that a MTA's trapping efficiency can be easily increased of\nmore than 20% with a single parametric approach and more than 30% with a\nmulti-parametric approach.

However, there is a vast amount of applications where the information\nflow is asymmetric, leading to directed graphs where information can only be\npassed in one direction. For example, a directed edge indicates that the\ninformation can only be conveyed forwardly from the start node to the end node,\nbut not backwardly. To accommodate such an asymmetric structure of directed\ngraphs within the framework of GNNs, we propose a simple yet remarkably\neffective framework for directed graph analysis to incorporate such one-way\ninformation passing. We define an incoming embedding and an outgoing embedding\nfor each node to model its sending and receiving features respectively. We\nfurther develop two steps in our directed GNN model with the first one to\naggregate/update the incoming features of nodes and the second one to\naggregate/update the outgoing features.

The\nlog-likelihood of all edges plays a natural role of regularization for the\nproposed model, which can alleviate the over-smoothing problem of the deep\nGNNs.

Despite its evident advantages,\nlaw enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of\ncryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry\nand government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data:\nclient-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law\nenforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable\non-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected,\nits existence and, potentially, its source, would be revealed to the agencies;\notherwise, little or no information would leave the client device.

We perform pulling experiments on DNA\nhairpins with optical tweezers, with a general feedback protocol based on\nmultiple measurements that includes either discrete-time or continuous-time\nfeedback. While feedback can reduce dissipation, it remains unanswered whether\nit also improves free energy determination (information-to-measurement\nconversion). We define thermodynamic information {\\Upsilon} as the natural\nlogarithm of the feedback efficacy, a quantitative measure of the efficiency of\ninformation-to-energy and information-to-measurement conversion in feedback\nprotocols. We find that discrete and continuous-time feedback reduces\ndissipation by roughly kBT{\\Upsilon} without improvement in free energy\ndetermination.

We first\nanalyze the convergence of the algorithm in the different parameter regions of\nthe AIM. As no additional approximation is made, the multiloop series for the\nlocal self-energy and response functions converge perfectly to the\ncorresponding results of the parquet approximation (PA) in the weak- to\nintermediate-coupling regime. Small oscillations of the mfRG solution as a\nfunction of the loop order gradually increase with the interaction, hindering a\nfull convergence to the PA in the strong-coupling regime, where perturbative\nresummation schemes are no longer reliable. By exploiting the converged\nresults, we inspect the fulfillment of (i) sum rules associated to the Pauli\nprinciple and (ii) Ward identities related to conservation laws. For the Pauli\nprinciple, we observe a systematic improvement by increasing the loop order and\nincluding the multiloop corrections to the self-energy. This is consistent with\nthe preservation of crossing symmetries and two-particle self-consistency in\nthe PA. For the Ward identities, we numerically confirm a visible improvement\nby means of the Katanin substitution. At weak coupling, violations of the Ward\nidentity are further reduced by increasing the loop order in mfRG. In this\nregime, we also determine the precise scaling of the deviations of the Ward\nidentity as a function of the electronic interaction. For larger interaction\nvalues, the overall behavior becomes more complex, and the benefits of the\nhigher-loop terms are mostly present in the contributions at large frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

To learn better span representation and increase classification\nperformance, it is crucial to effectively integrate heterogeneous factors\nincluding inside tokens, boundaries, labels, and related spans which could be\ncontributing to nested entities recognition. To fuse these heterogeneous\nfactors, we propose a novel triaffine mechanism including triaffine attention\nand scoring. Triaffine attention uses boundaries and labels as queries and uses\ninside tokens and related spans as keys and values for span representations.\nTriaffine scoring interacts with boundaries and span representations for\nclassification.

Back to Shannon's information theory, the goal of communication\nhas long been to guarantee the correct reception of transmitted messages\nirrespective of their meaning. However, in general, whenever communication\noccurs to convey a meaning, what matters is the receiver's understanding of the\ntransmitted message and not necessarily its correct reconstruction. Hence,\nsemantic communications introduce a new paradigm: transmitting only relevant\ninformation sufficient for the receiver to capture the meaning intended can\nsave significant communication bandwidth. Thus, this work explores the\nopportunity offered by semantic communications for beyond 5G networks. In\nparticular, we focus on the benefit of semantic compression. We refer to\nsemantic message as a sequence of well-formed symbols learned from the\n\"meaning\" underlying data, which have to be interpreted at the receiver.

In this paper, we consider the problem of taking a neural\nnetwork whose neurons are partitioned into clusters, and quantifying how\nfunctionally specialized the clusters are. We propose two proxies for this:\nimportance, which reflects how crucial sets of neurons are to network\nperformance; and coherence, which reflects how consistently their neurons\nassociate with features of the inputs. To measure these proxies, we develop a\nset of statistical methods based on techniques conventionally used to interpret\nindividual neurons. We apply the proxies to partitionings generated by\nspectrally clustering a graph representation of the network's neurons with\nedges determined either by network weights or correlations of activations. We\nshow that these partitionings, even ones based only on weights (i.e. strictly\nfrom non-runtime analysis), reveal groups of neurons that are important and\ncoherent.

The starting point is a\ntheoretical method based on linear elastic fracture mechanics merged with\napproaches from stochastic geometry to predict the 2D-macro-scale fragmentation\nof glass. The approach is based on two influencing parameters of glass: (i)\nfragment particle size and (ii) fracture particle intensity, which are related\nto the pre-stress induced strain energy density before fracture. Further Finite\nElement (FE) analysis of single cylindrical glass particles allow for\nestablishing functional relations of the glass fragment particle dimensions,\nthe pre-stress level and the resulting maximum in-plane deformation.

A\nmathematical description of sports riots is therefore sought to better\nunderstand their propagation and limit these physical and financial damages. In\nthis work, we present an agent-based modelling framework that describes the\nqualitative features of populations engaging in riotous behaviour. Agents,\npertaining to either a 'rioter' or a 'bystander' sub-population, move on an\nunderlying lattice and can either be recruited or defect from their respective\nsubpopulation. In particular, we allow these individual-level recruitment and\ndefection processes to vary with local population density. This agent-based\nmodelling framework provides the unifying link between multi-population\nstochastic models and density-dependent reaction processes. Furthermore, the\ncontinuum description of this ABM framework is shown to be a system of\nnonlinear reaction-diffusion equations and faithfully agrees with the average\nABM behaviour from individual simulations. Finally, we determine the unique\ncorrespondence between the underlying individual-level recruitment and\ndefection mechanisms with their population-level counterparts, providing a link\nbetween local-scale effects and macroscale rioting phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

To address this, we explore the gene interaction\nnetworks of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae beyond pairwise interaction\nusing the structural balance theory (SBT). Specifically, we ask whether\nessential and nonessential gene interaction networks are structurally balanced.\nWe study triadic interactions in the weighted signed undirected gene networks\nand observe that balanced and unbalanced triads are over and underrepresented\nin both networks, thus beautifully in line with the strong notion of balance.\nMoreover, we note that the energy distribution of triads is significantly\ndifferent in both essential and nonessential networks compared with the\nshuffled networks. Yet, this difference is greater in the essential network\nregarding the frequency as well as the energy of triads. Additionally, results\ndemonstrate that triads in the essential gene network are more interconnected\nthrough sharing common links, while in the nonessential network they tend to be\nisolated. Last but not least, we investigate the contribution of all-length\nsigned walks and its impact on the degree of balance. Our findings reveal that\ninterestingly when considering longer cycles the nonessential gene network is\nmore balanced compared to the essential network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks can\ndemocratize AI and make it accessible in a cost-effective manner. However, the\nnoisy bandwidth-limited multi-hop wireless connections can lead to delayed and\nnomadic model updates, which significantly slows down the FL convergence speed.\nTo address such challenges, this paper aims to accelerate FL convergence over\nwireless edge by optimizing the multi-hop federated networking performance. In\nparticular, the FL convergence optimization problem is formulated as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP). To solve such MDP, multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MA-RL) algorithms along with domain-specific action space refining schemes are\ndeveloped, which online learn the delay-minimum forwarding paths to minimize\nthe model exchange latency between the edge devices (i.e., workers) and the\nremote server. To validate the proposed solutions, FedEdge is developed and\nimplemented, which is the first experimental framework in the literature for FL\nover multi-hop wireless edge computing networks. FedEdge allows us to fast\nprototype, deploy, and evaluate novel FL algorithms along with RL-based system\noptimization methods in real wireless devices. Moreover, a physical\nexperimental testbed is implemented by customizing the widely adopted Linux\nwireless routers and ML computing nodes.Finally, our experimentation results on\nthe testbed show that the proposed network-accelerated FL system can\npractically and significantly improve FL convergence speed, compared to the FL\nsystem empowered by the production-grade commercially available wireless\nnetworking protocol, BATMAN-Adv.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 02:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 00:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 13:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In\ncontrast, in this paper, focusing on downlink transmissions from a Base Station\n(BS) to a Mobile User (MU) that is located in a blockage region, we propose to\noptimize the IRS for illumination of the area centered around the MU. Hence,\nthe proposed design requires the estimation of the MU's position and not the\nfull CSI. For a given IRS phase-shift configuration, the end-to-end BS-IRS-MU\nchannel can then be estimated using conventional channel estimation techniques.\nThe IRS reconfiguration overhead for the proposed scheme depends on the MU\nmobility as well as how wide the coverage of the IRS illumination is.\nTherefore, we develop a general IRS phase-shift design, which is valid for both\nthe near- and far-field regimes and features a parameter for tuning the size of\nthe illumination area. Moreover, we study a special case where the IRS\nilluminates the entire blockage area, which implies that the IRS phase shifts\ndo not change over time leading to zero overhead for IRS reconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 10:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 15:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

Stability can be affected mostly by increase in the load\ndemand. Power grids are overloaded in peak hours so more power generation units\nare required to cope the demand. Increase in power generation is not an optimal\nsolution. With the enlargement in Smart grid (SG), it becomes easier to\ncorrelate the consumer demand and available power. The most significant\nfeatutre of smart grid is demand response (DR) which is used to match the\ndemand of available electrical energy and shift the peak load into off peak\nhours to improve the economics of energy and stability of grid stations.\nPresently we used Genetic algorithm (GA) to schedule the load via real time\npricing signal (RTP).
