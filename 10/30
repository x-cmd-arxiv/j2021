Previous work is\nmostly concerned with reducing the number of model parameters which is only\nbeneficial for inference. However, memory footprint from activations is the\nmain bottleneck for training on the edge. Existing incremental training methods\nfine-tune the last few layers sacrificing accuracy gains from re-training the\nwhole model. In this work, we investigate the memory footprint of training deep\nlearning models, and use our observations to propose BitTrain. In BitTrain, we\nexploit activation sparsity and propose a novel bitmap compression technique\nthat reduces the memory footprint during training. We save the activations in\nour proposed bitmap compression format during the forward pass of the training,\nand restore them during the backward pass for the optimizer computations. The\nproposed method can be integrated seamlessly in the computation graph of modern\ndeep learning frameworks. Our implementation is safe by construction, and has\nno negative impact on the accuracy of model training. Experimental results show\nup to 34% reduction in the memory footprint at a sparsity level of 50%. Further\npruning during training results in more than 70% sparsity, which can lead to up\nto 56% reduction in memory footprint. BitTrain advances the efforts towards\nbringing more machine learning capabilities to edge devices.

We prove that when the algorithm starts from an\ninitial guess that satisfies the invariance equation very approximately\n(depending on some condition numbers, evaluated on the approximate solution),\nthen the algorithm converges to a true solution which is close to the initial\nguess. The convergence is faster than exponential in smooth norms. The distance\nfrom the exact solution and the approximation is bounded by the initial error.\nThis allows validating the numerical approximations (a-posteriori results). It\nalso implies the usual persistence formulations since the exact solutions of\nthe invariance equation for a model are approximate solutions for a similar\nmodel. The algorithm we present works irrespective of whether the dynamics on\nthe invariant circle is a rotation or it is phase-locked. The condition numbers\nrequired do not involve any global qualitative properties of the map.

Conventional distribution\nof neural networks consist in data parallelism, where data is scattered over\nresources (e.g., GPUs) to parallelize the training of the model.

The composition of wind-driving grains is affected by a feedback\nbetween their optical properties and the resulting heating due to stellar\nradiation. We explore the gradual Fe enrichment of wind-driving silicate grains\nin M-type AGB stars to derive typical values for Fe/Mg and test the effects on\nwind properties and synthetic spectra. We present new DARWIN models that allow\nfor the growth of silicate grains with a variable Fe/Mg ratio and predict\nmass-loss rates, wind velocities, and grain properties. Synthetic spectra and\nother observables are computed with the COMA code. The self-regulating feedback\nbetween grain composition and radiative heating, in combination with quickly\nfalling densities in the stellar wind, leads to low values of Fe/Mg, typically\na few percent. Nevertheless, the models show distinct silicate features around\n10 and 18 microns. Fe enrichment affects visual and near-IR photometry\nmoderately, and the new DARWIN models agree well with observations in (J-K) vs.\n(V-K) and Spitzer color-color diagrams. The enrichment of the silicate dust\nwith Fe is a secondary process, taking place in the stellar wind on the surface\nof large Fe-free grains that have initiated the outflow. Therefore, the\nmass-loss rates are basically unaffected, while the wind velocities tend to be\nslightly higher than in corresponding models with Fe-free silicate dust. The\ngradual Fe enrichment of silicate grains in the inner wind region should\nproduce signatures observable in mid-IR spectro-interferometrical measurements.\nMass-loss rates derived from existing DARWIN models, based on Fe-free\nsilicates, can be applied to stellar evolution models since the mass-loss rates\nare not significantly affected by the inclusion of Fe in the silicate grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 16:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Only recently\nhave QNM studies begun to focus on multimode fitting to numerical relativity\n(NR) strain waveforms. As GW observatories become even more sensitive they will\nbe able to resolve higher-order modes. Consequently, multimode QNM fits will be\ncritically important, and in turn require a more thorough treatment of the\nasymptotic frame at $\\mathscr{I}^+$. The first main result of this work is a\nmethod for systematically fitting a QNM model containing many modes to a\nnumerical waveform produced using Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE), an\nextraction technique which is known to resolve memory effects. We choose the\nmodes to model based on their power contribution to the residual between\nnumerical and model waveforms. We show that the all-mode strain mismatch\nimproves by a factor of $\\sim10^5$ when using multimode fitting as opposed to\nonly fitting the $(2,\\pm2,n)$ modes. Our most significant result addresses a\ncritical point that has been overlooked in the QNM literature: the importance\nof matching the Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the numerical\nwaveform to that of the QNM model. We show that by mapping the numerical\nwaveforms$-$which exhibit the memory effect$-$to a BMS frame known as the super\nrest frame, there is an improvement of $\\sim10^5$ in the all-mode strain\nmismatch compared to using a strain waveform whose BMS frame is not fixed.\nFurthermore, we find that by mapping CCE waveforms to the super rest frame, we\ncan obtain all-mode mismatches that are, on average, a factor of $\\sim4$ better\nthan using the publicly-available extrapolated waveforms. We illustrate the\neffectiveness of these modeling enhancements by applying them to families of\nwaveforms produced by NR and comparing our results to previous QNM studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 17:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 17:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The linear equations are solved in the\nFourier space to decrease computational time. For validation purposes, we first\nuse the proposed model to compute the response of a single cylinder in axial\nflow. We then implement a multiple cylinder geometry made of 4 fuel assemblies,\neach made of 8x8 cylinders, corresponding to an experimental facility available\nat CEA. The comparison between numerical results and experiments show good\nagreement. The model can correctly predict the added mass. It can also\nqualitatively capture the coupling between assemblies and the effect of\nconfinement. This shows that a potential flow approach can give insight into\nthe complex fluid-structure interactions within a nuclear reactor and, in\nparticular, be used to predict the response to seismic forcing at low\ncomputational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 17:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Using these results we delineate the relative importance of\nthermal and non-thermal electrons for sub-relativistic shock-powered\nsynchrotron transients. We find that thermal electrons are naturally expected\nto contribute significantly to the peak emission if the shock velocity is\n$\\gtrsim 0.2c$, but would be mostly undetectable in non-relativistic shocks.\nThis helps explain the dichotomy between typical radio supernovae and the\nemerging class of `AT2018cow-like' events. The signpost of thermal electron\nsynchrotron emission is a steep optically-thin spectral index and a $\\nu^2$\noptically-thick spectrum. These spectral features are also predicted to\ncorrelate with a steep post-peak light-curve decline rate, broadly consistent\nwith observed AT2018cow-like events.

One such tension is\nthe difference between the locally measured Hubble constant $H_0$ and the value\ninferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Interacting radiation has\nbeen suggested as a solution, but studies show that conventional models are\nprecluded by high-$\\ell$ CMB polarization data. It seems at least plausible\nthat a solution may be provided by related models that distinguish between\nhigh- and low-$\\ell$ multipoles. When interactions of strongly-coupled\nradiation are mediated by a force-carrier that becomes non-relativistic, the\ndark radiation undergoes a \"step\" in which its relative energy density\nincreases as the mediator deposits its entropy into the lighter species. If\nthis transition occurs while CMB-observable modes are inside the horizon, high-\nand low-$\\ell$ peaks are impacted differently, corresponding to modes that\nenter the horizon before or after the step. These dynamics are naturally\npackaged into the simplest supersymmetric theory, the Wess-Zumino model, with\nthe mass of the scalar mediator near the eV-scale. We investigate the\ncosmological signatures of such \"Wess-Zumino Dark Radiation\" (WZDR) and find\nthat it provides an improved fit to the CMB alone, favoring larger values of\n$H_0$. If supernovae measurements from the SH0ES collaboration are also\nincluded in the analysis, the inferred value of $H_0$ is yet larger, but the\npreference for dark radiation and the location of the transition is left nearly\nunchanged.

General circulation model\nsimulations permit a habitable climate as late as ~0.7 Ga, and there is\nsuggestive-albeit inconclusive-evidence for previous liquid water from surface\ngeomorphology and mineralogy. However, it is unclear whether a habitable past\ncan be reconciled with Venus's inferred atmospheric evolution. In particular,\nthe lack of leftover atmospheric oxygen argues against recent water loss. Here,\nwe apply a fully coupled model of Venus's atmospheric-interior-climate\nevolution from post-accretion magma ocean to present. The model\nself-consistently tracks C-, H-, and O-bearing volatiles and surface climate\nthrough the entirety of Venus's history. Atmospheric escape, mantle convection,\nmelt production, outgassing, deep water cycling, and carbon cycling are\nexplicitly coupled to climate and redox evolution. Plate tectonic and stagnant\nlid histories are considered. Using this coupled model, we conclude that both a\nhabitable Venusian past and one where Venus never possessed liquid surface\nwater can be reconciled with known constraints. Specifically, either scenario\ncan reproduce bulk atmospheric composition, inferred surface heat flow, and\nobserved $^{40}$Ar and $^{4}$He. Moreover, the model suggests that Venus could\nhave been habitable with a ~100 m global ocean as late as 1 Ga, without\nviolating any known constraints. In fact, if diffusion-limited water loss is\nthrottled by a cool, CO$_2$-dominated upper atmosphere, then a habitable past\nis tentatively favored by our model. This escape throttling makes it difficult\nto simultaneously recover negligible water vapor and ~90 bar CO$_2$ in the\nmodern atmosphere without temporarily sequestering carbon in the interior via\nsilicate weathering to enhance H escape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 18:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

In this\npaper, we point to and alleviate some of the practical shortcomings of these\nproposed GoF statistics, namely their high computational cost, high statistical\nsample complexity, and lack of differentiability with respect to the data. We\nshow that all these practically important issues are addressed by considering\nentropy-regularized optimal transport maps in place of the rank map, which we\nrefer to as the soft rank. We consequently propose two new statistics, the soft\nrank energy (sRE) and soft rank maximum mean discrepancy (sRMMD), which exhibit\nseveral desirable properties.

Compared to MDFs for select cosmological\nsimulations of similar mass galaxies, we find that Eri II has a lower fraction\nof stars with [Fe/H] $< -3$, though such comparisons should currently be\ntreated with caution due to a paucity of simulations, selection effects, and\nknown limitations of Ca H&K for EMPs. This study demonstrates the power of deep\nHST CaHK imaging for measuring the MDFs of UFDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 18:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

In addition, we show that integrating the proposed navigable\nspace segmentation model with a visual planner can achieve efficient mapless\nnavigation in real environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 18:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In particular, graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs), which take numerical node features and graph structure as\ninputs, have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various\ngraph-related learning tasks. Recent works exploring the correlation between\nnumerical node features and graph structure via self-supervised learning have\npaved the way for further performance improvements of GNNs. However, methods\nused for extracting numerical node features from raw data are still\ngraph-agnostic within standard GNN pipelines. This practice is sub-optimal as\nit prevents one from fully utilizing potential correlations between graph\ntopology and node attributes. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new\nself-supervised learning framework, Graph Information Aided Node feature\nexTraction (GIANT). GIANT makes use of the eXtreme Multi-label Classification\n(XMC) formalism, which is crucial for fine-tuning the language model based on\ngraph information, and scales to large datasets. We also provide a theoretical\nanalysis that justifies the use of XMC over link prediction and motivates\nintegrating XR-Transformers, a powerful method for solving XMC problems, into\nthe GIANT framework. We demonstrate the superior performance of GIANT over the\nstandard GNN pipeline on Open Graph Benchmark datasets: For example, we improve\nthe accuracy of the top-ranked method GAMLP from $68.25\\%$ to $69.67\\%$, SGC\nfrom $63.29\\%$ to $66.10\\%$ and MLP from $47.24\\%$ to $61.10\\%$ on the\nogbn-papers100M dataset by leveraging GIANT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 15:41:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The statistical inference of the\npropagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems\nhas been studied in previous work. The models used are mostly compartmental\nmodels representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential\nequations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections\nfrom data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest.\nHowever, there are many important features which are based on the individual\ninteractions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as\nsocial network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and\nsocial network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe\ncontact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such\nas age, neighbourhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places,\namong others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which\nare thus difficult to estimate.

Several recent works have demonstrated PuM\ntechniques in off-the-shelf DRAM devices. Since DRAM is the dominant memory\ntechnology as main memory in current computing systems, these PuM techniques\nrepresent an opportunity for alleviating the data movement bottleneck at very\nlow cost. However, system integration of PuM techniques imposes non-trivial\nchallenges that are yet to be solved. Design space exploration of potential\nsolutions to the PuM integration challenges requires appropriate tools to\ndevelop necessary hardware and software components. Unfortunately, current\nspecialized DRAM-testing platforms, or system simulators do not provide the\nflexibility and/or the holistic system view that is necessary to deal with PuM\nintegration challenges.\n  We design and develop PiDRAM, the first flexible end-to-end framework that\nenables system integration studies and evaluation of real PuM techniques.\nPiDRAM provides software and hardware components to rapidly integrate PuM\ntechniques across the whole system software and hardware stack (e.g., necessary\nmodifications in the operating system, memory controller).

In this paper, we analyze\nReddit's previous administrative interventions to understand one aspect of this\ndilemma: the relationship between the media and administrative interventions.\nMore specifically, we make two primary contributions.

Second,\nusing interrupted time series analysis, we show that media attention on\ncommunities with toxic content only increases the problematic behavior\nassociated with that community (both within the community itself and across the\nplatform). However, we find no significant difference in the impact of\nadministrative interventions on subreddits with and without media pressure.\nTaken all together, this study provides evidence of a media-driven moderation\nstrategy at Reddit and also suggests that such a strategy may not have a\nsignificantly different impact than a more proactive strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

To the sensors in the system, an attack may\nappear as anomalous behaviour. In this context, there are possibilities of\nanomalies generated due to faulty hardware, issues in network connectivity (if\npresent), or simply abrupt changes to the environment due to weather, human\naccident, or other unforeseen circumstances. To make such systems more secure,\nit is imperative to detect such data discrepancies, and trigger appropriate\nmitigation mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection model for\nSmart Farming using an unsupervised Autoencoder machine learning model. We\nchose to use an Autoencoder because it encodes and decodes data and attempts to\nignore outliers. When it encounters anomalous data the result will be a high\nreconstruction loss value, signaling that this data was not like the rest. Our\nmodel was trained and tested on data collected from our designed greenhouse\ntest-bed. Proposed Autoencoder model based anomaly detection achieved 98.98%\nand took 262 seconds to train and has a detection time of .0585 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 22:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Specifically, we\nintroduce the Fast Continuous Convolutional Taylor Transform (FC2T2), a variant\nof the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), that allows for the efficient approximation\nof low dimensional convolutional operators in continuous space. We build upon\nthe FMM which is an approximate algorithm that reduces the computational\ncomplexity of N-body problems from O(NM) to O(N+M) and finds application in\ne.g. particle simulations. As an intermediary step, the FMM produces a series\nexpansion for every cell on a grid and we introduce algorithms that act\ndirectly upon this representation. These algorithms analytically but\napproximately compute the quantities required for the forward and backward pass\nof the backpropagation algorithm and can therefore be employed as (implicit)\nlayers in Neural Networks. Specifically, we introduce a root-implicit layer\nthat outputs surface normals and object distances as well as an\nintegral-implicit layer that outputs a rendering of a radiance field given a 3D\npose.

We argue that this holomorphic representation is a natural\none which not only gives a canonical description of bosonic quantum computing\nusing basic elements of complex analysis but also provides a unifying picture\nwhich delineates the boundary between discrete- and continuous-variable quantum\ninformation theory. Using this representation, we show that the evolution of a\nsingle bosonic mode under a Gaussian Hamiltonian can be described as an\nintegrable dynamical system of classical Calogero-Moser particles corresponding\nto the zeros of the holomorphic function, together with a conformal evolution\nof Gaussian parameters. We explain that the Calogero-Moser dynamics is due to\nunique features of bosonic Hilbert spaces such as squeezing. We then generalize\nthe properties of this holomorphic representation to the multimode case,\nderiving a non-Gaussian hierarchy of quantum states and relating entanglement\nto factorization properties of holomorphic functions. Finally, we apply this\nformalism to discrete- and continuous- variable quantum measurements and obtain\na classification of subuniversal models that are generalizations of Boson\nSampling and Gaussian quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 23:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 02:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 12:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

More specifically, he constructed the so-called normalized\nwaves, by minimizing the Hamiltonian functional, for fixed power $P$ (i.e.\n$l^2$ mass). This type of variational method allows one to claim, in a\nstraightforward manner, set stability for such waves.\n  In this work, we revisit and build upon Weinstein's work in several\ndirections. First, for the normalized waves, we show that they are in fact\nspectrally stable as solutions of the corresponding discrete NLS evolution\nequation. Next, we construct the so-called homogeneous waves, by using a\ndifferent constrained optimization problem. Importantly, this construction\nworks for all values of the parameters, e.g. $l^2$ supercritical problems. We\nestablish a rigorous criterion for stability, which decides the stability on\nthe homogeneous waves, based on the classical\nGrillakis-Shatah-Strauss/Vakhitov-Kolokolov quantity $\\partial_\\omega\n\\|\\varphi_\\omega\\|_{l^2}^2$. In addition, we provide some symmetry results for\nthe solitons. Finally, we complement our results with numerical computations,\nwhich showcase the full agreement between the conclusion from the GSS/VK\ncriterion vis-\\'a-vis with the linearized problem. In particular, one observes\nthat it is possible for the stability of the wave to change as the spectral\nparameter $\\omega$ varies, in contrast with the corresponding continuous NLS\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 23:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

The model is discretized in space using the\nfinite-element method. Although the individual equations are decoupled by a\nsemi-implicit time discretization, the discrete model is still computationally\ndemanding. In addition, the parameters needed for the effective model equations\nare not easily available and have to be estimated or determined by repeatedly\nsolving the model and fitting the results to measurements.

Kusnetz proposed a quick method for radon progeny concentration\nmeasurement in mine atmosphere using a single gross-alpha count of a\nmembrane-filtered air. The method is still widely used today and is based on a\nnumber of impractical assumptions. An instantaneous sampling time (less than\nten seconds), is one of these assumptions that ignores the build-up and decay\nof the progeny on the filter paper during the sampling period. Of special\nconcern is the 214Bi decay during the sampling period, since 214Po alphas are\nlost during the sampling time and cannot be accounted for during the counting\ntime. In addition, the method assumes that 214Bi activity during the counting\nperiod is constant. This inaccurate assumption can result in a smaller count\nrate, especially when counting times are long. Hence underestimated working\nlevels are expected when using Kusnetz factors without correcting for the\nsampling and counting times. In this technical report, exact sampling and\ncounting time corrections to the method are provided along with the updated\nKusnetz factors that correspond to common equilibrium conditions to correctly\nestimate the Working Level in air.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate three different approaches to improve DNNs in recognizing objects\nin OoD orientations and illuminations. Namely, these are (i) training much\nlonger after convergence of the in-distribution (InD) validation accuracy,\ni.e., late-stopping, (ii) tuning the momentum parameter of the batch\nnormalization layers, and (iii) enforcing invariance of the neural activity in\nan intermediate layer to orientation and illumination conditions.

These datasets allow to study the effects of\ndifferent amounts of bias and are challenging as DNNs perform poorly in OoD\nconditions. Finally, we demonstrate that even though the three approaches focus\non different aspects of DNNs, they all tend to lead to the same underlying\nneural mechanism to enable OoD accuracy gains --individual neurons in the\nintermediate layers become more selective to a category and also invariant to\nOoD orientations and illuminations.

Recent attempts to\naddress these challenges typically impose restrictions on the exploitative\nnature of the bandit algorithm$-$trading off regret$-$and require large sample\nsizes to ensure asymptotic guarantees. However, large experiments generally\nfollow a successful pilot study, which is tightly constrained in its size or\nduration. Increasing power in such small pilot experiments, without limiting\nthe adaptive nature of the algorithm, can allow promising interventions to\nreach a larger experimental phase. In this work we introduce a novel hypothesis\ntest, uniquely based on the allocation probabilities of the bandit algorithm,\nand without constraining its exploitative nature or requiring a minimum\nexperimental size.

At large phase angles ($ \\alpha \\gtrsim\n80^\\circ$), the polarization phase curve are likely explained by the dominance\nof large grains and the paucity of small micron-sized grains. We conclude that\nthe polarimetric similarity of these near-Sun asteroids can be attributed to\nthe intense solar heating of carbonaceous materials around their perihelia,\nwhere large anhydrous particles with small porosity could be produced by\nsintering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 02:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The first\npart of this report deals with single-UAV systems. The complex problem of\nthree-dimensional (3D) collision-free navigation in unknown/dynamic\nenvironments is addressed. To that end, advanced 3D reactive control strategies\nare developed adopting the sense-and-avoid paradigm to produce quick reactions\naround obstacles. A special case of navigation in 3D unknown confined\nenvironments (i.e. tunnel-like) is also addressed. General 3D kinematic models\nare considered in the design which makes these methods applicable to different\nUAV types in addition to underwater vehicles. Moreover, different\nimplementation methods for these strategies with quadrotor-type UAVs are also\ninvestigated considering UAV dynamics in the control design. Practical\nexperiments and simulations were carried out to analyze the performance of the\ndeveloped methods. The second part of this report addresses safe navigation for\nmulti-UAV systems.

Furthermore, the introduction of these scattering centers may\nlead to the formation of a defect mid-gap state in the electronic band\nstructure (detrimental for electronic transport) or lead to light doping of the\nhost compound. The latter is found to be particularly conducive for attaining\nsynergy in both thermal as well as electronic transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 06:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

We perform 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations to investigate the\nevolution of leptonic galaxy bubbles driven by a 0.3 Myr intense explosive\noutburst from the nucleus of Milky Way-like galaxies. Adopting an ageing model\nfor their leptonic cosmic rays, we post-process our simulations to compute the\nmulti-wavelength emission properties of these bubbles. We calculate the\nresulting spectra emitted from the bubbles from radio frequencies to\n$\\gamma$-rays, and construct emission maps in four energy bands to show the\ndevelopment of the spatial emission structure of the bubbles. The simulated\nbubbles show a progression in their spectral properties as they age. In\nparticular, the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission is initially strong and dominated by\ninverse Compton scattering, but falls rapidly after $\\sim$ 1 Myr. By contrast,\nthe radio synchrotron emission remains relatively stable and fades slowly over\nthe lifetime of the bubble. Based on the emission properties of our\npost-processed simulations, we demonstrate that $\\gamma$-ray observations will\nbe limited in their ability to detect galaxy bubbles, with only young bubbles\naround nearby galaxies being within reach. However, radio observations with\ne.g. the up-coming Square Kilometer Array, would be able to detect\nsubstantially older bubbles at much greater distances, and would be better\nplaced to capture the evolutionary progression and diversity of galaxy bubble\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 08:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 09:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Both extraterrestrial and\natmospheric neutrinos are detected through the Cherenkov light induced in\nseawater by charged particles produced in neutrino interactions in the\nsurrounding medium.

In this work, we focus on accelerating the inference via\nconditional computations. To achieve this, we propose a novel idea, Magic\nPyramid (MP), to reduce both width-wise and depth-wise computation via token\npruning and early exiting for Transformer-based models, particularly BERT. The\nformer manages to save the computation via removing non-salient tokens, while\nthe latter can fulfill the computation reduction by terminating the inference\nearly before reaching the final layer, if the exiting condition is met. Our\nempirical studies demonstrate that compared to previous state of arts, MP is\nnot only able to achieve a speed-adjustable inference but also to surpass token\npruning and early exiting by reducing up to 70% giga floating point operations\n(GFLOPs) with less than 0.5% accuracy drop.

The required number of observations for\nexact completion is directly proportional to rank and the coherency parameter\nof the matrix. In many applications, there might exist additional information\nabout the low-rank matrix of interest. For example, in collaborative filtering,\nNetflix and dynamic channel estimation in communications, extra subspace\ninformation is available. More precisely in these applications, there are prior\nsubspaces forming multiple angles with the ground-truth subspaces. In this\npaper, we propose a novel strategy to incorporate this information into the\ncompletion task. To this end, we designed a multi-weight nuclear norm\nminimization where the weights are such chosen to penalize each angle within\nthe matrix subspace independently. We propose a new scheme for optimally\nchoosing the weights. Specifically, we first calculate an upper-bound\nexpression describing the coherency of the interested matrix.

Modern applications inturn have adopted the\nmicroservices architecture which composes applications as loosely coupled\nsmaller components, or services. This complements edge computing infrastructure\nthat are often resource constrained and may not handle monolithic applications.\nInstead, edge servers can independently deploy application service components,\nalthough at the cost of communication overheads. Consistently meeting\napplication service level objectives while also optimizing application\ndeployment (placement and migration of services) cost and communication\noverheads in mobile edge cloud environment is non-trivial. In this paper we\npropose and evaluate three dynamic placement strategies, two heuristic (greedy\napproximation based on set cover, and integer programming based optimization)\nand one learning-based algorithm. Their goal is to satisfy the application\nconstraints, minimize infrastructure deployment cost, while ensuring\navailability of services to all clients and User Equipment (UE) in the network\ncoverage area. The algorithms can be extended to any network topology and\nmicroservice based edge computing applications. For the experiments, we use the\ndrone swarm navigation as a representative application for edge computing use\ncases. Since access to real-world physical testbed for such application is\ndifficult, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms as a simulation. We\nalso contrast these algorithms with respect to placement quality, utilization\nof clusters, and level of determinism. Our evaluation not only shows that the\nlearning-based algorithm provides solutions of better quality; it also provides\ninteresting conclusions regarding when the (more traditional) heuristic\nalgorithms are actually better suited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 12:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

That this seems like a\nfundamental difference means current libraries for building parameterised\nfunctions in JAX have either rejected the OO approach entirely (Stax) or have\nintroduced OO-to-functional transformations, multiple new abstractions, and\nbeen limited in the extent to which they integrate with JAX (Flax, Haiku,\nObjax). Either way this OO/functional difference has been a source of tension.\nHere, we introduce `Equinox', a small neural network library showing how a\nPyTorch-like class-based approach may be admitted without sacrificing JAX-like\nfunctional programming. We provide two main ideas. One: parameterised functions\nare themselves represented as `PyTrees', which means that the parameterisation\nof a function is transparent to the JAX framework. Two: we filter a PyTree to\nisolate just those components that should be treated when transforming (`jit',\n`grad' or `vmap'-ing) a higher-order function of a parameterised function --\nsuch as a loss function applied to a model.

The appeal of high-level temporal\nlogic specifications has motivated research to develop RL algorithms for\nsynthesis of policies from specifications. To understand the techniques, and\nnuanced variations in their theoretical guarantees, in the growing body of\nresulting literature, we develop a formal framework for defining\ntransformations among RL tasks with different forms of objectives.

Saliency is the significant target(s) in the video. The object of\ninterest is further analyzed for high-level applications. The segregation of\nsaliency and the background can be made if they exhibit different visual cues.\nTherefore, saliency detection is often formulated as background subtraction.\nHowever, saliency detection is challenging. For instance, dynamic background\ncan result in false positive errors. In another scenario, camouflage will lead\nto false negative errors. With moving camera, the captured scenes are even more\ncomplicated to handle. We propose a new framework, called saliency detection\nvia background model completion (SD-BMC), that comprises of a background\nmodeler and the deep learning background/foreground segmentation network. The\nbackground modeler generates an initial clean background image from a short\nimage sequence.

The performance\nof the wall models is assessed both in a priori and a posteriori settings\nagainst the traditional finite-volume based ODE equilibrium wall model, showing\na comparable computational cost for the integral wall model, and superior\nperformance for the spectral implementation over the finite-volume based\napproach. Load imbalance among the processors in parallel simulations seems to\nseverely degrade the parallel efficiency of finite-volume based ODE wall model,\nwhereas the spectral implementation is remarkably agnostic to these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 00:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 03:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

At the same time, it is\nevident that these patterns are not completely random but are results of a\nconvolution of organisms' sensor-based information processing and motility. The\ncomplexity of the first component is reflected in the statistical\ncharacteristics of trajectories produced by an organism -- when it is, e.g.,\nforaging or searching for a mate (or a pathogen) -- and therefore some\nknowledge about the component can be obtained by analyzing the trajectories\nwith the standard toolbox of methods used for random walks. Here we consider\ntrajectories which appear as the results of a game played by two players on a\nfinite square lattice. One player wants to survive, i. e., to stay within the\ninterior of the square, as long as possible while another one wants to reach\nthe adsorbing boundary. A game starts from the center of the square and every\nnext movement of the point is determined by independent strategy choices made\nby the players. The value of the game is the survival time that is the number\nof steps before the adsorption happens. We present the results of a series of\nexperiments involving both human players and an autonomous agent (bot) and\nconcentrate on the probability distribution of the survival time. This\ndistribution indicate that the process we are dealing with is more complex than\nthe standard random walks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 17:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}
