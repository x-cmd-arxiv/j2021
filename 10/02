In this work, under the\nspatial-dependent propagation, we systematically study the contribution of all\nlocal SNRs within 1 kpc around solar to the spectra of nuclei and electron, as\nwell as the energy dependence of anisotropy. As a result, only Geminga,\nMonogem, and Vela SNRs have quantitive contribution to the nuclei and electron\nspectra and anisotropy. Here, Geminga SNR is the sole optimal candidate and\nMonogem SNR is controversial due to the tension of anisotropy between model\ncalculation and observations. The Vela SNR contributes a new spectral structure\nbeyond TeV energy, hinted by HESS, VERITAS, DAMPE and CALET measurements. More\ninteresting is that the electron anisotropy satisfies the Fermi-LAT limit below\nTeV energy, but rises greatly and reaches $10\\%$ at several TeV.

To address this issue, in this paper, we\npropose an ensemble-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method for\nselecting top performance machine learning technique(s) for COVID-19 cough\nclassification.

Here we demonstrate accurate and fast predictions of mechanical\nproperties for CNTs and arbitrary 3D graphitic assemblies based on a training\nset of over 1000 stress-strain curves from cutting-edge reactive MD simulation\nand machine learning (ML). Several ML methods are compared and show that our\nnewly proposed hierarchically structured graph neural networks with spatial\ninformation (HS-GNNs) achieve predictions in modulus and strength for any 3D\nnanostructure with only 5-10% error across a wide range of possible values. The\nreliability is sufficient for practical applications and a great improvement\nover off-the shelf ML methods with up to 50% deviation, as well as over earlier\nmodels for specific chemistry with 20% deviation. The algorithms allow more\nthan 10 times faster mechanical property predictions than traditional molecular\ndynamics simulations, the identification of the role of defects and random 3D\nmorphology, and high-throughput screening of 3D structures for enhanced\nmechanical properties. The algorithms can be scaled to morphologies up to 100\nnm in size, expanded for chemically similar compounds, and trained to predict a\nbroader range of properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 16:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 21:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Nevertheless, to mandate the\nuse of face masks or coverings in public areas, additional human resources are\nrequired, which is tedious and attention-intensive. To automate the monitoring\nprocess, one of the promising solutions is to leverage existing object\ndetection models to detect the faces with or without masks. As such, security\nofficers do not have to stare at the monitoring devices or crowds, and only\nhave to deal with the alerts triggered by the detection of faces without masks.\nExisting object detection models usually focus on designing the CNN-based\nnetwork architectures for extracting discriminative features.

However, such\nannotation approaches can be costly and impractical for secondary landmarks,\nthat is, ones that reflect fine-grained geometry of animals, and that are often\nspecific to customized behavioral tasks. Due to visual and geometric ambiguity,\nnonexperts are often not qualified for secondary landmark annotation, which can\nrequire anatomical and zoological knowledge.

Thus, there is increasing interest in reducing model errors,\nparticularly by leveraging the rapidly growing observational data to understand\ntheir physics and sources.

MEDIDA only\nrequires a working numerical solver of the model and a small number of\nnoise-free or noisy sporadic observations of the system. In MEDIDA, first the\nmodel error is estimated from differences between the observed states and\nmodel-predicted states (the latter are obtained from a number of one-time-step\nnumerical integrations from the previous observed states). If observations are\nnoisy, a data assimilation (DA) technique such as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)\nis employed to provide the analysis state of the system, which is then used to\nestimate the model error. Finally, an equation-discovery technique, here the\nrelevance vector machine (RVM), a sparsity-promoting Bayesian method, is used\nto identify an interpretable, parsimonious, and closed-form representation of\nthe model error.

Applying this method to\na number of linear classifiers under a variety of data dimensionality and\nsample size settings reveals that the classification performance loss due to\nnon-optimal native hyperparameters can be compensated for by weight vector\ntuning.

Deep kernel\nlearning showed success in adopting a deep network for feature extraction\nfollowed by a GP used as function model. Recently,it was suggested that, albeit\ntraining with marginal likelihood, the deterministic nature of feature\nextractor might lead to overfitting while the replacement with a Bayesian\nnetwork seemed to cure it. Here, we propose the conditional Deep Gaussian\nProcess (DGP) in which the intermediate GPs in hierarchical composition are\nsupported by the hyperdata and the exposed GP remains zero mean. Motivated by\nthe inducing points in sparse GP, the hyperdata also play the role of function\nsupports, but are hyperparameters rather than random variables. We follow our\nprevious moment matching approach to approximate the marginal prior for\nconditional DGP with a GP carrying an effective kernel. Thus, as in empirical\nBayes, the hyperdata are learned by optimizing the approximate marginal\nlikelihood which implicitly depends on the hyperdata via the kernel. We shall\nshow the equivalence with the deep kernel learning in the limit of dense\nhyperdata in latent space. However, the conditional DGP and the corresponding\napproximate inference enjoy the benefit of being more Bayesian than deep kernel\nlearning. Preliminary extrapolation results demonstrate expressive power from\nthe depth of hierarchy by exploiting the exact covariance and hyperdata\nlearning, in comparison with GP kernel composition, DGP variational inference\nand deep kernel learning.

Previous studies\nsuggested that the MVDR result can provide complementary information for the\nsecond DNN to better predict target speech. However, on fixed-geometry arrays,\nboth DNNs can take in, for example, the real and imaginary (RI) components of\nthe multi-channel mixture as features to leverage the spatial and spectral\ninformation for enhancement. It is not explained clearly why the linear MVDR\nresult can be complementary and why it is still needed, considering that the\nDNNs and the beamformer use the same input, and the DNNs perform non-linear\nfiltering and could render the linear filtering of MVDR unnecessary. Similarly,\nin monaural cases, one can replace the MVDR beamformer with a monaural weighted\nprediction error (WPE) filter.

Results: We find that vortices that spawn at\nthe outer gap edge can survive for about 100-3000 planetary orbits, with the\nshortest lifetimes occurring for moderately efficient dissipation and cooling.\nHowever, we also observe a different regime of long-lasting vortices with\nlifetimes of at least 15 000 orbits for very low viscosity and very short\nthermal relaxation timescales.

This central overabundance of mainly\nhard binaries can serve as a source of energy for the cluster and has a\nsignificant effect on the observed kinematics, such as artificially increasing\nthe observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion.\n  We analyse the binary fractions and distributions of 95 simulated GCs, with\nand without an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in their centre. We show\nthat an IMBH will not only halt the segregation of binaries towards the cluster\ncentre, but also, directly and indirectly, disrupt the binaries that segregate,\nthus depleting binaries in the cluster core. We illustrate this by showing that\nclusters with an IMBH have fewer binaries and flatter radial binary\ndistributions than their counterparts without one. These differences in the\nbinary fraction and distribution provide an additional indicator for the\npresence of a central IMBH in GCs. In addition, we analyse the effects of the\nbinary fraction on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion in the simulated GCs\nand find that binaries can cause an overestimation of up to $70\\%$ of the\nvelocity dispersion within the core radius.

Here we present another effect\noccurring within the Tavis-Cummings model: a nonlinear response of the cavity\nfor resonant external driving of intermediate strength, which makes use of\nlarge cavity dissipation rates. In this regime, $(N+1)$-photon processes\ndominate when the cavity couples to $N$ emitters. We explore and characterize\nthis effect in detail, and provide a picture of how the effect occurs due to\ndestructive interference between the emitter ensemble and the external drive.\nWe find that a central condition for the observed effect is large\ncooperativity, i.e., the product of the cavity and emitter decay rates is much\nsmaller than the collective cavity-emitter interaction strength squared.\nImportantly, this condition does not require strong coupling.

To this end, this paper presents a lightweight frontend\nLiDAR odometry solution with consistent and accurate localization for\ncomputationally-limited robotic platforms. Our Direct LiDAR Odometry (DLO)\nmethod includes several key algorithmic innovations which prioritize\ncomputational efficiency and enables the use of dense, minimally-preprocessed\npoint clouds to provide accurate pose estimates in real-time. This is achieved\nthrough a novel keyframing system which efficiently manages historical map\ninformation, in addition to a custom iterative closest point solver for fast\npoint cloud registration with data structure recycling. Our method is more\naccurate with lower computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art\nand has been extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging\nenvironments on aerial and legged robots as part of NASA JPL Team CoSTAR's\nresearch and development efforts for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 18:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 20:58:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 17:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Although most sdA\nstars are consistent with metal-poor halo main-sequence stars, the formation\nand evolution of a fraction of these stars are still matters of debate. The\nidentification of photometric variability can help to put further constraints\non the evolutionary status of sdA stars, in particular through the analysis of\npulsations. Moreover, the binary ratio, which can be deduced from eclipsing\nbinaries and ellipsoidal variables, is important as input for stellar models.\nIn order to search for variability due to either binarity or pulsations in\nobjects of the spectroscopic sdA class, we have extracted all available high\nprecision light curves from the Kepler K2 mission. We have performed a thorough\ntime series analysis on all available light curves, employing three different\nmethods. Frequencies with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than four have been\nused for further analysis. From the 25 targets, 13 turned out to be variables\nof different kinds (i.e. classical pulsating stars, ellipsoidal and cataclysmic\nvariables, eclipsing binaries, and rotationally induced variables).

Simulated\nemission line spectra from photoionized clouds provide important clues about\nthe physical conditions of HII regions and are frequently used for deriving\nmetallicities and ionization parameters. Through a systematic investigation on\nthe assumptions and methodology used in applying photoionization models, we\nfind that the derived correlation has a strong dependence on the choice of\nmodel parameters.

The existence of the positive correlation contradicts the\nwind-driven bubble model for HII regions. We explore assumptions in the models\nand conclude that there is a potential bias associated with the geometry.\nHowever, this is still insufficient to explain the correlation.

This paper presents a first attempt at addressing a\nfundamental question: What are the benefits from supervision and how does it\nbenefit? Starting from seeing that SCL is not better than random guessing if\nthe learning target is non-identifiable a priori, we propose a two-phase\nparadigm for SCL by explicitly considering structure identifiability. Following\nthis paradigm, we tackle the problem of SCL on discrete data and propose ML4C.\nThe core of ML4C is a binary classifier with a novel learning target: it\nclassifies whether an Unshielded Triple (UT) is a v-structure or not.\nSpecifically, starting from an input dataset with the corresponding skeleton\nprovided, ML4C orients each UT once it is classified as a v-structure. These\nv-structures are together used to construct the final output. To address the\nfundamental question of SCL, we propose a principled method for ML4C\nfeaturization: we exploit the vicinity of a given UT (i.e., the neighbors of UT\nin skeleton), and derive features by considering the conditional dependencies\nand structural entanglement within the vicinity. We further prove that ML4C is\nasymptotically correct. Last but foremost, thorough experiments conducted on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that ML4C remarkably outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, robustness and\ntolerance. In summary, ML4C shows promising results on validating the\neffectiveness of supervision for causal learning.

Many\napproaches to this issue have been developed in recent years. Among them one of\nthe most elegant and versatile is the equivalent polynomial technique. This\nmethod replaces the discontinuous function with a polynomial, allowing\nintegration to occur over the entire domain rather than integrating over\ncomplex subdomains. Although eliminating the issues involved with discontinuous\nfunction integration, the equivalent polynomial tactic introduces its problems.\nThe exact subdomain integration requires a machinery that quickly grows in\ncomplexity when increasing the polynomial degree and the geometry dimension,\nrestricting its applicability to lower order degree finite element families.\nThe current work eliminates this issue.

The motion planner role is to generate feasible, safe\ntrajectories for a self-driving vehicle to follow. The trajectories are\ngenerated through an optimization scheme to optimize a cost function based on\nmetrics related to smoothness, movability, and comfort, and subject to a set of\nconstraints derived from the planned behavior, safety considerations, and\nfeasibility.

In\nthis work, we leverage the already available CSI data to propose a novel\nmap-assisted CSI localization approach, referred to as MAP-CSI. We show that\nAngle-of-Departure (AoD) and Time-of-Arrival (ToA) can be extracted from CSI\nand then be used in combination with the environment map to localize the user.\nWe perform simulations on a public MIMO dataset and show that our method works\nfor both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. We compare\nour method to the state-of-the-art (SoA) method that uses the ray tracing data.\nUsing MAP-CSI, we accomplish an average localization error of 1.8 m in LOS and\n2.8 m in mixed (combination of LOS and NLOS samples) scenarios. On the other\nhand, SoA ray tracing has an average error of 1.0 m and 2.2 m, respectively,\nbut requires explicit AoD and ToA information to perform the localization task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 21:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

A\nparticular challenge is to identify the existence of a percolation cluster in a\nnetwork in the face of noisy data. Here, we consider bond-percolation, and\nintroduce a sampling approach that leverages the core-periphery structure of\nsuch networks at a microscopic scale, using onion decomposition, a refined\nversion of the $k-$core. By selecting subsets of nodes in a particular layer of\nthe onion spectrum that follow similar trajectories in the percolation process,\npercolating phases can be distinguished from non-percolating ones through an\nunsupervised clustering method.

These are particularly problematic in\nsettings with high level of non-compliance such as substance use disorder\ntreatments.

Besides cell-type annotation, supervised machine learning\nmethods can also be applied to predict other cell phenotypes from genomic data.\nDespite the popularity of such applications, there is no existing study to\nsystematically investigate the performance of those supervised algorithms in\nvarious sizes of scRNA-seq data sets.\n  Methods and Results: This study evaluates 13 popular supervised machine\nlearning algorithms to classify cell phenotypes, using published real and\nsimulated data sets with diverse cell sizes. The benchmark contained two parts.\nIn the first part, we used real data sets to assess the popular supervised\nalgorithms' computing speed and cell phenotype classification performance. The\nclassification performances were evaluated using AUC statistics, F1-score,\nprecision, recall, and false-positive rate.

Finally, we propose lightweight solutions to help\nexisting models become more robust to figurative language by simply using an\nexternal resource to translate figurative language to literal (non-figurative)\nforms while preserving the meaning to the best extent possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 23:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The\nlong-standing equal transit time (ETT) theory to explain lift has been proven\nfalse. If incorrect, why was it ever taught? Through a historical analysis of\nrelevant fluid and aerodynamics literature, this study attempts to explain why\nETT theory is part of our collectively lower-level cognitive understanding of\nlift and flight. It was found that in 1744 D'Alembert himself assumed this to\nbe a feature of moving fluids, and while this initial intuition (ETT 1.0) was\nincorrect, the property of ETT (ETT 2.0) was derived in 1752 when applying\nNewton's laws of motion to fluids. This incorrect result was independently\nconfirmed in 1757 by Euler! The conclusion is that an over simplified treatment\nof fluids predicts ETT, along with no lift and drag.

Thus, rain fade forecasting for\nthese systems is critical because it allows the system to switch between ground\ngateways proactively before a rain fade event to maintain seamless service.\nAlthough empirical, statistical, and fade slope models can predict rain fade to\nsome extent, they typically require statistical measurements of rain\ncharacteristics in a given area and cannot be generalized to a large scale\nsystem. Furthermore, such models typically predict near-future rain fade events\nbut are incapable of forecasting far into the future, making proactive resource\nmanagement more difficult. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based\narchitecture is proposed that forecasts future rain fade using satellite and\nradar imagery data as well as link power measurements. Furthermore, the data\npreprocessing and architectural design have been thoroughly explained and\nmultiple experiments have been conducted. Experiments show that the proposed DL\narchitecture outperforms current state-of-the-art machine learning-based\nalgorithms in rain fade forecasting in the near and long term.

In the middle of query execution, AdaptNN collects a number\nof runtime features and predicts termination condition for each individual\nquery, by which better end-to-end latency is attained. Despite its efficiency,\nusing runtime features complicates the learning process and leads to\nperformance degradation. Radically different from AdaptNN, we argue that it is\npromising to predict termination condition before query exetution.\nParticularly, we developed Tao, a general learning framework for Terminating\nANN queries Adaptively using Only static features. Upon the arrival of a query,\nTao first maps the query to a local intrinsic dimension (LID) number, and then\npredicts the termination condition using LID instead of runtime features. By\ndecoupling prediction procedure from query execution, Tao eliminates the\nlaborious feature selection process involved in AdaptNN.

However, many important aspects remain\nunexplored, such as outlier detection and robustness. Existing functional\noutlier detection methods are mainly used for ordinary functional data and\nusually perform poorly when applied to PDFs. To fill this gap, this study\nfocuses on PDF-valued outlier detection, as well as its application in robust\ndistributional regression. Similar to ordinary functional data, detecting the\nshape outlier masked by the \"curve net\" formed by the bulk of the PDFs is the\nmajor challenge in PDF-outlier detection. To this end, we propose a\ntree-structured transformation system for feature extraction as well as\nconverting the shape outliers to easily detectable magnitude outliers, relevant\noutlier detectors are designed for the specific transformed data. A multiple\ndetection strategy is also proposed to account for detection uncertainties and\nto combine different detectors to form a more reliable detection tool.\nMoreover, we propose a distributional-regression-based approach for detecting\nthe abnormal associations of PDF-valued two-tuples. As a specific application,\nthe proposed outlier detection methods are applied to robustify a\ndistribution-to-distribution regression method, and we develop a robust\nestimator for the regression operator by downweighting the detected outliers.\nThe proposed methods are validated and evaluated by extensive simulation\nstudies or real data applications. Relevant comparative studies demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the developed outlier detection method with other competitors in\ndistributional outlier detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 01:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

In this paper, we propose the tagged-multilingual NMT model\nand improve the self-learning algorithm to handle these two problems. Firstly,\nwe extend the Google's multilingual NMT model and add target tokens to the\ntarget languages, which associates the start tag with the target language to\nensure that the source language can be translated to the required target\nlanguage. Secondly, we improve the self-learning algorithm by replacing beam\nsearch with random sample to increases the diversity of the generated data and\nmakes it properly cover the true data distribution.

Methods: We\npropose an unrolling network induced by learnable optimization algorithms (LOA)\nfor solving our nonconvex nonsmooth variational model for MRI reconstruction.\nIn this model, the learnable regularization function contains a task-invariant\ncommon feature encoder and task-specific learner represented by a shallow\nnetwork. To train the network we split the training data into two parts:\ntraining and validation, and introduce a bilevel optimization algorithm. The\nlower-level optimization trains task-invariant parameters for the feature\nencoder with fixed parameters of the task-specific learner on the training\ndataset, and the upper-level optimizes the parameters of the task-specific\nlearner on the validation dataset.

We review their properties and describe the only\nconsistent black hole formation scenario.

A\nmajor obstacle in the SLDG task is the discriminability-generalization bias:\nthe discriminative information in the labeled source dataset may contain\ndomain-specific bias, constraining the generalization of the trained model. To\ntackle this challenging task, we propose a novel framework called\nDomain-Specific Bias Filtering (DSBF), which initializes a discriminative model\nwith the labeled source data and then filters out its domain-specific bias with\nthe unlabeled source data for generalization improvement.

In the standard CONGEST\nmodel of distributed computing, the complexity of clique/cycle detection and\nlisting has received a lot of attention recently.\n  In this paper we consider the induced variant of subgraph detection, where\nthe goal is to decide whether the $n$-node input graph contains $H$ as an\n\\emph{induced} subgraph or not. We first show a $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ lower bound\nfor detecting the existence of an induced $k$-cycle for any $k\\geq 4$ in the\nCONGEST model. This lower bound is tight for $k=4$, and shows that the induced\nvariant of $k$-cycle detection is much harder than the non-induced version.\nThis lower bound is proved via a reduction from two-party communication\ncomplexity. We complement this result by showing that for $5\\leq k\\leq 7$, this\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ lower bound cannot be improved via the two-party\ncommunication framework.\n  We then show how to prove stronger lower bounds for larger values of $k$.\nMore precisely, we show that detecting an induced $k$-cycle for any $k\\geq 8$\nrequires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{2-\\Theta{(1/k)}})$ rounds in the CONGEST model,\nnearly matching the known upper bound $\\tilde{O}(n^{2-\\Theta{(1/k)}})$ of the\ngeneral $k$-node subgraph detection (which also applies to the induced version)\nby Eden, Fiat, Fischer, Kuhn, and Oshman~[DISC 2019].\n  Finally, we investigate the case where $H$ is the diamond (the diamond is\nobtained by adding an edge to a 4-cycle, or equivalently removing an edge from\na 4-clique), and show non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the complexity of\nthe induced version of diamond detecting and listing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 07:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Looking at the relevant literature, XAI is currently focused on\nproducing explainable software and explanations that generally follow an\napproach we could term One-Size-Fits-All, that is unable to meet a requirement\nof centring on user needs. One of the causes of this limit is the belief that\nmaking things explainable alone is enough to have pragmatic explanations. Thus,\ninsisting on a clear separation between explainabilty (something that can be\nexplained) and explanations, we point to explanatorY AI (YAI) as an alternative\nand more powerful approach to win the AI-HLEG challenge. YAI builds over XAI\nwith the goal to collect and organize explainable information, articulating it\ninto something we called user-centred explanatory discourses. Through the use\nof explanatory discourses/narratives we represent the problem of generating\nexplanations for Automated Decision-Making systems (ADMs) into the\nidentification of an appropriate path over an explanatory space, allowing\nexplainees to interactively explore it and produce the explanation best suited\nto their needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 08:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Though the updated catalog\nof compact binary signals reports evidence for slowly spinning systems and\nunequal mass binaries, the data so far cannot provide convincing proof of\nstrongly precessing binaries. Here, we use the GW inference library parallel\nBilby to compare the performance of two waveform models for measuring\nspin-induced orbital precession. One of the waveform models incorporates both\nspin-precession effects and sub-dominant harmonics. The other model accounts\nfor precession but only includes the leading harmonic. By simulating signals\nwith varying mass ratios and spins, we find that the waveform model with\nsub-dominant harmonics enables us to infer the presence of precession in most\ncases accurately. In contrast, the dominant model often fails to extract enough\ninformation to measure precession. In particular, it cannot distinguish a\nface-on highly precessing binary from a slowly precessing binary system\nirrespective of the binary's mass ratio. As expected, we see a significant\nimprovement in measuring precession for edge-on binaries. Other intrinsic\nparameters also become better constrained, indicating that precession effects\nhelp break the correlations between mass and spin parameters. However, the\nprecession measurements are prior dominated for equal-mass binaries with\nface-on orientation, even if we employ waveform model including subdominant\nharmonics. In this case, doubling the signal-to-noise ratio does not help to\nreduce these prior induced biases.

This welfare function is\ndefined as the geometric mean of the agents' valuations and, hence, it strikes\na balance between the extremes of social welfare (arithmetic mean) and\negalitarian welfare (max-min value). Nash social welfare has been extensively\nstudied in recent years for various valuation classes. In particular, a notable\nnegative result is known when the agents' valuations are complement-free and\nare specified via value queries: for XOS valuations, one necessarily requires\nexponentially many value queries to find any sublinear (in $n$) approximation\nfor NSW. Indeed, this lower bound implies that stronger query models are needed\nfor finding better approximations. Towards this, we utilize demand oracles and\nXOS oracles; both of these query models are standard and have been used in\nprior work on social welfare maximization with XOS valuations.\n  We develop the first sublinear approximation algorithm for maximizing Nash\nsocial welfare under XOS valuations, specified via demand and XOS oracles.\nHence, this work breaks the $O(n)$-approximation barrier for NSW maximization\nunder XOS valuations. We obtain this result by developing a novel connection\nbetween NSW and social welfare under a capped version of the agents'\nvaluations. In addition to this insight, which might be of independent\ninterest, this work relies on an intricate combination of multiple technical\nideas, including the use of repeated matchings and the discrete moving knife\nmethod.

The computational expense for edge devices is reduced by\nreducing the floating-point precision of the parameters in the model.

Most manipulation planning approaches rely on\nanalytical models and carefully chosen abstractions/state-spaces to be\neffective. A central question is how models can be obtained from data that are\nnot primarily accurate in their predictions, but, more importantly, enable\nefficient reasoning within a planning framework, while at the same time being\nclosely coupled to perception spaces. We show that representing objects as\nsigned-distance fields not only enables to learn and represent a variety of\nmodels with higher accuracy compared to point-cloud and occupancy measure\nrepresentations, but also that SDF-based models are suitable for\noptimization-based planning. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we\nlearn both kinematic and dynamic models to solve tasks that involve hanging\nmugs on hooks and pushing objects on a table. We can unify these quite\ndifferent tasks within one framework, since SDFs are the common object\nrepresentation.

The regular arrangement of quasi-streamwise ridges\nand troughs at a characteristic spanwise spacing between 1 and 1.5 times the\nmean fluid height is found to be a consequence of the preferential spanwise\norganization of turbulence in large-scale streamwise velocity streaks. Sediment\nridges predominantly appear in regions of weaker erosion below large-scale\nlow-speed streaks and vice versa for troughs. The interaction between the\ndynamics of the large-scale streaks in the bulk flow and the evolution of\nsediment ridges on the sediment bed is best described as a `top-down' process,\nas the arrangement of the sediment bedforms is seen to adapt to changes in the\nouter flow with a time delay of several bulk time units. The observed\n`top-down' interaction between the outer flow and the bed agrees fairly well\nwith the conceptual model on causality in canonical channel flows proposed by\nJimenez (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 842, 2018, P1, section 5.6). Mean secondary\ncurrents of Prandtl's second kind of comparable intensity and lateral spacing\nare found over developed sediment ridges and in single-phase smooth-wall\nchannels alike in averages over O(10) bulk time units. This indicates that the\nsecondary flow commonly observed together with sediment ridges is the\nstatistical footprint of the regularly organized large-scale streaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 14:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

In this regard, it is suggested to quantify the\nfreshness of updates by using Age of Information (AoI) from the receiver's\nperspective. Specifically, the AoI measures the freshness over time. However,\nthe freshness in the content is neglected. In this paper, we introduce an\nage-based utility, named as Age of Changed Information (AoCI), which captures\nboth the passage of time and the change of information content. By modeling the\nunderlying physical process as a discrete time Markov chain, we investigate the\nAoCI in a time-slotted status update system, where a sensor samples the\nphysical process and transmits the update packets to the destination. With the\naim of minimizing the weighted sum of the AoCI and the update cost, we\nformulate an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process. We show\nthat the optimal updating policy has a special structure with respect to the\nAoCI and identify the condition under which the special structure exists. By\nexploiting the special structure, we provide a low complexity relative policy\niteration algorithm that finds the optimal updating policy. We further\ninvestigate the optimal policy for two special cases. In the first case where\nthe state of the physical process transits with equiprobability, we show that\noptimal policy is of threshold type and derive the closed-form of the optimal\nthreshold. We then study a more generalized periodic Markov model of the\nphysical process in the second case. Lastly, simulation results are laid out to\nexhibit the performance of the optimal updating policy and its superiority over\nthe zero-wait baseline policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 14:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

To distinguish the contribution of these dissipative mechanisms we\nhave measured frictional shear stresses for crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS) on three different rough surfaces of similar surface chemistry across\nnearly six decades of sliding velocity. The results show that the observed\nfriction is dominated by adhesive dissipation, rather than viscoelastic\ndissipation. Prior models for elastomer friction assume that roughness only\ninfluences adhesive dissipation via the amount of contact area; by contrast, we\nfind that the roughness-induced oscillations occurring across all length scales\nfrom macroscopic to atomic influence the molecular processes governing the\nadhesive dissipation. While it was previously known that roughness-induced\noscillations affected the viscoelastic dissipation; this is the first\ndemonstration that these oscillations also control the behavior of the adhesive\ncomponent of friction. Finally, while theory predicts that rough friction\nshould be independent of elastic modulus ($E'$), we show that a strong\ndependence on modulus, with the frictional shear stress scaling as $E'^{1/2}$.\nWhen analyzed in this way, data from four different moduli and three different\nroughnesses collapse onto a universal curve to describe the velocity-dependent\nfriction of soft materials. Taken together, this investigation sheds new light\non the adhesive component of friction, and how it depends on the roughness and\nstiffness of the materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 15:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

(ii)In general there is\nno deterministic algorithm for the identification version of $\\mathsf{HSP}$\nwith query complexity of $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$, since there exists an\ninstance of $\\mathsf{HSP}$ that needs $\\omega(\\sqrt{\\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$ queries\nto identify $H$. $f(x)$ is said to be $\\omega(g(x))$ if for every positive\nconstant $C$, there exists a positive constant $N$ such that for $x>N$,\n$f(x)\\ge C\\cdot g(x)$, which means $g$ is a strict lower bound for $f$. On the\nother hand, there exist instances of $\\mathsf{HSP}$ with query complexity far\nsmaller than $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$, whose query complexity is $O(\\log\n\\frac{|G|}{|H|})$ and even $O(1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 15:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 12:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In\nthis paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT,\nand Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content\nanalysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly\ntopics, sub-themes, and cross-topic themes within scientific research on\nsustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics\nincluding sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management,\nclimate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, the convergence of AI with IoT,\nAI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering\neducation, and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future\nresearch strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. Theoretically, this\nanalysis contributes to the existing literature on sustainable AI and\nsustainable energy, and practically, it intends to act as a general guide for\nenergy engineers and scientists, AI scientists, and social scientists to widen\ntheir knowledge of sustainability in AI and energy convergence research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 15:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

We\nintroduce algebraic operations on such sequences to model different kinds of\ncomponent composition. These composition operators yield the externally\nobservable behavior of their resulting composite components through\nspecifications of interactions of the behaviors of their constituent\ncomponents, as they, e.g., synchronize with or mutually exclude each other's\nalternative behaviors. Our framework is expressive enough to allow articulation\nof properties that coordinate desired interactions among composed components\nwithin the framework, also as component behavior.

Results show the appearance of two sedimentation fronts, a\nspherical particle front and the bacteria front. We find that the bacteria\nfront behave diffusive at short times, whereas at long times decays linearly.\nThe sedimentation speed of passive particles decays at a constant speed and\ndecreases as bacteria concentration ($\\phi_b$) is increased. As $\\phi_b$ is\nincreased further, the sedimentation speed becomes independent of $\\phi_b$. The\ntimescales of the bacteria front is associated with the particle settling\nspeeds.

Through event-driven information processing,\nSNNs can reduce the expensive compute requirements of DNNs considerably, while\nachieving comparable performance. However, high inference latency is a\nsignificant hindrance to the edge deployment of deep SNNs. Computation over\nmultiple timesteps not only increases latency as well as overall energy budget\ndue to higher number of operations, but also incurs memory access overhead of\nfetching membrane potentials, both of which lessen the energy benefits of SNNs.\nTo overcome this bottleneck and leverage the full potential of SNNs, we propose\nan Iterative Initialization and Retraining method for SNNs (IIR-SNN) to perform\nsingle shot inference in the temporal axis. The method starts with an SNN\ntrained with T timesteps (T>1). Then at each stage of latency reduction, the\nnetwork trained at previous stage with higher timestep is utilized as\ninitialization for subsequent training with lower timestep. This acts as a\ncompression method, as the network is gradually shrunk in the temporal domain.\nIn this paper, we use direct input encoding and choose T=5, since as per\nliterature, it is the minimum required latency to achieve satisfactory\nperformance on ImageNet. The proposed scheme allows us to obtain SNNs with up\nto unit latency, requiring a single forward pass during inference. We achieve\ntop-1 accuracy of 93.05%, 70.15% and 67.71% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and\nImageNet, respectively using VGG16, with just 1 timestep. In addition, IIR-SNNs\nperform inference with 5-2500X reduced latency compared to other\nstate-of-the-art SNNs, maintaining comparable or even better accuracy.\nFurthermore, in comparison with standard DNNs, the proposed IIR-SNNs\nprovide25-33X higher energy efficiency, while being comparable to them in\nclassification performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 22:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

For\ndescribing continuum of natural cognitive architectures, from basal cellular to\nhuman-level cognition, we use evolutionary info-computational framework, where\nnatural/ physical/ morphological computation leads to evolution of increasingly\ncomplex cognitive systems.
