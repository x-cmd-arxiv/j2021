This amounts to fixing a Killing vector $v$\ngenerating a $U(1)\\subset U(1)^r$ rotation and dimensionally reducing either\nalong $v$ or along another direction contained in $U(1)^r$. To perform such\nreduction we introduce a $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ quotient freely acting along one of the\ntwo fibers. For fixed $p$ the resulting manifolds $S^{2r-1}/\\mathbb{Z}_p\\equiv\nL^{2r-1}(p,\\pm 1)$ are a higher dimensional generalization of lens spaces. In\nthe large $p$ limit the fiber shrinks and effectively we find theories living\non the base manifold. Starting from $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM on $S^3$ and\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM on $S^5$ we compute the perturbative partition functions on\n$L^{2r-1}(p,\\pm 1)$ and, in the large $p$ limit, on $\\mathbb{CP}^{r-1}$,\nrespectively for $r=2$ and $r=3$. We show how the reductions along the two\ninequivalent fibers give rise to two distinct theories on the base. Reducing\nalong $v$ gives an equivariant version of Donaldson-Witten theory while the\nother choice leads to a supersymmetric theory closely related to Pestun's\ntheory on $S^4$. We use our technique to reproduce known results for $r=2$ and\nwe provide new results for $r=3$. In particular we show how, at large $p$, the\nsum over fluxes on $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ arises from a sum over flat connections on\n$L^{5}(p,\\pm 1)$. Finally, for $r=3$, we also comment on the factorization of\nperturbative partition functions on non simply connected manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 16:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 08:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

To address these scenarios, budgeted multi-stage\nclassifiers (MSC) process inputs through a sequence of partial feature\nacquisition and evaluation steps with early-exit options until a confident\nprediction can be made. This allows for fast evaluation that can prevent\nexpensive, unnecessary feature acquisition in time-critical instances. However,\nperformance of MSCs is highly sensitive to several design aspects -- making\noptimization of these systems an important but difficult problem.\n  To approximate an initially intractable combinatorial problem, current\napproaches to MSC configuration rely on well-behaved surrogate loss functions\naccounting for two primary objectives (processing cost, error). These\napproaches have proven useful in many scenarios but are limited by analytic\nconstraints (convexity, smoothness, etc.) and do not manage additional\nperformance objectives. Notably, such methods do not explicitly account for an\nimportant aspect of real-time detection systems -- the ratio of \"accepted\"\npredictions satisfying some confidence criterion imposed by a risk-averse\nmonitor.\n  This paper proposes a problem-specific genetic algorithm, EMSCO, that\nincorporates a terminal reject option for indecisive predictions and treats MSC\ndesign as an evolutionary optimization problem with distinct objectives\n(accuracy, cost, coverage). The algorithm's design emphasizes Pareto efficiency\nwhile respecting a notion of aggregated performance via a unique scalarization.\nExperiments are conducted to demonstrate EMSCO's ability to find global optima\nin a variety of Theta(k^n) solution spaces, and multiple experiments show EMSCO\nis competitive with alternative budgeted approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 16:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 18:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 02:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Existing methods do not exploit this\nliterature, which can effectively contextualize and combat science-related\nfallacies. Furthermore, these methods rarely require human intervention, which\nis essential for the convoluted and critical domain of scientific\nmisinformation. SciClops involves three main steps to process scientific claims\nfound in online news articles and social media postings: extraction,\nclustering, and contextualization. First, the extraction of scientific claims\ntakes place using a domain-specific, fine-tuned transformer model. Second,\nsimilar claims extracted from heterogeneous sources are clustered together with\nrelated scientific literature using a method that exploits their content and\nthe connections among them. Third, check-worthy claims, broadcasted by popular\nyet unreliable sources, are highlighted together with an enhanced fact-checking\ncontext that includes related verified claims, news articles, and scientific\npapers. Extensive experiments show that SciClops tackles sufficiently these\nthree steps, and effectively assists non-expert fact-checkers in the\nverification of complex scientific claims, outperforming commercial\nfact-checking systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 16:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Existing graph transformer models\ntypically adopt fully-connected attention mechanism on the whole input graph\nand thus suffer from severe scalability issues and are intractable to train in\ndata insufficient cases. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel\nGophormer model which applies transformers on ego-graphs instead of\nfull-graphs. Specifically, Node2Seq module is proposed to sample ego-graphs as\nthe input of transformers, which alleviates the challenge of scalability and\nserves as an effective data augmentation technique to boost model performance.\nMoreover, different from the feature-based attention strategy in vanilla\ntransformers, we propose a proximity-enhanced attention mechanism to capture\nthe fine-grained structural bias. In order to handle the uncertainty introduced\nby the ego-graph sampling, we further propose a consistency regularization and\na multi-sample inference strategy for stabilized training and testing,\nrespectively.

The computational cost of matched\nfiltering scales with both the number of templates required to cover a\nparameter space and the in-band duration of the waveform. Both of these factors\nincrease in difficulty as the current observatories improve in sensitivity,\nespecially at low frequencies, and may pose challenges for third-generation\nobservatories. Reducing the cost of matched filtering would make searches of\nfuture detector data more tractable. In addition, it would be easier to conduct\nsearches that incorporate the effects of eccentricity, precession or target\nlight sources (e.g. subsolar). We present a hierarchical scheme based on a\nreduced basis method to decrease the computational cost of conducting a\nmatched-filter based search. Compared to the current methods, we estimate\nwithout any loss in sensitivity, a speedup by a factor of ~ 10 for sources with\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least =6.0, and a factor of ~ 6 for SNR of at\nleast 5. Our method is dominated by linear operations which are highly\nparallelizable. Therefore, we implement our algorithm using graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs) and evaluate commercially motivated metrics to\ndemonstrate the efficiency of GPUs in CBC searches. Our scheme can be extended\nto generic CBC searches and allows for efficient matched filtering using GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 08:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Speckle reduction has thus been the subject of\nnumerous works spanning at least four decades. Techniques based on deep neural\nnetworks have recently achieved a new level of performance in terms of SAR\nimage restoration quality. Beyond the design of suitable network architectures\nor the selection of adequate loss functions, the construction of training sets\nis of uttermost importance. So far, most approaches have considered a\nsupervised training strategy: the networks are trained to produce outputs as\nclose as possible to speckle-free reference images. Speckle-free images are\ngenerally not available, which requires resorting to natural or optical images\nor the selection of stable areas in long time series to circumvent the lack of\nground truth. Self-supervision, on the other hand, avoids the use of\nspeckle-free images. We introduce a self-supervised strategy based on the\nseparation of the real and imaginary parts of single-look complex SAR images,\ncalled MERLIN (coMplex sElf-supeRvised despeckLINg), and show that it offers a\nstraightforward way to train all kinds of deep despeckling networks.

This early era of galaxy formation imprints the\ndistribution and kinematics of the stars that we observe today, but it is not\nyet well established how. In this work, we use simulations of isolated Milky\nWay-mass disc galaxies to study how kinematic properties of stars change when\nvarying the gas fraction. This allows us to quantify the roles played by\ninternal processes, e.g. gas turbulence and gravitational scattering off\nmassive gas clumps, in establishing the observed stellar velocity dispersions\nand orbital eccentricities. We find that models with gas fractions $>20$ per\ncent feature a turbulent and clumpy interstellar medium (ISM), leading to\nzero-age stellar velocity dispersions $\\sim 20-30~{\\rm km\\, s}^{-1}$ and high\nmean orbital eccentricities. Low eccentricities cannot arise from these\nphysical conditions. For gas fractions below $20$ per cent, the ISM becomes\nless turbulent, with stellar velocity dispersions $<10~{\\rm km\\, s}^{-1}$, and\nnearly circular orbits for young stars. The turbulence present in gas-rich high\nredshift galaxies hence acts as a `barrier' against the formation of thin\ndiscs. We compare our findings to the Milky Way's age-velocity dispersion\nrelation and argue that velocity dispersions imprinted already at star\nformation by the ISM contribute significantly at all times. Finally, we show\nthat observed orbital eccentricities in the Milky Way's thick and thin discs\ncan be explained entirely as imprints by the star-forming ISM, rather than by\nmergers or secular processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Maintaining coherence while producing accurate\nforecasts can be a challenging problem, especially in the case of probabilistic\nforecasting. We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent\nprobabilistic forecasts for time series when reliable hierarchical information\nis present. We call it Deep Poisson Mixture Network (DPMN).

By iteratively aggregating\nneighboring node features to a center node, both 1-WL and GNN obtain a node\nrepresentation that encodes a rooted subtree around the center node. These\nrooted subtree representations are then pooled into a single representation to\nrepresent the whole graph. However, rooted subtrees are of limited\nexpressiveness to represent a non-tree graph. To address it, we propose Nested\nGraph Neural Networks (NGNNs). NGNN represents a graph with rooted subgraphs\ninstead of rooted subtrees, so that two graphs sharing many identical subgraphs\n(rather than subtrees) tend to have similar representations. The key is to make\neach node representation encode a subgraph around it more than a subtree. To\nachieve this, NGNN extracts a local subgraph around each node and applies a\nbase GNN to each subgraph to learn a subgraph representation. The whole-graph\nrepresentation is then obtained by pooling these subgraph representations. We\nprovide a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that NGNN is strictly more\npowerful than 1-WL. In particular, we proved that NGNN can discriminate almost\nall r-regular graphs, where 1-WL always fails. Moreover, unlike other more\npowerful GNNs, NGNN only introduces a constant-factor higher time complexity\nthan standard GNNs. NGNN is a plug-and-play framework that can be combined with\nvarious base GNNs. We test NGNN with different base GNNs on several benchmark\ndatasets. NGNN uniformly improves their performance and shows highly\ncompetitive performance on all datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 18:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Presently, we introduce a Wilson loop prototype on a piecewise\ncurvilinear contour that can be interpreted in the T-dual language to\ncorrespond to nonvanishing gluon off-shellness. We analyze it first for four\nsites at one loop and demonstrate that it coincides with the four-gluon\namplitude on the Coulomb branch. Encouraged by this fact, we move on to the\ntwo-loop order.

However, broadband parametric\namplification can be achieved in active metamaterials which allow local\nparameters to be modulated both in space and in time. Inspired by the concept\nof luminal metamaterials in optics, we describe a mechanism for one-way\namplification of sound waves across an entire frequency band using\nspacetime-periodic modulation of local stiffnesses in the form of a traveling\nwave. When the speed of the modulation wave approaches that of the speed of\nsound in the metamaterial -- a regime called the sonic limit -- nearly all\nmodes in the forward-propagating acoustic band are amplified, whereas no\namplification occurs in the reverse-propagating band. To eliminate divergences\nthat are inherent to the sonic limit in continuum materials, we use an exact\nFloquet-Bloch approach to compute the dynamic excitation bands of discrete\nperiodic systems. We find wide ranges of parameters for which the amplification\nis nearly uniform across the lowest-frequency band, enabling amplification of\nwavepackets while preserving their speed, shape, and spectral content.

In many applications, there are high contrast changes\nin media properties. For solving these problems, one often uses coarse spatial\ngrid for spatial resolution. For temporal discretization, implicit methods are\noften used. For implicit methods, though the time step can be relatively large,\nthe equations are difficult to compute due to the nonlinearity and the fact\nthat one deals with large-scale systems. On the other hand, the discrete system\nin explicit methods are easier to compute but it requires small time steps. In\nthis work, we propose the partially explicit scheme following earlier works on\ndeveloping partially explicit methods for nonlinear diffusion equations. In\nthis scheme, the diffusion term is treated partially explicitly and the\nreaction term is treated fully explicitly. With the appropriate construction of\nspaces and stability analysis, we find that the required time step in our\nproposed scheme scales as the coarse mesh size, which creates a great saving in\ncomputing. The main novelty of this work is the extension of our earlier works\nfor diffusion equations to time fractional diffusion equations. For the case of\nfractional diffusion equations, the constraints on time steps are more severe\nand the proposed methods alleviate this since the time step in partially\nexplicit method scales as the coarse mesh size. We present stability results.\nNumerical results are presented where we compare our proposed partially\nexplicit methods with a fully implicit approach.

These strategies include the\naddition of long-chain polymers, the incorporation of slip surfaces, and the\napplication of an external body force. While it has been believed that such\nmethods lead to a skin-friction reduction by controlling near-wall flow\nstructures, the underlying mechanisms at play are still not as clear. In this\nstudy, a temporal analysis is employed to elucidate underlying drag-reduction\nmechanisms among these methods. The analysis is based on the lifetime of\nintermittent phases represented by the active and hibernating phases of a\nminimal turbulent channel flow (Xi & Graham, Phy. Rev. Lett. 2010). At a\nsimilar amount of drag reduction, the polymer and slip methods show a similar\nmechanism, while the body force method is different. The polymers and slip\nsurfaces cause hibernating phases to happen more frequently, while the duration\nof active phases is decreased. However, the body forces cause hibernating\nphases to happen less frequently but prolong its duration to achieve a\ncomparable amount of drag reduction. A possible mechanism behind the body force\nmethod is associated with its unique roller-like vortical structures formed\nnear the wall. These structures appear to prevent interactions between inner\nand outer regions by which hibernating phases are prolonged. It should motivate\nadaptive flow-control strategies to exploit the distinct underlying mechanisms\nfor robust control of turbulent drag at low Reynolds numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 21:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Our method is calibrated by comparing the\nstrengths of the first few normalized autocorrelation peaks using ensembles of\nmodels that have various starspot lifetimes. We find that we must mix models of\nshort and long lifetimes together (in heuristically determined ratios) to align\nthe models with the Kepler data. Our fundamental result is that short starspot\ngroup lifetimes (1-4 rotations) are implied when the first normalized peak is\nweaker than about 0.4, long lifetimes (15 or greater) are implied when it is\ngreater than about 0.7, and in between are the intermediate cases. Rotational\nlifetimes can be converted to physical lifetimes if the rotation period is\nknown. Stars with shorter rotation periods tend to have longer rotational (but\nnot physical) spot lifetimes, and cooler stars tend to have longer physical\nspot lifetimes than warmer stars with the same rotation period. The\ndistributions of the physical lifetimes are lognormal for both samples and\ngenerally longer in the first sample. The shorter lifetimes in the stars\nwithout known periods probably explain why their periods are difficult to\nmeasure.

The environment of a WSN is often organized into clusters to mitigate\nthe management complexity of such obligations. However, the distance between\nSensor Nodes (SNs) and the number of clusters per round are vital factors that\naffect QoS performance of a WSN. A designer's conundrum resolves around the\ndesire to sustain a balance between the limited residual energy of SNs and the\ndemand for prolonged network lifetime. Any imbalance in controlling such\nobjectives results in either QoS penalties due to draining SN energies, or an\nover-cost environment that is significantly difficult to distribute and\noperate. Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is a distributed\nalgorithm proposed to tackle such difficulties. Proposed LEACH-based algorithms\nfocus on residual energies of SNs to compute a probability function that\nselects cluster-heads and an optimal energy-efficient path toward a destination\nSN. Nevertheless, these algorithms do not consider variations in network's\nstate at run-time. Such a state changes in an adaptive manner according to\nexisting network structures and conditions. Thus, cluster-heads per round are\nnot elected adaptively depending on the state and distances between SNs. This\npaper proposes an energy-efficient adaptive distance-based clustering called\nAdapt-P, in which an adaptive probability function is developed to formulate\nclusters. A near-optimal distance between each cluster-head and its\ncluster-members is formulated so that energy consumption of the network is\nmitigated and network lifetime is maximized. The cluster-head selection\nprobability is adapted at the end of each round based on the maximum number of\ncluster-heads permitted per round found a priori and the number of alive SNs in\nthe network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 22:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Companies need to build up capabilities to implement new\ntechnologies, and automation may make some occupations obsolete. However,\nwhere, when, and how the change will happen remain to be determined. Robust\nempirical indicators of technological progress linked to occupations can help\nto illuminate this change. With this aim, we provide such an indicator based on\npatent data. Using natural language processing, we calculate patent exposure\nscores for more than 900 occupations, which represent the technological\nprogress related to them. To provide a lens on the impact of the 4IR, we\ndifferentiate between traditional and 4IR patent exposure. Our method differs\nfrom previous approaches in that it both accounts for the diversity of\ntask-level patent exposures within an occupation and reflects work activities\nmore accurately. We find that exposure to 4IR patents differs from traditional\npatent exposure. Manual tasks, and accordingly occupations such as construction\nand production, are exposed mainly to traditional (non-4IR) patents but have\nlow exposure to 4IR patents. The analysis suggests that 4IR technologies may\nhave a negative impact on job growth; this impact appears 10 to 20 years after\npatent filing. Further, we compared the 4IR exposure to other automation and AI\nexposure scores. Whereas many measures refer to theoretical automation\npotential, our patent-based indicator reflects actual technology diffusion. Our\nwork not only allows analyses of the impact of 4IR technologies as a whole, but\nalso provides exposure scores for more than 300 technology fields, such as AI\nand smart office technologies. Finally, the work provides a general mapping of\npatents to tasks and occupations, which enables future researchers to construct\nindividual exposure measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 23:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

The switch effects of the Josephson current are found in both\nconfigurations when the ${\\bf{d}}$-vectors are rotated in the $xy$ plane.\nFurthermore, the symmetries satisfied by the current-phase difference relations\nare analysed in details by the operations of the time-reversal,\nmirror-reflections, the spin-rotation and the gauge transformation, which can\nwell explain the above selection rules for the $\\phi_{0}$ phase. Our results\nreveal the peculiar Josephson effect between spin-triplet superconductors and\nthe quantum anomalous Hall insulator, which provide helpful phases and effects\nfor the device designs. The distinct current-phase difference relations for\ndifferent orientations may be used to determine the direction of the\n${\\bf{d}}$-vector in the spin-triplet superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

The ability to follow such rules, and to reason about them, is not\nnearly as clear-cut as it seems on first analysis. Real-world rules are\nunavoidably rife with open-textured terms, which imbue rules with a possibly\ninfinite set of possible interpretations. Narrowing down this set requires a\ncomplex reasoning process that is not yet within the scope of contemporary AI.\nThis poses a serious problem for autonomous AI: If one cannot reason about\nopen-textured terms, then one cannot reason about (or in accordance with)\nreal-world rules. And if one cannot reason about real-world rules, then one\ncannot: follow human laws, comply with regulations, act in accordance with\nwritten agreements, or even obey mission-specific commands that are anything\nmore than trivial. But before tackling these problems, we must first answer a\nmore fundamental question: Given an open-textured rule, what is its correct\ninterpretation?

We describe the microscopic layout by either an\nanalytic geometric model with uncertain parameters or a level cut from a\nGaussian random field. The macroscale properties of the microstructured\nmaterial are predicted by homogenization. Considering the large number of\npossible microscale configurations, one of the main challenges of solving such\ntopology optimization problems is the computational cost of estimating the\nstatistical moments of the cost and constraint functions and their gradients\nwith respect to the design variables.

The less exact the\naveraging is, however, the more the total iterations the training needs to\ntake. Therefore, the key to making decentralized SGD efficient is to realize\nnearly-exact averaging using little communication. This requires a skillful\nchoice of communication topology, which is an under-studied topic in\ndecentralized optimization.\n  In this paper, we study so-called exponential graphs where every node is\nconnected to $O(\\log(n))$ neighbors and $n$ is the total number of nodes.

These\nstrict followings bring the two advantages in the equivalent-machine based TSA:\n(i) the stability of the equivalent machine is characterized precisely, and\n(ii) the equivalent-machine trajectory variance is depicted clearly. The two\nadvantages are fully reflected in the precise definitions of the\nequivalent-machine based transient stability concepts. In particular, the\nequivalent machine swing is clearly depicted through the EDSP or EDLP of the\nmachine, and the critical stability of the equivalent system is strictly\ndefined as the critical stability of the equivalent machine.

Methods:This paper proposed a novel method\nfor aneurysm detection.First,a fully automatic cerebral artery segmentation\nalgorithm without training data was used to extract the volume of interest,and\nthen the 3D U-Net was improved by the 3D SENet module to establish an aneurysm\ndetection model.Eventually a set of fully automated,end-to-end aneurysm\ndetection methods have been formed. Results:A total of 231 magnetic resonance\nangiography image data were used in this study,among which 132 were training\nsets,34 were internal test sets and 65 were external test sets.The presented\nmethod obtained 97.89% sensitivity in the five-fold cross-validation and\nobtained 91.0% sensitivity with 2.48 false positives/case in the detection of\nthe external test sets. Conclusions:Compared with the results of our previous\nstudies and other studies,the method in this paper achieves a very competitive\nsensitivity with less training data and maintains a low false positive rate.As\nthe only method currently using 3D U-Net for aneurysm detection,it proves the\nfeasibility and superior performance of this network in aneurysm detection,and\nalso explores the potential of the channel attention mechanism in this task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Previous works often depend on the fine-tuning process to transfer their\nmodel to the novel category and rarely consider the defect of fine-tuning,\nresulting in many application drawbacks. For example, these methods are far\nfrom satisfying in the episode-changeable scenarios due to excessive\nfine-tuning times, and their performance on low-quality (e.g., low-shot and\nclass-incomplete) support sets degrades severely. To this end, this paper\nproposes an instant response few-shot object detector (IR-FSOD) that can\naccurately and directly detect the objects of novel categories without the\nfine-tuning process. To accomplish the objective, we carefully analyze the\ndefects of individual modules in the Faster R-CNN framework under the FSOD\nsetting and then extend it to IR-FSOD by improving these defects. Specifically,\nwe first propose two simple but effective meta-strategies for the box\nclassifier and RPN module to enable the object detection of novel categories\nwith instant response. Then, we introduce two explicit inferences into the\nlocalization module to alleviate its over-fitting to the base categories,\nincluding explicit localization score and semi-explicit box regression.\nExtensive experiments show that the IR-FSOD framework not only achieves\nfew-shot object detection with the instant response but also reaches\nstate-of-the-art performance in precision and recall under various FSOD\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 03:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 08:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Meanwhile,\nincreasing the outlook time horizon may lead to significant computation burdens\nand delayed reactions, which also compromises safety. To tackle this challenge,\nwe define a new notion of forward invariance on probability space as opposed to\nthe safe regions on state space. This new notion allows the long-term safe\nprobability to be framed into a forward invariance condition, which can be\nefficiently evaluated. We build upon this safety condition to propose a\ncontroller that works myopically yet can guarantee long-term safe probability\nor fast recovery probability.

We propose a novel\napproach named Scale-Free Delayed INF (SFD-INF) for this novel setting, which\ncombines a recent \"convex combination trick\" together with a novel doubling and\nskipping technique. We then present two instances of SFD-INF, each with\ncarefully designed delay-adapted learning scales. The first one SFD-TINF uses\n$\\frac 12$-Tsallis entropy regularizer and can achieve $\\widetilde{\\mathcal\nO}(\\sqrt{K(D+T)}L)$ regret when the losses are non-negative, where $K$ is the\nnumber of actions, $T$ is the number of steps, and $D$ is the total feedback\ndelay. This bound nearly matches the $\\Omega((\\sqrt{KT}+\\sqrt{D\\log K})L)$\nlower-bound when regarding $K$ as a constant independent of $T$. The second\none, SFD-LBINF, works for general scale-free losses and achieves a small-loss\nstyle adaptive regret bound $\\widetilde{\\mathcal\nO}(\\sqrt{K\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{\\mathfrak L}_T^2]}+\\sqrt{KDL})$, which falls to the\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}(\\sqrt{K(D+T)}L)$ regret in the worst case and is thus\nmore general than SFD-TINF despite a more complicated analysis and several\nextra logarithmic dependencies. Moreover, both instances also outperform the\nexisting algorithms for non-delayed (i.e., $D=0$) scale-free adversarial MAB\nproblems, which can be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 04:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 08:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 02:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

These interfacial\nfolds travel along the bottom of elastomer as surface detachment waves to\nfacilitate the apparent sliding motion of elastomer. At very low sliding speed\ncompared to elastic surface waves, the process is dominated by surface adhesion\nand relaxation effects, and the phenomenon is historically referred to as\nSchallamach waves. We report in this letter the observation of fast-traveling\nintersonic detachment waves exceeding the Rayleigh and shear wave velocities of\nthe soft material in contact. The spatio-temporal analysis revealed the\naccelerating nature of the detachment wave, and the scaling of wave speed with\nthe elastic modului of the material suggests that this process is governed by\nelasticity and inertia. Multiple wave signatures on the plot were connected to\ndifferent stages of surface wrinkles, as they exhibited distinctive slopes\n(from which velocities were derived) in the generation, propagation and rebound\nphases. We also characterized the frequencies of wrinkle generation in addition\nto the speeds and found a consistent scaling law of these two wave\ncharacteristics as the stiffness of elastomer increased. Physical implications\nof this new finding may further promote our understanding of elastomer noise\ngeneration mechanisms, as at macroscopic sliding velocity, the frequency of\nelastomer instability readily enters human audible ranges and interacts with\nother vibratory frequencies to cooperatively create harsh and detrimental\nnoises in disc braking, wiper blade and shoe squeaking among many other\nelastomer applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 05:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

In both conditions, the total\nbandwidth of the COWP bands can be efficiently broadened by more than three\ntimes. Moreover, based on the ultra-broadband one-way configurations,\ngradient-index metamaterial-based one-way waveguides are proposed to achieve\nbroadband truly rainbow trapping (TRT).

One of\nthe main challenges is the large variation between signals from different\nsubjects. It limits recognition systems to work only for the subjects involved\nin model training, which is undesirable for real-world scenarios where new\nsubjects are frequently added. This limitation can be alleviated by collecting\na large amount of data for each new user, yet it is costly and sometimes\ninfeasible. To make the task more practical, we introduce a novel problem\nsetting, namely subject adaptive EEG-based visual recognition. In this setting,\na bunch of pre-recorded data of existing users (source) is available, while\nonly a little training data from a new user (target) are provided. At inference\ntime, the model is evaluated solely on the signals from the target user. This\nsetting is challenging, especially because training samples from source\nsubjects may not be helpful when evaluating the model on the data from the\ntarget subject. To tackle the new problem, we design a simple yet effective\nbaseline that minimizes the discrepancy between feature distributions from\ndifferent subjects, which allows the model to extract subject-independent\nfeatures. Consequently, our model can learn the common knowledge shared among\nsubjects, thereby significantly improving the recognition performance for the\ntarget subject.

In addition, we further evaluate the\nqualities of all locations and provides valuable response by adaptive\npseudo-label selection (APS) strategies. Finally, we elucidate that knowledge\nfrom different responses should be assigned with different importance during\nincremental distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO\ndemonstrate significant advantages of our method, which substantially narrow\nthe performance gap towards full training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 08:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Where\nobjects provide a local view on the content in videos, in this work we also\nseek to include a global view of the scene in which actions occur.

Each entity may\nneed to make its local decision to improve the network performance under\ndynamic and uncertain network environments. Standard learning algorithms such\nas single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) have been recently used to enable each network entity as an agent to\nlearn an optimal decision-making policy adaptively through interacting with the\nunknown environments.

In Study 2, we identified\nassociations of user tendencies in evaluating information using the Implicit\nAssociation Test (IAT). The significant results showed that the user's\nattention and decision behavior improved after using the VSAS. The IAT results\nshow a change in the association of user exposure, where after the intervention\nusing VSAS, users tend not to share misinformation about COVID-19. The results\nare expected to be the basis for developing social media applications to combat\nthe negative impact of the infodemic COVID-19 misinformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 08:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 23:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Simply\ncentralizing these multi-sourced data for training would raise critical\nsecurity and privacy concerns, and might be prohibited given the increasingly\nstrict data regulations. To resolve the tension between privacy and data\nutilization in distributed learning, a machine learning framework called\nprivate aggregation of teacher ensembles(PATE) has been recently proposed. PATE\nharnesses the knowledge (label predictions for an unlabeled dataset) from\ndistributed teacher models to train a student model, obviating access to\ndistributed datasets. Despite being enticing, PATE does not offer protection\nfor the individual label predictions from teacher models, which still entails\nprivacy risks. In this paper, we propose SEDML, a new protocol which allows to\nsecurely and efficiently harness the distributed knowledge in machine learning.\nSEDML builds on lightweight cryptography and provides strong protection for the\nindividual label predictions, as well as differential privacy guarantees on the\naggregation results. Extensive evaluations show that while providing privacy\nprotection, SEDML preserves the accuracy as in the plaintext baseline.\nMeanwhile, SEDML's performance in computing and communication is 43 times and\n1.23 times higher than the latest technology, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 08:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

The latter requires solving a linear system,\nwhich can be advantageous as an explicit mapping of the data to a possibly\ninfinite-dimensional feature space is avoided. However, for large-scale\napplications, current low-rank approximation methods can perform inadequately.\nFor example, current methods are probabilistic due to their sampling\nprocedures, and/or suffer from a poor trade-off between the ranks and\napproximation power.

The proposed method is iterative, does not require\nexplicit storage of the kernel matrix, and allows the formulation of early\nstopping conditions. Additionally, the framework yields confidence estimates of\nobtained models, unlike alternative methods. The performance is tested on two\nregression and three classification experiments, and compared to the Nystr\\\"om\nand fixed size LS-SVM methods.

As ERGMs typically\ninvolve normalizing factors that are costly to compute, practical inference\nrelies on a variety of approximations or other workarounds. Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo maximum likelihood (MCMC MLE) provides a powerful tool to approximate the\nMLE of ERGM parameters, and is feasible for typical models on single networks\nwith as many as a few thousand nodes. MCMC-based algorithms for Bayesian\nanalysis are more expensive, and high-quality answers are challenging to obtain\non large graphs. For both strategies, extension to the pooled case - in which\nwe observe multiple networks from a common generative process - adds further\ncomputational cost, with both time and memory scaling linearly in the number of\ngraphs. This becomes prohibitive for large networks, or where large numbers of\ngraph observations are available. Here, we exploit some basic properties of the\ndiscrete exponential families to develop an approach for ERGM inference in the\npooled case that (where applicable) allows an arbitrarily large number of graph\nobservations to be fit at no additional computational cost beyond preprocessing\nthe data itself. Moreover, a variant of our approach can also be used to\nperform Bayesian inference under conjugate priors, again with no additional\ncomputational cost in the estimation phase.

It reduces the memory footprint\nand the computational cost at inference, facilitating the deployment of\nresource-hungry models. However, the parameter perturbations caused by this\ntransformation result in $behavioral$ $disparities$ between the model before\nand after quantization. For example, a quantized model can misclassify some\ntest-time samples that are otherwise classified correctly. It is not known\nwhether such differences lead to a new security vulnerability. We hypothesize\nthat an adversary may control this disparity to introduce specific behaviors\nthat activate upon quantization. To study this hypothesis, we weaponize\nquantization-aware training and propose a new training framework to implement\nadversarial quantization outcomes. Following this framework, we present three\nattacks we carry out with quantization: (i) an indiscriminate attack for\nsignificant accuracy loss; (ii) a targeted attack against specific samples; and\n(iii) a backdoor attack for controlling the model with an input trigger. We\nfurther show that a single compromised model defeats multiple quantization\nschemes, including robust quantization techniques. Moreover, in a federated\nlearning scenario, we demonstrate that a set of malicious participants who\nconspire can inject our quantization-activated backdoor.

Our models\naccount for the stellar limb-darkening and Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effects,\nand contemplate various possible scenarios for the planetary atmosphere.\nResults. We reconciled the discrepant results by identifying a range of\nplanetary atmospheres that are consistent with previous low- and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations.

Previous cross-modal\nretrieval methods focus on projecting the cross-modal data into a common space\nby learning the correlation between them to bridge the modality gap. However,\nthe rich semantic information in the video and the heterogeneous nature of\naudio-visual data leads to more serious heterogeneous gaps intuitively, which\nmay lead to the loss of key semantic content of video with single clue by the\nprevious methods when eliminating the modality gap, while the semantics of the\ncategories may undermine the properties of the original features. In this work,\nwe aim to learn effective audio-visual representations to support audio-visual\ncross-modal retrieval (AVCMR). We propose a novel model that maps audio-visual\nmodalities into two distinct shared latent subspaces: explicit and implicit\nshared spaces. In particular, the explicit shared space is used to optimize\npairwise correlations, where learned representations across modalities capture\nthe commonalities of audio-visual pairs and reduce the modality gap. The\nimplicit shared space is used to preserve the distinctive features between\nmodalities by maintaining the discrimination of audio/video patterns from\ndifferent semantic categories. Finally, the fusion of the features learned from\nthe two latent subspaces is used for the similarity computation of the AVCMR\ntask.

Theoretical\nstudies in connection with recent observational data of isolated neutron stars,\nas well as binary neutron stars systems, offer an excellent opportunity to\nprovide robust solutions on the dense nuclear problem. In the present work, we\nreview recent studies concerning the applications of various theoretical\nnuclear models on a few recent observations of binary neutron stars or\nneutron-star--black-hole systems. In particular, using a simple and\nwell-established model, we parametrize the stiffness of the equation of state\nwith the help of the speed of sound. Moreover, in comparison to the recent\nobservations of two events by LIGO/VIRGO collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425,\nwe suggest possible robust constraints. We also concentrate our theoretical\nstudy on the resent observation of a compact object with mass~$\\sim\n2.59_{-0.09}^{+0.08}~M_{\\odot}$ (GW190814 event), as a component of a system\nwhere the main companion was a black hole with mass $\\sim 23~M_{\\odot}$. There\nis scientific debate concerning the identification of the low mass component,\nas it falls into the neutron-star--black-hole mass gap. This is an important\nissue since understanding the nature of GW190814 event will offer rich\ninformation concerning the upper limit of the speed of sound in dense matter\nand the possible phase transition into other degrees of freedom. We\nsystematically study the tidal deformability of a possible high-mass candidate\nexisting as an individual star or as a component in a binary neutron star\nsystem. Finally, we provide some applications of equations of state of hot,\ndense nuclear matter in hot neutron stars, protoneutron stars, and binary\nneutron star merger remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 10:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 11:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, these algorithms\nsuffer performance degradation when applied to the regions on which they have\nnot been trained. Current large datasets mostly cover the developed regions and\ncollecting such datasets for every region is a costly, time-consuming, and\ndifficult endeavor. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation\nmethod for counting buildings where we use a labeled source domain (developed\nregions) and adapt the trained model on an unlabeled target domain (developing\nregions). We initially align distribution maps across domains by aligning the\noutput space distribution through adversarial loss. We then exploit counting\nconsistency constraints, within-image count consistency, and across-image count\nconsistency, to decrease the domain shift. Within-image consistency enforces\nthat building count in the whole image should be greater than or equal to count\nin any of its sub-image. Across-image consistency constraint enforces that if\nan image contains considerably more buildings than the other image, then their\nsub-images shall also have the same order. These two constraints encourage the\nbehavior to be consistent across and within the images, regardless of the\nscale. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we collected and\nannotated a large-scale dataset consisting of challenging South Asian regions\nhaving higher building densities and irregular structures as compared to\nexisting datasets. We perform extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of\nour approach and report improvements of approximately 7% to 20% over the\ncompetitive baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 10:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Refinement has been used successfully in the\ndevelopment of substantial verified systems. Nevertheless, existing refinement\ntechniques have limitations that impede their practical usefulness. Some\ntechniques generate executable code automatically, which generally leads to\nimplementations with sub-optimal performance. Others employ bottom-up program\nverification to reason about efficient implementations, but impose strict\nrequirements on the structure of the code, the structure of the refinement\nproofs, as well as the employed verification logic and tools.\n  In this paper, we present a novel refinement technique that removes these\nlimitations. Our technique uses separation logic to reason about efficient\nconcurrent implementations. It prescribes only a loose coupling between an\nabstract model and the concrete implementation. It thereby supports a wide\nrange of program structures, data representations, and proof structures. We\nmake only minimal assumptions about the underlying program logic, which allows\nour technique to be used in combination with a wide range of logics and to be\nautomated using off-the-shelf separation logic verifiers.

GPs are particularly\nuseful in the last application since they rely on Normal distributions and\nenable closed-form computation of the posterior probability function.\nUnfortunately, because the resulting posterior is not flexible enough to\ncapture complex distributions, GPs assume high similarity between subsequent\ntasks - a requirement rarely met in real-world conditions. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by leveraging the flexibility of Normalizing Flows to\nmodulate the posterior predictive distribution of the GP. This makes the GP\nposterior locally non-Gaussian, therefore we name our method Non-Gaussian\nGaussian Processes (NGGPs). More precisely, we propose an invertible ODE-based\nmapping that operates on each component of the random variable vectors and\nshares the parameters across all of them. We empirically tested the flexibility\nof NGGPs on various few-shot learning regression datasets, showing that the\nmapping can incorporate context embedding information to model different noise\nlevels for periodic functions. As a result, our method shares the structure of\nthe problem between subsequent tasks, but the contextualization allows for\nadaptation to dissimilarities.

It is easy to understand, infer\nnew knowledge, and communicate with other inference systems. One weakness of\nthe previous rule induction systems is that they only find rules within a\nknowledge base (KB) and therefore cannot generalize to more open and complex\nreal-world rules. Recently, the language model (LM)-based rule generation are\nproposed to enhance the expressive power of the rules. In this paper, we\nrevisit the differences between KB-based rule induction and LM-based rule\ngeneration. We argue that, while KB-based methods inducted rules by discovering\ndata commonalities, the current LM-based methods are \"learning rules from\nrules\". This limits these methods to only produce \"canned\" rules whose patterns\nare constrained by the annotated rules, while discarding the rich expressive\npower of LMs for free text.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we propose the open rule induction problem, which\naims to induce open rules utilizing the knowledge in LMs. Besides, we propose\nthe Orion (\\underline{o}pen \\underline{r}ule \\underline{i}nducti\\underline{on})\nsystem to automatically mine open rules from LMs without supervision of\nannotated rules.

Starting from a random initial node at time $t=1$, at each time step\n$t \\ge 2$ an RW hops into a random neighbor of its previous node. In some of\nthe time steps the RW may visit a new, yet-unvisited node, while in other time\nsteps it may revisit a node that has already been visited before. The cover\ntime $T_{\\rm C}$ is the number of time steps required for the RW to visit every\nsingle node in the network at least once. We derive a master equation for the\ndistribution $P_t(S=s)$ of the number of distinct nodes $s$ visited by an RW up\nto time $t$ and solve it analytically. Inserting $s=N$ we obtain the cumulative\ndistribution of cover times, namely the probability $P(T_{\\rm C} \\le t) =\nP_t(S=N)$ that up to time $t$ an RW will visit all the $N$ nodes in the\nnetwork. Taking the large network limit, we show that $P(T_{\\rm C} \\le t)$\nconverges to a Gumbel distribution.

Animal Pose estimation is more challenging than estimating human\npose due to high inter and intra class variability in animals. Existing works\nsolve this problem for a fixed set of predefined animal categories. Models\ntrained on such sets usually do not work well with new animal categories.\nRetraining the model on new categories makes the model overfit and leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel problem of\n\"Incremental Learning for Animal Pose Estimation\". Our method uses an exemplar\nmemory, sampled using Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) to continually adapt\nto new animal categories without forgetting the old ones. We further propose a\nnew variant of k-DPP that uses RBF kernel (termed as \"RBF k-DPP\") which gives\nmore gain in performance over traditional k-DPP. Due to memory constraints, the\nlimited number of exemplars along with new class data can lead to class\nimbalance. We mitigate it by performing image warping as an augmentation\ntechnique. This helps in crafting diverse poses, which reduces overfitting and\nyields further improvement in performance. The efficacy of our proposed\napproach is demonstrated via extensive experiments and ablations where we\nobtain significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 11:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We find that communities can be in a number of\ndifferent regimes, depending on the interaction strength. When interactions are\nstrong, the network of coexisting species breaks up into small subgraphs, while\nfor weaker interactions these graphs are larger and more complex, eventually\nencompassing all species. This process is driven by emergence of new allowed\nsubgraphs as interaction strength decreases, leading to sharp changes in\ndiversity and other community properties, and at weaker interactions to two\ndistinct collective transitions: a percolation transition, and a transition\nbetween having a unique equilibrium and having multiple alternative equilibria.\nUnderstanding community structure is thus made up of two parts: first, finding\nwhich subgraphs are allowed at a given interaction strength, and secondly, a\ndiscrete problem of matching these structures over the entire community.

From the Lie\ngroup theory, it is shown that the attitude estimation model is group affine\nand its error state model should be trajectory-independent. Moreover, with such\ntrajectory-independent error state model, the linear Kalman filter is still\neffective for large initialization errors. However, the measurement model of\nthe traditional MEKF is dependent on the attitude prediction, which is\ntherefore trajectory-dependent. This is also the main reason why the\nperformance of traditional MEKF is degraded for large initialization errors.\nThrough substitution of the attitude prediction related term with the vector\nobservation in body frame, a trajectory-independent measurement model is\nderived for MEKF.

A common solution for automating these\ntasks is using nucleus segmentation technology. However, it is hard to train a\nrobust nucleus segmentation model, due to several challenging problems, the\nnucleus adhesion, stacking, and excessive fusion with the background. Recently,\nsome researchers proposed a series of automatic nucleus segmentation methods\nbased on point annotation, which can significant improve the model performance.\nNevertheless, the point annotation needs to be marked by experienced\npathologists. In order to take advantage of segmentation methods based on point\nannotation, further alleviate the manual workload, and make cancer diagnosis\nmore efficient and accurate, it is necessary to develop an automatic nucleus\ndetection algorithm, which can automatically and efficiently locate the\nposition of the nucleus in the pathological image and extract valuable\ninformation for pathologists. In this paper, we propose a W-shaped network for\nautomatic nucleus detection. Different from the traditional U-Net based method,\nmapping the original pathology image to the target mask directly, our proposed\nmethod split the detection task into two sub-tasks. The first sub-task maps the\noriginal pathology image to the binary mask, then the binary mask is mapped to\nthe density mask in the second sub-task. After the task is split, the task's\ndifficulty is significantly reduced, and the network's overall performance is\nimproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Thereby, high amplitude forced\noscillations could be stimulated by MMA, which seriously threats the power\nsystem stability. First, the potential threat of MMA is clarified by\ninvestigating the vulnerability of the IoT-based coordinated charging load\ncontrol system, and an MMA process like Mirai is pointed out as an example.

Precisely, in a causal model with binary\ninterventions, i.e., control and treatment, the causal effect is simply the\ndifference between the factual and counterfactual. The difficulty is that the\ncounterfactual may never been obtained which has to be estimated and so the\ncausal effect could only be an estimate. The key challenge for estimating the\ncounterfactual is to identify confounders which effect both outcomes and\ntreatments. A typical approach is to formulate causal inference as a supervised\nlearning problem and so counterfactual could be predicted. Including linear\nregression and deep learning models, recent machine learning methods have been\nadapted to causal inference. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate\nCausal Effect by using Variational Information Bottleneck (CEVIB). The\npromising point is that VIB is able to naturally distill confounding variables\nfrom the data, which enables estimating causal effect by using observational\ndata.

However, the aggregation procedure of these\nemerged methods might be rigid, resulting in insufficiently exploiting the\ncomplementary relationship between skeleton joint and affective features.\nMeanwhile, the long range dependencies in both spatial and temporal domains of\nthe gait sequence are scarcely considered. To address these issues, we propose\na novel two-stream network with transformer-based complementarity, termed as\nTNTC. Skeleton joint and affective features are encoded into two individual\nimages as the inputs of two streams, respectively. A new transformer-based\ncomplementarity module (TCM) is proposed to bridge the complementarity between\ntwo streams hierarchically via capturing long range dependencies.

This project proposes a semi-supervised machine learning model\n(DASentimental) to extract depression, anxiety and stress from written text.\nFirst, we trained the model to spot how sequences of recalled emotion words by\n$N=200$ individuals correlated with their responses to the Depression Anxiety\nStress Scale (DASS-21). Within the framework of cognitive network science, we\nmodel every list of recalled emotions as a walk over a networked mental\nrepresentation of semantic memory, with emotions connected according to free\nassociations in people's memory. Among several tested machine learning\napproaches, we find that a multilayer perceptron neural network trained on word\nsequences and semantic network distances can achieve state-of-art,\ncross-validated predictions for depression ($R = 0.7$), anxiety ($R = 0.44$)\nand stress ($R = 0.52$).

Being aware of the herbage biomass in\nthe field enables farmers to manage surpluses and deficits in herbage supply,\nas well as using targeted nitrogen fertilization when necessary. Deep learning\nfor computer vision is a powerful tool in this context as it can accurately\nestimate the dry biomass of a herbage parcel using images of the grass canopy\ntaken using a portable device. However, the performance of deep learning comes\nat the cost of an extensive, and in this case destructive, data gathering\nprocess.

In addition, traditional DIC requires a long computation time and often\nproduces a low spatial resolution output affected by filtering and speckle\npattern quality. To address these challenges, we propose a new deep\nlearning-based DIC approach--Deep DIC, in which two convolutional neural\nnetworks, DisplacementNet and StrainNet, are designed to work together for\nend-to-end prediction of displacements and strains. DisplacementNet predicts\nthe displacement field and adaptively tracks a region of interest. StrainNet\npredicts the strain field directly from the image input without relying on the\ndisplacement prediction, which significantly improves the strain prediction\naccuracy. A new dataset generation method is developed to synthesize a\nrealistic and comprehensive dataset, including the generation of speckle\npatterns and the deformation of the speckle image with synthetic displacement\nfields. Though trained on synthetic datasets only, Deep DIC gives highly\nconsistent and comparable predictions of displacement and strain with those\nobtained from commercial DIC software for real experiments, while it\noutperforms commercial software with very robust strain prediction even at\nlarge and localized deformation and varied pattern qualities. In addition, Deep\nDIC is capable of real-time prediction of deformation with a calculation time\ndown to milliseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 20:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Adopting our z~4 QSO luminosity function and applying a\nmild density evolution in redshift, a photo-ionization rate of\nGammaHI=0.46+0.17-0.09x10^-12 s^-1 has been obtained at z=4.75, assuming an\nescape fraction of ~70% and a steep faint-end slope of the AGN luminosity\nfunction. The derived photo-ionization rate is ~50-100% of the ionizing\nbackground measured at the end of the reionization epoch, suggesting that AGNs\ncould play an important role in the cosmological reionization process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Then assuming that the\nlower-level problem is convex, the KKT reformulation of the problem is\nconsidered under the Slater constraint qualification. Based on this KKT\nreformulation, we introduce the corresponding version of the Scholtes\nrelaxation algorithm. We then construct theoretical results ensuring that a\nsequence of global/local optimal solutions (resp. stationarity points) of the\naforementioned Scholtes relaxation converges to a global/local optimal solution\n(resp. stationarity point) of the KKT reformulation of the pessimistic bilevel\noptimization. The results are accompanied by technical results ensuring that\nthe Scholtes relaxation algorithm is well-defined or the corresponding\nparametric optimization can easily be solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

By adapting these methods to\nsocial networks, it is possible to derive family trees of important vertices.\nOur approach consists of two steps. We first apply a novel method for\ndiscarding edges that stand for weak connections. This is done such that the\nconnectivity of the network is preserved. Then, we identify the important peaks\nin the network and the key cols, i.e., the lower points that connect them. This\ngives us a compact network that displays which peaks are connected through\nwhich cols. Thus, a natural hierarchy on the peaks arises by the question which\nhigher peak comes behind the col, yielding to chains of peaks with increasing\nheights. The resulting line parent hierarchy displays dominance relations\nbetween important vertices. We show that networks with hundreds or thousands of\nedges can be condensed to a small set of vertices and key connections and that\nour approach scales to networks with millions of nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 09:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

For instance, the graph\nconnectivity is not always consistent with the label distribution (e.g., the\nclosest neighbors of some nodes are not from the same category). In this case,\nGNNs need to stack more layers, in order to find the same categorical neighbors\nin a longer path for capturing the class-discriminative information. However,\ntwo major problems hinder the deeper GNNs to obtain satisfactory performance,\ni.e., vanishing gradient and over-smoothing. On one hand, stacking layers makes\nthe neural network hard to train as the gradients of the first few layers\nvanish. Moreover, when simply addressing vanishing gradient in GNNs, we\ndiscover the shading neighbors effect (i.e., stacking layers inappropriately\ndistorts the non-IID information of graphs and degrade the performance of\nGNNs). On the other hand, deeper GNNs aggregate much more information from\ncommon neighbors such that individual node representations share more\noverlapping features, which makes the final output representations not\ndiscriminative (i.e., overly smoothed). In this paper, for the first time, we\naddress both problems to enable deeper GNNs, and propose Deeper-GXX, which\nconsists of the Weight-Decaying Graph Residual Connection module (WDG-ResNet)\nand Topology-Guided Graph Contrastive Loss (TGCL).

Similar\nto other database architectures, LSM trees take into account information about\nthe expected workload (e.g., reads vs. writes, point vs. range queries) to\noptimize their performance via tuning. Operating in shared infrastructure like\nthe cloud, however, comes with a degree of workload uncertainty due to\nmulti-tenancy and the fast-evolving nature of modern applications. Systems with\nstatic tuning discount the variability of such hybrid workloads and hence\nprovide an inconsistent and overall suboptimal performance.\n  To address this problem, we introduce Endure - a new paradigm for tuning LSM\ntrees in the presence of workload uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on the\nimpact of the choice of compaction policies, size-ratio, and memory allocation\non the overall performance. Endure considers a robust formulation of the\nthroughput maximization problem, and recommends a tuning that maximizes the\nworst-case throughput over a neighborhood of each expected workload.\nAdditionally, an uncertainty tuning parameter controls the size of this\nneighborhood, thereby allowing the output tunings to be conservative or\noptimistic. Through both model-based and extensive experimental evaluation of\nEndure in the state-of-the-art LSM-based storage engine, RocksDB, we show that\nthe robust tuning methodology consistently outperforms classical tun-ing\nstrategies. We benchmark Endure using 15 workload templates that generate more\nthan 10000 unique noisy workloads. The robust tunings output by Endure lead up\nto a 5$\\times$ improvement in through-put in presence of uncertainty. On the\nflip side, when the observed workload exactly matches the expected one, Endure\ntunings have negligible performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 01:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Here, we theoretically validate the recently proposed PbTe-Pb\nhybrid nanowire as a potential candidate for Majorana devices. By studying the\nelectrostatic and electronic properties of PbTe nanowires, we demonstrate that\nthe huge dielectric constant of PbTe endows itself a high tolerance of charged\nimpurity, which is a potential advantage over InAs and InSb nanowires.\nMoreover, we find that the effective axial Land\\'{e} $g$ factor and Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling strength of PbTe nanowires are comparable to those of InAs\nnanowires. The conceivable merits of using Pb as the SC are (i) Pb has a larger\nsuperconducting gap, higher critical temperature, and higher parallel critical\nmagnetic field than those of Al; (ii) a superconducting gap comparable with\nthose of InAs-Al and InSb-Al can be induced in PbTe-Pb even by a weak coupling\nbetween Pb and PbTe, which simultaneously relieves the adverse renormalization\nand induced disorder effects on SM from SC; and (iii) Pb film can be grown on\nPbTe with a thin buffer CdTe layer in between, solving the lattice mismatch\nproblem as an important source of disorder.

Yet, in digital videos, face recognition is\ncomplicated by occlusion, pose and lighting variations, and persons\nentering/leaving the scene. The thesis's goal is to develop a fast method for\nface recognition in digital videos that is applicable to large datasets. The\nthesis introduces several methods to address the problems associated with video\nface recognition. First, to address issues associated with pose and lighting\nvariations, a collection of face prototypes is associated with each student.\nSecond, to speed up the process, sampling, K-means Clustering, and a\ncombination of both are used to reduce the number of face prototypes per\nstudent. Third, the videos are processed at different frame rates. Fourth, the\nthesis proposes the use of active sets to address occlusion and to eliminate\nface recognition application on video frames with slow face motions. Fifth, the\nthesis develops a group face detector that recognizes students within a\ncollaborative learning group, while rejecting out-of-group face detections.\nSixth, the thesis introduces a face DeID for protecting the students'\nidentities. Seventh, the thesis uses data augmentation to increase the training\nset's size. The different methods are combined using multi-objective\noptimization to guarantee that the full method remains fast without sacrificing\naccuracy. To test the approach, the thesis develops the AOLME dataset of 138\nstudent faces (81 boys and 57 girls) of ages 10 to 14, who are predominantly\nLatina/o students. Compared to the baseline method, the final optimized method\nresulted in fast recognition times with significant improvements in face\nrecognition accuracy. Using face prototype sampling only, the proposed method\nachieved an accuracy of 71.8% compared to 62.3% for the baseline system, while\nrunning 11.6 times faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

In this paper, we consider the\nprobabilistic difference of the kernel transformation in reconstructed state\nspaces, and derive a novel nonequilibrium descriptor by measuring the\nfluctuations of the vector distance with respect to the tolerance. We verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed kernel probabilistic difference using three\nchaotic series (logistic, Henon, and Lorenz) and a first-order autoregressive\nseries according to the surrogate theory, and we use the kernel parameter to\nanalyze real-world heartbeat data. In the heartbeat analysis, the kernel\nprobabilistic difference, particularly that based on the Kullback--Leibler\ndivergence, effectively characterizes the physiological complexity loss related\nto reduced cardiac dynamics in the elderly and diseased heartbeat data.\nOverall, the kernel probabilistic difference provides a novel method for the\nquantification of nonequilibria by characterizing the fluctuation theorem in\nreconstructed state spaces, and enables reliable detection of cardiac\nphysiological and pathological information from heart rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

The first strategy implies\nreplicating and maintaining for decades maximum growth rates of solar power\nachieved in leading countries and becoming an early and ambitious adopter of\nthe CCS technology.

In these works, the proposed approaches to formulate this\ncalculus are based either on the power of one Sonine kernel, or the convolution\nof one Sonine kernel with the kernels of the integer-order integrals. To apply\ngeneral fractional calculus, it is useful to have a wider range of operators,\nfor example, by using the Laplace convolution of different types of kernels. In\nthis paper, an extended formulation of the general fractional calculus of\narbitrary order is proposed. Extension is achieved by using different types\n(subsets) of pairs of operator kernels in definitions general fractional\nintegrals and derivatives. For this, the definition of the Luchko pair of\nkernels is somewhat broadened, which leads to the symmetry of the definition of\nthe Luchko pair. The proposed set of kernel pairs are subsets of the Luchko set\nof kernel pairs. The fundamental theorems for the proposed general fractional\nderivatives and integrals are proved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

A cross-sectional,\nweb-based survey was deployed during August and September, 2020, to practicing\nphysicians in the 18 states with the largest COVID-19 cases. Among 1,478\nresponding physicians, 1,017 completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). First, the\nPCL-5 was used to compare symptom endorsement between the two physician groups.\nA greater percentage of frontline than second-line physicians had clinically\nsignificant endorsement of PCL-5 symptoms and higher PCL-5 scores. Second,\nlogistic regression and seven nonlinear machine learning (ML) algorithms were\nleveraged to identify potential predictors of PTSD risk by analyzing variable\nimportance and partial dependence plots. Predictors of PTSD risk included\ncognitive/psychological measures, occupational characteristics, work\nexperiences, social support, demographics, and workplace characteristics.\nImportantly, the final ML model random forest, identified patterns of both\ndamaging and protective predictors of PTSD risk among frontline physicians. Key\ndamaging factors included depression, burnout, negative coping, fears of\ncontracting/transmitting COVID-19, perceived stigma, and insufficient resources\nto treat COVID-19 patients. Protective factors included resilience and support\nfrom employers/friends/family/significant others. This study underscores the\nvalue of ML algorithms to uncover nonlinear relationships among\nprotective/damaging risk factors for PTSD in frontline physicians, which may\nbetter inform interventions to prepare healthcare systems for future\nepidemics/pandemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

This is\nbecause of the inherent disjointedness and lack of context that typically come\nwith raw claims data. In this paper, we propose a framework for classifying\nhospitalizations due to a specific event.
