Specifically, we aimed to evaluate how the\nrelative growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths would have differed if all states\nhad issued a mandate to mask in public by September 1, 2020 versus if all\nstates had delayed issuing such a mandate. To do so, we applied the Causal\nRoadmap, a formal framework for causal and statistical inference. The outcome\nwas defined as the state-specific relative increase in cumulative cases and in\ncumulative deaths {21, 30, 45, 60}-days after September 1. Despite the natural\nexperiment in state-level masking policies, the causal effect of interest was\nnot identifiable. Nonetheless, we specified the target statistical parameter as\nthe adjusted rate ratio (aRR): the expected outcome with early implementation\ndivided by the expected outcome with delayed implementation, after adjusting\nfor state-level confounders. To minimize strong estimation assumptions, primary\nanalyses used targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner.\nAfter 60-days and at a national-level, early implementation was associated 9%\nreduction in new COVID-19 cases (aRR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.88-0.95) and a 16%\nreduction in new COVID-19 deaths (aRR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76-0.93). Although lack\nof identifiability prohibited causal interpretations, application of the Causal\nRoadmap facilitated estimation and inference of statistical associations,\nproviding timely answers to pressing questions in the COVID-19 response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 16:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Quantum\ncomputer offers the potential to simulate quantum dynamics with polynomial\ncomplexity; however, existing quantum algorithms based on the split-operator\ntechniques require large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers that remain\nelusive in the near future. Here we present variational simulations of\nreal-space quantum dynamics suitable for implementation in Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The Hamiltonian is first encoded\nonto qubits using a discrete variable representation (DVR) and binary encoding\nscheme. We show that direct application of real-time variational quantum\nalgorithm based on the McLachlan's principle is inefficient as the measurement\ncost grows exponentially with the qubit number for general potential energy and\nextremely small time-step size is required to achieve accurate results.\nMotivated by the insights that most chemical dynamics occur in the low energy\nsubspace, we propose a subspace expansion method by projecting the total\nHamiltonian, including the time-dependent driving field, onto the system\nlow-energy eigenstate subspace using quantum computers, the exact quantum\ndynamics within the subspace can then be solved classically. We show that the\nmeasurement cost of the subspace approach grows polynomially with\ndimensionality for general potential energy.

It is usually performed with the fast yet\ndelicate movement of hand gestures, body posture, and even facial expressions.\nCurrent Sign Language Recognition (SLR) methods usually extract features via\ndeep neural networks and suffer overfitting due to limited and noisy data.\nRecently, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention\ndue to its subject-invariant and background-invariant nature, whereas\nskeleton-based SLR is still under exploration due to the lack of hand\nannotations. Some researchers have tried to use off-line hand pose trackers to\nobtain hand keypoints and aid in recognizing sign language via recurrent neural\nnetworks. Nevertheless, none of them outperforms RGB-based approaches yet. To\nthis end, we propose a novel Skeleton Aware Multi-modal Framework with a Global\nEnsemble Model (GEM) for isolated SLR (SAM-SLR-v2) to learn and fuse\nmulti-modal feature representations towards a higher recognition rate.\nSpecifically, we propose a Sign Language Graph Convolution Network (SL-GCN) to\nmodel the embedded dynamics of skeleton keypoints and a Separable\nSpatial-Temporal Convolution Network (SSTCN) to exploit skeleton features.

In a bad weather condition of heavy rainfall, raindrops, mainly\nhitting the vehicle's windshield, can significantly reduce observation ability\neven though the windshield wipers might be able to remove part of it. Moreover,\nrain flows spreading over the windshield can yield the physical effect of\nrefraction, which seriously impede the sightline or undermine the machine\nlearning system equipped in the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a new\nmulti-stage multi-task recurrent generative adversarial network (M2GAN) to deal\nwith challenging problems of raindrops hitting the car's windshield. This\nmethod is also applicable for removing raindrops appearing on a glass window or\nlens.

This trade-off is\ncritical, because most current offline reinforcement learning methods need to\nquery the value of unseen actions during training to improve the policy, and\ntherefore need to either constrain these actions to be in-distribution, or else\nregularize their values. We propose an offline RL method that never needs to\nevaluate actions outside of the dataset, but still enables the learned policy\nto improve substantially over the best behavior in the data through\ngeneralization. The main insight in our work is that, instead of evaluating\nunseen actions from the latest policy, we can approximate the policy\nimprovement step implicitly by treating the state value function as a random\nvariable, with randomness determined by the action (while still integrating\nover the dynamics to avoid excessive optimism), and then taking a state\nconditional upper expectile of this random variable to estimate the value of\nthe best actions in that state. This leverages the generalization capacity of\nthe function approximator to estimate the value of the best available action at\na given state without ever directly querying a Q-function with this unseen\naction. Our algorithm alternates between fitting this upper expectile value\nfunction and backing it up into a Q-function. Then, we extract the policy via\nadvantage-weighted behavioral cloning. We dub our method implicit Q-learning\n(IQL). IQL demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, a standard\nbenchmark for offline reinforcement learning.

A novel utility metric is proposed, based on the area under\nthe average performance curve. The process of modelling, analysis and design of\nrealistic RC structures leads to objective functions for which the evaluation\nis computationally very expensive. To avoid costly simulations, two types of\nsurrogate models are used. The first one consists of the creation of a database\ncontaining all possible solutions. The second one uses benchmark functions to\ncreate a discrete sub-space of them, simulating the main features of realistic\nproblems. Parameter tuning of four metaheuristics is performed based on two\nstrategies. The main difference between them is the parameter control\nestablished to perform partial assessments. The simplest strategy is suitable\nto tune good `generalist' methods, i.e., methods with good performance\nregardless the parameter configuration. The other one is more expensive, but is\nwell suited to assess any method. Tuning results prove that Biogeography-Based\nOptimization, a relatively new evolutionary algorithm, outperforms other\nmethods such as GA or PSO for such optimization problems, due to its particular\napproach of applying recombination and mutation operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 17:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational\nAutoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material\nstability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the\ndecoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic\ncoordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy\nbonding preferences between neighbors.

Interestingly, we show that the constraints from the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are improved by factors of 2.5 and 4.0 on\n$\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $w$, respectively, when combined with our posterior\ndistributions in this cosmological model. In a scenario where the equation of\nstate of dark energy evolves with redshift, the strong lensing constraints are\ncompatible with a cosmological constant (i.e. $w=-1$). In a curved cosmology,\nour strong lensing analyses can accommodate a large range of values for the\ncurvature of the Universe of $\\Omega_{\\rm k}=0.28_{-0.21}^{+0.16}$. In all\ncosmological scenarios, we show that our strong lensing constraints are\ncomplementary and in good agreement with measurements from the CMB, baryon\nacoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae. Our results show that cluster\nstrong lensing cosmography is a potentially powerful probe to be included in\nthe cosmological analyses of future surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Near the epoch of classical\nsingularity, there is a significant contribution from incoming/outgoing modes\nof small wavenumber in the expanding/collapsing phase of the dust cloud, which\nkeeps on decreasing as one moves away from the singularity. The information of\nthe bounce is carried over to the infrared modes through a flip from largely\nincoming to largely outgoing radiation as the evolution progresses from\ncollapsing to expanding phase, much before the information of bounce comes\nabout to any observer. In the infrared sector, the saturation value of the\namplitude marks the bounce radius. Thus, we argue that the information of the\nshort scale physics is essentially carried over to the longest wavelength in\nthis quantum gravity model, which we argue is rather more prominent for low\nenergy processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 18:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 10:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

As a\nlinear instability, it has been shown that its growth with a distribution of\ndust sizes can be classified into two distinct regimes, fast- and slow-growth,\ndepending on the dust-size distribution and the total dust-to-gas density ratio\n$\\epsilon$. Using numerical simulations of an unstratified disc, we bring three\ncases in different regimes into nonlinear saturation. We find that the\nsaturation states of the two fast-growth cases are similar to its\nsingle-species counterparts. The one with maximum dimensionless stopping time\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{s,max}=0.1$ and $\\epsilon=2$ drives turbulent vertical dust-gas\nvortices, while the other with $\\tau_\\mathrm{s,max}=2$ and $\\epsilon=0.2$ leads\nto radial traffic jams and filamentary structures of dust particles. The dust\ndensity distribution for the former is flat in low densities, while the one for\nthe latter has a low-end cutoff. By contrast, the one slow-growth case results\nin a virtually quiescent state. Moreover, we find that in the fast-growth\nregime, significant dust segregation by size occurs, with large particles\nmoving towards dense regions while small particles remain in the diffuse\nregions, and the mean radial drift of each dust species is appreciably altered\nfrom the (initial) drag-force equilibrium. The former effect may skew the\nspectral index derived from multi-wavelength observations and change the\ninitial size distribution of a pebble cloud for planetesimal formation. The\nlatter along with turbulent diffusion may influence the radial transport and\nmixing of solid materials in young protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 18:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

We thus establish that policy iteration on reward-robust MDPs\ncan have the same time complexity as on regularized MDPs.

It is also\ncritical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in\nparticular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches,\nwhich must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude\nstronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map\nthe surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of\ninhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution\nstellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form\nsolution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model\nexplicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar\nspectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while\nsimultaneously mapping the stellar surface.

We implement the model within the open source starry\nframework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization\nand posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to\ninfer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close\nagreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014).

Understanding the above question has\nsubstantial fairness implications when different sub-populations are defined by\nthe demographic groups that we aim to treat fairly. In this paper, we reveal\nthe disparate impacts of deploying SSL: the sub-population who has a higher\nbaseline accuracy without using SSL (the \"rich\" one) tends to benefit more from\nSSL; while the sub-population who suffers from a low baseline accuracy (the\n\"poor\" one) might even observe a performance drop after adding the SSL module.\nWe theoretically and empirically establish the above observation for a broad\nfamily of SSL algorithms, which either explicitly or implicitly use an\nauxiliary \"pseudo-label\". Experiments on a set of image and text classification\ntasks confirm our claims. We introduce a new metric, Benefit Ratio, and promote\nthe evaluation of the fairness of SSL (Equalized Benefit Ratio). We further\ndiscuss how the disparate impact can be mitigated.

These approaches often require customized training\nprocesses and may overfit corrupted patterns, leading to a performance drop in\ndetection. In this paper, from a more data-centric perspective, we propose a\ntraining-free solution to detect corrupted labels. Intuitively, ``closer''\ninstances are more likely to share the same clean label. Based on the\nneighborhood information, we propose two methods: the first one uses ``local\nvoting\" via checking the noisy label consensuses of nearby features. The second\none is a ranking-based approach that scores each instance and filters out a\nguaranteed number of instances that are likely to be corrupted. We\ntheoretically analyze how the quality of features affects the local voting and\nprovide guidelines for tuning neighborhood size. We also prove the worst-case\nerror bound for the ranking-based method.

Here we conduct a systematic\ninvestigation of such characteristics under different closure conditions\nincluding re-entrant jet (RJ), quad vortex (QV), twin vortex (TV), and\npulsating twin vortex (PTV). Using high-speed digital inline holography (DIH),\nall the individual bubbles shed from the cavity are imaged downstream and are\nused to quantify the instantaneous gas leakage from the cavity. In general, the\nsupercavity gas leakage exhibits significant fluctuations under all closure\ntypes with the instantaneous leakage rate spiking up to 20 times of the\nventilation input under RJ and QV closures. However, the magnitude and\noccurrence rate of such excessive gas leakage vary substantially across\ndifferent closures, tunnel speeds, and ventilation conditions. Particularly, as\nthe supercavity transitions from RJ, to QV, TV, and PTV with increasing\nventilation or decreasing tunnel speed, the relative excessive gas leakage\ndecreases sharply from RJ to QV, plateaus from QV to TV, and drops again from\nTV to PTV. Correspondingly, the occurrence frequency of such excessive leakage\nfirst exhibits a double peak distribution under RJ, migrates to a single peak\nmode under QV and TV, and eventually transitions to a distribution with a\nbroadened peak at a higher frequency under PTV. These trends can be explained\nby the flow instabilities associated with three distinct gas leakage\nmechanisms. Subsequently, two metrics are introduced to quantify the relative\nchange of ventilation needed to compensate for the change of extra gas loss and\nthe predictability of the occurrence of excessive gas leakage, respectively.\nBased on these metrics, we suggest that the supercavity operating under TV\nclosure with moderate ventilation is optimal for ventilation-based controls of\nsupercavity stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 19:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

For the first stage, a control law is\nproposed that guarantees that the vehicle will not collide with the wall\ncontaining the window and will go through the window with non-zero velocity\nalong the direction orthogonal to the window, keeping at all times a safety\ndistance with respect to the window edges.

The\nformulation for dislocation mobility accounts for some or possibly all of the\nstiffening at high strain rates usually attributed to phonon drag.

A $n$-qubit quantum system is capable of providing $2^{n}$\ncomputational space to a quantum algorithm. However, quantum computers are\nprone to errors. Quantum circuits that can reliably run on today's Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are not only limited by their qubit\ncounts but also by their noisy gate operations. In this paper, we have\nintroduced $i$-QER, a scalable machine learning-based approach to evaluate\nerrors in a quantum circuit and helps to reduce these without using any\nadditional quantum resources. The $i$-QER predicts possible errors in a given\nquantum circuit using supervised learning models. If the predicted error is\nabove a pre-specified threshold, it cuts the large quantum circuit into two\nsmaller sub-circuits using an error-influenced fragmentation strategy for the\nfirst time to the best of our knowledge. The proposed fragmentation process is\niterated until the predicted error reaches below the threshold for each\nsub-circuit. The sub-circuits are then executed on a quantum device. Classical\nreconstruction of the outputs obtained from the sub-circuits can generate the\noutput of the complete circuit. Thus, $i$-QER also provides classical control\nover a scalable hybrid computing approach, which is a combination of quantum\nand classical computers.

High\noperator dependency and low reproducibility make ultrasound imaging and\ninterpretation challenging with a steep learning curve. Automatic image\nclassification using deep learning has the potential to overcome some of these\nchallenges by supporting ultrasound training in novices, as well as aiding\nultrasound image interpretation in patient with complex pathology for more\nexperienced practitioners. However, the use of deep learning methods requires a\nlarge amount of data in order to provide accurate results.

In this work, we propose a multi-modal convolutional neural network\n(CNN) architecture that labels endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images from raw\nverbal comments provided by a clinician during the procedure.

Despite these successes, the application of\nDMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains\nchallenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable\npredictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained,\nrestricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the\nbiological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a\ncompartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves\nwithin states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately\nrecreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper\nknowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that\nthe behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In\nthis work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing\nDMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover\nuseful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting\ncompartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass\nconservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical\nand numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to\nthis common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical\napplications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem\nfrom additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the\nresulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 21:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

However,\nthese methods rely on near real time availability of ground truth, which is\nrarely fulfilled. Further, in applications with seasonal data, temporal concept\ndrift is confounded by seasonal variation. In this work, we propose an approach\ncalled Unsupervised Temporal Drift Detector or UTDD to flexibly account for\nseasonal variation, efficiently detect temporal concept drift in time series\ndata in the absence of ground truth, and subsequently adapt our ML models to\nconcept drift for better generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 22:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

In this paper we show that rates with\nany $r<(d-1)/2$ can hold when $f$ is held fixed as $n\\to\\infty$. This is\naccomplished following a suggestion of Erich Novak to use some unpublished\nresults of Trojan from the 1980s as given in the information based complexity\nmonograph of Traub, Wasilkowski and Wo\\'zniakowski. The proof is made by\napplying a technique of Roth with the theorem of Trojan. The proof is non\nconstructive and we do not know of any integrand of bounded variation in the\nsense of Hardy and Krause for which the QMC error exceeds $(\\log\nn)^{1+\\epsilon}/n$ for infinitely many $n$ when using a digital sequence such\nas one of Sobol's. An empirical search when $d=2$ for integrands designed to\nexploit known weaknesses in certain point sets showed no evidence that $r>1$ is\nneeded. An example with $d=3$ and $n$ up to $2^{100}$ might possibly require\n$r>1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 01:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 23:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Against this backdrop, fleet operators can use compensation\nmechanisms such as monetary incentives to buy delay time from their customers,\nin order to improve the fleet efficiency and ultimately minimize the costs of\noperation. To make the most of such an operational model, the fleet activities\nand the incentives should be jointly optimized accounting for the customers'\nreactions. Against this backdrop, this paper presents an incentive-aware\nelectric vehicle routing scheme in which the fleet operator actively provides\nincentives to the customers in exchange of pickup or delivery time flexibility.\nSpecifically, we first devise a bi-level model whereby the fleet operator\noptimizes the routes and charging schedules of the fleet jointly with an\nincentive rate to reimburse the delivery delays experienced by the customers.\nAt the same time, the customers choose the admissible delays by minimizing a\nmonetarily-weighted combination of the delays minus the reimbursement offered\nby the operator. Second, we tackle the complexity resulting from the bi-level\nand nonlinear problem structure with an equivalent transformation method,\nreformulating the problem as a single-level optimization problem that can be\nsolved with standard mixed-integer linear programming algorithms. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via extensive numerical\nexperiments using VRP-REP data from Belgium.

Recent studies try to cover that by modeling fine-grained\ninteractions between the candidate news and each browsed news article of the\nuser.

We use an $N$-body$+$smooth particle hydrodynamics model of\na warped galaxy to study how warp stars settle into the disc. By following warp\nstars in angular momentum space, we show that they first tilt to partially\nalign with the main disc in a time scale of $\\sim1$ Gyr. Then, once\ndifferential precession halts this process, they phase mix into an axisymmetric\ndistribution on a time scale of $\\sim 6$ Gyr. The warp stars end up\ncontaminating the geometric thick disc. Because the warp in our fiducial\nsimulation is growing, the {\\it warp stars} settle to a distribution with a\nnegative vertical age gradient as younger stars settle further from the\nmid-plane. While vertically extended, warp star orbits are still nearly\ncircular and they are therefore subject to radial migration, with a net\nmovement inwards. As a result warp stars can be found throughout the disc. The\ndensity distribution of a given population of warp stars evolves from a torus\nto an increasingly centrally filled-in density distribution. Therefore we argue\nthat, in the Milky Way, warp stars should be found in the Solar Neighbourhood.\nMoreover, settled warp stars may constitute part of the young flaring\npopulation seen in the Milky Way's outskirts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 03:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

In\nthis paper, we devise a novel Active Learning (AL) framework for neural EA,\naiming to create highly informative seed alignment to obtain more effective EA\nmodels with less annotation cost. Our framework tackles two main challenges\nencountered when applying AL to EA: (1) How to exploit dependencies between\nentities within the AL strategy. Most AL strategies assume that the data\ninstances to sample are independent and identically distributed. However,\nentities in KGs are related. To address this challenge, we propose a\nstructure-aware uncertainty sampling strategy that can measure the uncertainty\nof each entity as well as its impact on its neighbour entities in the KG. (2)\nHow to recognise entities that appear in one KG but not in the other KG (i.e.,\nbachelors). Identifying bachelors would likely save annotation budget.

Second, during the promotion\nperiod, the exposure of some specific items will be re-weighted due to manual\nintervention, resulting in biased logs, which will degrade the ranking model\ntrained using these biased data. In this paper, we propose a novel\nScenario-Aware Ranking Network (SAR-Net) to address these issues. SAR-Net\nharvests the abundant data from different scenarios by learning users'\ncross-scenario interests via two specific attention modules, which leverage the\nscenario features and item features to modulate the user behavior features,\nrespectively. Then, taking the encoded features of previous module as input, a\nscenario-specific linear transformation layer is adopted to further extract\nscenario-specific features, followed by two groups of debias expert networks,\ni.e., scenario-specific experts and scenario-shared experts. They output\nintermediate results independently, which are further fused into the final\nresult by a multi-scenario gating module. In addition, to mitigate the data\nfairness issue caused by manual intervention, we propose the concept of\nFairness Coefficient (FC) to measures the importance of individual sample and\nuse it to reweigh the prediction in the debias expert networks.

However, recommending outfits\nhas two significant challenges that should be addressed. The first challenge is\nthat outfit recommendation often requires a complex and large model that\nutilizes visual information, incurring huge memory and time costs. One natural\nway to mitigate this problem is to compress such a cumbersome model with\nknowledge distillation (KD) techniques that leverage knowledge from a\npretrained teacher model. However, it is hard to apply existing KD approaches\nin recommender systems (RS) to the outfit recommendation because they require\nthe ranking of all possible outfits while the number of outfits grows\nexponentially to the number of consisting clothing items.

The second challenge\nis that the explosive number of outfit candidates amplifying the data sparsity\nproblem, often leading to poor outfit representation.

To address these problems, we investigate domain\nadaptive semantic segmentation without source data, which assumes that the\nmodel is pre-trained on the source domain, and then adapting to the target\ndomain without accessing source data anymore. Since there is no supervision\nfrom the source domain data, many self-training methods tend to fall into the\n``winner-takes-all'' dilemma, where the {\\it majority} classes totally dominate\nthe segmentation networks and the networks fail to classify the {\\it minority}\nclasses.

The last\nstep of an LMF before interpretation is usually to extract the activated brain\nregions from the map by thresholding. However, it is difficult to determine an\nappropriate threshold level. Thresholding can remove the underlying properties\nof spatial maps and their features imposed by the model. In this study, we\npropose a threshold-free activated region extraction method which involves\nsimplifying a brain spatial map to a dendrogram through Morse filtration. Since\na dendrogram is related to the change of clustering structure in Rips\nfiltration, we first show the relationship between the Rips filtration of a\ngraph and the Morse filtration of a function. Then, we dendrogramize a spatial\nmap in order to visualize the activated brain regions and the range of their\nimportance in a spatial map. The proposed method can be applied to any spatial\nmaps that a user wants to threshold and interpret.

Since these often small and single-purpose\nfunctions are managed on shared computing resources behind the scene, a great\npotential for computational reuse and approximate computing emerges that if\nunleashed, can remarkably improve the efficiency of serverless cloud systems --\nboth from the user's QoS and system's (energy consumption and incurred cost)\nperspectives. Accordingly, the goal of this survey study is to, first, unfold\nthe internal mechanics of the serverless computing and, second, explore the\nscope for efficiency within this paradigm via studying function reuse and\napproximation approaches and discussing the pros and cons of each one.

However, the field of medical imaging suffers from the lack\nof sufficient data for properly training DL models because medical images\nrequire manual labelling carried out by clinical experts thus the process is\ntime-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Recently, transfer learning (TL)\nwas introduced to reduce the need for the annotation procedure by means of\ntransferring the knowledge performed by a previous task and then fine-tuning\nthe result using a relatively small dataset. Nowadays, multiple classification\nmethods from medical imaging make use of TL from general-purpose pre-trained\nmodels, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective due to the\nmismatch between the features learned from natural images (ImageNet) and those\nmore specific from medical images especially medical gray images such as\nX-rays. ImageNet does not have grayscale images such as MRI, CT, and X-ray. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel DL model to be used for addressing\nclassification tasks of medical imaging, called MedNet. To do so, we aim to\nissue two versions of MedNet. The first one is Gray-MedNet which will be\ntrained on 3M publicly available gray-scale medical images including MRI, CT,\nX-ray, ultrasound, and PET. The second version is Color-MedNet which will be\ntrained on 3M publicly available color medical images including histopathology,\ntaken images, and many others. To validate the effectiveness MedNet, both\nversions will be fine-tuned to train on the target tasks of a more reduced set\nof medical images. MedNet performs as the pre-trained model to tackle any\nreal-world application from medical imaging and achieve the level of\ngeneralization needed for dealing with medical imaging tasks, e.g.\nclassification. MedNet would serve the research community as a baseline for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 05:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

While increased accuracy is often crucial, less complexity also has\nvalue. This paper proposes a training data selection algorithm that identifies\nmultiple subsets with simple structures. A learning algorithm trained on such a\nsubset can classify an instance belonging to the subset with better accuracy\nthan the traditional learning algorithms. In other words, while existing\npattern recognition algorithms attempt to learn a global mapping function to\nrepresent the entire dataset, we argue that an ensemble of simple local\npatterns may better describe the data. Hence the sub-setting algorithm\nidentifies multiple subsets with simple local patterns by identifying similar\ninstances in the neighborhood of an instance. This motivation has similarities\nto that of gradient boosted trees but focuses on the explainability of the\nmodel that is missing for boosted trees. The proposed algorithm thus balances\naccuracy and explainable machine learning by identifying a limited number of\nsubsets with simple structures.

Due to this effect, the rotation period slowly changes, which can be\nmost easily measured in light curves because the shift in the rotation phase\naccumulates over time quadratically. We collected archived light curves and\ncarried out new photometric observations for asteroids (10115) 1992 SK, (1620)\nGeographos, and (1685) Toro. We applied the method of light curve inversion to\nfit observations with a convex shape model. The YORP effect was modeled as a\nlinear change of the rotation frequency $\\upsilon \\equiv \\mathrm{d}\\omega /\n\\mathrm{d}t$ and optimized together with other spin and shape parameters. We\ndetected the acceleration $\\upsilon = (8.3 \\pm 0.6) \\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-2}$ of the rotation for asteroid (10115)\n1992 SK.

In all ten cases, the\n$\\mathrm{d}\\omega / \\mathrm{d}t$ value is positive, so the rotation of these\nasteroids is accelerated.

Results showed that the Stabilization is the optimal\nstate for modal convergence, in which DMD output becomes independent of the\nsampling range. The Initialization state also yields sufficient accuracy for\nmost system reconstruction tasks. Moreover, defying popular beliefs,\nover-sampling causes algorithmic instability: as the temporal dimension, n,\napproaches and transcends the spatial dimension, m (i.e., m < n), the output\ndiverges and becomes meaningless. Additionally, the convergence of the sampling\nresolution depends on the mode-specific dynamics, such that the resolution of\n15 frames per cycle for target activities is suggested for most engineering\nimplementations.

We introduce the expansion order of the\nelectric field and Berry curvature multipole moment, where the Berry curvature\ndipole is a particular one manifesting itself at the second harmonic order and\nthe second expansion order of the electric field. There are four cases with\nconserving or breaking the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and inversion symmetry\n(IS).

Only the longitudinal spin current survives at even harmonic order. With\nbreaking TRS and conserving IS, only odd harmonic order charge and spin\ncurrents can appear. Moreover, we observe that every harmonic order current\ncontains a series of infinite-order expansion of the electric field.

This\nprocedure relies on local methods for the feature importance computation, e.g.\nLRP, LIME, etc. that are the link between the model weights to be optimized and\nthe user-defined constraints on feature importance. In the fairness area,\npromising experimental results have been obtained for the Adult dataset. Many\nother possible applications of this model agnostic theoretical framework are\ndescribed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 09:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

Existing video captioning models\nlack adequate visual representation due to the neglect of the existence of gaps\nbetween videos and texts. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\nCLIP4Caption framework that improves video captioning based on a CLIP-enhanced\nvideo-text matching network (VTM). This framework is taking full advantage of\nthe information from both vision and language and enforcing the model to learn\nstrongly text-correlated video features for text generation. Besides, unlike\nmost existing models using LSTM or GRU as the sentence decoder, we adopt a\nTransformer structured decoder network to effectively learn the long-range\nvisual and language dependency. Additionally, we introduce a novel ensemble\nstrategy for captioning tasks.

We also emphasize the major themes\nthat are directly useful for investors when assessing the country risk premium.\nAt the global level, we notice that these themes mainly belong to the E and G\npillars. Those results confirm that extra-financial criteria are integrated\ninto bond pricing. However, we also identify a clear difference between\nhigh-and middle-income countries. Indeed, whereas the S pillar is lagging for\nthe highest income countries, it is nearly as important as the G pillar for the\nmiddle-income ones. Second, we determine which ESG metrics are indirectly\nvaluable for assessing a country's solvency. More precisely, we attempt to\ninfer credit rating solely from extra-financial criteria, that is the ESG\nindicators that are priced in by credit rating agencies. We find that there is\nno overlap between the set of indicators that predict credit ratings and those\nthat directly explain sovereign bond yields.

The E pillar\nis lagging, suggesting that credit rating agencies are undermining the impact\nof climate change and environmental topics on country creditworthiness. This is\nconsistent with the traditional view that social and governance issues are the\nmain drivers of the sovereign risk, because they are more specific and less\nglobal than environmental issues.

Like other neural renderers, our system takes as input\ncalibrated camera images and a proxy geometry of the scene, in our case a point\ncloud. To generate a novel view, the point cloud is rasterized with learned\nfeature vectors as colors and a deep neural network fills the remaining holes\nand shades each output pixel. The rasterizer renders points as one-pixel\nsplats, which makes it very fast and allows us to compute gradients with\nrespect to all relevant input parameters efficiently. Furthermore, our pipeline\ncontains a fully differentiable physically-based photometric camera model,\nincluding exposure, white balance, and a camera response function. Following\nthe idea of inverse rendering, we use our renderer to refine its input in order\nto reduce inconsistencies and optimize the quality of its output. In\nparticular, we can optimize structural parameters like the camera pose, lens\ndistortions, point positions and features, and a neural environment map, but\nalso photometric parameters like camera response function, vignetting, and\nper-image exposure and white balance. Because our pipeline includes photometric\nparameters, e.g.~exposure and camera response function, our system can smoothly\nhandle input images with varying exposure and white balance, and generates\nhigh-dynamic range output. We show that due to the improved input, we can\nachieve high render quality, also for difficult input, e.g. with imperfect\ncamera calibrations, inaccurate proxy geometry, or varying exposure. As a\nresult, a simpler and thus faster deep neural network is sufficient for\nreconstruction. In combination with the fast point rasterization, ADOP achieves\nreal-time rendering rates even for models with well over 100M points.\nhttps://github.com/darglein/ADOP\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 19:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 08:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Then, a docking\nprocess in a short distance is achieved with an accurate point cloud plane\ndetection method and a novel manipulator design. On the planning side, we\nformulate the robot's motion planning under a nonlinear model predictive\ncontrol framework with control barrier functions to improve obstacle avoidance\ncapabilities while maintaining the target in the sensors' field of view at\nclose distances. We demonstrate our design and framework by deploying the\nsystem on actual trolley collection tasks, and their effectiveness and\nrobustness are experimentally validated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 11:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 09:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

The framework\nleverages tools from stochastic geometry to derive analytical models that\nformulate a parametric uplink coverage problem which also includes user traffic\ndemand as an input. This allows operators to devise uplink expansion strategies\nto cater for expanding user demand. The framework demonstrates that fine-tuning\nof these parameters can significantly enhance the network capacity.

However, can exception handlers work securely in user enclaves,\nsuch as those enabled by Intel SGX, where the OS is not trusted by the enclave\ncode?\n  In this paper, we introduce a new attack called SmashEx which exploits the\nOS-enclave interface for asynchronous exceptions in SGX.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, DeepVecFont,\nto effectively resolve this problem. Using our method, for the first time,\nvisually-pleasing vector glyphs whose quality and compactness are both\ncomparable to human-designed ones can be automatically generated. The key idea\nof our DeepVecFont is to adopt the techniques of image synthesis, sequence\nmodeling and differentiable rasterization to exhaustively exploit the\ndual-modality information (i.e., raster images and vector outlines) of vector\nfonts. The highlights of this paper are threefold. First, we design a\ndual-modality learning strategy which utilizes both image-aspect and\nsequence-aspect features of fonts to synthesize vector glyphs. Second, we\nprovide a new generative paradigm to handle unstructured data (e.g., vector\nglyphs) by randomly sampling plausible synthesis results to get the optimal one\nwhich is further refined under the guidance of generated structured data (e.g.,\nglyph images). Finally, qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a\npublicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality\nsynthesis results in the applications of vector font generation and\ninterpolation, significantly outperforming the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 12:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

With the evolution of complex surfaces, quantification and prediction\nof these forces become intricate. Nevertheless, understanding these forces is\nhighly relevant for explaining liquid transport in nature and establishing\ndesign guidelines for manmade interfaces. Here, it is shown that the adhesion\nof droplets is highly sensitive to the directionality of chemical\nheterogeneities. Asymmetric biphilic surfaces, with hydrophilic triangular\npatches and superhydrophobic surrounding, impose direction-dependent adhesion.\nThis dependency is quantified by bending beam experiments, in which a droplet\nis dragged on the surface in two opposite directions. In addition, force\ncalculation derived from droplet roll-off experiments reveal accordant trends.\nThe lower the aspect ratio, the higher the difference of adhesion forces\nbetween the two directions. The shape of the fluid contact line on the biphilic\nsurfaces elucidates the origin of the direction-dependent adhesion. Namely, the\ndroplet receding part pins to a higher number of patches when moving toward to\napex in comparison to the opposite direction. When the triangular patches are\nmore slender, this asymmetry cancels. These findings improve the understanding\nof droplet adhesion to biphilic surfaces particularly, and surfaces with\nwetting heterogeneities in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

Similar cycles\nare found in other stars as well, but their details are not known to a similar\ndegree. Characterising stellar magnetic cycles is important for the\nunderstanding of the stellar and solar dynamos that are driving the magnetic\nactivity. We present spectropolarimetric observations of five young, solar-type\nstars, and compare them to previous observations, with the aim to identify and\ncharacterise stellar equivalents of the solar cycle. We use Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging (ZDI) to map the surface magnetic field and brightness of our targets.\nThe magnetic field is decomposed into spherical harmonic expansions, from which\nwe report the strengths of the axisymmetric vs. non-axisymmetric, and poloidal\nvs. toroidal components, and compare them to the Rossby numbers of the stars.\nWe present five new ZDI-maps of young, solar-type stars from Dec 2017. Of\nspecial interest is the case of V1358 Ori, that has gone through a polarity\nreversal between our observations and earlier ones. A less evident polarity\nreversal might also have occurred in HD 35296. There is a preference for more\naxisymmetric field, and possibly more toroidal field, for the more active stars\nwith lower Rossby number, but a larger sample should be studied to draw any\nstrong conclusions from this. For most of the individual stars, the amounts of\ntoroidal and poloidal field have stayed on similar levels as in earlier\nobservations.

Skewness may provide energy\nfor the excitation of electromagnetic instabilities, such as the whistler\nheat-flux instability (WHFI), that may play an important role in regulating the\nelectron heat-flux in the solar wind. Here we use kinetic theory to analyze the\nstability of the WHFI in a solar-wind-like plasma where solar wind core, halo\nand strahl electrons are described as a superposition of two distributions: a\nMaxwellian core, and another population modeled by a Kappa distribution to\nwhich an asymmetry term has been added, representing the halo and also the\nstrahl. Considering distributions with small skewness we solve the dispersion\nrelation for the parallel propagating whistler-mode and study its linear\nstability for different plasma parameters. Our results show that the WHFI can\ndevelop in this system, and provide stability thresholds for this instability,\nas a function of the electron beta and the parallel electron heat-flux, to be\ncompared with observational data. However, since different plasma states, with\ndifferent stability level to the WHFI, can have the same moment heat-flux\nvalue, it is the skewness (i.e. the asymmetry of the distribution along the\nmagnetic field), and not the heat-flux, the best indicator of instabilities.\nThus, systems with high heat-flux can be stable enough to WHFI, so that it is\nnot clear if the instability can effectively regulate the heat-flux values\nthrough wave-particle interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the\nparticles would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a\nneutralizing antibody can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated\nsubstrate. A prototype system consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope\nwas used to quantify particle attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of\nthis assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2\n{\\mu}g/ml. This is to be compared to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially\navailable kits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

Little research has\nbeen done to predict defects on the basis of the cognitive errors that cause\nthem. This paper proposes an approach to predicting software defects through\nknowledge about the cognitive mechanisms of human errors. Our theory is that\nthe main process behind a software defect is that an error-prone scenario\ntriggers human error modes, which psychologists have observed to recur across\ndiverse activities. Software defects can then be predicted by identifying such\nscenarios, guided by this knowledge of typical error modes. The proposed idea\nemphasizes predicting the exact location and form of a possible defect. We\nconducted two case studies to demonstrate and validate this approach, with 55\nprogrammers in a programming competition and 5 analysts serving as the users of\nthe approach. We found it impressive that the approach was able to predict, at\nthe requirement phase, the exact locations and forms of 7 out of the 22 (31.8%)\nspecific types of defects that were found in the code. The defects predicted\ntended to be common defects: their occurrences constituted 75.7% of the total\nnumber of defects in the 55 developed programs; each of them was introduced by\nat least two persons. The fraction of the defects introduced by a programmer\nthat were predicted was on average (over all programmers) 75%. Furthermore,\nthese predicted defects were highly persistent through the debugging process.\nIf the prediction had been used to successfully prevent these defects, this\ncould have saved 46.2% of the debugging iterations. This excellent capability\nof forecasting the exact locations and forms of possible defects at the early\nphases of software development recommends the approach for substantial benefits\nto defect prevention and early detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Today robots are used in a variety of\napplications. People and robots work together in human autonomous teams (HATs)\nto accomplish tasks that, separately, cannot be easily accomplished. Trust\nbetween robots and humans in HATs is vital to task completion and effective\nteam cohesion. For optimal performance and safety of human operators in HRI,\nhuman trust should be adjusted to the actual performance and reliability of the\nrobotic system. The cost of poor trust calibration in HRI, is at a minimum, low\nperformance, and at higher levels it causes human injury or critical task\nfailures. While the role of trust calibration is vital to team cohesion it is\nalso important for a robot to be able to assess whether or not a human is\nexhibiting signs of mistrust due to some other factor such as anger,\ndistraction or frustration. In these situations the robot chooses not to\ncalibrate trust, instead the robot chooses to respect trust. The decision to\nrespect trust is determined by the robots knowledge of whether or not a human\nshould trust the robot based on its actions(successes and failures) and its\nfeedback to the human. We show that the feedback in the form of trust\ncalibration cues(TCCs) can effectively change the trust level in humans.

Additionally,\nwe present a new Wasserstein adversarial attack that is projected gradient\ndescent based and which has a significantly reduced computational burden\ncompared to existing attack approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

This paper presents\nC-AllOut: a novel and effective outlier detector that annotates outliers by\ntype. It is parameter-free and scalable, besides working only with pairwise\nsimilarities (or distances) when it is needed. We show that C-AllOut achieves\non par or significantly better performance than state-of-the-art detectors when\nspotting outliers regardless of their type. It is also highly effective in\nannotating outliers of particular types, a task that none of the baselines can\nperform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

We apply and compare several methods of analysis and visualization,\nincluding eigenvalue analysis of the longitude-resolved covariances between the\nStokes parameters; longitude-resolved scatter plots of the normalised Stokes\nvectors in the Poincar\\'e sphere; auto- and cross-correlations between the\nStokes parameters as a function of offset in pulse longitude and lag in pulse\nnumber; and mean drift bands of polarization state, formed by averaging the\nStokes parameters and quantities derived from them synchronously with the\ndrifting sub-pulse modulation period.\n  Results. We observe regions of pulse longitude where the superposition of\northogonally polarised modes is best described as incoherent and regions where\nthe superposition appears to be at least partially coherent. Within the region\nof coherent superposition, over a range of pulse longitudes spanning $\\sim\n2\\circ$, the distribution of the Stokes polarization vectors forms a torus\ncentered near the origin of the Poincar\\'e sphere. Furthermore, the\npolarization vectors rotate about the axis of revolution of the torus\nsynchronously with the drifting sub-pulse modulation of the total intensity.\n  Conclusions. The nearly uniform circular modulation of polarization state,\nclearly evident in both the toroidal distribution of the Stokes polarization\nvectors and the mean drift bands of the Stokes parameters, is not predicted by\ncurrent theoretical models of pulsar emission.
