After harvesting energy and decoding\nmessages simultaneously via a power splitting scheme, the energy-limited relay\nnode forwards the decoded information to both terminals. Each terminal combines\nthe signals from the direct and relaying links via selection combining. We\nderive the system outage probability under independent but non-identically\ndistributed Nakagami-m fading channels.

Furthermore, we derive\nthe diversity gain of the considered network. The result reveals that when the\ntransmission rate is below the OSC threshold, the achieved diversity gain\nequals the sum of the shape parameter of the direct link and the smaller shape\nparameter of the terminal-to-relay links; otherwise, the diversity gain is\nzero. This is different from the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy, under which\nthe relaying links have no contribution to the diversity gain.

The spy and the guards\nmay occupy the same vertices. The spy wins if she reaches a vertex at distance\nmore than the surveilling distance $d$ from every guard. This game was\nintroduced by Cohen et al. in 2016 and is related to two well-studied games:\nCops and robber game and Eternal Dominating game. The guard number\n$gn_{s,d}(G)$ is the minimum number of guards such that the guards have a\nwinning strategy (of controlling the spy) in the graph $G$. In 2018, it was\nproved that deciding if the spy has a winning strategy is NP-hard for every\nspeed $s\\geq 2$ and distance $d\\geq 0$. In this paper, we initiate the\ninvestigation of the guard number in grids and in graph products. We obtain a\nstrict upper bound on the strong product of two general graphs and obtain\nexamples with King grids that match this bound and other examples for which the\nguard number is smaller. We also obtain the exact value of the guard number in\nthe lexicographical product of two general graphs for any distance $d\\geq 2$.\nFrom the algorithmic point of view, we prove a positive result: if the number\n$k$ of guards is fixed, the spy game is solvable in polynomial XP time\n$O(n^{3k+2})$ for every speed $s\\geq 2$ and distance $d\\geq 0$. In other words,\nthe spy game is XP when parameterized by the number of guards. This XP\nalgorithm is used to obtain an FPT algorithm on the $P_4$-fewness of the graph.\nAs a negative result, we prove that the spy game is W[2]-hard even in bipartite\ngraphs when parameterized by the number of guards, for every speed $s\\geq 2$\nand distance $d\\geq 0$, extending the hardness result of Cohen et al. in 2018.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 19:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Regardless of the division of collocations, it is difficult to\nclaim that any synoptic assessment can be based on independent observations.\nInstead, a measurement model that departs from ordinary linear regression by\naccommodating error correlation is proposed. The interpretation of independence\nis explored by applying Fuller's (1987) concept of equation and measurement\nerror to a division of error into shared (correlated) and unshared\n(uncorrelated) components, respectively. The resulting division of variance in\nthe new model favours noise. Ocean current shared (equation) error is of\ncomparable magnitude to unshared (measurement) error and the latter is, for\nGlobCurrent and drifters respectively, comparable to ordinary and reverse\nlinear regression. Although signal variance appears to be small, its utility as\na measure of agreement between two variates is highlighted.\n  Sparse collocations that sample a dense grid permit a first order\nautoregressive form of measurement model to be considered, including\nparameterizations of analysis-in situ error cross-correlation and analysis\ntemporal error autocorrelation.

The social media image filters studied either\nmodify the image contrast or illumination or occlude parts of the face with for\nexample artificial glasses or animal noses. We observe that the effect of some\nof these filters is harmful both to face detection and identity recognition,\nspecially if they obfuscate the eye or (to a lesser extent) the nose. To\ncounteract such effect, we develop a method to reconstruct the applied\nmanipulation with a modified version of the U-NET segmentation network. This is\nobserved to contribute to a better face detection and recognition accuracy.\nFrom a recognition perspective, we employ distance measures and trained machine\nlearning algorithms applied to features extracted using a ResNet-34 network\ntrained to recognize faces. We also evaluate if incorporating filtered images\nto the training set of machine learning approaches are beneficial for identity\nrecognition. Our results show good recognition when filters do not occlude\nimportant landmarks, specially the eyes (identification accuracy >99%, EER<2%).\nThe combined effect of the proposed approaches also allow to mitigate the\neffect produced by filters that occlude parts of the face, achieving an\nidentification accuracy of >92% with the majority of perturbations evaluated,\nand an EER <8%.

This effective SIR model\nshows a reduced population number and a constant $\\beta$ parameter. The effects\nof also including the retardation between recovery and infection process is\nalso considered. Next, it is shown that any solution of the effective SIR also\nsolves the linear problem to which the SIR equations reduce when the total\npopulation is much larger than the number of the infected cases.

The current state\nof the art uses generic reversible simulation through Bennett's pebble game and\nuniversal reversible gate sets such as the Toffoli. Using measurement-based\nuncomputation, we replace many of the ancilla qubits used by existing\nconstructions with classical control bits, which are cheaper. Our pebble game\nforms a natural framework for reasoning about measurement-based uncomputation,\nand we prove tight bounds on the time complexity of all algorithms that use our\npebble game.

Under the null hypothesis that the observed\nnon-repeating FRBs are originated from the mergers of Earth-mass primordial\nblack holes, we analyzed four independent samples of non-repeating FRBs to\nstudy the model parameters i.e. the typical charge value $q_{\\rm{c}}$ and the\npower index $\\alpha$ of the charge distribution function of the primordial\nblack hole population $\\phi(q) \\propto (q/q_{\\rm{c}})^{-\\alpha}$ which describe\nhow the charge was distributed in the population. $q$ is the charge of\n  the hole in the unit of $\\sqrt{G} M$, where $M$ is the mass of the hole.

By\ncontrolling the array lattice constants with sub-nm precision, we demonstrate\ntuning of the hopping amplitude and long-range interactions and observe the\nfinite-size analogue of a transition from Mott insulating to metallic behavior\nin the array. By increasing the measurement temperature, we simulate the effect\nof thermally activated hopping and Hubbard band formation in transport\nspectroscopy. We compare the analog quantum simulations with numerically\nsimulated results to help understand the energy spectrum and resonant tunneling\nwithin the array. The results demonstrated in this study serve as a launching\npoint for a new class of engineered artificial lattices to simulate the\nextended Fermi-Hubbard model of strongly correlated materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 02:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Hand-crafted audio features such as MFCCs or\nchromagrams are often used to elicit these patterns. However, with more\nannotations of section labels (e.g., verse, chorus, and bridge) becoming\navailable, one can use supervised feature learning to make these patterns even\nclearer and improve MSA performance.

Since the presentation of the\nspecial theory of relativity, it has been commonly accepted that a famous\nformula E = mc^2 = m_0c^2 /(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) expresses the energy of a free\nparticle only. However, while studying the experiment for the annihilation of\nparticle and antiparticle and the production of the photon in terms of the law\nof energy conservation of particle and field, we obtain a conclusion that E\nincludes not only the energy of a free particle but also the energy of its self\n-fields (electromagnetic field and gravitational field). Hence, a formula for\nthe energy in the special theory of relativity comes to have a more inclusive\nmeaning than Einstein had thought of it. Based upon such an idea and the\ncorrespondence principle, through introducing a new non-Euclidean\nfour-dimensional space, so-called KR space in which the metric is the function\nof coordinates and 4-velocity, we reformulate the action function to be a\nfunction defined in the nonlinear version and from it find equation system for\na charge and the field with a modified version, which is reduced to that in the\nMaxwell theory under the weak field condition: here, weak field condition is\ngiven by |U/m_0c^2|<<1, U; interactional energy. With the equation system, we\nshow that the divergence problem arising from the Maxwell theory, without\ninvoking renormalization, is very naturally solved by sensible mathematics and\nthen demonstrate that the total energy of a free charge and its field equals\nmc^2 and so the energy of an electrostatic field leads to the finite. In this\ncourse are derived the modified version of Coulomb potential and of radiation\nreaction without renormalization which contains an interference effect (a\nnonlinear effect that does not obey LSP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 03:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

This study\ndescribes a method for target source extraction, called the\nsimilarity-and-independence-aware beamformer (SIBF). The SIBF extracts the\ntarget source using a rough magnitude spectrogram as the reference signal. The\nadvantage of the SIBF is that it can obtain a more accurate signal than the\nspectrogram generated by target-enhancing methods such as speech enhancement\nbased on deep neural networks. For the extraction, we extend the framework of\ndeflationary independent component analysis (ICA) by considering the\nsimilarities between the reference and extracted target sources, in addition to\nthe mutual independence of all the potential sources. To solve the extraction\nproblem by maximum-likelihood estimation, we introduce three source models that\ncan reflect the similarities. The major contributions of this study are as\nfollows. First, the extraction performance is improved using two methods,\nnamely boost start for faster convergence and iterative casting for generating\na more accurate reference. The effectiveness of these methods is verified\nthrough experiments using the CHiME3 dataset. Second, a concept of a fixed\npoint pertaining to accuracy is developed.

The proposed FDTD subgridding method is accurate, efficient, easy to\nimplement and be integrated into the existing FDTD codes with only simple\nmodifications. At last, three numerical examples with fine structures are\ncarried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 06:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

To this end, we propose to boost the\ntransferability of video adversarial examples for black-box attacks on video\nrecognition models. Through extensive analysis, we discover that different\nvideo recognition models rely on different discriminative temporal patterns,\nleading to the poor transferability of video adversarial examples. This\nmotivates us to introduce a temporal translation attack method, which optimizes\nthe adversarial perturbations over a set of temporal translated video clips. By\ngenerating adversarial examples over translated videos, the resulting\nadversarial examples are less sensitive to temporal patterns existed in the\nwhite-box model being attacked and thus can be better transferred. Extensive\nexperiments on the Kinetics-400 dataset and the UCF-101 dataset demonstrate\nthat our method can significantly boost the transferability of video\nadversarial examples. For transfer-based attack against video recognition\nmodels, it achieves a 61.56% average attack success rate on the Kinetics-400\nand 48.60% on the UCF-101.

The aim is to build up a greedy-like heuristic able to learn on\nsome distribution of JSSP instances, different in the number of jobs and\nmachines. The need for fast scheduling methods is well known, and it arises in\nmany areas, from transportation to healthcare. We model the JSSP as a Markov\nDecision Process and then we exploit the efficacy of reinforcement learning to\nsolve the problem. We adopt an actor-critic scheme, where the action taken by\nthe agent is influenced by policy considerations on the state-value function.\nThe procedures are adapted to take into account the challenging nature of JSSP,\nwhere the state and the action space change not only for every instance but\nalso after each decision. To tackle the variability in the number of jobs and\noperations in the input, we modeled the agent using two incident LSTM models, a\nspecial type of deep neural network.

As these planets orbit close to their stars, they often present strong\nthermal and chemical hetereogeneities between the day and the night side of\ntheir atmosphere. For the hottest ones, the thermal dissociation of several\nspecies occurs in their atmospheres which leads to a stronger chemical\ndichotomy between the two hemispheres. It has already been shown that the\ncurrent retrieval algorithms, which are using 1D forward models, find biased\nmolecular abundances in ultra hot Jupiters. Here, we quantify the effective\ntemperature domain over which these biases are present. We use a set of 12\nsimulations of typical Hot Jupiters from Teq = 1000 K to Teq = 2100 K performed\nwith the Substellar and Planetary Atmospheric Radiation and Circulation global\nclimate model and generate transmission spectra that fully account for the 3D\nstructure of the atmosphere with Pytmosph3R. These spectra are then analyzed\nusing the 1D TauREx retrieval code. We find that for JWST-like data, accounting\nfor non-isothermal vertical temperature profiles is required over the whole\ntemperature range. We further find that 1D retrieval codes start to estimate\nwrong parameter values for planets with equilibrium temperatures greater than\n1400 K if there are absorbers in the visible able to create a hot stratosphere.\nThe high temperatures at low pressures indeed entail a thermal dissociation of\nspecies which creates a strong chemical day-night dichotomy. As a by-product,\nwe demonstrate that when using synthetic observations to assess the\ndetectability of a given feature or process using a Bayesian framework, it is\nvalid to use non-randomized input data, as long as the anticipated\nobservational uncertainties are correctly taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

To understand the impact the damage has on CCDs and how it\nvaries with their thermal history a proton radiation campaign has been carried\nout using a CCD280. The CCD is irradiated at 153 K and gradually warmed to 188\nK in 5 K increments with Fe55 X-ray, dark current and trap pumping images taken\nat 153 K after each anneal step.\n  The results show that despite the trap landscape changing throughout the\nanneal it has little impact on parallel charge transfer inefficiency. This is\nthought to be because most traps are unaffected and a lot of those that do\nanneal only move from the continuum between distinct trap species and into a\nnearby divacancy trap 'peak' whose emission time constant is similar enough to\nstill impact the CTI.\n  In terms of using a CCD280 or similar devices in a mission the CTI being\nunaffected by thermal annealing up to 188 K means that any CTI correction\nneeded as the radiation damage builds up does not have to take into account the\nthermal history of the focal plane.

For this, our\narticle mobilizes a public-private partnerships approach (PPPs) and the\nresource-based view theory. These perspectives emphasize the complementary role\nof disciplinary and incentive mechanisms as well as the exchange of specific\nresources as levers for value creation. Moreover, these orientations crossed\nwith the perspective of a hybrid form of co-investment allow us to build a\ncoherent and explanatory framework of the mixed syndication phenomenon. Our\nmethodology is based on a qualitative approach with an interpretative aim,\nwhich includes twenty-seven semi-structured interviews.

The results\nsuggest that the relationships between public and private Venture capitalists\n(VCs) of a formal or informal nature, more specifically in a syndication\ncontext, at a national or regional level, are representative of an\n''economico-cognitive'' (Farrugia, 2014, page 6) approach to networking and\ninnovation. Moreover, the phenomenon of mixed syndication reveals a context of\nhybridization of public and private actors that would allow the private VCs to\nbenefit from the distribution of wealth when the company develops its\ninnovation. We can also identify a process related to a quest for legitimacy on\nthe part of the public actor characterized by its controlling role within the\npublic-private partnership (Beuve and Saussier, 2019).

Vibrational test-ing such as Process Compensated\nResonance Testing (PCRT) has shown an efficient approach, which first measures\nthe vibrational response of the turbine blades, and then employs a classifier\nto determine if the quality of the turbine blades are good or bad. Our previous\nwork mainly concentrated on the development of Mahalanobis distance-based\nclassifiers which are fed by the measured vibrational features (such as\nresonant frequencies). In practice, however, measurement errors could lead to a\nbiased trained classifier, potentially resulting in the wrong quality\nclassifications of the turbine blade. In this study, we investigate the\nclassification problem of turbine blades under measurement uncertainty. For\nthis, the concept of Interval Mahalanobis Space is employed, leading to the\nIntegrated Interval Mahalanobis Classification system (IIMCS) classifier which\nhas high robustness against measurement uncertainty. The IIMCS employs Binary\nParticle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) to filter out those resonant frequencies\nwhich contrib-ute most to the information in the system. A Monte Carlo\nSimulation scheme is employed to analyze the sensitivity of the resonant\nfrequencies to the measurement uncertainty.

Solutions to this inverse and ill-posed problem\ntypically involve a search for models that best explain observed image data.\nNotably, images depend both on the properties of observed scenes and on the\nprocess of image formation. Hence, if optimization techniques should be used to\nexplain images, it is crucial to design differentiable functions for the\nprojection of 3D scenes into images, also known as differentiable rendering.\nPrevious approaches to differentiable rendering typically replace\nnon-differentiable operations by smooth approximations, impacting the\nsubsequent 3D estimation. In this paper, we take a more general approach and\nstudy differentiable renderers through the prism of randomized optimization and\nthe related notion of perturbed optimizers. In particular, our work highlights\nthe link between some well-known differentiable renderer formulations and\nrandomly smoothed optimizers, and introduces differentiable perturbed\nrenderers. We also propose a variance reduction mechanism to alleviate the\ncomputational burden inherent to perturbed optimizers and introduce an adaptive\nscheme to automatically adjust the smoothing parameters of the rendering\nprocess. We apply our method to 3D scene reconstruction and demonstrate its\nadvantages on the tasks of 6D pose estimation and 3D mesh reconstruction. By\nproviding informative gradients that can be used as a strong supervisory\nsignal, we demonstrate the benefits of perturbed renderers to obtain more\naccurate solutions when compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives using\nsmooth gradient approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on asymmetric\nmodality translation for face presentation attack detection in bi-modality\nscenarios. Under the framework, we establish connections between two modality\nimages of genuine faces. Specifically, a novel modality fusion scheme is\npresented that the image of one modality is translated to the other one through\nan asymmetric modality translator, then fused with its corresponding paired\nimage. The fusion result is fed as the input to a discriminator for inference.\nThe training of the translator is supervised by an asymmetric modality\ntranslation loss.

In this paper, we propose an\noverall scheme of the downlink multi-user OAM (MU-OAM) wireless backhaul based\non uniform circular arrays (UCAs) for broadcasting networks, which can achieve\nthe joint spatial division and coaxial multiplexing (JSDCM). A salient feature\nof the proposed downlink MU-OAM wireless backhaul systems is that the channel\nmatrices are completely characterized by the position of each small base\nstation (SBS), independent of the numbers of subcarriers and antennas, which\navoids estimating large channel matrices required by the traditional downlink\nmulti-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless backhaul systems.\nThereafter, we propose an OAM-based multiuser distance and angle of arrival\n(AoA) estimation method, which is able to simultaneously estimate the positions\nof multiple SBSs with a flexible number of training symbols. With the estimated\ndistances and AoAs, a MU-OAM preprocessing scheme is applied to eliminate the\nco-mode and inter-mode interferences in the downlink MU-OAM channel. At last,\nthe proposed methods are extended to the downlink MU-OAM-MIMO wireless backhaul\nsystem equipped with uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs), for which much\nhigher spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) than traditional\nMU-MIMO systems can be achieved.

Viewing each set as a distribution over a set of global\nprototypes, this paper provides a novel prototype-oriented optimal transport\n(POT) framework to improve existing summary networks. To learn the distribution\nover the global prototypes, we minimize its regularized optimal transport\ndistance to the set empirical distribution over data points, providing a\nnatural unsupervised way to improve the summary network. Since our\nplug-and-play framework can be applied to many meta-learning problems, we\nfurther instantiate it to the cases of few-shot classification and implicit\nmeta generative modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework\nsignificantly improves the existing summary networks on learning more powerful\nsummary statistics from sets and can be successfully integrated into\nmetric-based few-shot classification and generative modeling applications,\nproviding a promising tool for addressing set-input and meta-learning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 09:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 08:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Despite significant advancements, however,\nperformance scaling remains the Achilles' heel of this field. A key idea used\nin modern counters is to count models projected on an \\emph{independent\nsupport} that is often a small subset of the projection set, i.e. original set\nof variables on which we wanted to project. While this idea has been effective\nin scaling performance, the question of whether it can benefit to count models\nprojected on variables beyond the projection set, has not been explored. In\nthis paper, we study this question and show that contrary to intuition, it can\nbe beneficial to project on variables beyond the projection set. In\napplications such as verification of binarized neural networks, quantification\nof information flow, reliability of power grids etc., a good upper bound of the\nprojected model count often suffices. We show that in several such cases, we\ncan identify a set of variables, called upper bound support (UBS), that is not\nnecessarily a subset of the projection set, and yet counting models projected\non UBS guarantees an upper bound of the true projected model count.\nTheoretically, a UBS can be exponentially smaller than the smallest independent\nsupport. Our experiments show that even otherwise, UBS-based projected counting\ncan be more efficient than independent support-based projected counting, while\nyielding bounds of very high quality. Based on extensive experiments, we find\nthat UBS-based projected counting can solve many problem instances that are\nbeyond the reach of a state-of-the-art independent support-based projected\nmodel counter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

In\nthis paper, we introduce Sub-bit Neural Networks (SNNs), a new type of binary\nquantization design tailored to compress and accelerate BNNs. SNNs are inspired\nby an empirical observation, showing that binary kernels learnt at\nconvolutional layers of a BNN model are likely to be distributed over kernel\nsubsets. As a result, unlike existing methods that binarize weights one by one,\nSNNs are trained with a kernel-aware optimization framework, which exploits\nbinary quantization in the fine-grained convolutional kernel space.\nSpecifically, our method includes a random sampling step generating\nlayer-specific subsets of the kernel space, and a refinement step learning to\nadjust these subsets of binary kernels via optimization. Experiments on visual\nrecognition benchmarks and the hardware deployment on FPGA validate the great\npotentials of SNNs. For instance, on ImageNet, SNNs of ResNet-18/ResNet-34 with\n0.56-bit weights achieve 3.13/3.33 times runtime speed-up and 1.8 times\ncompression over conventional BNNs with moderate drops in recognition accuracy.\nPromising results are also obtained when applying SNNs to binarize both weights\nand activations.

The constitutive relations are based on\nTaylor's dislocation model, which enables gaining insights into the role of the\nincreased dislocation density associated with large gradients in plastic strain\nnear cracks. The material model is implemented in a commercial finite element\n(FE) software package using a user subroutine, and the nonlinear stress\nintensity factors (SIF) are evaluated as a function of the intrinsic material\nlength, characterising the scale at which gradient effects become significant.\nAs a result of the FE calculations of dislocation density distributions, the\neffects of both the fracture mode and the stress-strain state are determined.\nIn pure mode I, the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density is\nlocated symmetrically with respect to the blunted crack tip.

More precisely, this method first combines the\nobjective function of traditional thresholding algorithms to design\ncomprehensive objective functions then uses multi-objective optimizers to find\nthe best thresholds during the optimization of designed objective functions.\nAlso, our method uses a vector objective function in 3D space that could\nsimultaneously handle the segmentation of entire image color channels with the\nsame thresholds. To optimize this vector objective function, we employ\nmultiobjective swarm optimizers that can optimize multiple objective functions\nat the same time. Therefore, our method considers dependencies between channels\nto find the thresholds that satisfy objective functions of color channels\n(which we name as vector objective function) simultaneously. Segmenting entire\ncolor channels with the same thresholds also benefits from the fact that our\nproposed method needs fewer thresholds to segment the image than other\nthresholding algorithms; thus, it requires less memory space to save\nthresholds. It helps a lot when we want to segment many images to many regions.\nThe subjective and objective results show the superiority of this method to\ntraditional thresholding methods that separately threshold histograms of a\ncolor image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

This is a barrier to utilize RL for ONRA as on one hand, it is not\npractical to train the RL agent offline due to lack of information about future\nrequests, and on the other hand, online training in the real network leads to\nsignificant performance loss because of the sub-optimal policy during the\nprolonged learning time.

However, DNNs often need big amounts of data and\nannotations for training, both of which can be difficult and costly to obtain.\nIn this work, we propose a unified framework for generalized low-shot (one- and\nfew-shot) medical image segmentation based on distance metric learning (DML).\nUnlike most existing methods which only deal with the lack of annotations while\nassuming abundance of data, our framework works with extreme scarcity of both,\nwhich is ideal for rare diseases. Via DML, the framework learns a multimodal\nmixture representation for each category, and performs dense predictions based\non cosine distances between the pixels' deep embeddings and the category\nrepresentations. The multimodal representations effectively utilize the\ninter-subject similarities and intraclass variations to overcome overfitting\ndue to extremely limited data. In addition, we propose adaptive mixing\ncoefficients for the multimodal mixture distributions to adaptively emphasize\nthe modes better suited to the current input. The representations are\nimplicitly embedded as weights of the fc layer, such that the cosine distances\ncan be computed efficiently via forward propagation.

Planet--planet occultations (PPOs), which can occur in\nmultiple transiting systems, are one intuitive example. While the presence of\nPPOs constrains the orbital alignment, the absence at first glance does not.\nPlanetary systems, for which the measurement of orbital obliquities with\nconventional techniques remains elusive, call for new methods whereby at least\nsome information on the alignments can be obtained. Here we develop a method\nthat uses photometric data to gain this kind of information from multi-transit\nevents. In our approach we synthesize multi-transit light curves of the\nexoplanets in question via the construction of a grid of projected orbital tilt\nangles $\\alpha$, while keeping all transit parameters constant. These model\nlight curves contain PPOs for some values of $\\alpha$. To compute the model\nlight curves, we use the 3D animation software Blender for our transit\nsimulations, which allows the use of arbitrary surface brightness distributions\nof the star, such as limb darkening from model atmospheres. The resulting model\nlight curves are then compared to actual measurements. We present a detailed\nstudy of the multi-transiting planetary system Kepler-20, including parameter\nfits of the transiting planets and an analysis of the stellar activity. We\napply our method to Kepler-20 b and c, where we are able to exclude some\norbital geometries, and find a tendency of these planets to eclipse in front of\ndifferent stellar hemispheres in a prograde direction.

Formal methods are\nmathematically-based techniques for the specification and development of\nsoftware, which can provide proofs of properties and exhaustive checks over a\nsystem's state space. In this paper, we present a formal requirements-driven\nmethodology, applied to a model of an aircraft engine controller that has been\nprovided by our industrial partner. Our methodology begins by formalising the\ncontroller's natural-language requirements using the (pre-existing) Formal\nRequirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), iteratively, in consultation with our\nindustry partner. Once formalised, FRET can automatically translate the\nrequirements to enable their verification alongside a Simulink model of the\naircraft engine controller; the requirements can also guide formal verification\nusing other approaches. These two parallel streams in our methodology seek to\ncombine the results from formal requirements elicitation, classical\nverification approaches, and runtime verification; to support the verification\nof aerospace systems modelled in Simulink, from the requirements phase through\nto execution. Our methodology harnesses the power of formal methods in a way\nthat complements existing verification techniques, and supports the\ntraceability of requirements throughout the verification process. This\nmethodology streamlines the process of developing verifiable aircraft engine\ncontrollers, by ensuring that the requirements are formalised up-front and\nuseable during development. In this paper we give an overview of (FRET),\ndescribe our methodology and work to-date on the formalisation and verification\nof the requirements, and outline future work using our methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 13:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

This is\nsuggested by the fact that if one assumes a phase space to be a poly-Jacobi\nmanifold, the observables -- which are the dimensioned analogue of real-valued\nfunctions -- carry a natural partial addition and total multiplication\nstructure identical to the usual algebra of physical quantities in dimensional\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 13:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

While\nlegacy TE management planes have proven laborious to deploy, Segment Routing\n(SR) drastically eases the deployment of TE paths and is thus increasingly\nadopted by Internet Service Providers (ISP). There is a clear need in computing\nand deploying Delay-Constrained Least-Cost paths (DCLC) with SR for real-time\ninteractive services. However, most current DCLC solutions are not tailored for\nSR. They also often lack efficiency or guarantees. Similarly to approximation\nschemes, we argue that the challenge is to design an algorithm providing both\nperformances and guarantees. However, conversely to most of these schemes, we\nalso consider operational constraints to provide a practical, high-performance\nimplementation.\n  We leverage the inherent limitations of delay measurements and account for\nthe operational constraint added by SR to design a new algorithm, best2cop,\nproviding guarantees and performance in all cases. Best2cop outperforms a\nstate-of-the-art algorithm on both random and real networks of up to 1000\nnodes. Relying on commodity hardware with a single thread, our algorithm\nretrieves all non-superfluous 3-dimensional routes in only 250ms and 100ms\nrespectively. This execution time is further reduced using multiple threads, as\nthe design of best2cop enables a speedup almost linear in the number of cores.\nFinally, we extend best2cop to deal with massive scale ISP by leveraging the\nmulti-area partitioning of these deployments.

Previous algorithms are\nmainly based on greedy or local search. In this paper, we propose to\nreformulate the result diversification problem as a bi-objective maximization\nproblem, and solve it by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (EA), i.e.,\nthe GSEMO. We theoretically prove that the GSEMO can achieve the\n(asymptotically) optimal theoretical guarantees under both static and dynamic\nenvironments. For cardinality constraints, the GSEMO can achieve the optimal\npolynomial-time approximation ratio, $1/2$. For more general matroid\nconstraints, the GSEMO can achieve an asymptotically optimal polynomial-time\napproximation ratio, $1/2-\\epsilon/(4n)$, where $\\epsilon>0$ and $n$ is the\nsize of the ground set of items. Furthermore, when the objective function\n(i.e., a linear combination of quality and diversity) changes dynamically, the\nGSEMO can maintain this approximation ratio in polynomial running time,\naddressing the open question proposed by Borodin.

All of such practical applications require that humans\nand robots collaborate in human environments, where social interaction is\nunavoidable. Along with verbal communication, successful social interaction is\nclosely coupled with the interplay between nonverbal perception and action\nmechanisms, such as observation of gaze behaviour and following their\nattention, coordinating the form and function of hand gestures. Humans perform\nnonverbal communication in an instinctive and adaptive manner, with no effort.\nFor robots to be successful in our social landscape, they should therefore\nengage in social interactions in a humanlike way, with increasing levels of\nautonomy. In particular, nonverbal gestures are expected to endow social robots\nwith the capability of emphasizing their speech, or showing their intentions.\nMotivated by this, our research sheds a light on modeling human behaviors in\nsocial interactions, specifically, forecasting human nonverbal social signals\nduring dyadic interactions, with an overarching goal of developing robotic\ninterfaces that can learn to imitate human dyadic interactions. Such an\napproach will ensure the messages encoded in the robot gestures could be\nperceived by interacting partners in a facile and transparent manner, which\ncould help improve the interacting partner perception and makes the social\ninteraction outcomes enhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 15:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Our key insight is to disentangle features in the latent space\nwhile jointly learning both domain-invariant and domain-specific features in a\nunified framework. The domain-specific representation is optimized through the\nmeta-learning framework to adapt from source domains, targeting a robust\ngeneralization on unseen domains. We empirically show that mDSDI provides\ncompetitive results with state-of-the-art techniques in DG. A further ablation\nstudy with our generated dataset, Background-Colored-MNIST, confirms the\nhypothesis that domain-specific is essential, leading to better results when\ncompared with only using domain-invariant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 15:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Importantly, standard\nattention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this\nwork, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially:\n(a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder\ngeneralization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention\nmechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head\nstructure.

Recently, adversarial methods have been\nproved to effectively remove sensitive information from the latent\nrepresentation of neural networks.

However, the interpretation\nof causal connectivity remains to be fully clarified, in particular, how causal\nconnectivity depends on causality measures and how causal connectivity relates\nto structural connectivity. Here, we focus on nonlinear networks with pulse\nsignals as measured output, $e.g.$, neural networks with spike output, and\naddress the above issues based on four intensively utilized causality measures,\n$i.e.$, time-delayed correlation, time-delayed mutual information, Granger\ncausality, and transfer entropy.

Taking the\nsimulated Hodgkin-Huxley neural network and the real mouse brain network as two\nillustrative examples, we further verify the quantitative relations among the\nfour causality measures and demonstrate that the causal connectivity inferred\nby any of the four well coincides with the underlying network structural\nconnectivity, therefore establishing a direct link between the causal and\nstructural connectivity.

Optimizing the GNN computational graph suffers from: (1)\nRedundant neural operator computation.

Efficient thread mapping schemes for\nvertex-centric and edge-centric operators are different. This inconsistency\nprohibits operator fusion to reduce memory IO. (3) Excessive intermediate data.\nFor GNN training which is usually performed concurrently with inference,\nintermediate data must be stored for the backward pass, consuming 91.9% of the\ntotal memory requirement.

Typically,\npolynomial-based cancelers are employed to mitigate the SI; nevertheless, they\nsuffer from high complexity. This article proposes two novel hybrid-layers\nneural network (NN) architectures to cancel the SI with low complexity. The\nfirst architecture is referred to as hybrid-convolutional recurrent NN (HCRNN),\nwhereas the second is termed as hybrid-convolutional recurrent dense NN\n(HCRDNN). In contrast to the state-of-the-art NNs that employ dense or\nrecurrent layers for SI modeling, the proposed NNs exploit, in a novel manner,\na combination of different hidden layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent,\nand/or dense) in order to model the SI with lower computational complexity than\nthe polynomial and the state-of-the-art NN-based cancelers. The key idea behind\nusing hybrid layers is to build an NN model, which makes use of the\ncharacteristics of the different layers employed in its architecture. More\nspecifically, in the HCRNN, a convolutional layer is employed to extract the\ninput data features using a reduced network scale. Moreover, a recurrent layer\nis then applied to assist in learning the temporal behavior of the input signal\nfrom the localized feature map of the convolutional layer. In the HCRDNN, an\nadditional dense layer is exploited to add another degree of freedom for\nadapting the NN settings in order to achieve the best compromise between the\ncancellation performance and computational complexity.

Here, we formulate theoretically the geometric heat pump\neffect in macroscopic driven diffusive systems. Upon modulation protocols, the\nnontrivial geometric curvature in the parameter space universally induces an\nadditional pumped heat, beyond the constraint of hot-to-cold flowing.\nFurthermore, we set up a minimum experiment and indeed observe a non-vanishing\ndirectional heat flow across the driven system, despite keeping zero thermal\nbias between two time-dependent thermal reservoirs at every instant. We verify\nthat in analogy to the geometric phase effect, the geometric pumped heat during\neach driving cycle is independent of driving periods in the adiabatic limit and\ncoincides with theoretical predictions, thus validating its geometric origin.\nThese results about geometric heat pump effect could have potential\nimplications for designing and implementing nonreciprocal and topological\nthermal meta-devices under spatiotemporal modulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 16:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Resiliency must not increase the runtime, memory\nfootprint or I/O demands too significantly. We propose a task-based soft error\ndetection scheme that relies on error criteria per task outcome. They formalise\nhow ``dubious'' an outcome is, i.e. how likely it contains an error. Our whole\nsimulation is replicated once, forming two teams of MPI ranks that share their\ntask results. Thus, ideally each team handles only around half of the workload.\nIf a task yields large error criteria values, i.e.~is dubious, we compute the\ntask redundantly and compare the outcomes. Whenever they disagree, the task\nresult with a lower error likeliness is accepted. We obtain a self-healing,\nresilient algorithm which can compensate silent floating-point errors without a\nsignificant performance, I/O or memory footprint penalty. Case studies however\nsuggest that a careful, domain-specific tailoring of the error criteria remains\nessential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

It is\nmy hope that this acts as a crash course in $\\textit{fairness philosophy}$ for\nthe everyday computer scientist and specifically roboticist. This paper will\nconsider current state-of-the-art ideas in computer science, specifically\nalgorithmic fairness, as well as attempt to lay out a rough set of guidelines\nfor metric fairness.

Modeling an\neducation process of Massive open online courses (MOOCs) as a dynamic and\nmulti-agent process is one of the challenging tasks. In this paper, Petri net\nextensions are investigated in the context of the learnflow modeling. It is\nshown how a learnflow can be modeled with classical and Colored Petri nets.\nThese extensions facilitate modeling distributed and multi-agent processes.\nHowever, existing Petri net extensions do not provide the ability to model an\neducation process in the context of multi-course programs and adaptive\nlearning. We propose \\emph{Petri nets with reference data} (PNRDs) for modeling\ne-learning in MOOCs. PNRDs allow us to represent a model of the education\nprocess in a visual, clear and not overloaded form. Moreover, PNRDs enable us\nto display aspects of multi-course programs and dynamic changes in the MOOC\neducation process. We also show how PNRDs can be used to model online student\ncollaboration in project-based learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 09:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}
