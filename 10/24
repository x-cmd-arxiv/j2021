The active learning (AL) technique addresses this\nproblem by selecting valuable feedback candidates. However, mainstream AL\nmethods require an initial labeled set for a cold start and are often\ncomputationally complex to solve. Therefore, they cannot fully satisfy the\nrequirements for online RF in interactive INS tasks. To address this issue, we\npropose a confidence-aware active feedback method (CAAF) that is specifically\ndesigned for online RF in interactive INS tasks. Inspired by the explicit\ndifficulty modeling scheme in self-paced learning, CAAF utilizes a pairwise\nmanifold ranking loss to evaluate the ranking confidence of each unlabeled\nsample. The ranking confidence improves not only the interaction efficiency by\nindicating valuable feedback candidates but also the ranking quality by\nmodulating the diffusion weights in manifold ranking. In addition, we design\ntwo acceleration strategies, an approximate optimization scheme and a top-K\nsearch scheme, to reduce the computational complexity of CAAF. Extensive\nexperiments on both image INS tasks and video INS tasks searching for\nbuildings, landscapes, persons, and human behaviors demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, in the real-world, large-scale\nvideo INS task of NIST TRECVID 2021, CAAF uses 25% fewer feedback samples to\nachieve a performance that is nearly equivalent to the champion solution.\nMoreover, with the same number of feedback samples, CAAF's mAP is 51.9%,\nsignificantly surpassing the champion solution by 5.9%.

In this setup, each client's data is private\nto itself and is not transferable to other clients or the server. Though FL\nparadigm has received significant interest recently from the research\ncommunity, the problem of selecting the relevant clients w.r.t. the central\nserver's learning objective is under-explored. We refer to these problems as\nFederated Relevant Client Selection (FRCS). Because the server doesn't have\nexplicit control over the nature of data possessed by each client, the problem\nof selecting relevant clients is significantly complex in FL settings. In this\npaper, we resolve important and related FRCS problems viz., selecting clients\nwith relevant data, detecting clients that possess data relevant to a\nparticular target label, and rectifying corrupted data samples of individual\nclients. We follow a principled approach to address the above FRCS problems and\ndevelop a new federated learning method using the Shapley value concept from\ncooperative game theory. Towards this end, we propose a cooperative game\ninvolving the gradients shared by the clients. Using this game, we compute\nShapley values of clients and then present Shapley value based Federated\nAveraging (S-FedAvg) algorithm that empowers the server to select relevant\nclients with high probability. S-FedAvg turns out to be critical in designing\nspecific algorithms to address the FRCS problems. We finally conduct a thorough\nempirical analysis on image classification and speech recognition tasks to show\nthe superior performance of S-FedAvg than the baselines in the context of\nsupervised federated learning settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 16:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Moreover, because of the\nexistence of intrinsic vacancies, TiO demonstrates memristive properties. To\nuse these compounds in active region for memristive switching, the\ninvestigation of the dynamical stability of these compounds is of importance.\nTherefore, the structural, electronic, and dynamical properties of TiO in two\ndifferent phases, namely cubic and monoclinic structures along with vacancies,\nare debated from the framework of density functional theory. The structural\ncalculations show that the vacancies have quite an impact on the bulk modulus\nof these compounds. The electronic band structure remarks that these structures\nare metallic. In addition, there is an energy gap between O-2p and Ti-3d states\nin these compounds below the Fermi level that can be altered via vacancy\nconcentration. The phonon calculations reveal that monoclinic structure is\ndynamically stable whereas the cubic phase is unstable at room temperature.\nConsidering ~12.5% of both Ti and O vacancy concentration, eliminate the\nimaginary modes for the cubic structure. Moreover, the vacancy-free cubic\nstructure can be stable above ~ 10 GPa applied pressure, which is consistent\nwith the experiment. Additionally, phonon dispersion curves of TiOx compounds\nsuggest that these materials are not favorable for thermal conductivity.

In this thesis, we discuss new\ndevelopments in optimization inspired by the needs and practice of machine\nlearning, federated learning, and data science. In particular, we consider\nseven key challenges of mathematical optimization and develop a solution to\neach.\n  Our first contribution is the resolution of a key open problem in Federated\nLearning: we establish the first theoretical guarantees for the famous Local\nSGD algorithm in the heterogeneous data regime. As the second challenge, we\nclose the gap between the upper and lower bounds for the theory of two\nalgorithms known as Random Reshuffling (RR) and Shuffle-Once that are widely\nused in practice, and set as the default data selection strategies for SGD in\nmodern machine learning software. Our third contribution can be seen as a\ncombination of our new theory for proximal RR and Local SGD yielding a new\nalgorithm, which we call FedRR.

In\nparticular, we present the first parameter-free stepsize rule for gradient\ndescent that provably works for any locally smooth convex objective.

The situation is one in a layer which is heated from\nbelow and under appropriate conditions bimodal neutral curves are found. These\ndepend on the ratio ${\\hat d}$ of the depth $d$ of the fluid layer to the depth\n$d_m$ of the porous layer. We show that there is a critical value of ${\\hat d}$\nsuch that below this value convective motion initiates in the porous layer\nwhereas for ${\\hat d}$ above this value the convective instability commences in\nthe fluid layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 20:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Since human emotion\ninvolves a highly complex and abstract cognitive process, it is difficult to\ninfer visual emotions directly from holistic or regional features in affective\nimages. It has been demonstrated in psychology that visual emotions are evoked\nby the interactions between objects as well as the interactions between objects\nand scenes within an image. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Scene-Object\ninterreLated Visual Emotion Reasoning network (SOLVER) to predict emotions from\nimages. To mine the emotional relationships between distinct objects, we first\nbuild up an Emotion Graph based on semantic concepts and visual features. Then,\nwe conduct reasoning on the Emotion Graph using Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN), yielding emotion-enhanced object features.

First, a proportional-integral sliding mode controller\n(PI-SMC) is designed using a new switching surface and a proportional plus\npower rate reaching law. The PI-SMC is more robust than a feedback\nlinearization controller in the presence of mismatched uncertainties and\noutperforms the SMC schemes reported recently in the literature in terms of the\nconvergence rate and settling time. Next, to reduce the chattering phenomenon\nin the PI-SMC, a state feedback-based discrete-time SMC algorithm is developed.\nHowever, the disturbance rejection ability is compromised to some extent.\nFurthermore, to improve the robustness without compromising the chattering\nreduction benefits of the discrete-time SMC, mismatched uncertainties like\nsensor noise and track input disturbance are incorporated in a robust\ndiscrete-time SMC design using multirate output feedback (MROF). With this\ntechnique, it is possible to realize the effect of a full-state feedback\ncontroller without incurring the complexity of a dynamic controller or an\nadditional discrete-time observer. Also, the MROF-based discrete-time SMC\nstrategy can stabilize the magnetic levitation system with excellent dynamic\nand steady-state performance with superior robustness in the presence of\nmismatched uncertainties. The stability of the closed-loop system under the\nproposed controllers is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. The\nsimulation results and analytical comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed control schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 06:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Existing methods rely either\non optical flow regularization or fine-tuning with test data to attain temporal\nconsistency. However, optical flow is not always avail-able and reliable.\nBesides, it is expensive to compute. Fine-tuning the original model in test\ntime is cost sensitive.\n  This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online\nadaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most\nneural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass\nof the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the model's uncertainty in\nits output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own\nsegmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more\nconfident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels\nacross frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary\nsegmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More\nspecifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation\nnetwork (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every\nframe, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed.\nWe extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video\nbenchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI.

To this end, in this paper, we propose an alternative model,\nDU-VAE, for learning a more Diverse and less Uncertain latent space, and thus\nthe representation can be learned in a meaningful and compact manner.\nSpecifically, we first theoretically demonstrate that it will result in better\nlatent space with high diversity and low uncertainty awareness by controlling\nthe distribution of posterior's parameters across the whole data accordingly.\nThen, without the introduction of new loss terms or modifying training\nstrategies, we propose to exploit Dropout on the variances and\nBatch-Normalization on the means simultaneously to regularize their\ndistributions implicitly. Furthermore, to evaluate the generalization effect,\nwe also exploit DU-VAE for inverse autoregressive flow based-VAE (VAE-IAF)\nempirically.

Given two nearby video frames, perceptual consistency\nmeasures how much the segmentation decisions agree with the pixel\ncorrespondences obtained via matching general perceptual features. More\nspecifically, for each pixel in one frame, we find the most perceptually\ncorrelated pixel in the other frame. Our intuition is that such a pair of\npixels are highly likely to belong to the same class. Next, we assess how much\nthe segmentation agrees with such perceptual correspondences, based on which we\nderive the perceptual consistency of the segmentation maps across these two\nframes. Utilizing perceptual consistency, we can evaluate the temporal\nconsistency of video segmentation by measuring the perceptual consistency over\nconsecutive pairs of segmentation maps in a video. Furthermore, given a\nsparsely labeled test video, perceptual consistency can be utilized to aid with\npredicting the pixel-wise correctness of the segmentation on an unlabeled\nframe. More specifically, by measuring the perceptual consistency between the\npredicted segmentation and the available ground truth on a nearby frame and\ncombining it with the segmentation confidence, we can accurately assess the\nclassification correctness on each pixel. Our experiments show that the\nproposed perceptual consistency can more accurately evaluate the temporal\nconsistency of video segmentation as compared to flow-based measures.\nFurthermore, it can help more confidently predict segmentation accuracy on\nunlabeled test frames, as compared to using classification confidence alone.\nFinally, our proposed measure can be used as a regularizer during the training\nof segmentation models, which leads to more temporally consistent video\nsegmentation while maintaining accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 08:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

The\ncommon framework for graph signal compression is based on sampling, resulting\nin a set of continuous-amplitude samples, which in turn have to be quantized\ninto a finite bit representation. In this work we study the joint design of\ngraph signal sampling along with quantization, for graph signal compression. We\nfocus on bandlimited graph signals, and show that the compression problem can\nbe represented as a task-based quantization setup, in which the task is to\nrecover the spectrum of the signal. Based on this equivalence, we propose a\njoint design of the sampling and recovery mechanisms for a fixed quantization\nmapping, and present an iterative algorithm for dividing the available bit\nbudget among the discretized samples. Furthermore, we show how the proposed\napproach can be realized using graph filters combining elements corresponding\nthe neighbouring nodes of the graph, thus facilitating distributed\nimplementation at reduced complexity.

High-resolution observations of the solar photosphere reveal the\npresence of fine structures, in particular the so-called magnetic bright points\n(MBPs), which are small-scale features associated with strong magnetic field\nregions of the order of kilogauss (kG). It is especially relevant to study\nthese magnetic elements, which are extensively detected at all moments of the\nsolar cycle, in order to establish their contribution to the behaviour of the\nsolar atmosphere, and ultimately a plausible role within the coronal heating\nproblem.

We aim to characterise the size and velocity distributions of\nMBPs in the solar photosphere in two different datasets of quiet Sun images\nacquired with the Solar Optical Telescope SOT/Hinode and the High-resolution\nFast Imager HiFI/GREGOR, in the G-band (4308 angstroms). Methods. In order to\ndetect the MBPs, an automatic segmentation and identification algorithm was\nused. Next, the identified features were tracked to measure their proper\nmotions. Finally, a statistical analysis of hundreds of MBPs was carried out,\ngenerating histograms for areas, diameters, and horizontal velocities. Results.\nThis work establishes that areas and diameters of MBPs display log-normal\ndistributions that are well fitted by two different components, whereas the\nvelocity vector components follow Gaussians, and the vector magnitude follows a\nRayleigh distribution again revealing a two-component composition for all\nvector elements. Conclusions. The results can be interpreted as due to the\npresence of two different populations of MBPs in the solar photosphere, one\nlikely related to stronger network magnetic flux elements and the other one to\nweaker intranetwork flux elemens. In particular, this work concludes on the\neffect of the different spatial resolutions of the GREGOR and Hinode\ntelescopes, affecting detections and average values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 10:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

As\nan example, in implicit variational solvation, for the construction of\nbiomolecular shapes, the electrostatic contributions satisfy the\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation with discontinuous dielectric constants across the\ninterface. When interface motions are involved, one often needs not only\naccurate solution values, but accurate derivatives as well, such as the normal\nderivatives at the interface. We introduce here the Compact Coupling Interface\nMethod (CCIM), a finite difference method for the elliptic interface problem\nwith interfacial jump conditions. The CCIM can calculate solution values and\ntheir derivatives up to second-order accuracy in arbitrary ambient space\ndimensions. It combines elements of Chern and Shu's Coupling Interface Method\nand Mayo's approach for elliptic interface boundary value problems, leading to\nmore compact finite difference stencils that are applicable to more general\nsituations.

Recently, several Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL)-based placement techniques have been proposed in fog/edge\ncomputing environments, which are only suitable for centralized setups. The\ntraining of well-performed DRL agents requires manifold training data while\nobtaining training data is costly. Hence, these centralized DRL-based\ntechniques lack generalizability and quick adaptability, thus failing to\nefficiently tackle application placement problems. Moreover, many IoT\napplications are modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with diverse\ntopologies. Satisfying dependencies of DAG-based IoT applications incur\nadditional constraints and increase the complexity of placement problems. To\novercome these challenges, we propose an actor-critic-based distributed\napplication placement technique, working based on the IMPortance weighted\nActor-Learner Architectures (IMPALA). IMPALA is known for efficient distributed\nexperience trajectory generation that significantly reduces the exploration\ncosts of agents. Besides, it uses an adaptive off-policy correction method for\nfaster convergence to optimal solutions. Our technique uses recurrent layers to\ncapture temporal behaviors of input data and a replay buffer to improve the\nsample efficiency. The performance results, obtained from simulation and\ntestbed experiments, demonstrate that our technique significantly improves the\nexecution cost of IoT applications up to 30\\% compared to its counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 11:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Specifically, we derive the scaling function and the\ninfinite invariant density of a stochastic model for the momentum of laser\ncooled atoms using two approaches. The first is a direct analysis of the master\nequation and the second following the analysis of Bertin and Bardou using the\nlifetime dynamics. The two methods are shown to be identical, but yield\ndifferent insights into the problem.

Since a convenient formula is known for tangential velocity\nthat maintains the equidistribution rule with curvature-type monitor functions,\nthe strategy enables to compute the correspondence between the arclength and\nanother spatial variable by evolving the interpolated curve.

The partition of energy between these\nfluctuations determines the nature of dissipation, which, in many astrophysical\nsystems, happens on scales where plasma is collisionless. However, when the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) drives the turbulence, it is difficult to\nresolve numerically the scale at which both types of fluctuations start to be\ndecoupled because the MRI energy injection occurs in a broad range of\nwavenumbers, and both types of fluctuations are usually expected to be coupled\neven at relatively small scales. In this study, we focus on collisional MRI\nturbulence threaded by a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field, which is naturally\nproduced by the differential rotation of a disc. We show that, in such a case,\nthe decoupling scales are reachable using a reduced MHD model that includes\ndifferential-rotation effects.

In the decoupling scales, the energy flux of compressive\nfluctuations contained in the small scales is almost double that of Alfv\\'enic\nfluctuations.

In particular, we find that with the commonly used\nfinite-difference implementation of the quantitative phase-field model of\nbinary alloy solidification, both the operating state of the dendrite tip and\nthe dendrite growth orientation are strongly affected by the lattice\nanisotropy. To circumvent this problem, we use known methods in both real and\nFourier space to derive finite-difference approximations of leading\ndifferential terms in 2D and 3D that are isotropic at order $h^2$ of the\nlattice spacing $h$. Importantly, those terms include the divergence of the\nanti-trapping current that is found to have a critical influence on pattern\nselection. The 2D and 3D discretizations use an approximated form of the\nanti-trapping current that facilitates the Fourier-space derivation of the\nassociated isotropic differential operator at $O(h^2)$, but we also derive a 2D\ndiscretization of the standard form of this current. Finally, we present 2D and\n3D phase-field simulations of alloy solidification, showing that the isotropic\nfinite-difference implementations can dramatically reduce spurious lattice\nanisotropy effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 14:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

By\nprecisely engineering the dissipations of two membranes and tuning the\nintensity modulation of the cavity light, the two-membrane-in-the-middle system\nshows anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetry and the cavity mediated interaction\nbetween two nanomechanical resonators becomes purely dissipative.

Furthermore, the inflationary phenomenology with a\nDirac-Born-Infeld scalar field is briefly examined, which arises from quantum\ntheories of gravity such as superstring theory.

The proposed coordinates\nexhibit no singularities over the far-field hemi-sphere, making them a good\nchoice for automated radiation pattern analysis.

In this paper, we argue that the use of John Conway's surreal\nnumbers shall provide a firm mathematical foundation for transfinite decision\ntheory. To that end, we prove a surreal representation theorem and show that\nour surreal decision theory respects dominance reasoning even in the case of\ninfinite values. We then bring our theory to bear on one of the more venerable\ndecision problems in the literature: Pascal's Wager. Analyzing the wager\nshowcases our theory's virtues and advantages. To that end, we analyze two\nobjections against the wager: Mixed Strategies and Many Gods. After formulating\nthe two objections in the framework of surreal utilities and probabilities, our\ntheory correctly predicts that (1) the pure Pascalian strategy beats all mixed\nstrategies, and (2) what one should do in a Pascalian decision problem depends\non what one's credence function is like. Our analysis therefore suggests that\nalthough Pascal's Wager is mathematically coherent, it does not deliver what it\npurports to, a rationally compelling argument that people should lead a\nreligious life regardless of how confident they are in theism and its\nalternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 18:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}
