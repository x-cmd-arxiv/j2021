This complex collaboration structure makes developers\nmore likely to introduce defect-prone changes that lead to software faults.\nDetermining when these defect-prone changes are introduced has proven\nchallenging, and using traditional machine learning (ML) methods to make these\ndeterminations seems to have reached a plateau. In this work, we build\ncontribution graphs consisting of developers and source files to capture the\nnuanced complexity of changes required to build software. By leveraging these\ncontribution graphs, our research shows the potential of using graph-based ML\nto improve Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. We hypothesize that features\nextracted from the contribution graphs may be better predictors of defect-prone\nchanges than intrinsic features derived from software characteristics. We\ncorroborate our hypothesis using graph-based ML for classifying edges that\nrepresent defect-prone changes. This new framing of the JIT defect prediction\nproblem leads to remarkably better results. We test our approach on 14\nopen-source projects and show that our best model can predict whether or not a\ncode change will lead to a defect with an F1 score as high as 77.55% and a\nMatthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as high as 53.16%. This represents a\n152% higher F1 score and a 3% higher MCC over the state-of-the-art JIT defect\nprediction. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can\nbe used for operational JIT defect prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 16:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 13:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 16:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

However, the\nprevious implementation of multiway DWD was restricted to classification of\nmatrices, and did not account for sparsity. In this paper, we develop a general\nframework for multiway classification which is applicable to any number of\ndimensions and any degree of sparsity. We conducted extensive simulation\nstudies, showing that our model is robust to the degree of sparsity and\nimproves classification accuracy when the data have multiway structure.

Such cold flows are important since they dominate the\nmass and angular momentum acquisition that can make up rotationally-supported\ndisks at high-redshifts.

Without CS term the 3d massless gauge boson\nhas a single physical transverse polarization state, while adding the CS term\nconverts it into a massive physical polarization state and conserves the total\nphysical degrees of freedom. We newly formulate the mechanism of topological\nmass-generation at $S$-matrix level.

Being one of the\nmost widely-used methods to output probability, Softmax-based models have found\na wide range of applications, including session-based recommender systems\n(SBRSs). Softmax-based models consist of a Softmax function on top of a final\nlinear layer. The bottleneck has been shown to be caused by rank deficiency in\nthe final linear layer due to its connection with matrix factorization. In this\npaper, we show that there are more aspects to the Softmax bottleneck in SBRSs.\nContrary to common beliefs, overfitting does happen in the final linear layer,\nwhile it is often associated with complex networks. Furthermore, we identified\nthat the common technique of sharing item embeddings among session sequences\nand the candidate pool creates a tight-coupling that also contributes to the\nbottleneck. We propose a simple yet effective method, Dropout and Decoupling\n(D&D), to alleviate these problems. Our experiments show that our method\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of a variety of Softmax-based SBRS\nalgorithms. When compared to other computationally expensive methods, such as\nMLP and MoS (Mixture of Softmaxes), our method performs on par with and at\ntimes even better than those methods, while keeping the same time complexity as\nSoftmax-based models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 16:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Of all the surface\nroughness indicators, the International Roughness Index (IRI) is the most\nwidely used. However, it is costly to measure IRI, and for this reason, certain\nroad classes are excluded from IRI measurements at a network level. Higher\nlevels of distresses are generally associated with higher roughness. However,\nfor a given roughness level, pavement data typically exhibits a great deal of\nvariability in the distress types, density, and severity. It is hypothesized\nthat it is feasible to estimate the IRI of a pavement section given its\ndistress types and their respective densities and severities. To investigate\nthis hypothesis, this paper uses data from in-service pavements and machine\nlearning methods to ascertain the extent to which IRI can be predicted given a\nset of pavement attributes. The results suggest that machine learning can be\nused reliably to estimate IRI based on the measured distress types and their\nrespective densities and severities. The analysis also showed that IRI\nestimated this way depends on the pavement type and functional class. The paper\nalso includes an exploratory section that addresses the reverse situation, that\nis, estimating the probability of pavement distress type distribution and\noccurrence severity/extent based on a given roughness level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 16:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Employing a multipole expansion offers in principle an exact\ntreatment of the electrostatic potential such that the long-range and\nshort-range electrostatic interaction can be treated simultaneously with high\naccuracy.

Functional assessment of right ventricle (RV) using gated\nmyocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MPS) heavily\nrelies on the precise extraction of right ventricular contours. In this paper,\nwe present a new deep-learning-based model integrating both the spatial and\ntemporal features in gated MPS images to perform the segmentation of the RV\nepicardium and endocardium. Methods. By integrating the spatial features from\neach cardiac frame of the gated MPS and the temporal features from the\nsequential cardiac frames of the gated MPS, we developed a Spatial-Temporal\nV-Net (ST-VNet) for automatic extraction of RV endocardial and epicardial\ncontours. In the ST-VNet, a V-Net is employed to hierarchically extract spatial\nfeatures, and convolutional long-term short-term memory (ConvLSTM) units are\nadded to the skip-connection pathway to extract the temporal features.

For over a century, the\nAbbe-Rayleigh criterion has been utilized to assess the spatial resolution\nlimits of optical instruments. Recently, there has been an enormous impetus in\novercoming the Abbe-Rayleigh resolution limit by projecting target light beams\nonto spatial modes. These conventional schemes for superresolution rely on a\nseries of spatial projective measurements to pick up phase information that is\nused to boost the spatial resolution of optical systems. Unfortunately, these\nschemes require a priori information regarding the coherence properties of\n\"unknown\" light beams.

In addition, to facilitate\nthe development of a factual consistency detector, we automatically create a\nnew corpus called Conv-FEVER that is adapted from the Wizard of Wikipedia\ndataset and includes factually consistent and inconsistent responses. We\ndemonstrate the benefit of our Conv-FEVER dataset by showing that the models\ntrained on this data perform reasonably well to detect factually inconsistent\nresponses with respect to the provided knowledge through evaluation on our\nhuman annotated data. We will release the Conv-FEVER dataset and the human\nannotated responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 17:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 21:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

However, it is\ndifficult to predict all likely conditions the robot will encounter during\ndeployment and enumerate them at training-time. What if instead of training\ncontrollers that are robust enough to handle any eventuality, we enable the\nrobot to continually learn in any setting it finds itself in? This kind of\nreal-world reinforcement learning poses a number of challenges, including\nefficiency, safety, and autonomy. To address these challenges, we propose a\npractical robot reinforcement learning system for fine-tuning locomotion\npolicies in the real world. We demonstrate that a modest amount of real-world\ntraining can substantially improve performance during deployment, and this\nenables a real A1 quadrupedal robot to autonomously fine-tune multiple\nlocomotion skills in a range of environments, including an outdoor lawn and a\nvariety of indoor terrains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 17:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Second, representing body pose in 3D enables reasoning about self\nocclusions. Third, 3D body parts that are visible before and after reposing,\nshould have similar appearance features. Once trained, SPICE takes an image of\na person and generates a new image of that person in a new target pose.

In F|N thin-film stacks made of a\nferro/ferrimagnetic layer F and a normal-metal layer N, spin transport is\nmediated by (1) spin-polarized conduction electrons and/or (2) torque between\nelectron spins. To identify a cross-over from (1) to (2), we study laser-driven\nspin currents in F|Pt stacks where F consists of model materials with different\ndegrees of electrical conductivity. For the magnetic insulators YIG, GIG and\nmaghemite, identical dynamics is observed. It arises from the THz interfacial\nspin Seebeck effect (SSE), is fully determined by the relaxation of the\nelectrons in the metal layer and provides an estimate of the spin-mixing\nconductance of the GIG/Pt interface. Remarkably, in the half-metallic\nferrimagnet Fe3O4 (magnetite), our measurements reveal two spin-current\ncomponents with opposite direction. The slower, positive component exhibits SSE\ndynamics and is assigned to torque-type magnon excitation of the A- and B-spin\nsublattices of Fe3O4. The faster, negative component arises from the\npyro-spintronic effect and can consistently be assigned to ultrafast\ndemagnetization of e-sublattice minority-spin hopping electrons.

Existing approaches almost all neglect this problem, and treat\ncategories equally. Some popular approaches such as consistency regularization\nor pseudo-labeling may even harm the learning of under-performing categories,\nthat the predictions or pseudo labels of these categories could be too\ninaccurate to guide the learning on the unlabeled data. In this paper, we look\ninto this problem, and propose a novel framework for semi-supervised semantic\nsegmentation, named adaptive equalization learning (AEL). AEL adaptively\nbalances the training of well and badly performed categories, with a confidence\nbank to dynamically track category-wise performance during training. The\nconfidence bank is leveraged as an indicator to tilt training towards\nunder-performing categories, instantiated in three strategies: 1) adaptive\nCopy-Paste and CutMix data augmentation approaches which give more chance for\nunder-performing categories to be copied or cut; 2) an adaptive data sampling\napproach to encourage pixels from under-performing category to be sampled; 3) a\nsimple yet effective re-weighting method to alleviate the training noise raised\nby pseudo-labeling. Experimentally, AEL outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin on the Cityscapes and Pascal VOC benchmarks under\nvarious data partition protocols.

Here, we consider\nsmall-amplitude, shallow-water solitary waves propagating up a gentle, planar\nbathymetry forced by a weak, Jeffreys-type wind-induced surface pressure.

Many\nalgorithms have been developed under the assumption that there is at least one\nnearby data point to each vertex; two of the most widely used ones are vertex\ncomponent analysis (VCA) and the successive projection algorithm (SPA).

In that scenario, ALLS is probalistically more robust to\nnoise than algorithms based on the separability assumption. In this paper,\ninspired by ALLS, we propose smoothed VCA (SVCA) and smoothed SPA (SSPA) that\ngeneralize VCA and SPA by assuming the presence of several nearby data points\nto each vertex.

Further,\ncontemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the\nresource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning\nof an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy\nconsumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics\nand reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource\nmanagement address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a\nlimited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across\nthermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the\ncorresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an\nincrease in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments\nwith non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose\nan artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique\nfor sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates\nthe goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective\nscheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and\ncooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model\nfor approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and\ngenerating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical\ncloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit and the COSCO framework show that\nHUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption,\nSLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54\nand 3 percent respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 18:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 11:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

It has been suggested that dynamic rerouting could be\nfacilitated using emerging technologies such as fog-computing which offer\nadvantages of low-latency capabilities and information exchange between\nvehicles and roadway infrastructure. To address this question, this study\nproposes a two-stage model that combines GAQ (Graph Attention Network - Deep Q\nLearning) and EBkSP (Entropy Based k Shortest Path) using a fog-cloud\narchitecture, to reroute vehicles in a dynamic urban environment and therefore\nto improve travel efficiency in terms of travel speed. First, GAQ analyzes the\ntraffic conditions on each road and for each fog area, and then assigns a road\nindex based on the information attention from both local and neighboring areas.\nSecond, EBkSP assigns the route for each vehicle based on the vehicle priority\nand route popularity. A case study experiment is carried out to investigate the\nefficacy of the proposed model. At the model training stage, different methods\nare used to establish the vehicle priorities, and their impact on the results\nis assessed. Also, the proposed model is tested under various scenarios with\ndifferent ratios of rerouting and background (non-rerouting) vehicles. The\nresults demonstrate that vehicle rerouting using the proposed model can help\nattain higher speed and reduces possibility of severe congestion. This result\nsuggests that the proposed model can be deployed by urban transportation\nagencies for dynamic rerouting and ultimately, to reduce urban traffic\ncongestion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 18:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Here, we use mock astrometric\nobservations to demonstrate that Gaia can identify and characterize black hole\ncompanions to luminous stars with orbital periods longer than Gaia's lifetime.\nSuch astrometric binaries have orbital periods too long to exhibit complete\norbits, and instead are identified through curvature in their characteristic\nhelical paths.

Satellites around high-obliquity planets are known to be unstable near\ntheir Laplace radius, but the approximations used so far are invalidated in\nthis regime.\n  Aims: We aim to investigate the behaviour of a planet and its satellite when\nthe satellite crosses its Laplace radius while the planet is locked in secular\nspin-orbit resonance.\n  Methods: We expand on previous works and revisit the concept of Laplace\nsurface. We use it to build an averaged analytical model that couples the\nplanetary spin-axis and satellite dynamics.\n  Results: We show that the dynamics is organised around a critical point, S1,\nat which the phase-space structure is singular, located at 90{\\deg} obliquity\nand near the Laplace radius. If the spin-axis precession rate of the planet is\nmaintained fixed by a resonance while the satellite migrates outwards or\ninwards, then S1 acts as an attractor towards which the system is forced to\nevolve. When it reaches the vicinity of S1, the entire system breaks down,\neither because the planet is expelled from the resonance or because the\nsatellite is ejected or collides into the planet.\n  Conclusions: Provided that Titan's migration is not halted in the future,\nTitan and Saturn may reach instability between a few gigayears and several tens\nof gigayears from now, depending on Titan's migration rate. The evolution would\ndestabilise Titan and drive Saturn towards an obliquity of 90{\\deg}. Our\nfindings may have important consequences for Uranus.

From survey results\nand as evidenced by eventual research results and publications from\nparticipants, we believe that our method of structuring empirical research\nprofessional development was successful and could be a model for similar\nprograms in other areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 19:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Inspired by the perturbation\nanalysis, the intra-channel cross-phase modulation term is conveniently\nrepresented by matrix operations in the DNN. The introduction of this term in\neach nonlinear operation considerably improves the performance, as well as\nenables the flexibility of PA-LDBP by adjusting the numbers of spans per step.\nThe proposed scheme is evaluated by numerical simulations of a single carrier\noptical fiber communication system operating at 32 Gbaud with 64-quadrature\namplitude modulation and 20*80 km transmission distance. The results show that\nthe proposed scheme achieves approximately 3.5 dB, 1.8 dB, 1.4 dB, and 0.5 dB\nperformance gain in terms of Q2 factor over the linear compensation, when the\nnumbers of spans per step are 1, 2, 4, and 10, respectively.

It has been\nshown in past research that it is feasible to optimize the operations of\nindividual TSC systems or a small number of such systems. However, it has been\ncomputationally difficult to scale these solution approaches to large networks\npartly due to the curse of dimensionality that is encountered as the number of\nintersections increases. Fortunately, recent studies have recognized the\npotential of exploiting advancements in deep and reinforcement learning to\naddress this problem, and some preliminary successes have been achieved in this\nregard. However, facilitating such intelligent solution approaches may require\nlarge amounts of infrastructural investments such as roadside units (RSUs) and\ndrones in order to ensure thorough connectivity across all intersections in\nlarge networks, an investment that may be burdensome for agencies to undertake.\nAs such, this study builds on recent work to present a scalable TSC model that\nmay reduce the number of required enabling infrastructure. This is achieved\nusing graph attention networks (GATs) to serve as the neural network for deep\nreinforcement learning, which aids in maintaining the graph topology of the\ntraffic network while disregarding any irrelevant or unnecessary information. A\ncase study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel, and the results show much promise.

While the radiative properties of point dipoles at\nmetal interfaces has been studied extensively, those of excitons, which are\ndelocalized and exhibit a temperature-dependent momentum distribution, lack a\nthorough treatment. Here, we analyze the emission properties of excitons in\nTMDCs near planar metal interfaces and explore their dependence on exciton\ncenter-of-mass momentum, transition dipole orientation, and temperature.\nDefining a characteristic energy scale $k_B T_c = (\\hbar k)^2/2m$~($k$ being\nthe radiative wavevector and $m$ the exciton mass), we find that at\ntemperatures $T\\gg T_c$ and low densities where the momentum distribution can\nbe characterized by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, the modified emission\nrates~(normalized to free space) behave similarly to point dipoles at\ntemperatures $T\\gg T_c$. This similarity in behavior arises due to the broad\nnature of wavevector components making up the exciton and point dipole\nemission. On the other hand, the narrow momentum distribution of excitons for\n$T<T_c$ can result in significantly different emission behavior as compared to\npoint dipoles. These differences can be further amplified by considering\nexcitons with a Bose Einstein distribution at high phase space densities. We\nfind suppression or enhancement of emission relative to the point dipole case\nby several orders of magnitude. These insights can help optimize the\nperformance of optoelectronic devices that incorporate 2D semiconductors near\nmetal electrodes and can inform future studies of exciton radiative dynamics at\nlow temperatures. Additionally, these studies show that nanoscale optical\ncavities are a viable pathway to generating long-lifetime exciton states in\nTMDCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 19:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

The singularity can cause exceedingly\nlarge local values of the dynamic model constant. If these large values are not\nmitigated by application of averaging, they can amplify discretization errors\nand impair the stability of simulations. To improve the local applicability of\nthe DSM, the singularity is removed by replacing the resolved rate-of-strain\ntensors in the Smagorinsky model with the resolved velocity gradient tensor.\nThese replacements result in the new dynamic gradient Smagorinsky model (DGSM).\nResults of simulations of three canonical turbulent flows (decaying homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence, a temporal mixing layer, and turbulent channel flow) are\npresented to demonstrate the potential of this model. The DGSM provides\nimproved stability compared to the local DSM, and does not require averaging\nfor stability at time step sizes that are typically used for a static locally\nconsistent LES model. Results obtained with the DGSM are generally as accurate\nas results obtained with the DSM, while the DGSM has lower computational\ncomplexity.

Contrary to the\nprevious multi-staged framework to MVPS, where the position, iso-depth\ncontours, or orientation measurements are estimated independently and then\nfused later, our method is simple to implement and realize. Our method performs\nneural rendering of multi-view images while utilizing surface normals estimated\nby a deep photometric stereo network. We render the MVPS images by considering\nthe object's surface normals for each 3D sample point along the viewing\ndirection rather than explicitly using the density gradient in the volume space\nvia 3D occupancy information. We optimize the proposed neural radiance field\nrepresentation for the MVPS setup efficiently using a fully connected deep\nnetwork to recover the 3D geometry of an object. Extensive evaluation on the\nDiLiGenT-MV benchmark dataset shows that our method performs better than the\napproaches that perform only PS or only multi-view stereo (MVS) and provides\ncomparable results against the state-of-the-art multi-stage fusion methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 20:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Caster wheels are appreciated for their ability to turn in any\ndirection almost on the spot, allowing the robot to do the same and thereby\ngreatly simplifying the motion planning and control. However, in aligning the\ncaster wheels to the intended direction of motion they produce a so-called bore\ntorque. As a result, additional motor torque is required to move the robot,\nwhich may in some cases exceed the motor capacity or compromise the motion\nplanner's accuracy. Instead of taking a decoupled approach, where the\nnavigation and disturbance rejection algorithms are separated, we propose to\nembed the caster wheel awareness into the motion planner. To do so, we present\na caster-wheel-aware term that is compatible with MPC-based control methods,\nleveraging the existence of caster wheels in the motion planning stage. As a\nproof of concept, this term is combined with a a model-predictive trajectory\ntracking controller.

As transient spiral activity increases random motion, the patterns must\nfade over time unless the disk also contains a dissipative gas component.\nContinuing spiral activity alters the structure of the disks in other ways:\nreducing metallicity gradients and flattening rotation curves are two of the\nmost significant. The overwhelming majority of spirals in galaxies have two- or\nthree-fold rotational symmetry, indicating that the cool, thin disk component\nis massive.

The finite\nmomentum orders melt upon increasing doping to a vestigial nematic state which\nbreaks the rotational symmetry of the system. The spatial features of the\nground state at each doping reveal multiple wavevectors, which potentially\ndrives the incommensuration of charge orders.

A commonly used defense is adversarial training, whose performance is\ninfluenced by model capacity. While previous works have studied the impact of\nvarying model width and depth on robustness, the impact of increasing capacity\nby using learnable parametric activation functions (PAFs) has not been studied.\nWe study how using learnable PAFs can improve robustness in conjunction with\nadversarial training. We first ask the question: how should we incorporate\nparameters into activation functions to improve robustness? To address this, we\nanalyze the direct impact of activation shape on robustness through PAFs and\nobserve that activation shapes with positive outputs on negative inputs and\nwith high finite curvature can increase robustness. We combine these properties\nto create a new PAF, which we call Parametric Shifted Sigmoidal Linear Unit\n(PSSiLU). We then combine PAFs (including PReLU, PSoftplus and PSSiLU) with\nadversarial training and analyze robust performance. We find that PAFs optimize\ntowards activation shape properties found to directly affect robustness.\nAdditionally, we find that while introducing only 1-2 learnable parameters into\nthe network, smooth PAFs can significantly increase robustness over ReLU. For\ninstance, when trained on CIFAR-10 with additional synthetic data, PSSiLU\nimproves robust accuracy by 4.54% over ReLU on ResNet-18 and 2.69% over ReLU on\nWRN-28-10 in the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ threat model while adding only 2 additional\nparameters into the network architecture.

Such surveys require automatic detection of target sound\nevents. However, current detectors, especially those relying on band-limited\nenergy, are severely impacted by wind. The rapid dynamics of this noise\ninvalidate standard noise estimators, and no satisfactory method for dealing\nwith it exists in bioacoustics, where simple training and generalization\nbetween conditions are important. We propose to estimate the transient noise\nlevel by fitting short-term spectrum models to a wavelet packet representation.\nThis estimator is then combined with log-spectral subtraction to stabilize the\nbackground level. The resulting adjusted wavelet series can be analysed by\nstandard energy detectors. We use real monitoring data to tune this workflow,\nand test it on two acoustic surveys of birds. Additionally, we show how the\nestimator can be incorporated in a denoising method to restore sound. The\nproposed noise-robust workflow greatly reduced the number of false alarms in\nthe surveys, compared to unadjusted energy detection. As a result, the survey\nefficiency (precision of the estimated call density) improved for both species.\nDenoising was also more effective when using the short-term estimate, whereas\nstandard wavelet shrinkage with a constant noise estimate struggled to remove\nthe effects of wind. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed estimator\ncan adjust for transient broadband noises without requiring additional hardware\nor extensive tuning to each species. It improved the detection workflow based\non very little training data, making it particularly attractive for detection\nof rare species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 22:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We present TCube (Time-series-to-text), a\ndomain-agnostic neural framework for time-series narration, that couples the\nrepresentation of essential time-series elements in the form of a dense\nknowledge graph and the translation of said knowledge graph into rich and\nfluent narratives through the transfer-learning capabilities of PLMs\n(Pre-trained Language Models). TCube's design primarily addresses the challenge\nthat lies in building a neural framework in the complete paucity of annotated\ntraining data for time-series. The design incorporates knowledge graphs as an\nintermediary for the representation of essential time-series elements which can\nbe linearized for textual translation. To the best of our knowledge, TCube is\nthe first investigation of the use of neural strategies for time-series\nnarration. Through extensive evaluations, we show that TCube can improve the\nlexical diversity of the generated narratives by up to 65.38% while still\nmaintaining grammatical integrity.

For given stellar and\ndisk parameters, the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ is determined\nself-consistently under the framework of viscously-driven accretion from\ndetailed considerations of the MRI with non-ideal MHD effects (Ohmic\nresistivity and ambipolar diffusion), accounting for disk heating by stellar\nirradiation, non-thermal sources of ionization, and dust effects on the\nionization chemistry.

We\nbelieve that the framework here should be applicable to disentangling\nmechanisms for more complex processes such as multivalent ion disassociation,\nwhere previous work has suggested that long range contributions may be more\nimportant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 23:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We show that the agents can\nfind an $\\epsilon$-approximate CCE in at most $\\widetilde{O}( H^6S A\n/\\epsilon^2)$ episodes, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the size of\nthe largest individual action space, and $H$ is the length of an episode. This\nappears to be the first sample complexity result for learning in generic\ngeneral-sum Markov games. Our results rely on a novel investigation of an\nanytime high-probability regret bound for OMD with a dynamic learning rate and\nweighted regret, which would be of independent interest. One key feature of our\nalgorithm is that it is fully \\emph{decentralized}, in the sense that each\nagent has access to only its local information, and is completely oblivious to\nthe presence of others. This way, our algorithm can readily scale up to an\narbitrary number of agents, without suffering from the exponential dependence\non the number of agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 02:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 03:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 22:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Concretely, a decoupling module is designed to decompose a\nbrain network into two parts: one part is composed of a few sparse graphs which\nrepresent the neural circuits largely determining the development of AD; the\nother part is a supplement graph, whose influence on AD can be ignored.\nFurthermore, the adversarial strategy is utilized to guide the decoupling\nmodule to extract the feature more related to AD.

In\nparticular, our multi-task based approach treats predicting each annotators'\njudgements as separate subtasks, while sharing a common learned representation\nof the task. We show that this approach yields same or better performance than\naggregating labels in the data prior to training across seven different binary\nclassification tasks. Our approach also provides a way to estimate uncertainty\nin predictions, which we demonstrate better correlate with annotation\ndisagreements than traditional methods. Being able to model uncertainty is\nespecially useful in deployment scenarios where knowing when not to make a\nprediction is important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 03:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

This work addresses the task of VLN from a previously-ignored\naspect, namely the spatial route prior of the navigation scenes. A critically\nenabling innovation of this work is explicitly considering the spatial route\nprior under several different VLN settings. In a most information-rich case of\nknowing environment maps and admitting shortest-path prior, we observe that\ngiven an origin-destination node pair, the internal route can be uniquely\ndetermined. Thus, VLN can be effectively formulated as an ordinary\nclassification problem over all possible destination nodes in the scenes.\nFurthermore, we relax it to other more general VLN settings, proposing a\nsequential-decision variant (by abandoning the shortest-path route prior) and\nan explore-and-exploit scheme (for addressing the case of not knowing the\nenvironment maps) that curates a compact and informative sub-graph to exploit.\nAs reported by [34], the performance of VLN methods has been stuck at a plateau\nin past two years. Even with increased model complexity, the state-of-the-art\nsuccess rate on R2R validation-unseen set has stayed around 62% for single-run\nand 73% for beam-search with model-ensemble.

For example, on R2R validation-unseen set, when the number of discrete\nnodes explored is about 40, our single-model success rate reaches 73%, and\nincreases to 78% if a Speaker model is ensembled, which significantly outstrips\nprevious state-of-the-art VLN-BERT with 3 models ensembled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 03:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled\nthrough temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow\nagents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction\nwithin an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework\noften start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known\nbeforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for\nwhich options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor\nrepresentation (SR), which encodes states based on the pattern of state\nvisitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the\ndiscovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big\npicture view of recent results, showing how the SR can be used to discover\noptions that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We\ncast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option\ndiscovery in which the agent's representation is used to identify useful\noptions, which are then used to further improve its representation. This\nresults in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and\nthe options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery\nitself, we also discuss how the SR allows us to augment a set of options into a\ncombinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved\nthrough the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation\nfocuses on options discovered for exploration and on the use of the SR to\ncombine them. The results of our experiments shed light on important design\ndecisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of\ndifferent methods based on the SR, such as eigenoptions and the option\nkeyboard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 05:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 06:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 21:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

They leverage implicit decoder trained to take a\n3D point coordinate concatenated with a shape encoding and to output a value\nwhich indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not. Although this\napproach enables efficient rendering of visually plausible objects, it has two\nsignificant limitations. First, it is based on a single neural network\ndedicated for all objects from a training set which results in a cumbersome\ntraining procedure and its application in real life. More importantly, the\nimplicit decoder takes only points sampled within voxels (and not the entire\nvoxels) which yields problems at the classification boundaries and results in\nempty spaces within the rendered mesh.\n  To solve the above limitations, we introduce a new HyperCube architecture\nbased on interval arithmetic network, that enables direct processing of 3D\nvoxels, trained using a hypernetwork paradigm to enforce model convergence.\nInstead of processing individual 3D samples from within a voxel, our approach\nallows to input the entire voxel (3D cube) represented with its convex hull\ncoordinates, while the target network constructed by a hypernet assigns it to\nan inside or outside category. As a result our HyperCube model outperforms the\ncompeting approaches both in terms of training and inference efficiency, as\nwell as the final mesh quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 06:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Only a few simple but powerful tools exist so far. Two examples are\nthe spherical collapse model (SCM) and stable clustering hypothesis (SCH). We\npresent a new analytical tool, a two-body collapse model (TBCM), that plays the\nsame fundamental role as harmonic oscillator in dynamics. For convenience, TBCM\nis formulated for gravity with any potential exponent $n$ in a static\nbackground with a fixed damping ($n$=-1 for Newtonian gravity). The competition\nbetween gravity, expanding background (or damping), and angular momentum\nclassifies two-body collapse into: 1) free fall collapse, where free fall time\nis greater if same system starts to collapse at earlier time; 2) equilibrium\ncollapse that persists longer in time, whose perturbative solutions lead to\npower-law evolution of system energy and momentum. Two critical values\n$\\beta_{s1}=1$ and $\\beta_{s2}=1/3\\pi$ are identified that quantifies the\ncompetition between damping and gravity.

However, the efficiency of most existing DR models is limited by\nthe large memory cost of storing dense vectors and the time-consuming nearest\nneighbor search (NNS) in vector space. Therefore, we present RepCONC, a novel\nretrieval model that learns discrete Representations via CONstrained\nClustering. RepCONC jointly trains dual-encoders and the Product Quantization\n(PQ) method to learn discrete document representations and enables fast\napproximate NNS with compact indexes. It models quantization as a constrained\nclustering process, which requires the document embeddings to be uniformly\nclustered around the quantization centroids and supports end-to-end\noptimization of the quantization method and dual-encoders. We theoretically\ndemonstrate the importance of the uniform clustering constraint in RepCONC and\nderive an efficient approximate solution for constrained clustering by reducing\nit to an instance of the optimal transport problem. Besides constrained\nclustering, RepCONC further adopts a vector-based inverted file system (IVF) to\nsupport highly efficient vector search on CPUs. Extensive experiments on two\npopular ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks show that RepCONC achieves better ranking\neffectiveness than competitive vector quantization baselines under different\ncompression ratio settings. It also substantially outperforms a wide range of\nexisting retrieval models in terms of retrieval effectiveness, memory\nefficiency, and time efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

To provide a theoretical framework in resolving discrepancies between\nexperimental data and Linear-quadratic (LQ)model predictions, we employ a\nnon-Poisson distribution of lethal lesions together with non-homologous\nend-joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. A negative\nbinomial (NB)distribution is used to study the effect of the overdispersion on\nthe shapes and possible reduction of dose-response curvature at high doses. The\nerror distribution is customized to include an adjustable parameter so that the\noverdispersion parameter of NB is not constant but depends on the mean of the\ndistribution. The trends in predicted cell survival responses are compared with\nthe experimental data in low and high dose regions at various LET values for\nproton, helium, and carbon ions. The cell survival responses calculated by the\npresent method reveal straightening of survival curves at high doses. This\nsuggests that the overdispersion causes the cell survival dose-response to\napproximate log-linear behaviour at high doses. Comparison of the cell survival\npredictions with the Particle Irradiation Data Ensemble (PIDE) shows that the\nNB model provides better fits to the experimental data following low and\nintermediate doses.

The WIMP mass sensitivity of\nprevious COSINE-100 searches that relied on the detection of ionization signals\nproduced by target nuclei recoiling from elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering was\nrestricted to WIMP masses above $\\sim$5 GeV/$c^2$ by the detectors' 1 keVee\nenergy-electron-equivalent threshold. The search reported here looks for recoil\nsignals enhanced by the Migdal electrons that are ejected during the scattering\nprocess. This is particularly effective for the detection of low-mass WIMP\nscattering from the crystals' sodium nuclei in which a relatively larger\nfraction of the WIMP's energy is transferred to the nucleus recoil energy and\nthe excitation of its orbital electrons. In this analysis, the low-mass WIMP\nsearch window of the COSINE-100 experiment is extended to WIMP mass down to 200\nMeV/$c^2$. The low-mass WIMP sensitivity will be further improved by lowering\nthe analysis threshold based on a multivariable analysis technique.

Optimizing\nranking systems online means that the deployed system can serve user requests,\ne.g., queries in the web search, and optimize the ranking policy by learning\nfrom user interactions, e.g., clicks. Bandit is a general online learning\nframework and can be used in our optimization task. However, due to the unique\nfeatures of ranking, there are several challenges in designing bandit\nalgorithms for ranking system optimization. In this dissertation, we study and\npropose solutions for four challenges in optimizing ranking systems online:\neffectiveness, safety, nonstationarity, and diversification. First, the\neffectiveness is related to how fast the algorithm learns from interactions. We\nstudy the effective online ranker evaluation task and propose the MergeDTS\nalgorithm to solve the problem effectively. Second, the deployed algorithm\nshould be safe, which means the algorithm only displays reasonable content to\nuser requests. To solve the safe online learning to rank problem, we propose\nthe BubbleRank algorithm. Third, as users change their preferences constantly,\nthe algorithm should handle the nonstationarity. We formulate this\nnonstationary online learning to rank problem as cascade non-stationary bandits\nand propose CascadeDUCB and CascadeSWUCB algorithms to solve the problem.\nFinally, the contents in ranked lists should be diverse. We consider the\nresults diversification task and propose the CascadeHybird algorithm that\nconsiders both the item relevance and results diversification when learning\nfrom user interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 08:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Packets are replicated onto redundant paths by a\nreplication function. Later the paths merge again and an elimination function\nremoves the duplicates. This redundancy scheme has an effect on the timing\nbehavior of time-sensitive networks and many challenges arise from conducting\ntiming analyses. The replication can induce a burstiness increase along the\npaths of replicates, as well as packet mis-ordering that could increase the\ndelays in the crossed bridges or routers. The induced packet mis-ordering could\nalso negatively affect the interactions between the redundancy and scheduling\nmechanisms such as traffic regulators (as with per-flow regulators and\ninterleaved regulators, implemented by TSN asynchronous traffic shaping). Using\nthe network calculus framework, we provide a method of worst-case timing\nanalysis for time-sensitive networks that implement redundancy mechanisms in\nthe general use case, i.e., at end-devices and/or intermediate nodes.

Accordingly, the analysis relies on the assumption that the impacts cause\nimmediate dissipation in the contact region, which is modeled in terms of a\nknown coefficient of restitution. When a flexible host structure is considered\ninstead, the impact absorber not only dissipates energy at the time instances\nof impact, but it inflicts nonlinear energy scattering between structural\nmodes. Hence, it is crucial to account for such nonlinear energy transfers\nyielding energy redistribution within the modal space of the structure. In the\npresent work, we develop a design approach for reonantly-driven, flexible host\nstructures. We demonstrate decoupling of the time scales of the impact and the\nresonant vibration. On the long time scale, the dynamics can be properly\nreduced to the fundamental harmonic of the resonant mode. A light impact\nabsorber responds to this enforced motion, and we recover the Slow Invariant\nManifold of the dynamics for the regime of two impacts per period. On the short\ntime scale, the contact mechanics and elasto-dynamics must be finely resolved.\nWe show that it is sufficient to run a numerical simulation of a single impact\nevent with adequate pre-impact velocity. From this simulation, we derive a\nmodal coefficient of restitution and the properties of the contact force pulse,\nneeded to approximate the behavior on the long time scale. We establish that\nthe design problem can be reduced to four dimensionless parameters and\ndemonstrate the approach for the numerical example of a cantilevered beam with\nan impact absorber. We conclude that the proposed semi-analytical procedure\nenables deep qualitative understanding of the problem and, at the same time,\nyields a quantitatively accurate prediction of the optimum design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 08:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We show the applicability of\nthe approach on an attribute-driven privacy task where the sex information is\nremoved from speaker embeddings. Results on VoxCeleb2 dataset show the\nefficiency of the method that outperforms in terms of privacy and utility our\nprevious experiments based on adversarial disentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 09:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 16:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

It is commonly believed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nare architecturally invariant to translation thanks to the convolution and/or\npooling operations they are endowed with. In fact, several studies have found\nthat these networks systematically fail to recognise new objects on untrained\nlocations. In this work, we test a wide variety of CNNs architectures showing\nhow, apart from DenseNet-121, none of the models tested was architecturally\ninvariant to translation. Nevertheless, all of them could learn to be invariant\nto translation. We show how this can be achieved by pretraining on ImageNet,\nand it is sometimes possible with much simpler data sets when all the items are\nfully translated across the input canvas. At the same time, this invariance can\nbe disrupted by further training due to catastrophic forgetting/interference.\nThese experiments show how pretraining a network on an environment with the\nright `latent' characteristics (a more naturalistic environment) can result in\nthe network learning deep perceptual rules which would dramatically improve\nsubsequent generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 09:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

It is often of interest to infer how the\nintrinsic properties differ among the individuals, based on their observed\nmovement patterns. However, the true individual properties may be masked by\nemergent effects in the collective. We investigate the inference problem in the\ncontext of a bidisperse collective with two types of agents, where the goal is\nto observe the motion of the collective and classify the agents according to\ntheir types. Since collective effects such as jamming and clustering affect\nindividual motion, an agent's own movement does not have sufficient information\nto perform the classification well: a simple observer algorithm, based only on\nindividual velocities cannot accurately estimate the level of heterogeneity of\nthe system, and often misclassifies agents. We propose a novel approach to the\nclassification problem, where collective effects on an agent's motion is\nexplicitly accounted for. We use insights about the physics of collective\nmotion to quantify the effect of the neighbourhood on an agent using a\nneighbourhood parameter. Such an approach can distinguish between agents of two\ntypes, even when their observed motion is identical. This approach estimates\nthe level of heterogeneity much more accurately, and achieves significant\nimprovements in classification.

Research finds\nthe boundary blur problem is mainly caused by two factors, first, the low-level\nfeatures containing boundary and structure information may loss in deeper\nnetworks during the convolution process., second, the model ignores the errors\nintroduced by the boundary area due to the few portions of the boundary in the\nwhole areas during the backpropagation.

To address these discrepancies, we have\nextended the original Ackerman and Marley methodology in virga to allow for\nnon-constant $f_{\\text{sed}}$ values, in particular those that vary with\naltitude.

We call the former self-fixed TD, and it can be particularly\neffective, as developers are experts in their own code and are well-suited to\nfix the corresponding TD issues. Objective: The goal of our study is to\ninvestigate self-fixed technical debt, especially the extent in which TD is\nself-fixed, which types of TD are more likely to be self-fixed, whether the\nremediation time of self-fixed TD is shorter than non-self-fixed TD and how\ndevelopment behaviors are related to self-fixed TD. Method: We report on an\nempirical study that analyzes the self-fixed issues of five types of TD (i.e.,\nCode, Defect, Design, Documentation and Test), captured via static analysis, in\nmore than 44,000 commits obtained from 20 Python and 16 Java projects of the\nApache Software Foundation. Results: The results show that about half of the\nfixed issues are self-fixed and that the likelihood of contained TD issues\nbeing self-fixed is negatively correlated with project size, the number of\ndevelopers and total issues. Moreover, there is no significant difference of\nthe survival time between self-fixed and non-self-fixed issues.

Our main model consists of an elliptic PDE of the form $-\\Delta\nu_\\beta=f(x,u_\\beta)$ endowed with the Robin boundary conditions $\\partial_\\nu\nu_\\beta+\\beta(x)u_\\beta=0$. The optimisation variable is the function $\\beta$,\nwhich is assumed to take values between 0 and 1 and to have a fixed integral.\nTwo types of criteria are under consideration: the first one is non-energetic\ncriteria. In other words, we aim at optimising functionals of the form\n$\\mathcal J(\\beta)=\\int_{\\Omega\\text{ or }\\partial \\Omega}j(u_\\beta)$. We prove\nthat, depending on the monotonicity of the function $j$, the optimisers may be\nof \\emph{bang-bang} type (in other words, the optimisers write $1_\\Gamma$ for\nsome measurable subset $\\Gamma$ of $\\partial \\ Omega $) or, on the contrary,\nthat they may only take values strictly between 0 and 1.

In this study, we model the evolution of features during deep learning\ntraining using a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that each\ncorresponds to a training sample. As a crucial ingredient in our modeling\nstrategy, each SDE contains a drift term that reflects the impact of\nbackpropagation at an input on the features of all samples. Our main finding\nuncovers a sharp phase transition phenomenon regarding the {intra-class impact:\nif the SDEs are locally elastic in the sense that the impact is more\nsignificant on samples from the same class as the input, the features of the\ntraining data become linearly separable, meaning vanishing training loss;\notherwise, the features are not separable, regardless of how long the training\ntime is. Moreover, in the presence of local elasticity, an analysis of our SDEs\nshows that the emergence of a simple geometric structure called the neural\ncollapse of the features.

Ignoring the temporal, morphological changes of lesions can lead to\nmisdiagnosis in borderline cases. In this study, we propose a framework for\nautomated early melanoma diagnosis using sequential dermoscopic images. To this\nend, we construct our method in three steps. First, we align sequential\ndermoscopic images of skin lesions using estimated Euclidean transformations,\nextract the lesion growth region by computing image differences among the\nconsecutive images, and then propose a spatio-temporal network to capture the\ndermoscopic changes from aligned lesion images and the corresponding difference\nimages. Finally, we develop an early diagnosis module to compute probability\nscores of malignancy for lesion images over time. We collected 179 serial\ndermoscopic imaging data from 122 patients to verify our method. Extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed model outperforms other commonly used\nsequence models.

Therefore, this work is focused on the analysis of current labeling\nmethodologies applied to network-based data. In the field of network security,\nthe process of labeling a representative network traffic dataset is\nparticularly challenging and costly since very specialized knowledge is\nrequired to classify network traces. Consequently, most of the current traffic\nlabeling methods are based on the automatic generation of synthetic network\ntraces, which hides many of the essential aspects necessary for a correct\ndifferentiation between normal and malicious behavior.

It follows the discrete\nFourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(DFT-s-OFDM) signal model. 3MSK, is inspired by continuous-phase frequency\nshift keying (FSK), but it uses three frequencies in the baseband model --\nspecifically, 0 and $\\pm f_{symbol}/4$, where $f_{symbol}$ is the symbol rate\n-- which effectively constrains the phase transitions between consecutive\nsymbols to 0 and $\\pm \\pi/2$ rad. Motivated by the phase controlled model of\nmodulation, different degrees of phase continuity can be achieved, while\nsupporting receiver processing with low complexity. The signal characteristics\nare improved by generating an initial time-domain nearly constant envelope\nsignal at higher than the symbol rate. This helps to reach smooth phase\ntransitions between 3MSK symbols. Also the possibility of using excess\nbandwidth is investigated by transmitting additional non-zero subcarriers\noutside active subcarriers of the basic DFT-s-OFDM model, which provides the\ncapability to greatly reduce the PAPR. Due to the fact that the information is\nencoded in the phase transitions, a receiver model that tracks the phase\nvariations without needing reference signals is developed. To this end, it is\nshown that this new modulation is well-suited for non-coherent receivers, even\nunder strong phase noise (PN) conditions, thus allowing to reduce the overhead\nof reference signals. Evaluations of this physical-layer modulation and\nwaveform scheme are performed in terms of transmitter metrics such as PAPR, OOB\nemissions and achievable output power after the power amplifier (PA). Finally,\ncoded radio link evaluations are also shown and provided, demonstrating that\n3MSK has a similar BER performance as that of traditional QPSK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 13:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

However, real-world\npopulations are often evolving with the successive growth of nodes and links in\ntime, resulting in time-varying population structures.

The source of glare is not limited\nto the sun, and glare can be seen in the images captured during the nighttime\nand in indoor environments, which is due to the presence of different light\nsources; reflective surfaces also influence the generation of such artifacts.\nThe glare's visual characteristics are different on images captured by various\ncameras and depend on several factors such as the camera's shutter speed and\nexposure level.

It\nis widely assumed that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are well suited for this\ntask, as the endowed epistemic uncertainty should lead to disagreement in\npredictions on outliers. In this paper, we question this assumption and show\nthat proper Bayesian inference with function space priors induced by neural\nnetworks does not necessarily lead to good OOD detection. To circumvent the use\nof approximate inference, we start by studying the infinite-width case, where\nBayesian inference can be exact due to the correspondence with Gaussian\nprocesses. Strikingly, the kernels derived from common architectural choices\nlead to function space priors which induce predictive uncertainties that do not\nreflect the underlying input data distribution and are therefore unsuited for\nOOD detection. Importantly, we find the OOD behavior in this limiting case to\nbe consistent with the corresponding finite-width case. To overcome this\nlimitation, useful function space properties can also be encoded in the prior\nin weight space, however, this can currently only be applied to a specified\nsubset of the domain and thus does not inherently extend to OOD data. Finally,\nwe argue that a trade-off between generalization and OOD capabilities might\nrender the application of BNNs for OOD detection undesirable in practice.\nOverall, our study discloses fundamental problems when naively using BNNs for\nOOD detection and opens interesting avenues for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 14:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

The noise can be effectively filtered out on the ground through\na specific technique called time-delay interferometry (TDI), which relies on\nthe measurements of time-delays between spacecraft and careful modeling of how\nlaser noise enters the interferometric data. Recently, this technique has been\nrecast into a matrix-based formalism by several authors, offering a different\nperspective on TDI, particularly by relating it to principal component analysis\n(PCA). In this work, we demonstrate that we can cancel laser frequency noise by\ndirectly applying PCA to a set of shifted data samples, without any prior\nknowledge of the relationship between single-link measurements and noise, nor\ntime-delays. We show that this fully data-driven algorithm achieves a\ngravitational-wave sensitivity similar to classic TDI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 14:14:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

We collected the\nmost recent phishing samples to study the effectiveness of the proposed method\nusing different client numbers and data distributions.

The network was trained and tested on\nslides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in addition to two independent test\ndatasets. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values > 0.75 on\nTCGA and 0.8 on independent test sets. Our experiments show that the proposed\napproach can be utilised for case triaging as well as pre-ordering diagnostic\ntests in a diagnostic setting. It can also be used for other weakly supervised\nprediction problems in computational pathology.

Theoretically, the superior expressivity of a quadratic network over\neither a conventional network or a conventional network via quadratic\nactivation is not fully elucidated, which makes the use of quadratic networks\nnot well grounded. Practically, although a quadratic network can be trained via\ngeneric backpropagation, it can be subject to a higher risk of collapse than\nthe conventional counterpart.

To solve this problem and image segmentation,\nconditional random fields (CRFs) are usually formulated as discrete models in\nlabel space to encourage label consistency, which is actually a kind of\npostprocessing. In this paper, we reconsider the CRF in feature space for point\ncloud segmentation because it can capture the structure of features well to\nimprove the representation ability of features rather than simply smoothing.\nTherefore, we first model the point cloud features with a continuous quadratic\nenergy model and formulate its solution process as a message-passing graph\nconvolution, by which it can be easily integrated into a deep network. We\ntheoretically demonstrate that the message passing in the graph convolution is\nequivalent to the mean-field approximation of a continuous CRF model.\nFurthermore, we build an encoder-decoder network based on the proposed\ncontinuous CRF graph convolution (CRFConv), in which the CRFConv embedded in\nthe decoding layers can restore the details of high-level features that were\nlost in the encoding stage to enhance the location ability of the network,\nthereby benefiting segmentation. Analogous to the CRFConv, we show that the\nclassical discrete CRF can also work collaboratively with the proposed network\nvia another graph convolution to further improve the segmentation results.\nExperiments on various point cloud benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed method.

Unfortunately, increasing the DWDM degree (i.e., using a larger\nnumber of wavelengths) to achieve higher aggregated datarate in photonic links,\nand hence higher throughput in PNoCs, requires sophisticated and costly laser\nsources along with extra photonic hardware. This extra hardware can introduce\nundesired noise to the photonic link and increase the bit-error-rate (BER),\npower, and area consumption of PNoCs. To mitigate these issues, the use of\n4-pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) signaling, instead of the conventional\non-off keying (OOK) signaling, can halve the wavelength signals utilized in\nphotonic links for achieving the target aggregate datarate while reducing the\noverhead of crosstalk noise, BER, and photonic hardware. There are various\ndesigns of 4- PAM modulators reported in the literature. For example, the\nsignal superposition (SS), electrical digital-to-analog converter (EDAC), and\noptical digital-to-analog converter (ODAC) based designs of 4-PAM modulators\nhave been reports.

The focus of this work is to formulate this concept for a general\nclass of passive oscillatory dynamical systems, including but not limited to\nmechanical, structural, acoustic, electrical, and optical. Typically, the\nbandwidth of these systems is determined by the half-power (-3 dB) method, and\nthe result is often referred to as half-power bandwidth. The fundamental\nassumption underlying this definition is that the system performance degrades\nonce its power decreases by 50%; moreover, there are restrictive conditions\nthat are rarely met. Here the concept of root mean square bandwidth is\nconsidered, justified by the Fourier uncertainty principle, to generalize the\ndefinition of bandwidth to encompass linear and nonlinear, single and\nmulti-mode, low and high loss and time-varying and invariant oscillating\nsystems. By tying the bandwidth of an oscillatory dynamical system directly to\nits dissipative capacity, one can formulate a definition based solely on its\ntransient energy evolution, effectively circumventing the previous\nrestrictions. Further, applications are given that highlight the limitations of\nthe traditional half-power bandwidth; including a Duffing oscillator with\nhardening nonlinearity, and a geometrically nonlinear oscillator with tunable\nhardening or softening nonlinearity. The resulting energy-dependent bandwidth\ncomputations are compatible with the nonlinear dynamics of these systems, since\nat low energies they recover the half-power bandwidth, whereas at high energies\nthey accurately capture the nonlinear physics. Moreover, the bandwidth\ncomputation is directly tied to nonlinear harmonic generation in the transient\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 22:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Inspired by image generation, deep\nurban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use\nconfigurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies\nusually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial\nhierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of\nlarge-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge.\nThis paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly\nsolve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep\nconditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we\nexploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To\ncapture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to\ngenerate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the\nfine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow\nhumans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model\ncondition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model\nrobustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not\njust allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of\ntraining data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also\nadds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to\nimprove embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present\nextensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

What if we can build new CNN models by reusing parts\nfrom previously build CNN models? What if we can improve a CNN model by\nreplacing (possibly faulty) parts with other parts? In both cases, instead of\ntraining, can we identify the part responsible for each output class (module)\nin the model(s) and reuse or replace only the desired output classes to build a\nmodel? Prior work has proposed decomposing dense-based networks into modules\n(one for each output class) to enable reusability and replaceability in various\nscenarios. However, this work is limited to the dense layers and based on the\none-to-one relationship between the nodes in consecutive layers. Due to the\nshared architecture in the CNN model, prior work cannot be adapted directly. In\nthis paper, we propose to decompose a CNN model used for image classification\nproblems into modules for each output class. These modules can further be\nreused or replaced to build a new model. We have evaluated our approach with\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet tiny datasets with three variations of ResNet\nmodels and found that enabling decomposition comes with a small cost (1.77% and\n0.85% for top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively). Also, building a model by\nreusing or replacing modules can be done with a 2.3% and 0.5% average loss of\naccuracy. Furthermore, reusing and replacing these modules reduces CO2e\nemission by ~37 times compared to training the model from scratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 20:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 15:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

The most fundamental challenge\nfacing this task lies in the enormously varying quality of the video as well as\nthe high-level semantic abstraction of event inherently. In this paper, we\ndecompose the video into several segments and intuitively model the task of\ncomplex event detection as a multiple instance learning problem by representing\neach video as a \"bag\" of segments in which each segment is referred to as an\ninstance. Instead of treating the instances equally, we associate each instance\nwith a reliability variable to indicate its importance and then select reliable\ninstances for training. To measure the reliability of the varying instances\nprecisely, we propose a visual-semantic guided loss by exploiting low-level\nfeature from visual information together with instance-event similarity based\nhigh-level semantic feature.

In particular, based\non the gravity model, a series of improved gravity models are proposed to find\nvital nodes better in complex networks. However, they still have the room to be\nimproved. In this paper, a novel and improved gravity model, which is named\nnetwork efficiency gravity centrality model (NEG), integrates gravity model and\nnetwork efficiency is proposed. Compared to other methods based on different\ngravity models, the proposed method considers the effect of the nodes on\nstructure robustness of the network better.

Since, besides luck and skill, the probability of qualification\ndepends on the design of the qualifiers, the study of these competitions forms\nan integral part of sports analytics. The Confederation of North, Central\nAmerica and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) announced a novel\nqualifying format for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in July 2019. However, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic forced the organisers to return to a more traditional\nstructure. The present chapter analyses how this reform impacted the chances of\nthe national teams to qualify. It is found that the probability of\nparticipating in the FIFA World Cup finals can change by more than 5 percentage\npoints under the assumption of fixed strengths for the teams. The idea behind\nthe original design, to divide the contestants into two distinct sets, is worth\nconsidering due to the increased competitiveness of the matches played by the\nstrongest and the weakest teams. We recommend mitigating the sharp nonlinearity\ncaused by the seeding policy via a probabilistic rule to the analogy of the NBA\ndraft lottery system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 12:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

We\nconsider infrastructure-assisted and mmWave-based scenarios in which the macro\nbase station (MBS) cannot directly provide the streaming service to vehicles\ndue to the short range of mmWave beams so that small mmWave base stations\n(mBSs) along the road deliver the desired videos to users. For a smoother\nstreaming service, the MBS proactively pushes video chunks to mBSs. This is\ndone to support vehicles that are currently covered and/or will be by each mBS.\nWe formulate the dynamic video delivery scheme that adaptively determines 1)\nwhich content, 2) what quality and 3) how many chunks to be proactively\ndelivered from the MBS to mBSs using Markov decision process (MDP). Since it is\ndifficult for the MBS to track all the channel conditions and the network\nstates have extensive dimensions, we adopt the deep deterministic policy\ngradient (DDPG) algorithm for the DRL-based video delivery scheme. This paper\nfinally shows that the DRL agent learns a streaming policy that pursues high\naverage quality while limiting packet drops, avoiding playback stalls, reducing\nquality fluctuations and saving backhaul usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 06:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

Based on the\nlargest dataset of its kind, we test the assumption that cost and benefit\nestimates of public investments are accurate and unbiased. We find this is not\nthe case with overwhelming statistical significance. We document the extent of\ncost overruns, benefit shortfalls, and forecasting bias in public investments.\nWe further assess whether such inaccuracies seriously distort effective\nresource allocation, which is found to be the case.
