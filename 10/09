Sulfur is used as a tracer of the evolution from interstellar clouds\nto stellar systems. However, most of the expected sulfur in molecular clouds\nremains undetected. Sulfur disappears from the gas phase in two steps. One\nfirst depletion occurs during the translucent phase, reducing the gas phase\nsulfur by 7-40 times, while the following freeze-out step occurs in molecular\nclouds, reducing it by another order of magnitude. This long-standing dilemma\nawaits an explanation. Aims. The aim of this study is to understand under which\nform the missing sulfur is hiding in molecular clouds. Depletion onto dust\ngrains is considered. Methods. Experimental simulations mimicking H2S ice\nUV-photoprocessing in molecular clouds were conducted. The ice was monitored\nusing infrared spectroscopy and the desorbing molecules were measured by\nquadrupole mass spectrometry. Theoretical Monte Carlo simulations were\nperformed for interpretation of the experimental results and extrapolation to\nastrophysical conditions. Results. H2S2 formation was observed during\nirradiation at 8 K. Molecules H2Sx with x > 2 were also identified and found to\ndesorb during warm-up, along with S2 to S4 species. Larger Sx molecules up to\nS8 are refractory at room temperature and remained on the substrate forming a\nresidue. Monte Carlo simulations were able to reproduce the molecules desorbing\nduring warming up, and found that residues are chains or sulfur consisting of\n6-7 atoms. Conclusions. We propose that S+ in translucent clouds contributes\nnotoriously to S depletion in denser regions by forming long S-chains on dust\nin few times 10^4 years. We suggest that the S2 to S4 molecules observed in\ncomets are not produced by fragmentation of these large chains. Instead, they\nprobably come either from UV-photoprocessing of H2S-bearing ice produced in\nmolecular clouds or from short S chains formed during the translucent cloud\nphase\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 16:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

It proposes a\nlearning framework for identifying promising controls during the expansion\nprocess of sampling-based planners. Given a dynamics model, a reinforcement\nlearning process is trained offline to return a low-cost control that reaches a\nlocal goal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles. By focusing on\nthe system's dynamics and not knowing the environment, this process is\ndata-efficient and takes place once for a robotic system. In this way, it can\nbe reused in different environments. The planner generates online local goal\nstates for the learned controller in an informed manner to bias towards the\ngoal and consecutively in an exploratory, random manner. For the informed\nexpansion, local goal states are generated either via (a) medial axis\ninformation in environments with obstacles, or (b) wavefront information for\nsetups with traversability costs. The learning process and the resulting\nplanning framework are evaluated for a first and second-order differential\ndrive system, as well as a physically simulated Segway robot.

By generalizing surface\nquasigeostrophic theory to account for variable stratification, we show that\nsurface buoyancy anomalies can generate a variety of dynamical regimes\ndepending on the stratification's vertical structure. Buoyancy anomalies\ngenerate longer range velocity fields over decreasing stratification and\nshorter range velocity fields over increasing stratification.

However, SAMs are reported to be\nparameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better\nperformance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by\nexploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such\nresearch might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used\nrouting methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly\nrouting inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model,\nTHOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). Unlike classic expert-based models,\nsuch as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each\ninput during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a\nconsistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data\nbut also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make\nconsistent predictions.

Saturn has an excess of irregular moons. This is thought to be the\nresult of past collisional events.

A recently announced centaur,\n2013 VZ70, follows an orbit that could be compatible with those of prograde\nSaturn's co-orbitals.\n  Aims. We perform an exploration of the short-term dynamical evolution of 2013\nVZ70 to confirm or reject a co-orbital relationship with Saturn. A possible\nconnection with Saturn's irregular moon population is also investigated.\n  Methods.

Near four dimensions, where the CFT is described by the\nWilson-Fisher fixed point of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, two of these phases\ncorrespond respectively to the choice of Neumann or Dirichlet boundary\ncondition on the scalar field, while the third one corresponds to the case\nwhere the bulk scalar field acquires a classical expectation value. One may\nflow between these boundary critical points by suitable relevant boundary\ndeformations. We compute the AdS free energy on each of them, and verify that\nits value is consistent with the boundary version of the F-theorem. We also\ncompute some of the BCFT observables in these theories, including bulk\ntwo-point functions of scalar and fermions, and four-point functions of\nboundary fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 17:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 23:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

In this paper, we tackle rapid adaptation to new tasks through\nthe framework of meta-learning, which utilizes past tasks to learn to adapt\nwith a specific focus on industrial insertion tasks. Fast adaptation is crucial\nbecause prohibitively large number of on-robot trials will potentially damage\nhardware pieces. Additionally, effective adaptation is also feasible in that\nexperience among different insertion applications can be largely leveraged by\neach other. In this setting, we address two specific challenges when applying\nmeta-learning. First, conventional meta-RL algorithms require lengthy online\nmeta-training. We show that this can be replaced with appropriately chosen\noffline data, resulting in an offline meta-RL method that only requires\ndemonstrations and trials from each of the prior tasks, without the need to run\ncostly meta-RL procedures online. Second, meta-RL methods can fail to\ngeneralize to new tasks that are too different from those seen at meta-training\ntime, which poses a particular challenge in industrial applications, where high\nsuccess rates are critical. We address this by combining contextual\nmeta-learning with direct online finetuning: if the new task is similar to\nthose seen in the prior data, then the contextual meta-learner adapts\nimmediately, and if it is too different, it gradually adapts through\nfinetuning. We show that our approach is able to quickly adapt to a variety of\ndifferent insertion tasks, with a success rate of 100% using only a fraction of\nthe samples needed for learning the tasks from scratch.

An encounter event of gas with a star can lead to the formation\nof a second-generation disk after the initial protostellar collapse phase.\nAdditionally, observations of shadows in disks can be well described by a\nconfiguration of misaligned inner and outer disk, such that the inner disk\ncasts a shadow on the outer disk. Carrying out altogether eleven 3D\nhydrodynamical models with the moving mesh code AREPO, we test whether a late\nencounter of an existing star-disk system with a cloudlet of gas can lead to\nthe formation of an outer disk that is misaligned with respect to the\nprimordial inner disk. Our models demonstrate that a second-generation disk\nwith large misalignment with respect to an existing primordial disk can easily\nform if the infall angle is large. The second-generation outer disk is more\neccentric, though the asymmetric infall also triggers eccentricity of the inner\ndisk of $e\\approx 0.05$ to $0.1$. Retrograde infall can lead to the formation\nof counter-rotating disks and enhanced accretion. As the angular momentum of\nthe inner disk is reduced, the inner disk shrinks and a gap forms between the\ntwo disks. The resulting misaligned disk system can survive for $\\sim 100$ kyr\nor longer without aligning each other even for low primordial disk masses given\nan infall mass of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$. A synthetic image reveals shadows\nin the outer disk similar to the ones observed in multiple transition disks\nthat are caused by the misaligned inner disk. We conclude that late inclined\ninfall onto a star-disk system leads to the formation of a misaligned outer\ndisk.

These parameters specify the behavior of twin radiation and the\nacoustic oscillations of twin baryons, which lead to testable effects on the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS). While\ncollider searches can only probe the twin VEV, through a fit to cosmological\ndata we show that the existing CMB (Planck18 TTTEEE+lowE+lowT+lensing) and LSS\n(KV450) data already provide useful constraints on the remaining MTH\nparameters. Additionally, we show that the presence of twin radiation in this\nmodel can raise the Hubble constant $H_0$ while the scattering twin baryons can\nreduce the matter fluctuations $S_8$, which helps to relax the observed $H_0$\nand $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. This scenario is different from the typical\n$\\Lambda$CDM + $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ model, in which extra radiation helps with\nthe Hubble tension but worsens the $S_8$ tension.

FL is unfortunately susceptible to poisoning by\nmalicious clients who aim to hamper the accuracy of the commonly trained model\nthrough sending malicious model updates during FL's training process.\n  We argue that the key factor to the success of poisoning attacks against\nexisting FL systems is the large space of model updates available to the\nclients, allowing malicious clients to search for the most poisonous model\nupdates, e.g., by solving an optimization problem. To address this, we propose\nFederated Rank Learning (FRL). FRL reduces the space of client updates from\nmodel parameter updates (a continuous space of float numbers) in standard FL to\nthe space of parameter rankings (a discrete space of integer values). To be\nable to train the global model using parameter ranks (instead of parameter\nweights), FRL leverage ideas from recent supermasks training mechanisms.\nSpecifically, FRL clients rank the parameters of a randomly initialized neural\nnetwork (provided by the server) based on their local training data. The FRL\nserver uses a voting mechanism to aggregate the parameter rankings submitted by\nclients in each training epoch to generate the global ranking of the next\ntraining epoch.\n  Intuitively, our voting-based aggregation mechanism prevents poisoning\nclients from making significant adversarial modifications to the global model,\nas each client will have a single vote!

A crucial task in analyzing such data is to identify and detect\nanomalous observations and events from the data with complex spatial and\ntemporal dependencies. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a widely\nused tool for anomaly detection. However, the traditional RPCA purely relies on\nthe global low-rank assumption while ignoring the local temporal correlations.\nIn light of this, this study proposes a Hankel-structured tensor version of\nRPCA for anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data. We treat the raw data with\nanomalies as a multivariate time series matrix (location $\\times$ time) and\nassume the denoised matrix has a low-rank structure. Then we transform the\nlow-rank matrix to a third-order tensor by applying temporal Hankelization. In\nthe end, we decompose the corrupted matrix into a low-rank Hankel tensor and a\nsparse matrix. With the Hankelization operation, the model can simultaneously\ncapture the global and local spatiotemporal correlations and exhibit more\nrobust performance. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem and use\ntensor nuclear norm (TNN) to approximate the tensor rank and $l_1$ norm to\napproximate the sparsity. We develop an efficient solution algorithm based on\nthe Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Despite having three\nhyper-parameters, the model is easy to set in practice.

Analogously, hierarchical reinforcement learning seeks to\nleverage lower-level policies for simple tasks to solve complex ones. However,\nbecause each lower-level policy induces a different distribution of states,\ntransitioning from one lower-level policy to another may fail due to an\nunexpected starting state. We introduce transition policies that smoothly\nconnect lower-level policies by producing a distribution of states and actions\nthat matches what is expected by the next policy. Training transition policies\nis challenging because the natural reward signal -- whether the next policy can\nexecute its subtask successfully -- is sparse. By training transition policies\nvia adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to match the distribution of\nexpected states and actions, we avoid relying on task-based reward. To further\nimprove performance, we use deep Q-learning with a binary action space to\ndetermine when to switch from a transition policy to the next pre-trained\npolicy, using the success or failure of the next subtask as the reward.\nAlthough the reward is still sparse, the problem is less severe due to the\nsimple binary action space.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a framework for fair regression under sample selection bias when\ndependent variable values of a set of samples from the training data are\nmissing as a result of another hidden process. Our framework adopts the classic\nHeckman model for bias correction and the Lagrange duality to achieve fairness\nin regression based on a variety of fairness notions.

This\npaper continues a series aimed at refining three-dimensional (3D)\nhydrodynamical models of disk instabilities, where the handling of the gas\nthermodynamics is a crucial factor.

However, it is difficult to\nevaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve\naccess to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the\nsemantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content.\nIn response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed\nby natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a\ngrounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of\nsemantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g.,\nmarks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g.,\nextrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena\n(e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights\n(e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be\napplied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct\na mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that\nthese reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as\nmost useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful\ninformation is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic\nvisualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly\ncommunicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our\nwork further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface\ncoequal with visualization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 23:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

The arrival of wide-field surveys such as\nthe Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) offers new\npossibilities for the study of GCs. Nevertheless, GCs are not detected a priori\nby the data reduction pipeline of J-PLUS and, due to its pixel scale, the\nstandard techniques of GCs detection are challenged. To fill this gap, we\ndevelop a semi-automatic pipeline to detect GCs in J-PLUS that can also be\nadapted to similar surveys. As a case study, we use data from the S0 galaxy NGC\n1023 and we also study the stellar population content of GC candidates in the\ngalaxy. To detect GCs, our methodology is based on Source Extractor and does\nnot require a previous filtering or modelling of the host galaxy. We study\ncolors and perform spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis on our final GC\ncandidate catalog to obtain stellar population parameters. In NGC 1023,\nGCFinder identifies 523 GC candidates. We observe evidence of color bimodality\nin a few broad-band colors but not on narrow-band colors. The SED analysis\nreveals a clear metallicity bimodality and we observe that narrow-band filters\nare very useful to constrain metallicities. We also identified a broad\nage-metallicity relation as well as a wide metallicity distribution that are\nevidence that NGC 1023 experienced accretion events in the past. It is the\nfirst time this kind of study is performed with J-PLUS data. By detecting GC\ncandidates in wide-field images without modeling the light of the galaxy,\nGCFinder becomes considerably faster, at a marginal loss of centrally-located\nGC candidates of about 7 percent. As GCFinder is entirely based on Source\nExtractor, it could be easily incorporated into automated software handling\nwide-field surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 00:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method on the RIS task, with our proposed TV-Net surpassing the\nstate-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 02:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

A significant challenge to achieve trust\ncalibration is to quantitatively estimate human trust in real-time.

The ``confident'' participants,\nas compared to the ``skeptical'' participants, have higher initial trust\nlevels, lose trust slower when they encounter low reliability operations, and\nhave higher trust levels during trust-repair after the low reliability\noperations.

However, in geographic SMR,\nthe communication bandwidths of replicas are different and constantly changing.\nTherefore, existing state transfer methods cannot fully utilize the available\nbandwidth, and their state transfer time becomes long. To overcome this\nproblem, our method divides the state into multiple chunks and assigns them to\nreplicas based on each replica's bandwidth so that the broader a replica's\nbandwidth is, the more chunks it transfers.

Transient and steady-state analyses of the proposed\nq-CLMS algorithm are performed and exact analytical expressions for mean\nanalysis, mean square error (MSE), excess mean square error (EMSE), mean square\ndeviation (MSD) and misadjustment are presented. Extensive experiments have\nbeen conducted and a good match between the simulation results and theoretical\nfindings is reported. The proposed q-CLMS algorithm is also explored for\nwhitening applications with satisfactory performance. A modification of the\nproposed q-CLMS algorithm called Enhanced $q$-CLMS (Eq-CLMS) is also proposed.\nThe Eq-CLMS algorithm eliminates the need for a pre-coded value of the\nq-parameter thereby automatically adapting to the best value. Extensive\nexperiments are performed on system identification and channel equalization\ntasks and the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform several benchmark and\nstate-of-the-art approaches namely Complex Least Mean Square (CLMS), Normalized\nComplex Least Mean Square (NCLMS), Variable Step Size Complex Least Mean Square\n(VSS-CLMS), Complex FLMS (CFLMS) and Fractional-ordered-CLMS (FoCLMS)\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 04:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

PNG parameterized by $f_{NL}$ leads to a scale-dependent correction to\nthe bias, and therefore a correction to the line intensity power spectrum.\nHowever, LIM experiences contamination from foreground emission, including\ninterloping emission lines from other redshifts which alter the power spectra\nof the maps at these scales, potentially biasing measurements of $f_{NL}$. Here\nwe model the effect of line interlopers on upcoming line intensity mapping\nprobes of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) from inflation. As an example, we\nconsider the $[\\rm CII]$ line at target redshift $z_t = 3.6$ to probe PNG, with\nthe important systematic concern being foreground contamination from CO lines\nresiding at redshifts different from the target redshift. We find interloper\nlines can lead to a significant bias and an increase in errors for our PNG\nconstraints, leading to a false positive for non-standard inflation models. We\nmodel how well the cross-correlation technique could reduce this interloper\ncontamination. We find the uncertainty of $f_{NL}$ reduces by factors of two\nand six for local and orthogonal shape PNG respectively, and by a factor of\nfive for local shape if we consider seven interloper lines, almost eliminating\nthe effect of interlopers. This work shows that using cross-power and\nauto-power spectra of line intensity maps jointly could potentially remove the\neffects of interlopers when measuring non-Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 05:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Furthermore,\nLiquid Haskell's support for refinement reflection enables the use of Haskell\nfor general-purpose mechanized theorem proving. A growing list of large-scale\nmechanized proof developments in Liquid Haskell take advantage of this\ncapability. Adding theorem-proving capabilities to a \"legacy\" language like\nHaskell lets programmers directly verify properties of real-world Haskell\nprograms (taking advantage of the existing highly tuned compiler, run-time\nsystem, and libraries), just by writing Haskell. However, more established\nproof assistants like Agda and Coq offer far better support for interactive\nproof development and insight into the proof state (for instance, what subgoals\nstill need to be proved to finish a partially-complete proof). In contrast,\nLiquid Haskell provides only coarse-grained feedback to the user -- either it\nreports a type error, or not -- unfortunately hindering its usability as a\ntheorem prover.\n  In this paper, we propose improving the usability of Liquid Haskell by\nextending it with support for Agda-style typed holes and interactive editing\ncommands that take advantage of them. In Agda, typed holes allow programmers to\nindicate unfinished parts of a proof, and incrementally complete the proof in a\ndialogue with the compiler.

The difficulty mainly comes from a lack of accurate and\nefficient exchange-correlation functional in elucidating the amphiphilic nature\nand the ubiquitous proton transfer behaviors of the two ions. By adopting the\nstrongly-constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional in\nAIMD simulations, we systematically examine the amphiphilic properties, the\nsolvation structures, the electronic structures, and the dynamic properties of\nthe two water ions. In particular, we compare these results to those predicted\nby the PBE0-TS functional, which is an accurate yet computationally more\nexpensive exchange-correlation functional. We demonstrate that the\ngeneral-purpose SCAN functional provides a reliable choice in describing the\ntwo water ions. Specifically, in the SCAN picture of water ions, the appearance\nof the fourth and fifth hydrogen bonds near hydroxide stabilizes the pot-like\nshape solvation structure and suppresses the structural diffusion, while the\nhydronium stably donates three hydrogen bonds to its neighbors. As a result,\nhydroxide prefers the stepwise proton transfer (PT) while hydronium prefers the\nconcerted PT behavior. Consequently, hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium\nin water, which is consistent with the experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 06:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 10:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

So far, many EMTO algorithms\nhave been developed and demonstrated well performance on solving real-world\nproblems. However, there remain many works to do in adapting knowledge transfer\nto task relatedness in EMTO. Different from the existing works, we develop a\nself-adaptive multi-task particle swarm optimization (SaMTPSO) through the\ndeveloped knowledge transfer adaptation strategy, the focus search strategy and\nthe knowledge incorporation strategy. In the knowledge transfer adaptation\nstrategy, each task has a knowledge source pool that consists of all knowledge\nsources. Each source (task) outputs knowledge to the task. And knowledge\ntransfer adapts to task relatedness via individuals' choice on different\nsources of a pool, where the chosen probabilities for different sources are\ncomputed respectively according to task's success rate in generating improved\nsolutions via these sources.

Drawing inspiration from this we find that a similar problem\nimpedes semi-supervised semantic segmentation and offer colour augmentation as\na solution, improving semi-supervised semantic segmentation performance on\nchallenging photographic imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 07:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Recent studies demonstrated that adversarial attacks against such\nmodels can maintain their effectiveness even when used on models other than the\none targeted by the attacker. This major property is known as transferability,\nand makes CNNs ill-suited for security applications. In this paper, we provide\nthe first comprehensive study which assesses the robustness of CNN-based models\nfor computer networks against adversarial transferability. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate whether the transferability property issue holds in computer\nnetworks applications. In our experiments, we first consider five different\nattacks: the Iterative Fast Gradient Method (I-FGSM), the Jacobian-based\nSaliency Map (JSMA), the Limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno BFGS\n(L- BFGS), the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and the DeepFool attack. Then,\nwe perform these attacks against three well- known datasets: the Network-based\nDetection of IoT (N-BaIoT) dataset, the Domain Generating Algorithms (DGA)\ndataset, and the RIPE Atlas dataset. Our experimental results show clearly that\nthe transferability happens in specific use cases for the I- FGSM, the JSMA,\nand the LBFGS attack. In such scenarios, the attack success rate on the target\nnetwork range from 63.00% to 100%. Finally, we suggest two shielding strategies\nto hinder the attack transferability, by considering the Most Powerful Attacks\n(MPAs), and the mismatch LSTM architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 07:20:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 09:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 12:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

This phenomenon has stimulated two interesting topics:\npruning the unimportant weights for compression and reactivating the\nunimportant weights to make full use of network capability. However, current\nweight reactivation methods usually reactivate the entire filters, which may\nnot be precise enough. Looking back in history, the prosperity of filter\npruning is mainly due to its friendliness to hardware implementation, but\npruning at a finer structure level, i.e., weight elements, usually leads to\nbetter network performance. We study the problem of weight element reactivation\nin this paper. Motivated by evolution, we select the unimportant filters and\nupdate their unimportant elements by combining them with the important elements\nof important filters, just like gene crossover to produce better offspring, and\nthe proposed method is called weight evolution (WE). WE is mainly composed of\nfour strategies. We propose a global selection strategy and a local selection\nstrategy and combine them to locate the unimportant filters. A forward matching\nstrategy is proposed to find the matched important filters and a crossover\nstrategy is proposed to utilize the important elements of the important filters\nfor updating unimportant filters.

The existing\nscaling and squaring algorithm (SSA) is not suitable for the computation of the\nlarge sparse matrix exponential as it requires greater memories and\ncomputational cost than is actually needed. By introducing two novel concepts,\ni.e., real bandwidth and bandwidth, to measure the sparsity of the matrix, the\nsparsity of the matrix exponential is analyzed. It is found that for every\nmatrix computed in the squaring phase of the SSA, a corresponding sparse\napproximate matrix exists. To obtain the sparse approximate matrix, a new\nfiltering technique in terms of forward error analysis is proposed. Combining\nthe filtering technique with the idea of keeping track of the incremental part,\na competitive algorithm is developed for the large sparse matrix exponential.\nThe proposed method can primarily alleviate the over-scaling problem due to the\nfiltering technique. Three sets of numerical experiments, including one large\nmatrix with a dimension larger than 2e6 , are conducted.

Recently,\nseveral studies attempt to address the FSRSSC problem by following few-shot\nnatural image classification methods. These existing methods have made\npromising progress and achieved superior performance. However, they all\noverlook two unique characteristics of remote sensing images: (i) object\nco-occurrence that multiple objects tend to appear together in a scene image\nand (ii) object spatial correlation that these co-occurrence objects are\ndistributed in the scene image following some spatial structure patterns. Such\nunique characteristics are very beneficial for FSRSSC, which can effectively\nalleviate the scarcity issue of labeled remote sensing images since they can\nprovide more refined descriptions for each scene class. To fully exploit these\ncharacteristics, we propose a novel scene graph matching-based meta-learning\nframework for FSRSSC, called SGMNet. In this framework, a scene graph\nconstruction module is carefully designed to represent each test remote sensing\nimage or each scene class as a scene graph, where the nodes reflect these\nco-occurrence objects meanwhile the edges capture the spatial correlations\nbetween these co-occurrence objects. Then, a scene graph matching module is\nfurther developed to evaluate the similarity score between each test remote\nsensing image and each scene class. Finally, based on the similarity scores, we\nperform the scene class prediction via a nearest neighbor classifier. We\nconduct extensive experiments on UCMerced LandUse, WHU19, AID, and\nNWPU-RESISC45 datasets.

In cooperative multi-agent systems,\ncomplex symmetries arise between different configurations of the agents and\ntheir local observations. For example, consider a group of agents navigating:\nrotating the state globally results in a permutation of the optimal joint\npolicy. Existing work on symmetries in single agent reinforcement learning can\nonly be generalized to the fully centralized setting, because such approaches\nrely on the global symmetry in the full state-action spaces, and these can\nresult in correspondences across agents. To encode such symmetries while still\nallowing distributed execution we propose a factorization that decomposes\nglobal symmetries into local transformations. Our proposed factorization allows\nfor distributing the computation that enforces global symmetries over local\nagents and local interactions. We introduce a multi-agent equivariant policy\nnetwork based on this factorization. We show empirically on symmetric\nmulti-agent problems that globally symmetric distributable policies improve\ndata efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 07:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 11:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Due to shifts in atomic energy levels,\nquantum sensors often have stringent requirements on their internal magnetic\nfield environment. Typically, background magnetic fields are attenuated using\nhigh permeability magnetic shielding, with the cancelling of residual and\nintroduction of quantisation fields implemented with coils inside the shield.\nThe high permeability shield, however, distorts all magnetic fields, including\nthose generated inside the sensor. Here, we demonstrate a solution by designing\nmultiple coils overlaid on a 3D-printed former to generate three uniform and\nthree constant linear gradient magnetic fields inside the capped cylindrical\nmagnetic shield of a cold atom interferometer. The fields are characterised\nin-situ and match their desired forms to high accuracy. For example, the\nuniform transverse field, $B_x$, deviates by less than $0.2$% over more than\n$40$% of the length of the shield. We also map the field directly using the\ncold atoms and investigate the potential of the coil system to reduce bias from\nthe quadratic Zeeman effect. This coil design technology enables targeted field\ncompensation over large spatial volumes and has the potential to reduce\nsystematic shifts and noise in numerous cold atom systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 08:04:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 12:28:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 09:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Temporal interaction network\nembedding can effectively mine the information in temporal interaction\nnetworks, which is of great significance to the above fields. Usually, the\noccurrence of an interaction affects not only the nodes directly involved in\nthe interaction (interacting nodes), but also the neighbor nodes of interacting\nnodes. However, existing temporal interaction network embedding methods only\nuse historical interaction relations to mine neighbor nodes, ignoring other\nrelation types. In this paper, we propose a multi-relation aware temporal\ninteraction network embedding method (MRATE). Based on historical interactions,\nMRATE mines historical interaction relations, common interaction relations, and\ninteraction sequence similarity relations to obtain the neighbor based\nembeddings of interacting nodes. The hierarchical multi-relation aware\naggregation method in MRATE first employs graph attention networks (GATs) to\naggregate the interaction impacts propagated through a same relation type and\nthen combines the aggregated interaction impacts from multiple relation types\nthrough the self-attention mechanism. Experiments are conducted on three public\ntemporal interaction network datasets, and the experimental results show the\neffectiveness of MRATE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 08:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Using these devices, we\nachieve high fidelity polarization generation with a polarization extinction\nratio up to 41.9 dB, fast polarization scrambling with a scrambling rate up to\n65 Mrad/s, and endless polarization control with a tracking speed up to 10\nKrad/s, all of which are best results in integrated optics. The demonstrated\ndevices unlock a drastically new level of performance and scales in\npolarization management devices, leading to a paradigm shift in polarization\nmanagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 08:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

The energy efficiency and\nproductivity of conventional solar still are unsatisfying and need improvement,\nwhich requires a deep understanding of the heat and mass transfer process in\nsolar still. In this work, the effect of the inner air circulation on the\nsystem's heat and mass transfer performance and energy efficiency are studied\ntheoretically and experimentally. The theoretical results reveal that a weak\nacceleration of the air circulation inside the SS will significantly increase\nits performance, due to the improved mass transfer process.

Besides, lower ambient temperature and higher ambient\nconvective heat transfer coefficient will decrease the energy efficiency. Given\nthe heat loss, the experimental energy efficiencies are only 3% to 6% lower\nthan the theoretical results, which indicates that the great performance\npredicted by the theory can be realized in practical application.

The investigation\nstarts with experiments to understand the effect of LTR speech on\ngeneral-purpose ASR. LTR speech with reversed segment duration of 5 ms - 50 ms\nis rendered and evaluated. For ASR training data augmentation with LTR speech,\ntraining sets are created by combining natural speech with different partitions\nof LTR speech.

Typically, observations/samples are from\nseveral heterogenous groups and the group membership of each observation/sample\nis unavailable, which poses a great challenge for graph structure learning. In\nthis article, we propose a method which can achieve Simultaneous Clustering and\nEstimation of Heterogeneous Graphs (briefly denoted as SCEHG) for\nmatrix-variate function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Unlike the\nconventional clustering methods which rely on the mean differences of various\ngroups, the proposed SCEHG method fully exploits the group differences of\nconditional dependence relationships among brain regions for learning cluster\nstructure. In essence, by constructing individual-level between-region network\nmeasures, we formulate clustering as penalized regression with grouping and\nsparsity pursuit, which transforms the unsupervised learning into supervised\nlearning. An ADMM algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding optimization\nproblem. We also propose a generalized criterion to specify the number of\nclusters. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the superiority of the SCEHG\nmethod over some state-of-the-art methods in terms of both clustering and graph\nrecovery accuracy. We also apply the SCEHG procedure to analyze fMRI data\nassociated with ADHD (abbreviated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder), which illustrate its empirical usefulness.

Towards this end,\nwe propose a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection and\nlocalization. Our method aims at learning dense and compact distribution from\nnormal images with a coarse-to-fine alignment process. The coarse alignment\nstage standardizes the pixel-wise position of objects in both image and feature\nlevels. The fine alignment stage then densely maximizes the similarity of\nfeatures among all corresponding locations in a batch. To facilitate the\nlearning with only normal images, we propose a new pretext task called\nnon-contrastive learning for the fine alignment stage. Non-contrastive learning\nextracts robust and discriminating normal image representations without making\nassumptions on abnormal samples, and it thus empowers our model to generalize\nto various anomalous scenarios. Extensive experiments on two typical industrial\ndatasets of MVTec AD and BenTech AD demonstrate that our framework is effective\nin detecting various real-world defects and achieves a new state-of-the-art in\nindustrial unsupervised anomaly detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 10:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 02:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Soft-robots\nprovide an opportunity to cover the lack of compliance in conventional\nactuation mechanisms, however, the control of them is very challenging given\ntheir intrinsic complex motions. Therefore, soft-robots require new approaches\nto e.g., modeling, control, dynamics, and planning. One of the control\nstrategies that ensures compliance is the impedance control. During the task\nexecution in the presence of coupling force and position constraints, a dynamic\nbehavior increases the flexibility of the impedance control. This imposes some\nadditional constraints on the stability of the control system. To tackle them,\nwe propose a variable impedance control in configuration space for a modular\nsoft robot manipulator (MSRM) in the presence of model uncertainties and\nexternal forces. The external loads are estimated in configuration space using\na momentum-based approach in order to reduce the calculation complexity, and\nthe adaptive back-stepping sliding mode (ABSM) controller is designed to guard\nagainst uncertainties. Stability analysis is performed using Lyapunov theory\nwhich guarantees not only the exponential stability of each state under the\ndesigned control law, but also the global stability of the closed-loop system.\nThe system performance is benchmarked against other conventional control\nmethods, such as the sliding mode (SM) and inverse dynamics PD controllers. The\nresults show the effectiveness of the proposed variable impedance control in\nstabilizing the position error and diminishing the impact of the external load\ncompared to SM and PD controllers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 12:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

We have performed detailed structural, ac\nmagnetic susceptibility and heat capacity studies on Ho$_{2}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{7}$ to\ninvestigate the interplay of structural disorder and frustrated interactions.\nThe zero-field ground state exhibits large magnetic susceptibility and remains\ndynamic down to 30 mK without showing Pauling's residual entropy. The dynamic\nstate is suppressed continuously with the magnetic field and freezing\ntransition evolves ($\\sim$ 10 K) at a field of $\\sim$ 10 kOe. These results\nsuggest that the alteration of chemical order and local strain in\nHo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$ prevents the development of spin ice state and provides\na new material to study the geometrical frustration based on the structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 12:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The wave kinetic equation describes the effective dynamics of the second\nmoments of the Fourier modes of the NLS solution at the kinetic timescale, and\nin the kinetic limit in which the size of the system diverges to infinity and\nthe strength of the nonlinearity vanishes asymptotically according to a\nspecified scaling law.\n  Here, we investigate the behavior of the joint distribution of these Fourier\nmodes and derive their effective limit dynamics at the kinetic timescale.

Such\nstatements are central to the formal derivations of all kinetic theories,\ndating back to the work of Boltzmann (Stosszahlansatz).

Research has mainly addressed the temporal dimension as time\nseries and the interaction of human body joints with a kinematic tree or by a\ngraph. This has decoupled the two aspects and leveraged progress from the\nrelevant fields, but it has also limited the understanding of the complex\nstructural joint spatio-temporal dynamics of the human pose. Here we propose a\nnovel Space-Time-Separable Graph Convolutional Network (STS-GCN) for pose\nforecasting. For the first time, STS-GCN models the human pose dynamics only\nwith a graph convolutional network (GCN), including the temporal evolution and\nthe spatial joint interaction within a single-graph framework, which allows the\ncross-talk of motion and spatial correlations. Concurrently, STS-GCN is the\nfirst space-time-separable GCN: the space-time graph connectivity is factored\ninto space and time affinity matrices, which bottlenecks the space-time\ncross-talk, while enabling full joint-joint and time-time correlations. Both\naffinity matrices are learnt end-to-end, which results in connections\nsubstantially deviating from the standard kinematic tree and the linear-time\ntime series. In experimental evaluation on three complex, recent and\nlarge-scale benchmarks, Human3.6M [Ionescu et al. TPAMI'14], AMASS [Mahmood et\nal. ICCV'19] and 3DPW [Von Marcard et al. ECCV'18], STS-GCN outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art, surpassing the current best technique [Mao et al. ECCV'20] by\nover 32% in average at the most difficult long-term predictions, while only\nrequiring 1.7% of its parameters. We explain the results qualitatively and\nillustrate the graph interactions by the factored joint-joint and time-time\nlearnt graph connections.\n  Our source code is available at: https://github.com/FraLuca/STSGCN\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 13:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

The proposed expressions for the\nmodified contact values of fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution\nfunctions include three terms.

For intermediate fluid\ndensities, the depletion contribution leads to an increase of the\nself-diffusion coefficient in comparison with the hard sphere fluid. For a\nsufficiently dense fluid, the self-diffusion coefficient strongly decreases due\nto a hard sphere effect.

However, the reported PM-OPDs with high\nresponsivity performances are all accompanied by high dark currents due to the\nintroduction of carrier traps, which inevitably results in inferior\ndetectivities. In this work, we modify a P3HT:PCBM donor-rich PM-OPD by\nintroducing an atomically thin Al2O3 interfacial layer through the ALD\ntechnique, obtaining a high responsivity of 8294 A/W and high detectivity of\n6.76*10^14 Jones, simultaneously, both of which are among the highest reported\nfor bulk heterojunction PM-OPDs.

To bridge this gap, we propose an uncertainty-informed framework to\ndiagnose faults and meanwhile detect the OOD dataset, enabling the capability\nof learning unknowns and achieving trustworthy fault diagnosis. Particularly,\nwe develop a probabilistic Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN) to\nquantify both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in fault diagnosis.

This results in trustworthy fault diagnosis and\nreduces the risk of erroneous decision-making, thus potentially avoiding\nundesirable consequences. The proposed framework is demonstrated by the fault\ndiagnosis of bearings with three OOD datasets attributed to random number\ngeneration, an unknown fault mode, and four common sensor faults, respectively.\nThe results show that the proposed framework is of particular advantage in\ntackling unknowns and enhancing the trustworthiness of fault diagnosis in\nsafety-critical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 21:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Most of\nthe literature provides a definition for the exceptional case of a single\nreaction step or gives an implicit definition that cannot be made explicit.\nThere are views that the reaction extent somehow has to tend to 1 when the\nreaction goes to completion as time tends to infinity.

The new general, explicit definition is\nalso valid for non-mass action kinetics.

We\nalso show how to apply this concept to exotic reactions: reactions with more\nthan one stationary state, oscillatory reactions, and reactions showing chaotic\nbehavior. The main advantage of the new definition of reaction extent is that\nby knowing the kinetic model of a reacting system one can now calculate not\nonly the time evolution of the concentration of each reacting species but also\nthe number of occurrences of the individual reaction events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 17:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 11:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 10:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 09:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}
