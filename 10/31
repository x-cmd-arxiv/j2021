It is based on a\nforest formula with linear operators applied to the Feynman amplitudes of\nultraviolet-divergent subdiagrams. The formula is similar to BPHZ; the\ndifference is only in the linear operators used and in the way of combining\nthem. The subtraction is equivalent to the on-shell renormalization from the\nbeginning: for obtaining the final result we should only sum up the\ncontributions of all Feynman diagrams after subtraction.

The theory of abstract interpretation provides a rich framework\nto devise invariant inference algorithms. One of the latest breakthroughs in\ninvariant inference is property-directed reachability (PDR), but the research\ncommunity views PDR and abstract interpretation as mostly unrelated techniques.\n  This paper shows that, surprisingly, propositional PDR can be formulated as\nan abstract interpretation algorithm in a logical domain. More precisely, we\ndefine a version of PDR, called $\\Lambda$-PDR, in which all generalizations of\ncounterexamples are used to strengthen a frame. In this way, there is no need\nto refine frames after their creation, because all the possible supporting\nfacts are included in advance. We analyze this algorithm using notions from\nBshouty's monotone theory, originally developed in the context of exact\nlearning. We show that there is an inherent overapproximation between the\nalgorithm's frames that is related to the monotone theory. We then define a new\nabstract domain in which the best abstract transformer performs this\noverapproximation, and show that it captures the invariant inference process,\ni.e., $\\Lambda$-PDR corresponds to Kleene iterations with the best transformer\nin this abstract domain. We provide some sufficient conditions for when this\nprocess converges in a small number of iterations, with sometimes an\nexponential gap from the number of iterations required for naive exact forward\nreachability. These results provide a firm theoretical foundation for the\nbenefits of how PDR tackles forward reachability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 19:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 09:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

These\n``temporal wormhole'' connections create a shortcut that allows the Neural\nNetwork to use the information available at deeper layers and re-do earlier\ncomputations with modulated inputs. End-to-end training is accomplished by\nusing appropriate calculations for a numeric iterate-to-fixed-point operator.\nIn a typical case, where the ``wormhole'' connections are inactive, this is\ninexpensive; but when they are active, the network takes a longer time to\nsettle down, and the gradient calculation is also more laborious, with an\neffect similar to making the network deeper. In contrast to the existing\nskip-connection concept, this proposed technique enables information to flow up\nand down in the network.

Our numerical results obtained using only far detector\ndata and supported by simple approximate analytical expressions of the\noscillation probabilities in matter, reveal that JD+KD has better sensitivities\nfor $|\\alpha_{21}|$ and $\\alpha_{22}$ as compared to DUNE, due to its larger\nstatistics in the appearance channel and less systematic uncertainties in the\ndisappearance channel, respectively. For $|\\alpha_{31}|$, $|\\alpha_{32}|$, and\n$\\alpha_{33}$, DUNE gives better constraints as compared to JD+KD, due to its\nlarger matter effect and wider neutrino energy spectrum. For $\\alpha_{11}$,\nboth DUNE and JD+KD give similar bounds. We also show how much the bounds on\nthe NUNM parameters can be improved by combining the prospective data from DUNE\nand JD+KD setups. We find that due to zero-distance effects, the near detectors\nalone can also constrain $\\alpha_{11}$, $|\\alpha_{21}|$, and $\\alpha_{22}$ in\nboth these setups. Finally, we observe that the $\\nu_\\tau$ appearance sample in\nDUNE can improve the constraints on $|\\alpha_{32}|$ and $\\alpha_{33}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 20:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

An eclipse model of the dips yields clump sizes and orbital\nradii of 0.5-8 and 5-150 white dwarf radii, respectively. The simultaneous UV\nlight curve shows no significant variations beyond slow fading. The RGS\nspectrum contains both residual shock emission at short wavelengths and the SSS\nemission at longer wavelengths. The shock temperature has clearly decreased\ncompared to an earlier Chandra observation (day 6). The dip spectrum is\ndominated by emission lines like in U Sco. The intensity of underlying\nblackbody-like emission is much lower with the blackbody normalisation yielding\na similar radius as during the brighter phases, while the lower bolometric\nluminosity is ascribed to lower T_eff. This would be inconsistent with clump\noccultations unless Compton scattering of the continuum emission reduces the\nphoton energies to mimic a lower effective temperature. However, systematic\nuncertainties are high. The absorption lines in the bright SSS spectrum are\nblue-shifted by 870+/-10 km/s before the dip and 900+/-10 km/s, after the dip.\nThe reproduction of the observed spectrum is astonishing, especially that only\na single absorbing layer is necessary while three such layers are needed to\nreproduce the RGS spectrum of V2491 Cyg. The ejecta of V3890 Sgr are thus more\nhomogeneous than many other SSS spectra indicate. Abundance determination is in\nprinciple possible but highly uncertain. Generally, solar abundances are found\nexcept for N and possibly O higher by an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 20:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Due to the sparsity of real-world graph data, GNN\nperformance is limited by extensive sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM)\noperations involved in computation. While the right sparse matrix storage\nformat varies across input data, existing deep learning frameworks employ a\nsingle, static storage format, leaving much room for improvement. This paper\ninvestigates how the choice of sparse matrix storage formats affect the GNN\nperformance. We observe that choosing a suitable sparse matrix storage format\ncan significantly improve the GNN training performance, but the right format\ndepends on the input workloads and can change as the GNN iterates over the\ninput graph. We then develop a predictive model to dynamically choose a sparse\nmatrix storage format to be used by a GNN layer based on the input matrices.\nOur model is first trained offline using training matrix samples, and the\ntrained model can be applied to any input matrix and GNN kernels with SpMM\ncomputation. We implement our approach on top of PyTorch and apply it to 5\nrepresentative GNN models running on a multi-core CPU using real-life and\nsynthetic datasets.

Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows originate from the interaction\nbetween the relativistic ejecta and the surrounding medium. Consequently, their\nproperties depend on several aspects: radiation mechanisms, relativistic shock\nmicro-physics, circumburst environment, and the structure and geometry of the\nrelativistic jet. While the standard afterglow model accounts for the overall\nspectral and temporal evolution for a number of GRBs, its validity limits\nemerge when the data set is particularly rich and constraining, especially in\nthe radio band.\n  Aims. We aimed to model the afterglow of the long GRB160131A (redshift $z =\n0.972$), for which we collected a rich, broadband, and accurate data set,\nspanning from $6\\times10^{8}$ to $7\\times10^{17}$ Hz in frequency, and from 330\ns to 160 days post burst in time.\n  Methods. We modelled the spectral and temporal evolution of this GRB\nafterglow through two approaches: the adoption of empirical functions to model\noptical/X-rays data set, later assessing their compatibility with the radio\ndomain; the inclusion of the entire multi-frequency data set simultaneously\nthrough the Python package named sAGa (Software for AfterGlow Analysis), to\ncome up with an exhaustive and self-consistent description of the\nmicro-physics, geometry, and dynamics of the afterglow.\n  Results. From deep broadband analysis (from radio to X-ray frequencies) of\nthe afterglow light curves, GRB160131A outflow shows evidence of jetted\nemission. Moreover, we observe dust extinction in the optical spectra, and\nenergy injection in the optical/X-ray data. Radio spectra are characterised by\nseveral peaks, that could be due to either interstellar scintillation (ISS)\neffects or a multi-component structure.\n  Conclusions. The inclusion of radio data in the broadband set of GRB160131A\nmakes a self-consistent modelling hardly attainable within the standard model\nof GRB afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 22:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 23:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

When the QIs store 14 modes,\nthe measured Bell parameter S for the QIs using the asymmetric and the\nsymmetric photon-collection channels are 2.36+/-0.03 and 2.24+/-0.04,\nrespectively, showing that the QI using the asymmetric channel gives rise to a\n3% increase in entanglement fidelity, i.e., a 1.7-fold decrease in the\nadditional noise, compared with the QI using the symmetric one. On the other\nhand, the 14-mode entanglement QIs that use the asymmetric and symmetric\ncollections preserve the violation of a Bell inequality for storage times up to\n25 us and 20 us, respectively, showing that the asymmetric QI has a higher\nentanglement storage performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 02:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

This indicates bodies at these\nsizes (and perhaps smaller) retain a record of how they were formed, and are\nthe most numerous record of that epoch. However, such bodies are impractical to\nfind by optical surveys due to their very low brightnesses. Their presence can\nbe inferred from the observed cratering record of Pluto and Charon, and\ndirectly measured by serendipitous stellar occultations. These two methods\nproduce conflicting results, with occultations measuring roughly ten times the\nnumber of ~km bodies inferred from the cratering record.

We find that models where the initial size of\nbodies decreases with increasing semimajor axis of formation, and models where\nthe surface density of bodies increases beyond the 2:1 mean-motion resonance\nwith Neptune can produce both sets of observations, though comparison to\nvarious observational tests favours the former mechanism.

Concretely, Actor-Critic (AC) framework is applied, where the Actor\nserves as a surrogate model to predict the performance on unknown designs,\nwhereas the actor encodes the sampling policy to be optimized. We design the\nupdating rule and propose two algorithms for the cases where the feasible\nspaces are continuous and discrete respectively. Some experiments are designed\nto validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms, including two toy\nexamples, which intuitively explain the algorithms, and two more complex tasks,\ni.e., adversarial attack task and RL task, which validate the effectiveness in\nlarge-scale problems. The results show that the proposed algorithms can\nsuccessfully deal with these problems. Especially note that in the RL task, our\nmethods give a new perspective to robot control by treating the task as a\nsimulation model and solving it by optimizing the policy generating process,\nwhile existing works commonly optimize the policy itself directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 09:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

An analytical laminar velocity profile for\nthis specific configuration was derived within a simplified nematohydrodynamic\nmodel in which the nematic order parameter is a fixed-magnitude unit vector n.\nIn this study we explore systematically active flows in this confined geometry\nwith a more general theoretical model that uses a second-rank tensor order\nparameter Q to express both the magnitude and orientation of the nematic phase.\nThe Q-model allows for the presence of defects and biaxial, in addition to\nuniaxial, molecular arrangements.

Several methods have been\ndeveloped to mitigate these lensing foreground biases, dividing broadly into\nmulti-frequency cleaning approaches and modifications to the estimator\ngeometry, but how to optimally combine these methods has not yet been explored\nin detail. In this paper, we examine which combination of lensing foreground\nmitigation strategies is best able to reduce the impact of foreground\ncontamination for a Simons-Observatory-like experiment while preserving maximal\nsignal-to-noise. Although the optimal combination obtained depends on whether\nbias- or variance-reduction are prioritized and on whether polarization data is\nused, generally, we find that combinations involving both geometric (profile\nhardening, source hardening or shear) and multifrequency (symmetric cleaning)\nmethods perform best. For lensing power spectrum measurements from temperature\n(polarization and temperature), our combined estimator methods are able to\nreduce the bias to the lensing amplitude below $\\sigma/4$ or 0.3% (0.1%), a\nfactor of 16 (30) lower than the standard QE bias, at a modest signal-to-noise\ncost of only 18% (12%). In contrast, single-method foreground-mitigation\napproaches struggle to reduce the bias to a negligible level below $\\sigma/2$\nwithout incurring a large noise penalty.

By\npredicative and constructive, we respectively mean that we do not assume\nVoevodsky's propositional resizing axioms or excluded middle. Our work\ncomplements existing work on predicative mathematics by exploring what cannot\nbe done predicatively in univalent foundations. Our first main result is that\nnontrivial (directed or bounded) complete posets are necessarily large. That\nis, if such a nontrivial poset is small, then weak propositional resizing\nholds. It is possible to derive full propositional resizing if we strengthen\nnontriviality to positivity. The distinction between nontriviality and\npositivity is analogous to the distinction between nonemptiness and\ninhabitedness. Moreover, we prove that locally small, nontrivial (directed or\nbounded) complete posets necessarily lack decidable equality. We prove our\nresults for a general class of posets, which includes e.g. directed complete\nposets, bounded complete posets, sup-lattices and frames. Secondly, the fact\nthat these nontrivial posets are necessarily large has the important\nconsequence that Tarski's theorem (and similar results) cannot be applied in\nnontrivial instances. Furthermore, we explain that generalizations of Tarski's\ntheorem that allow for large structures are provably false by showing that the\nordinal of ordinals in a univalent universe has small suprema in the presence\nof set quotients. The latter also leads us to investigate the\ninter-definability and interaction of type universes of propositional\ntruncations and set quotients, as well as a set replacement principle.

Rather than\ngenerating and evolving the modular compositions, a strategy is presented\nthrough which the unconventional optimal configurations can be mapped directly\nto the modular compositions. The generated modular composition is validated\nusing Robot Operating System for the motion planning between the prescribed\nworking locations in a given cluttered environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 13:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

In this paper, we design a privacy preserving\ntargeted advertising strategy for the wireless edge Metaverse.

To protect users'\nprivacy, the covert communication technique is used in the downlink. Then, the\nMSP can offer high-quality access services to earn more profits. Motivated by\nthe concept of \"covert\", targeted advertising is used to promote the sale of\nbandwidth and ensure that the advertising strategy cannot be detected by\ncompetitors who may make counter-offer and by attackers who want to disrupt the\nservices. We derive the best advertising strategy in terms of budget input,\nwith the help of the Vidale-Wolfe model and Hamiltonian function.

In recent years, methods that use transfer\nlearning from large Transformer-based language models like BERT, have achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in text classification tasks, including sentiment\nanalysis using labelled datasets. Researchers have quickly adopted these\napproaches to financial texts, but best practices in this domain are not\nwell-established. In this work, we propose a new model for financial sentiment\nanalysis based on supervised fine-tuned sentence embeddings from a standard\nBERT model. We demonstrate our approach achieves significant improvements in\ncomparison to vanilla BERT, LSTM, and FinBERT, a financial domain specific\nBERT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 15:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 13:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

This standard model involves two dark\ncomponents of the universe, dark energy and dark matter. Whereas dark energy is\nusually associated with the cosmological constant, we propose to explain dark\nmatter as a pure QCD effect, namely a gluonic Bose Einstein condensate,\nfollowing the transition from the quark gluon plasma phase to the colorless\nhadronic phase.\n  Our approach not only allows us to assume a ratio Dark/Visible equal to 11/2\nbut also provides gluons (and di-gluons, viewed as quasi-particles) with an\nextra mass of vibrational nature. Such an interpretation would comfort the idea\nthat, apart from the violation of the matter/antimatter symmetry satisfying the\nSakharov's conditions, the reconciliation of particle physics and cosmology\nneeds not the recourse to any ad hoc fields, particles or hidden variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 17:55:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 10:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

These optimizations are computationally\nexpensive due to the large number of multiphase flow simulations that must be\nconducted. In this work, we present an optimization framework in which these\nsimulations are performed with low-fidelity (LF) models. These LF models are\nconstructed from the underlying high-fidelity (HF) geomodel using a global\ntransmissibility upscaling procedure. Tree-based machine-learning methods,\nspecifically random forest and light gradient boosting machine, are applied to\nestimate the error in objective function value (in this case net present value,\nNPV) associated with the LF models. In the offline (preprocessing) step,\npreliminary optimizations are performed using LF models, and a clustering\nprocedure is applied to select a representative set of 100--150 well\nconfigurations to use for training. HF simulation is then performed for these\nconfigurations, and the tree-based models are trained using an appropriate set\nof features. In the online (runtime) step, optimization with LF models, with\nthe machine-learning correction, is conducted. Differential evolution is used\nfor all optimizations. Results are presented for two example cases involving\nthe placement of vertical wells in 3D bimodal channelized geomodels. We compare\nthe performance of our procedure to optimization using HF models. In the first\ncase, 25 optimization runs are performed with both approaches.

Increasing evidence indicates that induction mechanisms play a\ncrucial role in triggering emotions by simulating the sensations required for\nan experimental design. Over the years, many reviews have evaluated a passive\nelicitation mechanism where the user is an observer, ignoring the importance of\nself-relevance in emotional experience. So, in response to the gap in the\nliterature, this study intends to explore the possibility of using Virtual\nReality (VR) as an active mechanism for emotion induction. Furthermore, for the\nsuccess and quality of research settings, VR must select the appropriate\nmaterial to effectively evoke emotions. Therefore, in the present review, we\nevaluated to what extent VR visual and audio-visual stimuli, games, and tasks,\nand 360-degree panoramas and videos can elicit emotions based on the current\nliterature. Further, we present public datasets generated by VR and\nemotion-sensing interfaces that can be used in VR based research. The\nconclusions of this survey reveal that VR has a great potential to evoke\nemotions effectively and naturally by generating motivational and empathy\nmechanisms which makes it an ecologically valid paradigm to study emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 10:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}
