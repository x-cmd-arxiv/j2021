Since\nthese models are trained on a single image, they are limited in their scale and\napplication. To overcome these issues, we propose a meta-learning approach that\nenables training over a collection of images, in order to model the internal\nstatistics of the sample image more effectively. In the presented meta-learning\napproach, a single-image GAN model is generated given an input image, via a\nconvolutional feedforward hypernetwork $f$.

The large variability of cloth deformations\nhas motivated most of the current approaches to focus on identifying specific\ngrasping points rather than semantic parts, as the appearance and depth\nvariations of local regions are smaller and easier to model than the larger\nones. However, tasks like cloth folding or assisted dressing require\nrecognising larger segments, such as semantic edges that carry more information\nthan points. The first goal of this paper is therefore to tackle the problem of\nfine-grained region detection in deformed clothes using only a depth image.

Our\nmain observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an\nMPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to\nrepresent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy,\nand to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel\nvariants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph\nisomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of\nthese new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the\nexpressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we\nprovide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the\nsubgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our\narchitecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost,\nwe propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic\nversion of our framework.

In\ncontrast to a convolutional neural network, CapsNets are not vulnerable to\nobject deformation, as the relative spatial information of the objects is\npreserved across the network. However, their complexity is mainly related to\nthe capsule structure and the dynamic routing mechanism, which makes it almost\nunreasonable to deploy a CapsNet, in its original form, in a\nresource-constrained device powered by a small microcontroller (MCU). In an era\nwhere intelligence is rapidly shifting from the cloud to the edge, this high\ncomplexity imposes serious challenges to the adoption of CapsNets at the very\nedge.

Recently, a new type of sensor has been\ndeveloped - the optically pumped magnetometer (OPM). These sensors can be\nplaced directly on the scalp and move with the head during participant\nmovement, making them wearable. This opens up a range of exciting experimental\nand clinical opportunities for OPM-based MEG experiments, including paediatric\nstudies, and the incorporation of naturalistic movements into neuroimaging\nparadigms. However, OPMs face some unique challenges in terms of interference\nsuppression, especially in situations involving mobile participants, and when\nOPMs are integrated with electrical equipment required for naturalistic\nparadigms, such as motion capture systems. Here we briefly review various\nhardware solutions for OPM interference suppression. We then outline several\nsignal processing strategies aimed at increasing the signal from neuromagnetic\nsources. These include regression-based strategies, temporal filtering and\nspatial filtering approaches. The focus is on the practical application of\nthese signal processing algorithms to OPM data. In a similar vein, we include\ntwo worked-through experiments using OPM data collected from a whole-head\nsensor array. These tutorial-style examples illustrate how the steps for\nsuppressing external interference can be implemented, including the associated\ndata and code so that researchers can try the pipelines for themselves.

In particular, are the\ninteractions leading to LLPS exclusively those underlying the formation of\ndiscrete inter-domain complexes in homogeneous solutions? We address this\nquestion by developing a mean-field LLPS theory of two stoichiometrically\nconstrained solute species. The theory is applied to the neuronal proteins\nSynGAP and PSD-95, whose complex coacervate serves as a rudimentary model for\nneuronal postsynaptic densities (PSDs). The predicted phase behaviors are\ncompared with experiments. Previously, a three-SynGAP, two-PSD-95 ratio was\ndetermined for SynGAP/PSD-95 complexes in dilute solutions. However, when this\n3:2 stoichiometry is uniformly imposed in our theory encompassing both dilute\nand condensed phases, the tie-line pattern of the predicted SynGAP/PSD-95 phase\ndiagram differs drastically from that obtained experimentally. In contrast,\ntheories embodying alternate scenarios postulating auxiliary SynGAP-PSD-95 as\nwell as SynGAP-SynGAP and PSD-95-PSD-95 interactions in addition to those\nresponsible for stoichiometric SynGAP/PSD-95 complexes produce tie-line\npatterns consistent with experiment. Hence, our combined\ntheoretical-experimental analysis indicates that weaker interactions or\nhigher-order complexes beyond the 3:2 stoichiometry, but not yet documented,\nare involved in the formation of SynGAP/PSD-95 condensates, imploring future\nefforts to ascertain the nature of these auxiliary interactions in PSD-like\nLLPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 17:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

A common\nproblem is the need for manual clean-up after the MVS step, as 3D scans are\ntypically affected by noise and outliers and contain hairy surface regions that\nneed to be cleaned up by artists. Furthermore, mesh registration tends to fail\nfor extreme facial expressions. Most learning-based methods use an underlying\n3D morphable model (3DMM) to ensure robustness, but this limits the output\naccuracy for extreme facial expressions. In addition, the global bottleneck of\nregression architectures cannot produce meshes that tightly fit the ground\ntruth surfaces. We propose ToFu, Topologically consistent Face from multi-view,\na geometry inference framework that can produce topologically consistent meshes\nacross facial identities and expressions using a volumetric representation\ninstead of an explicit underlying 3DMM. Our novel progressive mesh generation\nnetwork embeds the topological structure of the face in a feature volume,\nsampled from geometry-aware local features. A coarse-to-fine architecture\nfacilitates dense and accurate facial mesh predictions in a consistent mesh\ntopology. ToFu further captures displacement maps for pore-level geometric\ndetails and facilitates high-quality rendering in the form of albedo and\nspecular reflectance maps. These high-quality assets are readily usable by\nproduction studios for avatar creation, animation and physically-based skin\nrendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric and correspondence\naccuracy, while only taking 0.385 seconds to compute a mesh with 10K vertices,\nwhich is three orders of magnitude faster than traditional techniques.

However, predicting realistic and representative statistics\nfor comparison with observations represents a significant challenge in the\ncontext of large-volume cosmological simulations. The THESAN project offers a\nunique framework for addressing such limitations by combining state-of-the-art\ngalaxy formation (IllustrisTNG) and dust models with the Arepo-RT\nradiation-magneto-hydrodynamics solver. In this initial study we present\nLyman-alpha centric analysis for the flagship simulation that resolves atomic\ncooling haloes throughout a (95.5 cMpc)^3 region of the Universe. To avoid\nnumerical artifacts we devise a novel method for accurate frequency-dependent\nline radiative transfer in the presence of continuous Hubble flow, transferable\nto broader astrophysical applications as well. Our scalable approach highlights\nthe utility of LAEs and red damping-wing transmission as probes of\nreionization, which reveal nontrivial trends across different galaxies,\nsightlines, and frequency bands that can be modelled in the framework of\ncovering fractions. In fact, after accounting for environmental factors\ninfluencing large-scale ionized bubble formation such as redshift and UV\nmagnitude, the variation across galaxies and sightlines mainly depends on\nrandom processes including peculiar velocities and self-shielded systems that\nstrongly impact unfortunate rays more than others. Throughout the EoR local and\ncosmological optical depths are often greater than or less than unity such that\nthe exp(-tau) behavior leads to anisotropic and bimodal transmissivity.

However, how this universal\nmany-body quantum chaotic regime emerges due to interactions remains largely a\npuzzle. This paper demonstrates using both heuristic arguments and a\nmicroscopic calculation that a dephasing mechanism, similar to\nAltshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitskii dephasing in the theory of localization,\nunderlies this transition to chaos. We focus on the behavior of the spectral\nform factor (SFF) as a function of \"time\", t, which characterizes level\ncorrelations in the many-body spectrum. The SFF can be expressed as a sum over\nperiodic classical orbits and its behavior hinges on the interference of\ntrajectories related to each other by a time translation. In the absence of\ninteractions, time-translation symmetry is present for each individual\nparticle, which leads to a fast exponential growth of the SFF and\ncorrespondingly loss of correlations between many-body levels. Interactions\nlead to dephasing, which disrupts interference, and breaks the massive\ntime-translation symmetry down to a global time-translation/energy\nconservation. This in turn gives rise to the hallmark linear-in-$t$ ramp in the\nSFF reflecting Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. This general picture is supported\nby a microscopic analysis of an interacting many-body model. Specifically, we\nstudy the complex $\\mbox{SYK}_2+\\mbox{SYK}_2^2$ model, which allows to tune\nbetween an integrable and chaotic regime. It is shown that the dephasing mass\nvanishes in the former case, which maps to the non-interacting $\\mbox{SYK}_2$\nmodel via a time reparameterization. In contrast, the chaotic regime gives rise\nto dephasing, which suppresses the exponential ramp of the non-interacting\ntheory and induces correlations between many-body levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 17:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

In\nthis article, we compute entropic order parameters in weakly coupled gauge\ntheories. To perform this computation, the natural route of evaluating\nexpectation values of physical (smeared) non-local operators is prevented by\nknown difficulties in constructing suitable smeared Wilson loops. We circumvent\nthis problem by studying the smeared non-local class operators in the enlarged\nnon-gauge invariant Hilbert space. This provides a generic approach for smeared\noperators in gauge theories and explicit formulas at weak coupling. In this\napproach, the Wilson and 't Hooft loops are labeled by the full weight and\nco-weight lattices respectively. We study generic Lie groups and discuss\ncouplings with matter fields. Smeared magnetic operators, as opposed to the\nusual infinitely thin ones, have expectation values that approach one at weak\ncoupling. The corresponding entropic order parameter saturates to its maximum\ntopological value, except for an exponentially small correction, which we\ncompute. On the other hand, smeared 't Hooft loops and their entropic disorder\nparameter are exponentially small. We verify that both behaviors match the\ncertainty relation for the relative entropies. In particular, we find upper and\nlower bounds (that differ by a factor of 2) for the exact coefficient of the\nlinear perimeter law for thin loops at weak coupling. This coefficient is\nunphysical/non-universal for line operators. We end with some comments\nregarding the RG flows of entropic parameters through perturbative beta\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 18:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 23:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

With the growing tendency of\ngraph nodes and edges, GCN training by single processor cannot meet the demand\nfor time and memory, which led to a boom into distributed GCN training\nframeworks research. However, existing distributed GCN training frameworks\nrequire enormous communication costs between processors since multitudes of\ndependent nodes and edges information need to be collected and transmitted for\nGCN training from other processors. To address this issue, we propose a Graph\nAugmentation based Distributed GCN framework(GAD). In particular, GAD has two\nmain components, GAD-Partition and GAD-Optimizer. We first propose a graph\naugmentation-based partition (GAD-Partition) that can divide original graph\ninto augmented subgraphs to reduce communication by selecting and storing as\nfew significant nodes of other processors as possible while guaranteeing the\naccuracy of the training. In addition, we further design a subgraph\nvariance-based importance calculation formula and propose a novel weighted\nglobal consensus method, collectively referred to as GAD-Optimizer. This\noptimizer adaptively reduces the importance of subgraphs with large variances\nfor the purpose of reducing the effect of extra variance introduced by\nGAD-Partition on distributed GCN training. Extensive experiments on four\nlarge-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly\nreduces the communication overhead (50%), improves the convergence speed (2X)\nof distributed GCN training, and slight gain in accuracy (0.45%) based on\nminimal redundancy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 18:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

Here, the effects of strong curvature can leave their imprint\non observables which we may use to study gravity. Recently, NICER provided a\nmass and radius measurement of an isolated neutron star using x-rays, while\nLIGO/Virgo measured the tidal deformability of neutron stars through\ngravitational waves. These measurements can be used to test the relation\nbetween the tidal deformability and compactness of neutron stars that are known\nto be universal in general relativity. Here, we take (shift-symmetric)\nscalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (motivated by a low-energy effective theory of a\nstring theory) as an example and study whether one can apply the NICER and\nLIGO/Virgo measurements to the universal relation to test the theory. To do so,\nthis paper is mostly devoted on theoretically constructing tidally-deformed\nneutron star solutions in this theory perturbatively and calculate the tidal\ndeformability for the first time. We find that the relation between the tidal\ndeformability and compactness remains to be mostly universal for a fixed\ndimensionless coupling constant of the theory though the relation is different\nfrom the one in general relativity. We also present a universal relation\nbetween the tidal deformability \\textbf{of} one neutron star and the\ncompactness for another neutron star that can be directly applied to\nobservations by LIGO/Virgo and NICER. For the equations of state considered in\nthis paper, it is still inconclusive whether one can place a meaningful bounds\non scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the new universal relations.

Training PINNs for forward\nproblems, however, pose significant challenges, mainly because of the complex\nnon-convex and multi-objective loss function. In this work, we present a PINN\napproach to solving the equations of coupled flow and deformation in porous\nmedia for both single-phase and multiphase flow. To this end, we construct the\nsolution space using multi-layer neural networks. Due to the dynamics of the\nproblem, we find that incorporating multiple differential relations into the\nloss function results in an unstable optimization problem, meaning that\nsometimes it converges to the trivial null solution, other times it moves very\nfar from the expected solution. We report a dimensionless form of the coupled\ngoverning equations that we find most favourable to the optimizer.\nAdditionally, we propose a sequential training approach based on the\nstress-split algorithms of poromechanics. Notably, we find that sequential\ntraining based on stress-split performs well for different problems, while the\nclassical strain-split algorithm shows an unstable behaviour similar to what is\nreported in the context of finite element solvers.

The brain of such interfaces is a\ncontrol model that detects the user's intention using sensor input and\ngenerates corresponding output (control commands). With recent advances in\ntechnology, AI-based policies have gained attention as control models for HMIs.\nHowever, supervised learning techniques require affluent amounts of labeled\ntraining data from the user, which is challenging in the context of lower-limb\nrehabilitation. Moreover, a static pre-trained model does not take the temporal\nvariations in the motion of the amputee (e.g., due to speed, terrain) into\naccount. In this study, we aimed to address both of these issues by creating an\nincremental training approach for a torque prediction model using incomplete\nuser-specific training data and biologically inspired temporal patterns of\nhuman gait. To reach this goal, we created a hybrid of two distinct approaches,\na generic inter-individual and an adapting individual-specific model that\nexploits the inter-limb synergistic coupling during human gait to learn a\nfunction that predicts the torque at the ankle joint continuously based on the\nkinematic sequences of the hip, knee, and shank.

The data generated by tracking is used in\nmany other downstream tasks, such as game event detection and game strategy\nanalysis. Player tracking and identification is a challenging problem since the\nmotion of players in hockey is fast-paced and non-linear when compared to\npedestrians. There is also significant camera panning and zooming in hockey\nbroadcast video. Identifying players in ice hockey is challenging since the\nplayers of the same team look almost identical, with the jersey number the only\ndiscriminating factor between players. In this paper, an automated system to\ntrack and identify players in broadcast NHL hockey videos is introduced. The\nsystem is composed of three components (1) Player tracking, (2) Team\nidentification and (3) Player identification. Due to the absence of publicly\navailable datasets, the datasets used to train the three components are\nannotated manually. Player tracking is performed with the help of a state of\nthe art tracking algorithm obtaining a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA)\nscore of 94.5%. For team identification, the away-team jerseys are grouped into\na single class and home-team jerseys are grouped in classes according to their\njersey color. A convolutional neural network is then trained on the team\nidentification dataset. The team identification network gets an accuracy of 97%\non the test set. A novel player identification model is introduced that\nutilizes a temporal one-dimensional convolutional network to identify players\nfrom player bounding box sequences. The player identification model further\ntakes advantage of the available NHL game roster data to obtain a player\nidentification accuracy of 83%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 22:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 22:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

In this paper, we present a fast, accurate, and\nreliable methodology to calibrate the SWAT model (i.e., 21 parameters) using\ndeep learning (DL). We develop DL-enabled inverse models based on convolutional\nneural networks to ingest streamflow data and estimate the SWAT model\nparameters.

The\nbehavioral parameter sets estimated by DL have narrower ranges than GLUE and\nproduce values within the sampling range even under high relative observational\nerrors.

This paper\nstudies the consistency of model prediction on counterfactual examples in deep\nnetworks under small changes to initial training conditions, such as weight\ninitialization and leave-one-out variations in data, as often occurs during\nmodel deployment. We demonstrate experimentally that counterfactual examples\nfor deep models are often inconsistent across such small changes, and that\nincreasing the cost of the counterfactual, a stability-enhancing mitigation\nsuggested by prior work in the context of simpler models, is not a reliable\nheuristic in deep networks.

Several methods\nhave been developed for controlling for the time-dependent confounding that\ntypically occurs. The most commonly used is inverse probability weighted\nestimation of marginal structural models (MSM-IPTW). An alternative, the\nsequential trials approach, is increasingly popular, in particular in\ncombination with the target trial emulation framework. This approach involves\ncreating a sequence of `trials' from new time origins, restricting to\nindividuals as yet untreated and meeting other eligibility criteria, and\ncomparing treatment initiators and non-initiators. Individuals are censored\nwhen they deviate from their treatment status at the start of each `trial'\n(initiator/non-initiator) and this is addressed using inverse probability of\ncensoring weights. The analysis is based on data combined across trials. We\nshow that the sequential trials approach can estimate the parameter of a\nparticular MSM, and compare it to a MSM-IPTW with respect to the estimands\nbeing identified, the assumptions needed and how data are used differently. We\nshow how both approaches can estimate the same marginal risk differences. The\ntwo approaches are compared using a simulation study. The sequential trials\napproach, which tends to involve less extreme weights than MSM-IPTW, results in\ngreater efficiency for estimating the marginal risk difference at most\nfollow-up times, but this can, in certain scenarios, be reversed at late time\npoints.

We present a statistical theory concerning the maximum entropy\ndistributions of velocity, speed, and energy for system involving a power-law\ninteraction with an arbitrary exponent $n$.

It is known that\ncomputing $d_\\mathrm{GH}$ between two finite metric spaces is NP-hard, even in\nthe case of finite ultrametric spaces which are highly structured metric spaces\nin the sense that they satisfy the so-called \\emph{strong triangle inequality}.\nUltrametric spaces naturally arise in many applications such as hierarchical\nclustering, phylogenetics, genomics, and even linguistics. By exploiting the\nspecial structures of ultrametric spaces, (1) we identify a one parameter\nfamily $\\{d_\\mathrm{GH}^{(p)}\\}_{p\\in[1,\\infty]}$ of distances defined in a\nflavor similar to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance on the collection of finite\nultrametric spaces, and in particular $d_\\mathrm{GH}^{(1)} =d_\\mathrm{GH}$.

Whereas for\nall $p\\in[1,\\infty)$, $d_\\mathrm{GH}^{(p)}$ yields NP-hard problems, we prove\nthat surprisingly $u_\\mathrm{GH}$ can be computed in polynomial time. The proof\nis based on a structural theorem for $u_\\mathrm{GH}$ established in this paper;\n(2) inspired by the structural theorem for $u_\\mathrm{GH}$, and by carefully\nleveraging properties of ultrametric spaces, we also establish a structural\ntheorem for $d_\\mathrm{GH}$ when restricted to ultrametric spaces.

Infrared\n(IR) cameras are robust under such conditions and can be helpful in real-world\napplications. Though thermal cameras are widely used for military applications\nand increasingly for commercial applications, there is a lack of robust\nalgorithms to robustly exploit the thermal imagery due to the limited\navailability of labeled thermal data.

No closed-form\nsolutions are available for MSLP and the definition of non-anticipative\npolicies with high-quality out-of-sample performance is crucial. Linear\ndecision rules (LDR) provide an interesting simulation-based framework for\nfinding high-quality policies for MSLP through two-stage stochastic models. In\npractical applications, however, the number of parameters to be estimated when\nusing an LDR may be close to or higher than the number of scenarios of the\nsample average approximation problem, thereby generating an in-sample overfit\nand poor performances in out-of-sample simulations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel regularized LDR to solve MSLP based on the AdaLASSO (adaptive least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator). The goal is to use the parsimony\nprinciple, as largely studied in high-dimensional linear regression models, to\nobtain better out-of-sample performance for LDR applied to MSLP.

It normally relies\non a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and make flying/driving\ndecisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the obstacle in the path or\nmoving away from the detected obstacle. In this paper, we explore new security\nrisks associated with the stereo vision-based depth estimation algorithms used\nfor obstacle avoidance. By exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in\ndepth estimation algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we\npropose DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by\nprojecting pure light from two complementary light sources.\n  DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs\nattack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs respectively\nto cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two commercial stereo\ncameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel RealSense). The\nvisualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras illustrates the\nfalse stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use Ardupilot to\nsimulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To validate the\nattack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards a commercial\ndrone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance algorithms. Our attack\ncan continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden stop or drift it away across\na long distance under various lighting conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion\nmechanisms. Specifically, our experimental results show that DoubleStar creates\nfake depth up to 15 meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the\ndaytime.

Firstly, by leverage of a variant of the gross\nerror model in robust statistics, we decompose the value distribution into its\nexpectation and the remaining distribution part.

This disconnect leads to an\ninteresting and unexplored problem in offline RL: Is it possible to use a\nrichly processed offline dataset to train a policy which has access to fewer\nfeatures in the online environment? In this work, we introduce and formalize\nthis novel resource-constrained problem setting. We highlight the performance\ngap between policies trained using the full offline dataset and policies\ntrained using limited features. We address this performance gap with a policy\ntransfer algorithm which first trains a teacher agent using the offline dataset\nwhere features are fully available, and then transfers this knowledge to a\nstudent agent that only uses the resource-constrained features. To better\ncapture the challenge of this setting, we propose a data collection procedure:\nResource Constrained-Datasets for RL (RC-D4RL). We evaluate our transfer\nalgorithm on RC-D4RL and the popular D4RL benchmarks and observe consistent\nimprovement over the baseline (TD3+BC without transfer).

However,\nthe classical formulation of logistic regression relies on the independent\nsampling assumption, which is often violated when the outcomes interact through\nan underlying network structure. This necessitates the development of models\nthat can simultaneously handle both the network peer-effect (arising from\nneighborhood interactions) and the effect of high-dimensional covariates. In\nthis paper, we develop a framework for incorporating such dependencies in a\nhigh-dimensional logistic regression model by introducing a quadratic\ninteraction term, as in the Ising model, designed to capture pairwise\ninteractions from the underlying network. The resulting model can also be\nviewed as an Ising model, where the node-dependent external fields linearly\nencode the high-dimensional covariates. We propose a penalized maximum\npseudo-likelihood method for estimating the network peer-effect and the effect\nof the covariates, which, in addition to handling the high-dimensionality of\nthe parameters, conveniently avoids the computational intractability of the\nmaximum likelihood approach. Consequently, our method is computationally\nefficient and, under various standard regularity conditions, our estimate\nattains the classical high-dimensional rate of consistency. In particular, our\nresults imply that even under network dependence it is possible to consistently\nestimate the model parameters at the same rate as in classical logistic\nregression, when the true parameter is sparse and the underlying network is not\ntoo dense. As a consequence of the general results, we derive the rates of\nconsistency for various natural network models.

Because\ndetailed modeling of the dynamical evolution of these structures is\ncomputationally costly, an efficient method for computing approximate but quick\nphysics-based solutions is to rely on space integrated 0D simulations. The\nenthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops EBTEL framework is a commonly used\nmethod to study the exchange of mass and energy between the corona and\ntransition region. EBTEL solves for density, temperature, and pressure averaged\nover the coronal part of the loop, the velocity at the coronal base, and the\ninstantaneous differential emission measure distribution in the transition\nregion. The current single-fluid version of the code, EBTEL2, assumes that at\nall stages the flows are subsonic. However, sometimes the solutions show the\npresence of supersonic flows during the impulsive phase of heat input. It is\nthus necessary to account for this effect. Here, we upgrade EBTEL2 to EBTEL3 by\nincluding the kinetic energy term in the Navier-Stokes equation. We compare the\nsolutions from EBTEL3 with those obtained using EBTEL2 as well as the\nstate-of-the-art field-aligned hydrodynamics code HYDRAD. We find that the\nmatch in pressure between EBTEL3 and HYDRAD is better than that between EBTEL2\nand HYDRAD. Additionally, the velocities predicted by EBTEL3 are in close\nagreement with those obtained with HYDRAD when the flows are subsonic. However,\nEBTEL3 solutions deviate substantially from HYDRAD's when the latter predicts\nsupersonic flows. Using the mismatches in the solution, we propose a criterion\nto determine the conditions under which EBTEL can be used to study flows in the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 06:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Since an exhaustive search of those spaces is not\nfeasible, humans utilize relevant domain knowledge to condense the search\nspace. Previously, deep learning agents (DLAgents) were introduced to use\nvisual imitation learning to model design domain knowledge. This note builds on\nDLAgents and integrates them with one-step lookahead search to develop\ngoal-directed agents capable of enhancing learned strategies for sequentially\ngenerating designs. Goal-directed DLAgents can employ human strategies learned\nfrom data along with optimizing an objective function. The visual imitation\nnetwork from DLAgents is composed of a convolutional encoder-decoder network,\nacting as a rough planning step that is agnostic to feedback. Meanwhile, the\nlookahead search identifies the fine-tuned design action guided by an\nobjective. These design agents are trained on an unconstrained truss design\nproblem that is modeled as a sequential, action-based configuration design\nproblem. The agents are then evaluated on two versions of the problem: the\noriginal version used for training and an unseen constrained version with an\nobstructed construction space. The goal-directed agents outperform the human\ndesigners used to train the network as well as the previous objective-agnostic\nversions of the agent in both scenarios. This illustrates a design agent\nframework that can efficiently use feedback to not only enhance learned design\nstrategies but also adapt to unseen design problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 07:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

We assume that the colors produced by the geometric scanner camera and\nthe color camera sensor are different and therefore characterized by different\nchromatic acquisition properties. Under these multimodal conditions, we find\nthe transformation between the camera image and the point cloud colors. We\nalternately optimize for aligning the position of the point cloud and matching\nthe different color spaces. The alignments produced by the proposed method are\ndemonstrated on both synthetic data with quantitative evaluation and real\nscenes with qualitative results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 08:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 13:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Here the\nterm \"polynomial\" refers to the bound on the query sizes, as the running time\nof any kernel is required to be polynomial. One of the most important open\ngoals in parameterized complexity is to understand the applicability and\nlimitations of polynomial Turing Kernels. As any fixed-parameter tractable\nproblem admits a Turing kernel of some size, the focus has mostly being on\ndetermining which problems admit such kernels whose query sizes can be indeed\nbounded by some polynomial.\n  In this paper we take a different approach, and instead focus on the number\nof queries that a Turing kernel uses, assuming it is restricted to using only\npolynomial sized queries. Our study focuses on one the main problems studied in\nparameterized complexity, the Clique problem: Given a graph $G$ and an integer\n$k$, determine whether there are $k$ pairwise adjacent vertices in $G$. We show\nthat Clique parameterized by several structural parameters exhibits the\nfollowing phenomena:\n  - It admits polynomial Turing kernels which use a sublinear number of\nqueries, namely $O(n/\\log^c n)$ queries where $n$ is the total size of the\ngraph and $c$ is any constant. This holds even for a very restrictive type of\nTuring kernels which we call OR-kernels.\n  - It does not admit polynomial Turing kernels which use $O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$\nqueries, unless NP$\\subseteq$coNP/poly.\n  For proving the second item above, we develop a new framework for bounding\nthe number of queries needed by polynomial Turing kernels.

Most existing detection methods train a binary\nclassifier under global supervision to judge real or fake. However, advanced\nmanipulations only perform small-scale tampering, posing challenges to\ncomprehensively capture subtle and local forgery artifacts, especially in high\ncompression settings and cross-dataset scenarios. To address such limitations,\nwe propose a novel framework named Multi-modal Contrastive Classification by\nLocally Correlated Representations(MC-LCR), for effective face forgery\ndetection. Instead of specific appearance features, our MC-LCR aims to amplify\nimplicit local discrepancies between authentic and forged faces from both\nspatial and frequency domains. Specifically, we design the shallow style\nrepresentation block that measures the pairwise correlation of shallow feature\nmaps, which encodes local style information to extract more discriminative\nfeatures in the spatial domain. Moreover, we make a key observation that subtle\nforgery artifacts can be further exposed in the patch-wise phase and amplitude\nspectrum and exhibit different clues. According to the complementarity of\namplitude and phase information, we develop a patch-wise amplitude and phase\ndual attention module to capture locally correlated inconsistencies with each\nother in the frequency domain. Besides the above two modules, we further\nintroduce the collaboration of supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy\nloss.

This enables us both to use continuous states and actions and to learn\nwith sparse rewards.

On Earth,\nthe long-term carbonate silicate cycle is able to regulate surface temperatures\nover timescales larger than one million years. Elevated temperatures enhance\nweathering, removing CO$_2$ from the atmosphere, which is subducted into the\nmantle. At mid-ocean ridges, CO$_2$ is supplied to the atmosphere from the\ninterior. The carbon degassing flux is controlled by the melting depth beneath\nmid-ocean ridges and the spreading rate, influenced by the pressure- and\ntemperature-dependent mantle viscosity. The influences of temperature and\npressure on mantle degassing become increasingly important for more massive\nplanets. Here, we couple a thermal evolution model of Earth-like planets of\ndifferent masses with a model of the long-term carbon cycle and assess their\nsurface temperature evolution. We find that the spreading rate at 4.5 Gyr\nincreases with planetary mass up to 3 $M_\\oplus$, since the\ntemperature-dependence of viscosity dominates over its pressure-dependency. For\nhigher mass planets, pressure-dependence dominates and the plates slow down. In\naddition, the effective melting depth at 4.5 Gyr as a function of planetary\nmass has its maximum at 3 $M_\\oplus$. Altogether, at 4.5 Gyr, the degassing\nrate and therefore surface temperature have their maximum at 3 $M_\\oplus$. This\nwork emphasizes that both age and mass should be considered when predicting the\nhabitability of exoplanets. Despite these effects, the long-term carbon cycle\nremains an effective mechanism that regulates the surface temperature of\nmassive Earth-like planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 09:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

This paper\npresents a practical evasion attack, EvadeDroid, to circumvent black-box\nAndroid malware detectors. In addition to generating real-world adversarial\nmalware, the proposed evasion attack can also preserve the functionality of the\noriginal malware samples.

While deep models have achieved remarkable progress in\ngeneral object detection, they are not satisfying enough in complex indoor\nscenes. The indoor surveillance video often includes cluttered background\nobjects, among which heads have small scales and diverse poses. In this paper,\nwe propose Motion-aware Pseudo Siamese Network (MPSN), an end-to-end approach\nthat leverages head motion information to guide the deep model to extract\neffective head features in indoor scenarios. By taking the pixel-wise\ndifference of adjacent frames as the auxiliary input, MPSN effectively enhances\nhuman head motion information and removes the irrelevant objects in the\nbackground. Compared with prior methods, it achieves superior performance on\nthe two indoor video datasets. Our experiments show that MPSN successfully\nsuppresses static background objects and highlights the moving instances,\nespecially human heads in indoor videos. We also compare different methods to\ncapture head motion, which demonstrates the simplicity and flexibility of MPSN.\nTo validate the robustness of MPSN, we conduct adversarial experiments with a\nmathematical solution of small perturbations for robust model selection.\nFinally, for confirming its potential in building control systems, we apply\nMPSN to occupancy counting.

On the contrary, centralized machine learning\n(ML) techniques have demonstrated a significant potential in handling different\nchallenges relating to wireless communication systems. Specifically, it was\nshown that ML algorithms exhibit superior capabilities in handling complicated\nnetwork tasks, such as channel equalization, estimation and modeling, resources\nallocation, and opportunistic spectrum access control, to name a few.\nNevertheless, concerns pertaining to privacy and communication overhead when\nsharing raw data of the involved clients with a server constitute major\nbottlenecks in the implementation of centralized ML techniques. This has\nmotivated the emergence of a new distributed ML paradigm, namely federated\nlearning (FL), which can reduce the cost associated with transferring raw data,\nand preserve privacy by training ML models locally and collaboratively at the\nclients' side. Hence, it becomes evident that integrating FL into VLC networks\ncan provide ubiquitous and reliable implementation of VLC systems. With this\nmotivation, this is the first in-depth review in the literature on the\napplication of FL in VLC networks. To that end, besides the different\narchitectures and related characteristics of FL, we provide a thorough overview\non the main design aspects of FL based VLC systems. Finally, we also highlight\nsome potential future research directions of FL that are envisioned to\nsubstantially enhance the performance and robustness of VLC systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 10:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

When\ntraining a flexible discriminative model using a strictly proper loss, such\nnoise will inevitably shift the solution towards the conditional distribution\nover noisy labels. Nevertheless, while deep neural networks have proven capable\nof fitting random labels, regularisation and the use of robust loss functions\nempirically mitigate the effects of label noise. However, such observations\nconcern robustness in accuracy, which is insufficient if reliable uncertainty\nquantification is critical. We demonstrate this by analysing the properties of\nthe conditional distribution over noisy labels for an input-dependent noise\nmodel. In addition, we evaluate the set of robust loss functions characterised\nby noise-insensitive, asymptotic risk minimisers. We find that strictly proper\nand robust loss functions both offer asymptotic robustness in accuracy, but\nneither guarantee that the final model is calibrated. Moreover, even with\nrobust loss functions, overfitting is an issue in practice. With these results,\nwe aim to explain observed robustness of common training practices, such as\nearly stopping, to label noise. In addition, we aim to encourage the\ndevelopment of new noise-robust algorithms that not only preserve accuracy but\nthat also ensure reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 10:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 14:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

The earlier, lower value is due to\nan overestimate of the emission volume together with an omission of the\ndependence of the minimum magnetic field on the synchrotron spectral index.\nSince the source is partially resolved, this implies a low volume filling\nfactor for the synchrotron emission.

Due to the large\nnumber of base station antennas in massive MIMO, accurate covariance estimation\nis challenging especially in the case where the number of samples is limited\nand thus comparable to the channel vector dimension. As a result, the standard\nsample covariance estimator may yield a too large estimation error which in\nturn may yield significant system performance degradation with respect to the\nideal channel covariance knowledge case.

However, it\nis often challenging to design neural network architectures that respect these\nsymmetries while being expressive and computationally efficient. For example,\nEuclidean motion invariant/equivariant graph or point cloud neural networks. We\nintroduce Frame Averaging (FA), a general purpose and systematic framework for\nadapting known (backbone) architectures to become invariant or equivariant to\nnew symmetry types. Our framework builds on the well known group averaging\noperator that guarantees invariance or equivariance but is intractable. In\ncontrast, we observe that for many important classes of symmetries, this\noperator can be replaced with an averaging operator over a small subset of the\ngroup elements, called a frame. We show that averaging over a frame guarantees\nexact invariance or equivariance while often being much simpler to compute than\naveraging over the entire group. Furthermore, we prove that FA-based models\nhave maximal expressive power in a broad setting and in general preserve the\nexpressive power of their backbone architectures. Using frame averaging, we\npropose a new class of universal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), universal\nEuclidean motion invariant point cloud networks, and Euclidean motion invariant\nMessage Passing (MP) GNNs.

However, for most datasets that are used by\npractitioners to build industrial NLP applications, it is hard to guarantee the\npresence of any noise in the data. While most transformer based NLP models have\nperformed exceedingly well in transferring the learnings from one dataset to\nanother, it remains unclear how these models perform when fine-tuned on noisy\ntext. We address the open question by Kumar et al.

We show (via experimental\nresults) that these models perform badly on most common NLP tasks namely text\nclassification, textual similarity, NER, question answering, text summarization\non benchmark datasets. We further show that as the noise in data increases, the\nperformance degrades.

The protoplanetary disk around the star HD 100546 displays prominent\nsubstructures in the form of two concentric rings. Recent observations with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed these\nfeatures with high angular resolution and have resolved the faint outer ring\nwell. This allows us to study the nature of the system further.\n  Aims. Our aim is to constrain some of the properties of potential planets\nembedded in the disk, assuming that they induce the observed rings and gaps.\n  Methods. We present the self-calibrated $0.9\\,$mm ALMA observations of the\ndust continuum emission from the circumstellar disk around HD 100546. These\nobservations reveal substructures in the disk that are consistent with two\nrings, the outer ring being much fainter than the inner one. We reproduced this\nappearance closely with a numerical model that assumes two embedded planets. We\nvaried planet and disk parameters in the framework of the planet-disk\ninteraction code FARGO3D and used the outputs for the gas and dust distribution\nto generate synthetic observations with the code RADMC-3D.\n  Results. From this comparison, we find that an inner planet located at $r_1 =\n13\\,$au with a mass $M_1 = 8 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$ and an outer planet located at $r_2\n= 143\\,$au with a mass $M_2 = 3 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$ leads to the best agreement\nbetween synthetic and ALMA observations (deviation less than $3\\sigma$ for the\nnormalized radial profiles). To match the very low brightness of the outer\nstructure relative to the inner ring, the initial disk gas surface density\nprofile needs to follow an exponentially tapered power law (self-similar\nsolution), rather than a simple power-law profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 12:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 20:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

However, most recent\nresearches have focused on anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel\nanomaly segmentation network (AnoSeg) that can directly generate an accurate\nanomaly map using self-supervised learning. For highly accurate anomaly\nsegmentation, the proposed AnoSeg considers three novel techniques: Anomaly\ndata generation based on hard augmentation, self-supervised learning with\npixel-wise and adversarial losses, and coordinate channel concatenation. First,\nto generate synthetic anomaly images and reference masks for normal data, the\nproposed method uses hard augmentation to change the normal sample\ndistribution. Then, the proposed AnoSeg is trained in a self-supervised\nlearning manner from the synthetic anomaly data and normal data. Finally, the\ncoordinate channel, which represents the pixel location information, is\nconcatenated to an input of AnoSeg to consider the positional relationship of\neach pixel in the image. The estimated anomaly map can also be utilized to\nimprove the performance of anomaly detection. Our experiments show that the\nproposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection and anomaly\nsegmentation methods for the MVTec AD dataset. In addition, we compared the\nproposed method with the existing methods through the intersection over union\n(IoU) metric commonly used in segmentation tasks and demonstrated the\nsuperiority of our method for anomaly segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 12:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

The main issue is that the linear and non-linear\noperations are entangled in every layer, making it hard to interpret the hidden\nlayer outputs. In this paper, we look at DNNs with rectified linear units\n(ReLUs), and focus on the gating property (`on/off' states) of the ReLUs. We\nextend the recently developed dual view in which the computation is broken\npath-wise to show that learning in the gates is more crucial, and learning the\nweights given the gates is characterised analytically via the so called neural\npath kernel (NPK) which depends on inputs and gates. In this paper, we present\nnovel results to show that convolution with global pooling and skip connection\nprovide respectively rotational invariance and ensemble structure to the NPK.\nTo address `black box'-ness, we propose a novel interpretable counterpart of\nDNNs with ReLUs namely deep linearly gated networks (DLGN): the pre-activations\nto the gates are generated by a deep linear network, and the gates are then\napplied as external masks to learn the weights in a different network. The DLGN\nis not an alternative architecture per se, but a disentanglement and an\ninterpretable re-arrangement of the computations in a DNN with ReLUs. The DLGN\ndisentangles the computations into two `mathematically' interpretable\nlinearities (i) the `primal' linearity between the input and the\npre-activations in the gating network and (ii) the `dual' linearity in the path\nspace in the weights network characterised by the NPK. We compare the\nperformance of DNN, DGN and DLGN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 to show that, the\nDLGN recovers more than $83.5\\%$ of the performance of state-of-the-art DNNs.\nThis brings us to an interesting question: `Is DLGN a universal spectral\napproximator?'\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 16:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

Comparing and benchmarking different DNN models can\noften be tedious due to the use of different datasets and evaluation protocols.\nTo facilitate the process, here, we present the Speech Emotion Recognition\nAdaptation Benchmark (SERAB), a framework for evaluating the performance and\ngeneralization capacity of different approaches for utterance-level SER. The\nbenchmark is composed of nine datasets for SER in six languages. Since the\ndatasets have different sizes and numbers of emotional classes, the proposed\nsetup is particularly suitable for estimating the generalization capacity of\npre-trained DNN-based feature extractors.

Furthermore, theoretical models for the generated two-photon state often\nforgo the importance of the measurement system, resulting in a discrepancy\nbetween theory and experiment. Here we formalise a description of the\ntwo-photon wavefunction in the spatial domain, referred to as the collected\njoint-transverse-momentum-amplitude (JTMA), which incorporates both the\ngeneration and measurement system involved. We go on to propose and demonstrate\na practical and efficient method to accurately reconstruct the collected JTMA\nusing a simple phase-step scan known as the $2D\\pi$-measurement. Finally, we\ndiscuss how precise knowledge of the collected JTMA enables us to generate\ntailored high-dimensional entangled states that maximise discrete-variable\nentanglement measures such as entanglement-of-formation or entanglement\ndimensionality, and optimise critical experimental parameters such as photon\nheralding efficiency. By accurately and efficiently characterising photonic\nposition-momentum entanglement, our results unlock its full potential for\ndiscrete-variable quantum information science and lay the groundwork for future\nquantum technologies based on multi-mode entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 13:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

The study is conducted using Dyson Schwinger\nequations under the Yukawa vertices set at their tree level form up to certain\nconstants. Among the field propagators, the two Higgs propagators are found to\nbe least effected in the parameter space which also reflects in the\ninsignificant beyond the bare mass contributions to the renormalized Higgs\nmasses.

Such losses, however,\nare limited because 2D keypoints do not supervise body shape and segmentations\nof people in clothing do not match projected minimally-clothed SMPL shapes. To\nexploit richer image information about clothed people, we introduce\nhigher-level semantic information about clothing to penalize clothed and\nnon-clothed regions of the image differently. To do so, we train a body\nregressor using a novel Differentiable Semantic Rendering - DSR loss. For\nMinimally-Clothed regions, we define the DSR-MC loss, which encourages a tight\nmatch between a rendered SMPL body and the minimally-clothed regions of the\nimage. For clothed regions, we define the DSR-C loss to encourage the rendered\nSMPL body to be inside the clothing mask. To ensure end-to-end differentiable\ntraining, we learn a semantic clothing prior for SMPL vertices from thousands\nof clothed human scans.

Where\ntraditional time-domain dedispersion algorithms correct time delays using time\nshifts, the FDD algorithm performs these shifts by applying phase rotations to\nthe Fourier-transformed time-series data. Incoherent dedispersion to many trial\ndispersion measures (DMs) is compute, memory-bandwidth and I/O intensive and\ndedispersion algorithms have been implemented on Graphics Processing Units\n(GPUs) to achieve high computational performance. However, time-domain\ndedispersion algorithms have low arithmetic intensity and are therefore often\nmemory-bandwidth limited. The FDD algorithm avoids this limitation and is\ncompute limited, providing a path to exploit the potential of current and\nupcoming generations of GPUs. We implement the FDD algorithm as an extension of\nthe DEDISP time-domain dedispersion software. We compare the performance and\nenergy-to-completion of the FDD implementation using an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU\nagainst the standard as well as an optimized version of DEDISP.

The efficiency, flexibility, and convenience of\ntop-down lithography processes are however compromised by nm-scale edge\nroughness and resolution variability issues, which especially affects the\nperformance of 2D materials. Here we study how dry anisotropic etching of\nmultilayer 2D materials with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) may overcome some of\nthese issues, showing results for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), tungsten\ndisulfide (WS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),\nmolybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy\nreveal that etching leads to anisotropic hexagonal features in the studied\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, with the relative degree of anisotropy ranked\nas: WS2 > WSe2 > MoTe2 / MoS2. Etched holes are terminated by zigzag edges\nwhile etched dots (protrusions) are terminated by armchair edges. This can be\nexplained by Wulff constructions, taking the relative stabilities of the edges\nand the AA stacking order into account. Patterns in WS2 are transferred to an\nunderlying graphite layer, demonstrating a possible use for creating sub-10 nm\nfeatures. In contrast, multilayer hBN exhibits no lateral anisotropy, but shows\nconsistent vertical etch angles, independent of crystal orientation. This is\nused to create super-resolution lithographic patterns with ultra-sharp corners\nat the base of the hBN crystal, which are transferred into an underlying\ngraphite crystal. We find that the anisotropic SF6 reactive ion etching process\nmakes it possible to downsize nanostructures to obtain smooth edges, sharp\ncorners, and feature sizes significantly below the resolution limit of electron\nbeam lithography. The nanostructured 2D materials can be used themselves or as\netch-masks to pattern other nanomaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 14:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

To evaluate our solutions, we use the New York City\ntaxi data set. For the first method, we find that optimizing for driver-side\nfairness outperforms state-of-the-art models on the number of riders serviced,\nboth in the worst-off neighborhood and overall, showing that optimizing for\nfairness can assist profitability in certain circumstances. For the second\nmethod, we explore income redistribution as a way to combat income inequality\nby having drivers keep an $r$ fraction of their income, and contributing the\nrest to a redistribution pool. For certain values of $r$, most drivers earn\nnear their Shapley value, while still incentivizing drivers to maximize value,\nthereby avoiding the free-rider problem and reducing income variability. The\nfirst method can be extended to many definitions of fairness and the second\nmethod provably improves fairness without affecting profitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 14:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

They enable\nunique properties including slow light in photonics, correlated phases in\nelectronics, and supercollimation in both systems. Despite these intense\nparallel efforts, flatbands have never been shown to affect the core\nlight-matter interaction between electrons and photons, which is limited by a\ndimensionality mismatch. Here, we reveal that a photonic flatband can overcome\nthis mismatch between localized electrons and extended photons and thus\nremarkably boost their light-matter interaction. We design flatband resonances\nin a silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal slab to control and enhance the\nradiation emission from free electrons by tuning their trajectory and velocity.\nIn particular, we record a 100-fold radiation enhancement from the conventional\ndiffraction-enabled Smith-Purcell radiation, and show the potential of our\napproach to achieve $10^6$-fold enhancements and beyond. The enhancement also\nenables us to perform polarization shaping of free electron radiation from\nmultiple flatbands and demonstrate an approach to measure photonic bands via\nangle-resolved electron-beam measurements.

The training procedure of\na probabilistic BNN model involves training an ensemble of sampled DNN models,\nwhich induces orders of magnitude larger volume of data movement than training\na single DNN model. In this paper, we reveal that the root cause for BNN\ntraining inefficiency originates from the massive off-chip data transfer by\nGaussian Random Variables (GRVs). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel\ndesign that eliminates all the off-chip data transfer by GRVs through the\nreversed shifting of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) without incurring\nany training accuracy loss.

By leveraging this finding, we design and prototype\nthe first highly efficient BNN training accelerator, named Shift-BNN, that is\nlow-cost and scalable. Extensive evaluation on five representative BNN models\ndemonstrates that Shift-BNN achieves an average of 4.9x (up to 10.8x) boost in\nenergy efficiency and 1.6x (up to 2.8x) speedup over the baseline DNN training\naccelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 15:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

These regions of sharp change in the Floquet operator, referred to\nas structural instability regions, appear typically at intermediate Trotter\nstep sizes and in the weakly-interacting regime, and are thus complementary to\nrecently revealed quantum chaotic regimes of the Trotterized evolution\n(Sieberer et al., npj Quantum Information 5, 1 (2019)). We characterize these\nstructural instability regimes in $p$-spin models, transverse-field Ising\nmodels with all-to-all $p$-body interactions, and analytically predict their\noccurrence based on unitary perturbation theory. We further show that the\neffective Hamiltonian associated with the Trotter decomposition of the unitary\ntime-evolution operator, when the Trotter-step size is chosen to be in the\nstructural instability region, is very different from the target Hamiltonian,\nwhich explains the large errors that can occur in the simulation in the regions\nof instability. These results have implications for the reliability of\nnear-term gate-based quantum simulators, and reveal an important interplay\nbetween errors and the physical properties of the system being simulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 15:41:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 14:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

The\npost-processing performs signal-processing tasks from as simple as, removing\nisolated 0s or 1s in the prediction-stream to sophisticated steps, which\nrequire domain-specific knowledge, including the minimum threshold of a\nQRS-complex extent or R-R interval. Often these thresholds vary among\nQRS-detection studies and are empirically determined for the target dataset,\nwhich may have implications if the target dataset differs. Moreover, these\nstudies, in general, fail to identify the relative strengths of deep-learning\nmodels and post-processing to weigh them appropriately. This study classifies\npost-processing, as found in the QRS-detection literature, into two levels -\nmoderate, and advanced - and advocates that the thresholds be learned by an\nappropriate deep-learning module, called a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to avoid\nexplicitly setting post-processing thresholds. This is done by utilising the\nsame philosophy of shifting from hand-crafted feature-engineering to\ndeep-learning-based feature-extraction. The results suggest that GRU learns the\npost-processing level and the QRS detection performance using GRU-based\npost-processing marginally follows the domain-specific manual post-processing,\nwithout requiring usage of domain-specific threshold parameters. To the best of\nour knowledge, the use of GRU to learn QRS-detection post-processing from CNN\nmodel generated prediction streams is the first of its kind.

A polyomino is a polygon that is formed by\njoining one or more unit squares edge to edge. These two notions were first\nintroduced and investigated by Solomon W. Golomb in the 1950s and popularized\nby Martin Gardner in the 1960s. Since then, dozens of studies have been made in\ncommunities of recreational mathematics and puzzles. In this study, we first\nfocus on the specific rep-tiles that have been investigated in these\ncommunities. Since the notion of rep-tiles is so simple that can be formulated\nmathematically in a natural way, we can apply a representative puzzle solver, a\nMIP solver, and SAT-based solvers for solving the rep-tile problem in common.\nIn comparing their performance, we can conclude that the puzzle solver is the\nweakest while the SAT-based solvers are the strongest in the context of simple\npuzzle solving.

The above nonlinear\noptical transition occurs when excited electron hole pairs in ML WS2 continuum\nheavily interact with each other followed by transformation into a collective\nelectron hole plasma phase (EHP), by losing their identity as individual\nquasiparticles. This is manifested by the alluring red-shift-blue-shift\ncrossover (RBC) phenomena of the excitonic peaks in the emission spectra,\nresulting from the synergistic attraction-repulsion processes at the\nMott-transition point. A systematic investigation of many-body effects is\nreported on ML WS$_2$, while considering the modulated dielectric screening of\nthree different substrates, viz., silicon dioxide, sapphire, and gold.\nSubstrate doping effects on ML WS$_2$ are discussed using the Raman\nfingerprints and PL spectral weight, which are further corroborated using\ntheoretical DFT calculations. Further the substrate dependent excitonic Bohr\nradius of ML WS$_2$ is extracted via modelling the emission energy shift with\nLennard-Jones potential. The variation of Mott point as well as excitonic Bohr\nradius is explained via substrate induced dielectric screening effect for both\nthe dielectric substrates, which is however absent in ML WS$_2$ on Au.

During ILMA, we\nfine-tune the internal LM, i.e., the E2E components excluding the encoder, to\nminimize a cross-entropy loss. To make ILMA effective, it is essential to train\nthe E2E model with an internal LM loss besides the standard E2E loss.\nFurthermore, we propose to regularize ILMA by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between the output distributions of the adapted and unadapted\ninternal LMs. ILMA is the most effective when we update only the last linear\nlayer of the joint network. ILMA enables a fast text-only adaptation of the E2E\nmodel without increasing the run-time computational cost.

In these networks, reconfigurable wireless\nnetwork slicing is considered as one of the key elements for 5G and 6G\nnetworks. A reconfigurable slicing allows the operators to run various\ninstances of the network using a single infrastructure for a better quality of\nservices (QoS). The QoS can be achieved by reconfiguring and optimizing these\nnetworks using Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. To\ndevelop a smart decision-making mechanism for network management and\nrestricting network slice failures, machine learning-enabled reconfigurable\nwireless network solutions are required. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\ndeep learning model that consists of a convolution neural network (CNN) and\nlong short term memory (LSTM). The CNN performs resource allocation, network\nreconfiguration, and slice selection while the LSTM is used for statistical\ninformation (load balancing, error rate etc.) regarding network slices. The\napplicability of the proposed model is validated by using multiple unknown\ndevices, slice failure, and overloading conditions. The overall accuracy of\n95.17% is achieved by the proposed model that reflects its applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 10:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

In each time slot, a base station (BS) uses information from\nspectrum sensing and reception quality to autonomously decide whether or not to\ntransmit on a given resource, with the goal of maximizing proportional fairness\nnetwork-wide. Empirically, we find the proportional fairness reward accumulated\nby the policy gradient approach to be significantly higher than even a\ngenie-aided adaptive energy detection threshold.
