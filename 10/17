In\nrecent years, the severe social and environmental impact of illegal waste\ndumping sites has made them one of the most serious problems faced by cities in\nthe Global South, in a context of scarce information available for decision\nmaking. To help identify the location of dumping sites and track their\nevolution over time we adopt a data-driven model from the machine learning\ndomain, analyzing satellite images. This allows us to take advantage of the\nincreasing availability of geo-spatial open-data, high-resolution satellite\nimagery, and open source tools to train machine learning algorithms with a\nsmall set of known waste dumping sites in Buenos Aires, and then predict the\nlocation of other sites over vast areas at high speed and low cost.

The proposed algorithm is based on the principle of\nmajorization-minimization (MM); however, the application of MM here is very\nnovel and distinct from the way MM has been usually used to solve optimization\nproblems in the literature. More precisely, we reformulate the original\nminimization problem into a saddle point problem by invoking Fenchel dual\nrepresentation of the log (.) term in the Poisson likelihood function. We then\npropose tighter surrogate functions over both primal and dual variables\nresulting in a double-loop MM algorithm, which we have named as Primal-Dual\nMajorization-Minimization (PDMM) algorithm. The iterative steps of the\nresulting algorithm are simple to implement and involve only computing matrix\nvector products. We also extend our algorithm to handle various L1 regularized\nPoisson phase-retrieval problems (which exploit sparsity). The proposed\nalgorithm is compared with previously proposed algorithms such as wirtinger\nflow (WF), MM (conventional), and alternating direction methods of multipliers\n(ADMM) for the Poisson data model. The simulation results under different\nexperimental settings show that PDMM is faster than the competing methods, and\nits performance in recovering the original signal is at par with the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 16:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Given an observed\nsequence of radar responses, the adversary tests for utility maximization\nbehavior of the radar and estimates its utility function that rationalizes the\nradar's responses. In turn, the radar deliberately chooses sub-optimal\nresponses so that its utility function almost fails the utility maximization\ntest, and hence, its cognitive ability is masked from the adversary.

Our method, termed Deep\nPoint Correspondence (DPC), requires a fraction of the training data compared\nto previous techniques and presents better generalization capabilities. Until\nnow, two main approaches have been suggested for the dense correspondence\nproblem. The first is a spectral-based approach that obtains great results on\nsynthetic datasets but requires mesh connectivity of the shapes and long\ninference processing time while being unstable in real-world scenarios. The\nsecond is a spatial approach that uses an encoder-decoder framework to regress\nan ordered point cloud for the matching alignment from an irregular input.\nUnfortunately, the decoder brings considerable disadvantages, as it requires a\nlarge amount of training data and struggles to generalize well in cross-dataset\nevaluations. DPC's novelty lies in its lack of a decoder component. Instead, we\nuse latent similarity and the input coordinates themselves to construct the\npoint cloud and determine correspondence, replacing the coordinate regression\ndone by the decoder. Extensive experiments show that our construction scheme\nleads to a performance boost in comparison to recent state-of-the-art\ncorrespondence methods.

We used a subarray of the Giant Ukrainian\nRadio Telescope (GURT) to get the spectral properties of radio bursts at the\nfrequency range of 8-80 MHz, as well as the PSP radio instruments with a\nbandwidth of 10.5 kHz - 19.2 MHz, during solar observations on June 5, 2020. We\ndirectly detected the radio events initiated by the active region behind the\nsolar limb of the PSP spacecraft, using special conditions in the solar corona,\ndue to the absence of active regions from the PSP side. Following the\ngeneration mechanism of solar radio emission, we refined the density model for\nthe solar corona above the active region 12765 responsible for the radio\nbursts. Based on the PSP spacecraft position near the Sun and delays of radio\nwaves between space- and ground-based records, we found the corresponding radio\nresponses on the PSP spectrogram. The absence of sunspots from the PSP side\ncontributes to the propagation of radio waves from a dense loop of the Sun to\nquiet regions with low densities, through which PSP instruments can detect the\nradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 19:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Saturn's moon Hyperion is a\nnotable exception by having a chaotic rotation. Hyperion's dynamical state is a\nconsequence of its high eccentricity and its highly prolate shape (Wisdom et\nal. 1984). As many binary asteroids also have elongated secondaries, chaotic\nrotation is expected for moons in eccentric binaries (\\'Cuk and Nesvorn\\'y,\n2010), and a minority of asteroidal secondaries may be in that state (Pravec et\nal. 2016). The question of secondary rotation is also important for the action\nof the BYORP effect, which can quickly evolve orbits of synchronous (but not\nnon-synchronous) secondaries (\\'Cuk and Burns, 2005). Here we report results of\na large set of short numerical simulations which indicate that, apart from\nsynchronous and classic chaotic rotation, close-in irregularly-shaped\nasteroidal secondaries can occupy an additional, intermediate rotational state.\nIn this ``barrel instability'' the secondary slowly rolls along its long axis,\nwhile the longest axis is staying largely aligned with the primary-secondary\nline. This behavior may be more difficult to detect through lightcurves than a\nfully chaotic rotation, but would likewise shut down BYORP. We show that the\nbinary's eccentricity, separation measured in secondary's radii and the\nsecondary's shape are all important for determining whether the system settles\nin synchronous rotation, chaotic tumbling, or barrel instability. We compare\nour results for synthetic asteroids with known binary pairs to determine which\nof these behaviors may be present in the Near-Earth Asteroid binary population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 21:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

However, for the conventional MCS, the large consumption of communication\nresources for raw data transmission and high requirements on data storage and\ncomputing capability hinder potential requestors with limited resources from\nusing MCS. To facilitate the widespread application of MCS, we propose a novel\nMCS learning framework leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept\nof edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL), which involves four\nmajor entities, including requestors, blockchain, edge servers and mobile\ndevices as workers. Even though there exist several studies on blockchain-based\nMCS and blockchain-based FL, they cannot solve the essential challenges of MCS\nwith respect to accommodating resource-constrained requestors or deal with the\nprivacy concerns brought by the involvement of requestors and workers in the\nlearning process. To fill the gaps, four main procedures, i.e., task\npublication, data sensing and submission, learning to return final results, and\npayment settlement and allocation, are designed to address major challenges\nbrought by both internal and external threats, such as malicious edge servers\nand dishonest requestors. Specifically, a mechanism design based data\nsubmission rule is proposed to guarantee the data privacy of mobile devices\nbeing truthfully preserved at edge servers; consortium blockchain based FL is\nelaborated to secure the distributed learning process; and a\ncooperation-enforcing control strategy is devised to elicit full payment from\nthe requestor.

Researchers have developed new sensing\ntechnologies (reference-free) to overcome the limitations of reference\npoint-based displacement sensors. Reference-free methods use accelerometers to\nestimate displacements, by decomposing the total displacement in two parts: a\nhigh-frequency dynamic displacement component, and a low-frequency\npseudo-static displacement component. In the past, researchers have used the\nEuler-Bernoulli beam theory formula to estimate the pseudo-static displacement\nassuming railroad bridge piles and columns can be simplified as cantilever\nbeams.

Meanwhile, deep learning and\nend-to-end framework have made great progress in various fields including\ncomputer vision. However, existing superpixel algorithms cannot be integrated\ninto subsequent tasks in an end-to-end way. Traditional algorithms and deep\nlearning-based algorithms are two main streams in superpixel segmentation. The\nformer is non-differentiable and the latter needs a non-differentiable\npost-processing step to enforce connectivity, which constraints the integration\nof superpixels and downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep\nlearning-based superpixel segmentation algorithm SIN which can be integrated\nwith downstream tasks in an end-to-end way. Owing to some downstream tasks such\nas visual tracking require real-time speed, the speed of generating superpixels\nis also important. To remove the post-processing step, our algorithm enforces\nspatial connectivity from the start. Superpixels are initialized by sampled\npixels and other pixels are assigned to superpixels through multiple updating\nsteps. Each step consists of a horizontal and a vertical interpolation, which\nis the key to enforcing spatial connectivity. Multi-layer outputs of a fully\nconvolutional network are utilized to predict association scores for\ninterpolations.

But it does not provide an actionable procedure for\npicking one or a few special models to return to practical users. In this\npaper, we consider \\emph{optimization in Pareto set (OPT-in-Pareto)}, the\nproblem of finding Pareto models that optimize an extra reference criterion\nfunction within the Pareto set. This function can either encode a specific\npreference from the users, or represent a generic diversity measure for\nobtaining a set of diversified Pareto models that are representative of the\nwhole Pareto set.

The CAE Transformer\nutilizes an encoder to automatically extract informative features from CT\nslices, which are then fed to a modified transformer to capture global\ninter-slice relations and provide classification labels. Experimental results\non our in-house dataset of 114 pathologically proven Sub-Solid Nodules (SSNs)\ndemonstrate the superiority of the CAE-Transformer over its counterparts,\nachieving an accuracy of 87.73%, sensitivity of 88.67%, specificity of 86.33%,\nand AUC of 0.913, using a 10-fold cross-validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 04:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 16:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Existing inference acceleration methods like\npruning and quantization can speed up GNNs by reducing\nMultiplication-and-ACcumulation (MAC) operations, but the improvements are\nlimited given the data dependency is not resolved. Conversely, multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) have no graph dependency and infer much faster than GNNs,\neven though they are less accurate than GNNs for node classification in\ngeneral. Motivated by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, we bring\nGNNs and MLPs together via knowledge distillation (KD).

Three detonation propagation modes are found: (1) pulsating\npropagation, (2) propagation followed by extinction, and (3) immediate\nextinction. For pulsating detonation, within one cycle, the propagation speeds\nand the distance between reaction front (RF) and shock front (SF) change\nperiodically. The pulsating phenomenon originates from the interactions between\ngas dynamics, chemical kinetics, and droplet dynamics inside the induction\nzone. Multiple pressure waves are emanated from the RF within one cycle, which\novertake and intensify the lead SF. An autoigniting spot arises in the shocked\ngas after the contact surface. The relative locations of SF, RF, shock-frame\nsonic point, and two-phase contact surface remain unchanged in a pulsating\ncycle, but their distances have periodic variations. Moreover, the unsteady\nbehaviors of detonation extinction include continuously increased distance\nbetween the RF and SF and quickly reduced pressure peaks, temperature, and\ncombustion heat release. The decoupling of RF and SF leads to significantly\nincreasing chemical timescale of the shocked mixture. The hydrodynamic\nstructure also changes considerably when detonation extinction occurs.\nMoreover, the predicted map of detonation propagation and extinction\nillustrates that the critical mass loading for detonation extinction reduces\nsignificantly when the droplet size becomes smaller. It is also found that for\nthe same droplet size, the average detonation speed monotonically decreases\nwith water mass loading. However, detonation speed and pulsating frequency have\na non-monotonic dependence on droplet size under a constant water mass loading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 06:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

As a result, the miss rate of polyps is between 6% and 27% despite\nthe prominence of CADx solutions.

To conserve their limited flight energy,\ndrones can use trucks as temporary modes of transit en route to their own\ndestinations. Such coordination can yield significant savings in total vehicle\ndistance traveled, i.e., truck travel distance and drone flight distance,\ncompared to operating drones and trucks independently. But it comes at the\npotentially prohibitive computational cost of deciding which trucks and drones\nshould coordinate and when and where it is most beneficial to do so. We tackle\nthis fundamental trade-off by decoupling our overall intractable problem into\ntractable sub-problems that we solve stage-wise. The first stage solves only\nfor trucks, by computing paths that make them more likely to be useful transit\noptions for drones. The second stage solves only for drones, by routing them\nover a composite of the road network and the transit network defined by truck\npaths from the first stage.

In this work, we\nanalyze a number of noisy quantum channels for qudits, on the family of qudit\nhypergraph states. The channels studied are the dit-flip noise, phase flip\nnoise, dit-phase flip noise, depolarizing noise, non-Markovian Amplitude\nDamping Channel (ADC), dephasing noise, and depolarization noise. To gauge the\neffect of noise on quantum hypergraph states, the fidelity between the original\nand the final states is studied. The change of coherence under the action of\nnoisy channels is also studied, both analytically and numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 14:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

FineSum automatically identifies opinion\nphrases from the raw corpus, classifies them into different aspects and\nsentiments, and constructs multiple fine-grained opinion clusters under each\naspect/sentiment. Each cluster consists of semantically coherent phrases,\nexpressing uniform opinions towards certain sub-aspect or characteristics\n(e.g., positive feelings for ``burgers'' in the ``food'' aspect). An\nopinion-oriented spherical word embedding space is trained to provide weak\nsupervision for the phrase classifier, and phrase clustering is performed using\nthe aspect-aware contextualized embedding generated from the phrase classifier.\nBoth automatic evaluation on the benchmark and quantitative human evaluation\nvalidate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 15:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

This might lead\none to believe that any consistent-looking effective field theory coupled to\ngravity can be obtained as a low-energy limit of string theory. However, a set\nof \"swampland\" conjectures suggests that this is not true and that, in fact,\nthere is an even larger set of effective field theories that cannot be obtained\nin this way. In particular, the AdS instability swampland conjecture asserts\nthat nonsupersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are unstable. These swampland\ncriteria can have implications for, for instance, low-energy physics and\ncosmology.\n  M-theory is a nonperturbative unification of all superstring theories. Its\nlow-energy limit, eleven-dimensional supergravity, admits two compactifications\non the squashed seven-sphere. One of the solutions has one unbroken\nsupersymmetry ($\\mathcal{N} = 1$) while the other has none ($\\mathcal{N} = 0$).\nDue to the AdS instability swampland conjecture, the latter should be unstable.\nHowever, this has not been demonstrated explicitly. To study the stability of\nthe $\\mathcal{N} = 0$ vacuum, we investigate the mass spectrum of the theory.\nThe main advancement compared to previous attempts is the realisation that all\nmass operators in the Freund-Rubin compactification are related to a universal\nLaplacian, allowing us to relate Weyl tensor terms to group invariants. One\nlimitation of the group-theoretical method we employ is that it can lead to\nfalse roots.

However, the main challenges are high time\ncomplexity. Moreover, the interaction between features is another big challenge\nin FS problems that directly affects the classification performance.

Secondly,\nwe provide a guiding technique for determining the number of features for\nindividuals in each iteration.

Thus, it can deal with complementary features and\nconsequently increase classification performance. To do this, we provide a\nconditional probability scheme that considers the joint probability\ndistribution of selecting two features. The introduced probabilities\nsuccessfully detect correlated features.

Generally, training a deep CNN\nmodel requires numerous labeled training samples, and the number and quality of\nthese samples directly affect the representational capability of the trained\nmodel. However, this approach is restrictive in practice, because manually\nlabeling such a large number of training samples is time-consuming and\nprohibitively expensive.

Under the guidance of active learning, the tracker\nbased on the trained deep CNNs model can achieve competitive tracking\nperformance while reducing the labeling cost. More specifically, to ensure the\ndiversity of selected samples, we propose an active learning method based on\nmulti-frame collaboration to select those training samples that should be and\nneed to be annotated.

In this paper, we explore the statistical quality of data\nunder this framework by comparing traditional uniform sampling to a dueling\nbandit algorithm and find that dueling bandit algorithms perform well at\ncumulative regret minimisation, but lead to inflated Type-I error rates and\nreduced power under certain circumstances. Through these results we provide\ninsight into the challenges and opportunities in using dueling bandit\nalgorithms to run adaptive experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 23:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}
