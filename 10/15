For example, events in the\nstandard model of particle physics, such as the $W^\\pm/Z^0$ decoupling, the\nquark-hadron transition, the muon and pion becoming non-relativistic, and the\nannihilation of electrons and positrons, cause a suppression in the Equation of\nState parameter and leave peaks in the PBH mass function around\n$10^{-6},\\,2,\\,60$, and $10^6\\, M_\\odot$, respectively, in the case of a nearly\nscale-invariant primordial power spectrum. The superposition of unresolved\nmergers of such PBHs results in a stochastic gravitational-wave background\n(SGWB) that covers a wide range of frequencies and can be tested with future\ngravitational wave (GW) detectors. In this paper, we discuss how its spectral\nshape can be used to infer properties about inflation, the thermal history of\nthe Universe, and the dynamics of binary formation in dense halos encoded in\ntheir merger rate formula. Although many of these physical effects are\ndegenerate within the sensitivity of a single detector, they can be\ndisentangled by the simultaneous observation of the SGWB at different\nfrequencies, highlighting the importance of multi-frequency observations of GWs\nto characterize the physics of PBHs from the early to the late time Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 16:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 09:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Multi-camera systems were installed in two treatment bunkers\nin the radiation oncology clinic at our center and one bunker in an affiliated\nsatellite clinic. Images were acquired as part of normal treatment procedure\nand reviewed retrospectively with potential incidents flagged for evaluation by\nthe physician and medical physics teams.\n  Results: In total, 622 patients were imaged as part of this study. In this\nsummary, 9 patients were identified with incidents occurring during their\ncourse of treatment that were detected only with Cherenkov imaging. Incidents\nwere found relating to issues during simulation, planning, pre-treatment\nreview, and treatment delivery, however none of the incidents were detected\nprior to treatment delivery. Primary areas of improvement identified in this\nstudy are dose to unintended areas in planning, dose to unintended areas due to\npositioning, and non-ideal bolus placement during setup. Case studies are\npresented highlighting the detection of these issues using Cherenkov imaging.\n  Conclusions: All detected events were deemed below the threshold for\nreporting, but their observation could lead to quality improvement in practice.\nPerhaps most importantly, the imaging was seamless with no effort required by\nthe radiotherapy team and provided both real-time and permanent records of what\nwas delivered in each fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 16:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

Most of the WSOD methods use Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) as their\nbasic framework, which regard it as an instance classification problem.\nHowever, these methods based on MIL tends to converge only on the most\ndiscriminate regions of different instances, rather than their corresponding\ncomplete regions, that is, insufficient integrity. Inspired by the habit of\nobserving things by the human, we propose a new method by comparing the initial\nproposals and the extension ones to optimize those initial proposals.\nSpecifically, we propose one new strategy for WSOD by involving contrastive\nproposal extension (CPE), which consists of multiple directional contrastive\nproposal extensions (D-CPE), and each D-CPE contains encoders based on LSTM\nnetwork and corresponding decoders. Firstly, the boundary of initial proposals\nin MIL is extended to different positions according to well-designed sequential\norder. Then, CPE compares the extended proposal and the initial proposal by\nextracting the feature semantics of them using the encoders, and calculates the\nintegrity of the initial proposal to optimize the score of the initial\nproposal. These contrastive contextual semantics will guide the basic WSOD to\nsuppress bad proposals and improve the scores of good ones. In addition, a\nsimple two-stream network is designed as the decoder to constrain the temporal\ncoding of LSTM and improve the performance of WSOD further.

How covalent bonds in water could break under\nsuch conditions challenges our textbook understanding of physical chemistry and\nthe water substance. While there is no definitive answer, it has been\nspeculated that ultrahigh electric fields at the air-water interface are\nresponsible for this chemical transformation. Here, we resolve this mystery via\na comprehensive experimental investigation of H$_2$O$_2$ formation in (i) water\nmicrodroplets sprayed over a range of liquid flow-rates, the (shearing) air\nflow rates, and the air composition (ii) water microdroplets condensed on\nhydrophobic substrates formed via hot water or humidifier under controlled air\ncomposition. Specifically, we assessed the contributions of the evaporative\nconcentration and shock waves in sprays and the effects of trace O$_3$(g) on\nthe H$_2$O$_2$ formation. Glovebox experiments revealed that the H$_2$O$_2$\nformation in water microdroplets was most sensitive to the air-borne ozone\n(O$_3$) concentration. In the absence of O$_3$(g), we could not detect\nH$_2$O$_2$(aq) in sprays or condensates (detection limit: 250 nM. In contrast,\nmicrodroplets exposed to atmospherically relevant O$_3$(g) concentration\n(10-100 ppb) formed 2-30 $\\mu$M H$_2$O$_2$(aq); increasing the gas-liquid\nsurface area, mixing, and contact duration increased H$_2$O$_2$(aq)\nconcentration. Thus, the mystery is resolved - the water surface facilitates\nthe O$_3$(g) mass transfer, which is followed by the chemical transformation of\nO$_3$(aq) into H$_2$O$_2$(aq). These findings should also help us understand\nthe implications of this chemistry in natural and applied contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 16:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

The method uses an array of small\nhypervelocity kinetic penetrators that pulverize and disassemble an asteroid or\nsmall comet. This mitigates the threat using the Earth's atmosphere to\ndissipate the energy in the fragment cloud. The system allows a planetary\ndefense solution using existing technologies. This approach will work in\nextended time scale modes where there is a large warning time, as well as in\nshort interdiction time scenarios with intercepts of minutes to days before\nimpact. In longer time intercept scenarios, the disassembled asteroid fragments\nlargely miss the Earth. In short intercept scenarios, the asteroid fragments of\nmaximum $\\sim$10-meter diameter allow the Earth's atmosphere to act as a \"beam\ndump\" where the fragments burn up and/or air burst, with the primary channel of\nenergy going into spatially and temporally de-correlated shock waves. It is the\nde-correlated blast waves that are the key to why PI works so well. The\neffectiveness of the approach depends on the intercept time and size of the\nasteroid, but allows for effective defense against asteroids in the 20-1000m\ndiameter class and could virtually eliminate the threat of mass destruction\nposed by these threats with very short warning times, though longer warning is\nalways preferred.

To increase its\nefficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting and interference, techniques\nlike adapters and sparse fine-tuning have been developed. Adapters are modular,\nas they can be combined to adapt a model towards different facets of knowledge\n(e.g., dedicated language and/or task adapters). Sparse fine-tuning is\nexpressive, as it controls the behavior of all model components. In this work,\nwe introduce a new fine-tuning method with both these desirable properties. In\nparticular, we learn sparse, real-valued masks based on a simple variant of the\nLottery Ticket Hypothesis. Task-specific masks are obtained from annotated data\nin a source language, and language-specific masks from masked language modeling\nin a target language. Both these masks can then be composed with the pretrained\nmodel. Unlike adapter-based fine-tuning, this method neither increases the\nnumber of parameters at inference time nor alters the original model\narchitecture. Most importantly, it outperforms adapters in zero-shot\ncross-lingual transfer by a large margin in a series of multilingual\nbenchmarks, including Universal Dependencies, MasakhaNER, and AmericasNLI.\nBased on an in-depth analysis, we additionally find that sparsity is crucial to\nprevent both 1) interference between the fine-tunings to be composed and 2)\noverfitting.

To address this issue, we\npropose a distributed approximate Newton-type algorithm with fast convergence\nspeed to alleviate the problem of FEEL resource (in terms of communication\nresources) constraints. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is improved based\non distributed L-BFGS algorithm and allows each client to approximate the\nhigh-cost Hessian matrix by computing the low-cost Fisher matrix in a\ndistributed manner to find a \"better\" descent direction, thereby speeding up\nconvergence. Second, we prove that the proposed algorithm has linear\nconvergence in strongly convex and non-convex cases and analyze its\ncomputational and communication complexity.

To this end, we\ndesign a simple but elegant training scheme, namely FedOVA, to solve the\nheterogeneous statistical challenge brought by heterogeneous data. In this way,\nFedOVA first decomposes a multi-class classification problem into more\nstraightforward binary classification problems and then combines their\nrespective outputs using ensemble learning.

Yet, teaching morality to\nmachines is a formidable task, as morality remains among the most intensely\ndebated questions in humanity, let alone for AI. Existing AI systems deployed\nto millions of users, however, are already making decisions loaded with moral\nimplications, which poses a seemingly impossible challenge: teaching machines\nmoral sense, while humanity continues to grapple with it.\n  To explore this challenge, we introduce Delphi, an experimental framework\nbased on deep neural networks trained directly to reason about descriptive\nethical judgments, e.g., \"helping a friend\" is generally good, while \"helping a\nfriend spread fake news\" is not. Empirical results shed novel insights on the\npromises and limits of machine ethics; Delphi demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capabilities in the face of novel ethical situations, while\noff-the-shelf neural network models exhibit markedly poor judgment including\nunjust biases, confirming the need for explicitly teaching machines moral\nsense.\n  Yet, Delphi is not perfect, exhibiting susceptibility to pervasive biases and\ninconsistencies.

However, due to the prohibitive cost of\nmotion capture, existing datasets are often limited in scale and diversity. In\nthis work, we obtain massive human sequences by playing the video game with\nautomatically annotated 3D ground truths. Specifically, we contribute\nGTA-Human, a large-scale 3D human dataset generated with the GTA-V game engine,\nfeaturing a highly diverse set of subjects, actions, and scenarios. More\nimportantly, we study the use of game-playing data and obtain five major\ninsights. First, game-playing data is surprisingly effective. A simple\nframe-based baseline trained on GTA-Human outperforms more sophisticated\nmethods by a large margin. For video-based methods, GTA-Human is even on par\nwith the in-domain training set. Second, we discover that synthetic data\nprovides critical complements to the real data that is typically collected\nindoor. Our investigation into domain gap provides explanations for our data\nmixture strategies that are simple yet useful. Third, the scale of the dataset\nmatters. The performance boost is closely related to the additional data\navailable. A systematic study reveals the model sensitivity to data density\nfrom multiple key aspects. Fourth, the effectiveness of GTA-Human is also\nattributed to the rich collection of strong supervision labels (SMPL\nparameters), which are otherwise expensive to acquire in real datasets. Fifth,\nthe benefits of synthetic data extend to larger models such as deeper\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, for which a significant\nimpact is also observed.

A series of experimental and\ntheoretical studies have suggested that an effective two-band Hubbard model\nwith Ni 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and rare-earth ($R$) 5$d$ character may describe the\nlow-energy physics. Here, we study the ground state properties of this two-band\nmodel on four-leg cylinders using the density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) technique to better grasp whether such a simple model can embody the\nessential physics. A key difference compared to single-band Hubbard materials\nis that the system is self-doped: even at overall half-filling, the $R$-band\nacts as an electron reservoir, hole-doping the Ni-layer and fundamentally\naltering the physics expected from an undoped antiferromagnet. On the four-leg\ncylinder, the ground state is consistent with a Luttinger liquid, with\nanti-phase modulations of the charge density in the Ni- and $R$-layers having\ncorresponding wavevectors that lock together. Light hole doping away from 1/2\nfilling releases the locking between the Ni and the $R$ charge modulations, as\nthe electron density in the $R$-band decreases and eventually becomes exhausted\nat a hole doping concentration that depends sensitively on the effective\nsplitting between the Ni and the $R$ orbitals. The ground state of the doped\nsystem is consistent with a Luther-Emery liquid, possessing quasi-long-range\nsuperconducting correlations in the Ni layer, similar to the single-band\nHubbard model.

One of the key\nproperties of the obtained representations is their dimension. Whilst the\ncommonly adopted dimensions of 256 and 768 offer sufficient performance on many\ntasks, it is many times unclear whether the default dimension is the most\nsuitable choice for the subsequent downstream learning tasks. Furthermore,\nrepresentation dimensions are seldom subject to hyperparameter tuning due to\ncomputational constraints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a\nsurprisingly simple and efficient recursive compression procedure can be\nsufficient to both significantly compress the initial representation, but also\npotentially improve its performance when considering the task of text\nclassification. Having smaller and less noisy representations is the desired\nproperty during deployment, as orders of magnitude smaller models can\nsignificantly reduce the computational overload and with it the deployment\ncosts.

Our proposed main road begins with the tidal disruption\nof a scattered asteroid and the formation of a highly eccentric tidal disc with\na wide range of fragment sizes. Accretion of these fragments by\nPoynting-Robertson (PR) drag alone is too slow to explain the observed rates.\nInstead, in the second stage, several processes including differential apsidal\nprecession cause high-velocity collisions between the eccentric fragments.\nLarge asteroids produce more fragments when they disrupt, causing rapid\ngrind-down and generating short and intense bursts of dust production, whereas\nsmaller asteroids grind down over longer periods of time.

Most prior works deal with the open-set\nvisual speech recognition problem by adapting existing automatic speech\nrecognition techniques on top of trivially pooled visual features. Instead, in\nthis paper we focus on the unique challenges encountered in lip reading and\npropose tailored solutions. To this end, we make the following contributions:\n(1) we propose an attention-based pooling mechanism to aggregate visual speech\nrepresentations; (2) we use sub-word units for lip reading for the first time\nand show that this allows us to better model the ambiguities of the task; (3)\nwe propose a model for Visual Speech Detection (VSD), trained on top of the lip\nreading network. Following the above, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the\nchallenging LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks when training on public datasets, and even\nsurpass models trained on large-scale industrial datasets by using an order of\nmagnitude less data. Our best model achieves 22.6% word error rate on the LRS2\ndataset, a performance unprecedented for lip reading models, significantly\nreducing the performance gap between lip reading and automatic speech\nrecognition. Moreover, on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker benchmark, our VSD model\nsurpasses all visual-only baselines and even outperforms several recent\naudio-visual methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 17:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 11:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Classically, the\nsymmetries consist of an infinite set of left-moving conformal and affine\n$U(1)$ transformations that generate a Witt-Kac-Moody algebra, as well as a set\nof non-local, field-dependent generalizations of right-moving conformal and\naffine $U(1)$ transformations, whose algebra depends on the chosen basis.\nNotably, there exists a basis, denoted as the \"flowed\" representation, in which\nthe right-moving charge algebra is simply Witt-Kac-Moody. At the quantum level,\nwe provide a concrete prescription for constructing the symmetry generators via\na combination of the flow equations they satisfy and the Sugawara construction,\nand use this to explicitly resolve the ordering ambiguities and the quantum\ncorrections to the generators up to second order in the $J\\bar T$ coupling\nparameter. This construction naturally produces the \"flowed\" generators, whose\nalgebra is Virasoro-Kac-Moody to all orders in the coupling, with the same\ncentral extension as that of the undeformed CFT. We use this input to work out\nthe quantum modifications to the \"unflowed\" generator algebra. A peculiarity of\nthe Virasoro generators we study is that their zero mode does not equal the\nHamiltonian, but is a quadratic function of it; this helps reconcile the\nVirasoro symmetry with the non-locality of the model.

This has been compiled by cross-correlating each of these X-ray\narchives with a large sample of galaxies primarily drawn from the HyperLEDA\narchive. Significant efforts have been made to clean the sample of known\nnon-ULX contaminants (e.g. foreground stars, background AGN, supernovae), and\nalso to identify ULX candidates that are common to the different X-ray\ncatalogues utilized, allowing us to produce a combined 'master' list of unique\nsources. Our sample contains 1843 ULX candidates associated with 951 different\nhost galaxies, making it the largest ULX catalogue compiled to date. Of these,\n689 sources are catalogued as ULX candidates for the first time. Our primary\nmotivation is to identify new sources of interest for detailed follow-up\nstudies, and within our catalogue we have already found one new extreme ULX\ncandidate that has high S/N data in the archive: NGC 3044 ULX1.

The aim of this feasibility study was development and application test\nof a novel radioactive catheter for potential use in LDR brachytherapy to\nprevent urethral stenosis. Methods: A beta radiation emitting 32P-foil was\ndeveloped and integrated in an indwelling catheter, which is usually inserted\nafter surgical interventions in the urethra. Activity and dose distribution\nwere measured after neutron activation of the 31P foil component with\nscintillation techniques as well as radiochromic films and compared to MC\nsimulations. Practicability and radiation safety of this new applicator was\ntested on male rabbits, which underwent before catheter application a new\nmethod of stricture induction by radial laser light irradiation. Results:\nMeasured dose distributions of catheters with 32P-foils were found in good\nagreement with MC simulations.

But more depth means more\nsequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it\npossible to build high-performing \"non-deep\" neural networks? We show that it\nis. To do so, we use parallel subnetworks instead of stacking one layer after\nanother. This helps effectively reduce depth while maintaining high\nperformance. By utilizing parallel substructures, we show, for the first time,\nthat a network with a depth of just 12 can achieve top-1 accuracy over 80% on\nImageNet, 96% on CIFAR10, and 81% on CIFAR100. We also show that a network with\na low-depth (12) backbone can achieve an AP of 48% on MS-COCO. We analyze the\nscaling rules for our design and show how to increase performance without\nchanging the network's depth.

In this paper, we consider a special\ntype of microlensing events where the sources are fast radio bursts with\n$\\sim$milliseconds (ms) durations for which the relative motion between the\nlens and source is negligible. In this scenario, it is possible to temporally\nresolve the individual microimages. As a result, a method beyond the inverse\nray shooting (IRS) method, which only evaluates the total magnification of all\nmicroimages, is needed. We therefore implement an algorithm for identifying\nindividual microimages and computing their magnifications and relative time\ndelays. We validate our algorithm by comparing to analytical predictions for a\nsingle microlens case and find excellent agreement. We show that the\nsuperposition of pulses from individual microimages produces a light curve that\nappears as multi-peaked FRBs. The relative time delays between pulses can reach\n0.1--1 ms for stellar-mass lenses and hence can already be resolved temporally\nby current facilities. Although not yet discovered, microlensing of FRBs will\nbecome regular events and surpass the number of quasar microlensing events in\nthe near future when $10^{4-5}$ FRBs are expected to be discovered on a daily\nbasis. Our algorithm provides a way of generating the microlensing light curve\nthat can be used for constraining stellar mass distribution in distant\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 18:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

For minimizing the original empirical risk, we\ncompute a closed form for the Mixup-optimal classification, which allows us to\nconstruct a simple dataset on which minimizing the Mixup loss can provably lead\nto learning a classifier that does not minimize the empirical loss on the data.\nOn the other hand, we also give sufficient conditions for Mixup training to\nalso minimize the original empirical risk.

Traditional machine learning employs fully\ncentralized architecture in which the entire training data is collected at one\nnode e.g., cloud server, that significantly increases the communication\noverheads and also raises severe privacy concerns. Towards this end, a\ndistributed machine learning paradigm termed as Federated learning (FL) has\nbeen proposed recently. In FL, each participating edge device trains its local\nmodel by using its own training data. Then, via the wireless channels the\nweights or parameters of the locally trained models are sent to the central PS,\nthat aggregates them and updates the global model. On one hand, FL plays an\nimportant role for optimizing the resources of wireless communication networks,\non the other hand, wireless communications is crucial for FL. Thus, a\n`bidirectional' relationship exists between FL and wireless communications.\nAlthough FL is an emerging concept, many publications have already been\npublished in the domain of FL and its applications for next generation wireless\nnetworks.

When the data is high dimensional and the potential dependence\nsignal is sparse, independence testing becomes very challenging without\ndistributional or structural assumptions. In this paper, we propose a general\nframework for independence testing by first fitting a classifier that\ndistinguishes the joint and product distributions, and then testing the\nsignificance of the fitted classifier. This framework allows us to borrow the\nstrength of the most advanced classification algorithms developed from the\nmodern machine learning community, making it applicable to high dimensional,\ncomplex data. By combining a sample split and a fixed permutation, our test\nstatistic has a universal, fixed Gaussian null distribution that is independent\nof the underlying data distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the\nadvantages of the newly proposed test compared with existing methods. We\nfurther apply the new test to a single-cell data set to test the independence\nbetween two types of single-cell sequencing measurements, whose high\ndimensionality and sparsity make existing methods hard to apply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 18:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 19:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 20:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on\nmultivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have\nconsistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set\nof labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in\npractice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying\nsequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic).\nAlso, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse.

The method can use the\nlimited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal\nand abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training\ndata scarcity.

In this paper, we have come up with a novel two-layer approach\nto disaggregate the unknown PV generation and native demand from the known\nhourly net demand data recorded by smart meters: 1) At the aggregate level, the\nproposed approach separates the total PV generation and native demand time\nseries from the total net demand time series for customers with PVs. 2) At the\ncustomer level, the separated aggregate-level PV generation is allocated to\nindividual PVs. These two layers leverage the spatial correlations of native\ndemand and PV generation, respectively. One primary advantage of our proposed\napproach is that it is more independent and practical compared to previous\nworks because it does not require PV array parameters, meteorological data and\npreviously recorded solar power exemplars.

In this work, we study the\nproblem of safe reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomous racing, using the\nvehicle's ego-camera view and speed as input. Given the nature of the task,\nautonomous agents need to be able to 1) identify and avoid unsafe scenarios\nunder the complex vehicle dynamics, and 2) make sub-second decision in a\nfast-changing environment. To satisfy these criteria, we propose to incorporate\nHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory, a safety verification method for\ngeneral non-linear systems, into the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)\nframework.

Unitary evolution does not require a monotonic\nclock variable and can be achieved more generally by formally unwinding the\nperiodic clock movement, keeping track not only of the value of the clock\nvariable but also of the number of cycles it has gone through at any moment. As\na result, the clock is generically in a quantum state with a superposition of\ndifferent clock cycles, a key feature that distinguishes oscillating clocks\nfrom monotonic time. Because the clock and an evolving system have a common\nconserved energy, the clock is in different cycles for different energy\neigenstates of the system state.

Numerical computations show that coherence is\nalmost maintained over long time scales provided the clock period is much\nsmaller than the system period. Since the precision of atomic clocks could not\nbe achieved if atomic frequencies would be subject to additional variations\nfrom coupling to a fundamental clock, an upper bound on the clock period can be\nobtained that turns out to be much smaller than currently available direct or\nindirect measurements of time.

Existing\nmethods still have limitations for classifying scene images with great spatial\nvariability. Thus, how to extract local patch-level features effectively using\nonly image labels is still an open problem for RGB-D scene recognition. In this\npaper, we propose an efficient framework for RGB-D scene recognition, which\nadaptively selects important local features to capture the great spatial\nvariability of scene images. Specifically, we design a differentiable local\nfeature selection (DLFS) module, which can extract the appropriate number of\nkey local scenerelated features. Discriminative local theme-level and\nobject-level representations can be selected with the DLFS module from the\nspatially-correlated multi-modal RGB-D features. We take advantage of the\ncorrelation between RGB and depth modalities to provide more cues for selecting\nlocal features. To ensure that discriminative local features are selected, the\nvariational mutual information maximization loss is proposed. Additionally, the\nDLFS module can be easily extended to select local features of different\nscales. By concatenating the local-orderless and global structured multi-modal\nfeatures, the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on\npublic RGB-D scene recognition datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

The fractional changes in the flux densities are\nlarger at frequencies $>$ 15~GHz compared to those at 327~MHz and the spectral\nindices of the increased flux densities are flatter compared to the quiescent\nspectrum during these flares. These observed features are consistent with a\nmodel of uniformly expanding cloud of relativistic electrons or shock-in-jet\nmodel. Our 327~MHz dataset also overlaps with a rare form of variability $-$\nsymmetric achromatic variability (SAV) $-$ seen at higher frequencies ($>$\n15~GHz) toward the source. SAV is possibly due to gravitational milli-lensing\nof the core emission by an intervening massive object and is expected to be\ndetected at all frequencies \\cite{Vedantham2017}. No variability in association\nwith the SAV events is seen in the 327~MHz dataset; however, if SAV is due to\nthe lensing of core emission alone then the expected variability is less than\n3$\\sigma$ uncertainty in our measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 14:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

In\nthis paper, we aim to automatically identify such spurious correlations in NLP\nmodels at scale. We first leverage existing interpretability methods to extract\ntokens that significantly affect model's decision process from the input text.\nWe then distinguish \"genuine\" tokens and \"spurious\" tokens by analyzing model\npredictions across multiple corpora and further verify them through\nknowledge-aware perturbations. We show that our proposed method can effectively\nand efficiently identify a scalable set of \"shortcuts\", and mitigating these\nleads to more robust models in multiple applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 05:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

A good solution to it can provide scientists valuable information\nabout the hidden dynamic state and enable optimal feedback control. Usually,\nthe model parameters need to be inferred simultaneously with state variables,\nand a conventional particle filter can fail to solve this problem accurately\ndue to sample degeneracy. In this case, the regularized particle filter (RPF)\nis preferred to the conventional ones, as the RPF can mitigate sample\ndegeneracy by perturbing particles with artificial noise. However, the\nartificial noise introduces an additional bias to the estimate, and, thus, it\nis questionable whether the RPF can provide reliable results for SRNs.

First, we\nestablish computationally efficient RPFs for SRNs on different scales using\ndifferent dynamical models, including the continuous-time Markov process,\ntau-leaping model, and piecewise deterministic process.

The frequency spectrum of the predicted memory signal\nis roughly similar to that of the chirp signal.

In particular, 4D\ntrajectories are the most crucial component for flight attribute prediction. In\nparticular, 4D trajectories are the most crucial component for flight attribute\nprediction. Each trajectory contains spatial and temporal features that are\nassociated with uncertainties that make the prediction process complex. Today\nbecause of the increasing demand for air transportation, it is compulsory for\nairports and airlines to have an optimized schedule to use all of the airport's\ninfrastructure potential. This is possible using advanced trajectory prediction\nmethods. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model to extract the\nspatial and temporal features considering the uncertainty of the prediction\nmodel for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport(ATL). Automatic\nDependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are used as input to the models.\nThis research is conducted in three steps: (a) data preprocessing; (b)\nprediction by a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit\n(CNN-GRU) along with a 3D-CNN model; (c) The third and last step is the\ncomparison of the model's performance with the proposed model by comparing the\nexperimental results. The deep model uncertainty is considered using the\nMont-Carlo dropout (MC-Dropout). Mont-Carlo dropouts are added to the network\nlayers to enhance the model's prediction performance by a robust approach of\nswitching off between different neurons. The results show that the proposed\nmodel has low error measurements compared to the other models (i.e., 3D CNN,\nCNN-GRU). The model with MC-dropout reduces the error further by an average of\n21 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

However, in realistic scenarios, clients are often unable\nto label their data due to the lack of expertise and motivation while the\nserver may host a small amount of labeled data. How to reasonably utilize the\nserver labeled data and the clients' unlabeled data is thus of paramount\npractical importance. In this paper, we propose a new FL algorithm, called\nFedSEAL, to solve this Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) problem. Our\nalgorithm utilizes self-ensemble learning and complementary negative learning\nto enhance both the accuracy and the efficiency of clients' unsupervised\nlearning on unlabeled data, and orchestrates the model training on both the\nserver side and the clients' side. Our experimental results on Fashion-MNIST\nand CIFAR10 datasets in the SSFL setting validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, which outperforms the state-of-the-art SSFL methods by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 03:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 16:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

The standard flare\nmodels are well explained the evolution and eruption after magnetic\nreconnection around the hot cusp-structure above the top of plasma loops,\nhowever, the early evolution of the plasma loops before the onset of magnetic\nreconnection has been poorly understood. Considering that magnetic-gradients\nare ubiquitous in solar plasma loops, this work applies the magnetic-gradient\npumping (MGP) mechanism to study the early evolution of flaring plasma loops.\nThe results indicate that the early evolution depend on the magnetic field\ndistribution and the geometry of the plasma loops which dominates the balance\nbetween the accumulation and dissipation of energy around loop-tops. Driven by\nMGP process, both of the density and temperature as well as the plasma beta\nvalue around the looptop will increase in the early phase of the plasma loops\nevolution. In fact, the solar plasma loops will have two distinct evolutionary\nresults: the low, initial dense plasma loops with relatively strong magnetic\nfields tend to be stable for their maximum beta value always smaller than the\ncritical value, while the higher, initial dilute solar plasma loops with\nrelatively weak magnetic fields tend to be unstable for their beta values\nexceeding the critical value at a time of about one hour after the formation of\nthe solar magnetized plasma loop. The latter may produce ballooning instability\nand finally trigger the following magnetic reconnection and eruptions. These\nphysical scenarios may provide us a new viewpoint to understand the nature and\norigin of solar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

In one incarnation, this leads to\na theory of predictive coding, where predictions are subtracted from signals,\nreducing the cost of sending something that is already known.

We formulate this inference problem as\nmessage-passing on a graph whereby feedback serves as an internal control\nsignal aiming to maximize how well an inference tracks a target state while\nminimizing the costs of computation. We apply this novel formulation of\ninference as control to the canonical problem of inferring the hidden scalar\nstate of a linear dynamical system with Gaussian variability.

Most existingGNNs embed graph data into Euclidean space and thus\nare less effective to capture the ubiquitous hierarchical structures in\nreal-world networks. Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks(HGNNs) extend GNNs to\nhyperbolic space and thus are more effective to capture the hierarchical\nstructures of graphs in node representation learning. In hyperbolic geometry,\nthe graph hierarchical structure can be reflected by the curvatures of the\nhyperbolic space, and different curvatures can model different hierarchical\nstructures of a graph. However, most existing HGNNs manually set the curvature\nto a fixed value for simplicity, which achieves a suboptimal performance of\ngraph learning due to the complex and diverse hierarchical structures of the\ngraphs. To resolve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Curvature Exploration\nHyperbolic Graph NeuralNetwork named ACE-HGNN to adaptively learn the optimal\ncurvature according to the input graph and downstream tasks.

These changes might trigger compile-time,\nlink-time, or run-time errors in client code. As a result, clients may hesitate\nto upgrade their dependencies, raising security concerns and making future\nupgrades even more difficult.Understanding how libraries evolve helps client\ndevelopers to know which changes to expect and where to expect them, and\nlibrary developers to understand how they might impact their clients. In the\nmost extensive study to date, Raemaekers et al. investigate to what extent\ndevelopers of Java libraries hosted on the Maven Central Repository (MCR)\nfollow semantic versioning conventions to signal the introduction of BCs and\nhow these changes impact client projects.

We identify and address some limitations of the original\nprotocol and expand the analysis to a new corpus spanning seven more years of\nthe MCR.

Pseudo-labeling approaches have proven to be\neffective for UDA re-ID.

After a brief\ncooling phase, the merged cores resume accretion. But, the evolution timescale\nof transitional discs is too brief for the cores to acquire sufficiently\nmassive envelopes to undergo runaway accretion despite their large combined\nmasses. Consequently, these events lead to the emergence of CSS without their\ntransformation into gas giants.

A non-linear\nratchet model with stick-slips reproduces many faces of the phenomenon. The\ncollective motion discussed here underlies phenomena observed recently with\nvibrofluidized granular materials, such as persistent rotations and anomalous\ndiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 08:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 09:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

It is a challenging task that requires a system to understand,\nsummarize, and translate at the same time, making it highly related to\nMonolingual Summarization (MS) and Machine Translation (MT). In practice, the\ntraining resources for Machine Translation are far more than that for\ncross-lingual and monolingual summarization. Thus incorporating the Machine\nTranslation corpus into CLS would be beneficial for its performance. However,\nthe present work only leverages a simple multi-task framework to bring Machine\nTranslation in, lacking deeper exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntask, Cross-lingual Summarization with Compression rate (CSC), to benefit\nCross-Lingual Summarization by large-scale Machine Translation corpus. Through\nintroducing compression rate, the information ratio between the source and the\ntarget text, we regard the MT task as a special CLS task with a compression\nrate of 100%. Hence they can be trained as a unified task, sharing knowledge\nmore effectively. However, a huge gap exists between the MT task and the CLS\ntask, where samples with compression rates between 30% and 90% are extremely\nrare. Hence, to bridge these two tasks smoothly, we propose an effective data\naugmentation method to produce document-summary pairs with different\ncompression rates. The proposed method not only improves the performance of the\nCLS task, but also provides controllability to generate summaries in desired\nlengths. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms various strong\nbaselines in three cross-lingual summarization datasets.

The route leaks can disrupt the internet traffic and cause\nlarge outages. The accurately detection of route leaks requires the share of AS\nbusiness relationship information of ASes. However, the business relationship\ninformation between ASes is confidential due to economic issues. Thus, ASes are\nusually unwilling to revealing this information to the other ASes, especially\ntheir competitors. Recent advancements in federated learning make it possible\nto share data while maintaining privacy. Motivated by this, in this paper we\nstudy the route leak problem by considering the privacy of business\nrelationships between ASes, and propose a method for route leak detection with\nprivacy guarantee by using blockchain-based federated learning framework, in\nwhich ASes can train a global detection model without revealing their business\nrelationships directly. Moreover, the proposed method provides a\nself-validation scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies,\nwhich mitigates route leaks' lack of ground truth.

The results show that the proposed method has a\nbetter performance in detecting route leaks than a single AS detection\nregardless of whether using balanced or unbalanced datasets.

To this\npurpose, a novel class of transformations, named the Isometric\n$\\alpha$-transformation ($\\alpha$-IT), is proposed, which encompasses the\ntraditional Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) transformation. It is shown that the ILR\nis the limit case of the $\\alpha$-IT as $\\alpha$ tends to 0 and that $\\alpha=1$\ncorresponds to a linear transformation of the data. Unlike the ILR, the\nproposed transformation accepts 0s in the compositions when $\\alpha>0$. Maximum\nlikelihood estimation of the parameter $\\alpha$ is established. Prediction\nusing kriging on $\\alpha$-IT transformed data is validated on synthetic spatial\ncompositional data, using prediction scores computed either in the geometry\ninduced by the $\\alpha$-IT, or in the simplex. Application to land cover data\nshows that the relative superiority of the various approaches w.r.t. a\nprediction objective depends on whether the compositions contained any zero\ncomponent.

An\nintermediate geometry, corresponding to the $\\alpha$-IT with maximum likelihood\nestimate, better describes the dataset in a geostatistical setting. When the\namount of compositions with 0s is not negligible, some side-effects of the\ntransformation gets amplified as $\\alpha$ decreases, entailing poor kriging\nperformances both within the $\\alpha$-IT geometry and for metrics in the\nsimplex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 09:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

Besides, transferring the different actions to a novel target view\nrequires awareness of action category and viewpoint change simultaneously. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Pose-guided Action\nSeparable Generative Adversarial Net (PAS-GAN), which utilizes pose to\nalleviate the difficulty of this task. First, we propose a recurrent\npose-transformation module which transforms actions from the source view to the\ntarget view and generates novel view pose sequence in 2D coordinate space.\nSecond, a well-transformed pose sequence enables us to separatethe action and\nbackground in the target view. We employ a novel local-global spatial\ntransformation module to effectively generate sequential video features in the\ntarget view using these action and background features. Finally, the generated\nvideo features are used to synthesize human action with the help of a 3D\ndecoder.

The\nTAQMN, managed by Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA),\nprovides high-quality PM$_{2.5}$ measurements at $77$ monitoring stations. More\nrecently, the AirBox network was launched, consisting of low-cost, small\ninternet-of-things (IoT) microsensors (i.e., AirBoxes) at thousands of\nlocations. While the AirBox network provides broad spatial coverage, its\nmeasurements are not reliable and require calibrations. However, applying a\nuniversal calibration procedure to all AirBoxes does not work well because the\ncalibration curves vary with several factors, including the chemical\ncompositions of PM$_{2.5}$, which are not homogeneous in space. Therefore,\ndifferent calibrations are needed at different locations with different local\nenvironments. Unfortunately, most AirBoxes are not close to EPA stations,\nmaking the calibration task challenging. In this article, we propose a spatial\nmodel with spatially varying coefficients to account for heteroscedasticity in\nthe data. Our method gives adaptive calibrations of AirBoxes according to their\nlocal conditions and provides accurate PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations at any\nlocation in Taiwan, incorporating two types of measurements. In addition, the\nproposed method automatically calibrates measurements from a new AirBox once it\nis added to the network. We illustrate our approach using hourly PM$_{2.5}$\ndata in the year 2020. After the calibration, the results show that the\nPM$_{2.5}$ prediction improves about 37% to 67% in root mean-squared prediction\nerror for matching EPA data. In particular, once the calibration curves are\nestablished, we can obtain reliable PM$_{2.5}$ values at any location in\nTaiwan, even if we ignore EPA data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 10:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

To accelerate the research on reliable evaluation of adversarial\nrobustness of the current defense models in image classification, the TSAIL\ngroup at Tsinghua University and the Alibaba Security group organized this\ncompetition along with a CVPR 2021 workshop on adversarial machine learning\n(https://aisecure-workshop.github.io/amlcvpr2021/). The purpose of this\ncompetition is to motivate novel attack algorithms to evaluate adversarial\nrobustness more effectively and reliably. The participants were encouraged to\ndevelop stronger white-box attack algorithms to find the worst-case robustness\nof different defenses. This competition was conducted on an adversarial\nrobustness evaluation platform -- ARES (https://github.com/thu-ml/ares), and is\nheld on the TianChi platform\n(https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531847/introduction) as one of\nthe series of AI Security Challengers Program.

In particular, we show that solutions to\nthe cumulant based ICA model have particular structure that induces a low\ndimensional model set that resides in the cumulant tensor space. By showing a\nrestricted isometry property holds for random cumulants e.g. Gaussian\nensembles, we prove the existence of a compressive ICA scheme. Thereafter, we\npropose two algorithms of the form of an iterative projection gradient (IPG)\nand an alternating steepest descent (ASD) algorithm for compressive ICA, where\nthe order of compression asserted from the restricted isometry property is\nrealised through empirical results. We provide analysis of the CICA algorithms\nincluding the effects of finite samples. The effects of compression are\ncharacterised by a trade-off between the sketch size and the statistical\nefficiency of the ICA estimates. By considering synthetic and real datasets, we\nshow the substantial memory gains achieved over well-known ICA algorithms by\nusing one of the proposed CICA algorithms.

However, an interesting improvement in such a phenomenological\ndescription and also a change in the theoretical status of the $\\Lambda$-term\noccurs upon realizing that the vacuum energy density, $\\rho_{\\textrm{vac}}$, is\nactually a \"running quantity\" in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.\nSeveral works have shown that this option can compete with the $\\Lambda$CDM\nwith a rigid $\\Lambda$term. The so-called, \"running vacuum models\" (RVM) are\ncharacterized indeed by a $\\rho_{\\textrm{vac}}$ which is evolving with time as\na series of even powers of the Hubble parameter and its time derivatives. This\nform has been motivated by renormalization group arguments in previous works.\nHere we review a recent detailed computation by the authors of the renormalized\nenergy-momentum tensor of a non-minimally coupled scalar field with the help of\nadiabatic regularization. The final result is noteworthy:\n$\\rho_{\\textrm{vac}}(H)$ takes the precise structure of the RVM, namely a\nconstant term plus a dynamical component $\\sim H^2$ (which may be detectable in\nthe present universe) including also higher order effects $\\mathcal{O}(H^4)$\nwhich can be of interest during the early stages of the cosmological evolution.\nBesides, it is most remarkable that such renormalized form of\n$\\rho_{\\textrm{vac}}$ does not carry dangerous terms proportional to $m^4$, the\nquartic powers of the masses of the fields, which are a well-known source of\nexceedingly large contributions to the vacuum energy density and are directly\nresponsible for fine tuning in the context of the CC problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 12:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

Yet in bivariate situations, causal discovery problems remain\nchallenging. One class of such methods, that also allows tackling the bivariate\ncase, is based on Additive Noise Models (ANMs). Unfortunately, one aspect of\nthese methods has not received much attention until now: what is the impact of\ndifferent noise levels on the ability of these methods to identify the\ndirection of the causal relationship. This work aims to bridge this gap with\nthe help of an empirical study. We test Regression with Subsequent Independence\nTest (RESIT) using an exhaustive range of models where the level of additive\nnoise gradually changes from 1\\% to 10000\\% of the causes' noise level (the\nlatter remains fixed). Additionally, the experiments in this work consider\nseveral different types of distributions as well as linear and non-linear\nmodels. The results of the experiments show that ANMs methods can fail to\ncapture the true causal direction for some levels of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 13:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

However, Reynolds operators are computationally expensive\nwhen the order of the group is large because they use the sum over the whole\ngroup, which poses an implementation difficulty. To overcome this difficulty,\nwe consider representing the Reynolds operator as a sum over a subset instead\nof a sum over the whole group.

Atmospheric escape subsequently occurred by\nplasma heating, photoevaporation, Jeans escape, and photoionization. To\nquantify atmospheric loss, we combine constraints on the lifetime of surficial\nmelt, melt composition, and atmospheric composition. Consideration of two\ninitial Mercury sizes and four magma ocean compositions determine the\natmospheric speciation at a given surface temperature. A coupled\ninterior-atmosphere model determines the cooling rate and therefore the\nlifetime of surficial melt. Combining the melt lifetime and escape flux\ncalculations provide estimates for the total mass loss from early Mercury. Loss\nrates by Jeans escape are negligible. Plasma heating and photoionization are\nlimited by homopause diffusion rates of $\\sim10^{6}$ kg/s. Loss by\nphotoevaporation depends on the timing of Mercury formation and assumed heating\nefficiency and ranges from $\\sim10^{6.6}$ to $\\sim10^{9.6}$ kg/s. The material\nfor photoevaporation is sourced from below the homopause and is therefore\nenergy-limited rather than diffusion-limited. The timescale for efficient\ninterior-atmosphere chemical exchange is less than ten thousand years.\nTherefore, escape processes only account for an equivalent loss of less than\n2.3 km of crust ($0.3\\%$ of Mercury's mass). Accordingly, $\\leq0.02\\%$ of the\ntotal mass of H$_2$O and Na is lost. Therefore, cumulative loss cannot\nsignificantly modify Mercury's bulk mantle composition during the magma ocean\nstage.

The European Central Bank reported more than 11 billion cash\nwithdrawals and loading/unloading transactions on the European ATMs in 2019.\nAlthough ATMs have undergone various technological evolutions, Personal\nIdentification Numbers (PINs) are still the most common authentication method\nfor these devices. Unfortunately, the PIN mechanism is vulnerable to\nshoulder-surfing attacks performed via hidden cameras installed near the ATM to\ncatch the PIN pad. To overcome this problem, people get used to covering the\ntyping hand with the other hand. While such users probably believe this\nbehavior is safe enough to protect against mentioned attacks, there is no clear\nassessment of this countermeasure in the scientific literature.\n  This paper proposes a novel attack to reconstruct PINs entered by victims\ncovering the typing hand with the other hand. We consider the setting where the\nattacker can access an ATM PIN pad of the same brand/model as the target one.\nAfterward, the attacker uses that model to infer the digits pressed by the\nvictim while entering the PIN. Our attack owes its success to a carefully\nselected deep learning architecture that can infer the PIN from the typing hand\nposition and movements. We run a detailed experimental analysis including 58\nusers. With our approach, we can guess 30% of the 5-digit PINs within three\nattempts -- the ones usually allowed by ATM before blocking the card. We also\nconducted a survey with 78 users that managed to reach an accuracy of only\n7.92% on average for the same setting.

Initially, there is a single\nvertex affected by the cascade (the source) and the cascade spreads in discrete\ntime steps across the network. The cascade evolution is hidden, but one can\nobserve a time series of noisy signals from each vertex. The time series of a\nvertex is assumed to be a sequence of i.i.d. samples from a pre-change\ndistribution $Q_0$ before the cascade affects the vertex, and the time series\nis a sequence of i.i.d. samples from a post-change distribution $Q_1$ once the\ncascade has affected the vertex. Given the time series of noisy signals, which\ncan be viewed as a noisy measurement of the cascade evolution, we aim to devise\na procedure to reliably estimate the cascade source as fast as possible.\n  We investigate Bayesian and minimax formulations of the source estimation\nproblem, and derive near-optimal estimators for simple cascade dynamics and\nnetwork topologies. In the Bayesian setting, an estimator which observes\nsamples until the error of the Bayes-optimal estimator falls below a threshold\nachieves optimal performance. In the minimax setting, optimal performance is\nachieved by designing a novel multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio\ntest (MSPRT).

The current best conversational models, which are either\ngood chit-chatters (e.g., BlenderBot) or goal-oriented systems (e.g., MinTL),\nare language models (LMs) fine-tuned on large conversational datasets. Training\nthese models is expensive, both in terms of computational resources and time,\nand it is hard to keep them up to date with new conversational skills. A simple\nyet unexplored solution is prompt-based few-shot learning (Brown et al. 2020)\nwhich does not require gradient-based fine-tuning but instead uses a few\nexamples in the LM context as the only source of learning. In this paper, we\nexplore prompt-based few-shot learning in dialogue tasks. We benchmark LMs of\ndifferent sizes in nine response generation tasks, which include four\nknowledge-grounded tasks, a task-oriented generations task, three open-chat\ntasks, and controlled stylistic generation, and five conversational parsing\ntasks, which include dialogue state tracking, graph path generation, persona\ninformation extraction, document retrieval, and internet query generation. The\ncurrent largest released LM (GPT-J-6B) using prompt-based few-shot learning,\nand thus requiring no training, achieves competitive performance to fully\ntrained state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel prompt-based\nfew-shot classifier, that also does not require any fine-tuning, to select the\nmost appropriate prompt given a dialogue history. Finally, by combining the\npower of prompt-based few-shot learning and a Skill Selector, we create an\nend-to-end chatbot named the Few-Shot Bot (FSB), which automatically selects\nthe most appropriate conversational skill, queries different knowledge bases or\nthe internet, and uses the retrieved knowledge to generate a human-like\nresponse, all using only few dialogue examples per skill.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 14:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

To better understand how one guides multiple\npolicies toward distinct strategies and benefit from diversity, we need to\nanalyze further the influence of the reward signal modulation and other\nevolutionary mechanisms on the obtained behaviors.

Firstly,\nthey synthesize initial images without attempting to separate image attributes\nat a word-level. As a result, object attributes of initial images (that provide\na basis for subsequent refinement) are inherently entangled and ambiguous in\nnature. Secondly, by using common text-representations for all regions, current\nmethods prevent us from interpreting text in fundamentally different ways at\ndifferent parts of an image. Different image regions are therefore only allowed\nto assimilate the same type of information from text at each refinement stage.\nFinally, current methods generate refinement features only once at each\nrefinement stage and attempt to address all image aspects in a single shot.\nThis single-shot refinement limits the precision with which each refinement\nstage can learn to improve the prior image.

In contrast, we explore the\nhypothesis that it may be beneficial to extract triple slots iteratively: first\nextract easy slots, followed by the difficult ones by conditioning on the easy\nslots, and therefore achieve a better overall extraction. Based on this\nhypothesis, we propose a neural OpenIE system, milIE, that operates in an\niterative fashion. Due to the iterative nature, the system is also modular --\nit is possible to seamlessly integrate rule based extraction systems with a\nneural end-to-end system, thereby allowing rule based systems to supply\nextraction slots which milIE can leverage for extracting the remaining slots.\nWe confirm our hypothesis empirically: milIE outperforms SOTA systems on\nmultiple languages ranging from Chinese to Arabic.

Instead\nof using Nesterov's accelerating approach, our methods rely on a so-called\nHalpern-type fixed-point iteration in [32], and recently exploited by a number\nof researchers, including [24, 70]. Firstly, we derive a new variant of the\nanchored extra-gradient scheme in [70] based on Popov's past extra-gradient\nmethod to solve a maximally monotone equation $G(x) = 0$. We show that our\nmethod achieves the same $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate (up to a constant\nfactor) as in the anchored extra-gradient algorithm on the operator norm $\\Vert\nG(x_k)\\Vert$, , but requires only one evaluation of $G$ at each iteration,\nwhere $k$ is the iteration counter. Next, we develop two splitting algorithms\nto approximate a zero point of the sum of two maximally monotone operators. The\nfirst algorithm originates from the anchored extra-gradient method combining\nwith a splitting technique, while the second one is its Popov's variant which\ncan reduce the per-iteration complexity. Both algorithms appear to be new and\ncan be viewed as accelerated variants of the Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting\nmethod.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will fly a focal\nplane with 18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared (IR) detector arrays; these have\nnever been used for weak lensing and they present unique instrument calibration\nchallenges. A pair of previous investigations (Hirata & Choi 2020; Choi &\nHirata 2020) demonstrated that spatiotemporal correlations of flat fields can\neffectively separate the brighter-fatter effect (BFE) and interpixel\ncapacitance (IPC). Later work (Freudenburg et al. 2020) introduced a\nFourier-space treatment of these correlations which allowed the authors to\nexpand to higher orders in BFE, IPC, and classical nonlinearity (CNL). This\nwork expands the previous formalism to include quantum yield and charge\ndiffusion. We test the updated formalism on simulations and show that we can\nrecover input characterization values. We then apply the formalism to visible\nand IR flat field data from three Roman flight candidate detectors.

Last, we convert\nthe asymmetry of the charge diffusion into an equivalent shear signal, and find\na contamination of the shear correlation function to be $\\xi_+ \\sim 10^{-6}$\nfor each detector. This exceeds Roman's allotted error budget for the\nmeasurement by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ in power (amplitude squared) but\ncan likely be mitigated through standard methods for fitting the point spread\nfunction (PSF) since charge diffusion can be treated as a contribution to the\nPSF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

These three methods\nhave been shown to provide online control of the \"modified\" false discovery\nrate (mFDR) under a condition known as conditional superuniformity. However, to\nour knowledge, LORD & SAFFRON have only been shown to control the traditional\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) under an independence condition on the test\nstatistics. Our work bolsters these results by showing that SAFFRON and LORD\nadditionally ensure online control of the FDR under a \"local\" form of\nnonnegative dependence. Further, FDR control is maintained under certain types\nof adaptive stopping rules, such as stopping after a certain number of\nrejections have been observed. Because alpha investing can be recovered as a\nspecial case of the SAFFRON framework, our results immediately apply to alpha\ninvesting as well. In the process of deriving these results, we also formally\ncharacterize how the conditional superuniformity assumption implicitly limits\nthe allowed p-value dependencies. This implicit limitation is important not\nonly to our proposed FDR result, but also to many existing mFDR results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 02:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

We experimentally observe both conventional grain\nrotation and grain splitting in 2D colloidal polycrystals. We find that grain\nsplitting occurs via independently rotating \"granules\" whose shapes are\ndetermined by the underlying triangular lattices of the two merging crystal\ngrains. These granules are so small that existing continuum theories of grain\nboundary energy are inapplicable, so we introduce a hard sphere model for the\nfree energy of a colloidal polycrystal. We find that during splitting, the\nsystem overcomes a free energy barrier before ultimately reaching a lower free\nenergy when splitting is complete. Using simulated splitting events and a\nsimple scaling prediction, we find that the barrier to grain splitting\ndecreases as grain size decreases. Consequently, grain splitting is likely to\nplay an important role in polycrystals with small grains. This discovery\nsuggests that mesoscale models of grain coarsening may offer better predictions\nin the nanocrystalline regime by including grain splitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

To\nachieve this, one typical solution is designing modules based on RNN to capture\ntheir preferences to various locations. Although these RNN-based methods can\neffectively learn individual's hidden personalized preferences to her visited\nplaces, the interactions among users can only be weakly learned through the\nrepresentations of locations. Targeting this, we propose an end-to-end\nframework named personalized and group preference guided network (PG$^2$Net),\nconsidering the users' preferences to various places at both individual and\ncollective levels. Specifically, PG$^2$Net concatenates Bi-LSTM and attention\nmechanism to capture each user's long-term mobility tendency. To learn\npopulation's group preferences, we utilize spatial and temporal information of\nthe visitations to construct a spatio-temporal dependency module. We adopt a\ngraph embedding method to map users' trajectory into a hidden space, capturing\ntheir sequential relation.

Two MP are\ndetected for both data sets, while the literature reports five and four MP from\nhigh- and low-resolution spectroscopy respectively. The silhouette analysis\nsuggests that the population sub-structure is reliable for high-resolution\nspectroscopy data, while the actual existence of MP is questionable for the\nlow-resolution spectroscopy data.

Petri nets and its extensions are used in most works.\nHowever, existing verifiers based on Petri nets are difficult to be complete\nand efficient. Basic Parallel Process (BPP), as a subclass of Petri nets, can\nbe used as a model for describing and verifying concurrent programs with lower\ncomplexity. We propose and implement BPPChecker, the first model checker for\nverifying a subclass of CTL on BPP. We propose constraint-based algorithms for\nthe problem of model checking on BPPs and handle formulas by SMT solver Z3. For\nEF operator, we reduce the model checking of EF-formulas to the satisfiability\nproblem of existential Presburger formula. For EG operator, we provide a k-step\nbounded semantics and reduce the model checking of EG-formulas to the\nsatisfiability problem of linear integer arithmetic. Besides, we give Actor\nCommunicating System (ACS) the over-approximation BPP-based semantics and\nevaluate BPPChecker on ACSs generated from real Erlang programs.

In such dry atmospheric plasma priming process, we show that a\nHe-N2 plasma treatment of 20 min can reduce the median germination time of\nlentil seeds from 1420 min to 1145 minutes, ie a gain in vigor of 275 min (or\n+19.4 %). Considering that this result depends on the plasma-seed interaction\nand therefore on the contact surfaces between the seeds and the plasma, a\ntopographic modeling of a 100 seeds-stack is performed in the dielectric\nbarrier device. This model drives to the distinction between the seed-seed\ncontact surfaces (276 contacts standing for a total area of 230.6 mm2) and the\nseed-wall contact surfaces (134 contacts standing for a total area of 105.9\nmm2). After a single plasma treatment, the outer envelope of each seed is 92%\nexposed to plasma: a value high enough to support the relevance of the plasma\nprocess but which also opens the way to process optimizations. In this outlook,\nwe propose to replace the single 20-minute plasma treatment by a \"plasma\nsequence\", ie a succession of shorter plasma treatments whose total duration\nremains 20 min. Between two successive plasma treatments, the seeds can follow\neither a trapping procedure (seeds in same positions and orientations) or a\nrandomizing procedure (seeds in same positions but reoriented) or a stirring\nprocedure (seeds vigorously shaken). A sequence of 10 plasma treatments (upon 2\nmin) separated by short stirring procedures leads to a gain in vigor as high as\n405 min vs 275 min for a single plasma treatment of 20 min. We propose to\nunderstand these results by correlating the gain in vigor with the water uptake\nof the seeds and the wettability state of their coating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 13:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

A common method of evaluating the robustness of GRNs\nis to measure their ability to regulate a set of perturbed gene activation\npatterns back to their unperturbed forms. Usually, perturbations are obtained\nby collecting random samples produced by a predefined distribution of gene\nactivation patterns. This sampling method introduces stochasticity, in turn\ninducing dynamicity. This dynamicity is imposed on top of an already complex\nfitness landscape. So where sampling is used, it is important to understand\nwhich effects arise from the structure of the fitness landscape, and which\narise from the dynamicity imposed on it. Stochasticity of the fitness function\nalso causes difficulties in reproducibility and in post-experimental analyses.\n  We develop a deterministic distributional fitness evaluation by considering\nthe complete distribution of gene activity patterns, so as to avoid\nstochasticity in fitness assessment. This fitness evaluation facilitates\nrepeatability. Its determinism permits us to ascertain theoretical bounds on\nthe fitness, and thus to identify whether the algorithm has reached a global\noptimum. It enables us to differentiate the effects of the problem domain from\nthose of the noisy fitness evaluation, and thus to resolve two remaining\nanomalies in the behaviour of the problem domain\nof~\\citet{espinosa2010specialization}.

Thus,\nreliable estimates of the time to the critical condition, under which there\nwill be no available servers to respond the next incoming call, become very\nuseful measures of the system's performance. In this contribution, we develop a\nkey performance indicator by providing an explicit formula for the average time\nto the shortage condition. Our analytical expression for this average time is a\nfunction of the number of parallel servers and the inter-arrival and service\ntimes. We assume exponential distributions of times in our analytical\nexpression but for evaluating the mean first-passage time to the critical\ncondition under more realistic scenarios we validate our result through\nexhaustive simulations with lognormal service time distributions. For this task\nwe have implemented an simulator in $R$. Our results indicate that our\nanalytical formula is an acceptable approximation under any situation of\npractical interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

In this paper, we propose a cost-aware optimal scheduling\nand allocation strategy for distributed computing systems while minimizing the\ncost function including response time and service cost. First, based on the\nproposed cost function, we derive the optimal request scheduling policy and the\noptimal resource allocation policy synchronously. Second, considering the\neffects of incoming requests on the scheduling policy, the additive increase\nmultiplicative decrease (AIMD) mechanism is implemented to model the relation\nbetween the request arrival and scheduling. In particular, the AIMD parameters\ncan be designed such that the derived optimal strategy is still valid. Finally,\na numerical example is presented to illustrate the derived results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 11:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}
