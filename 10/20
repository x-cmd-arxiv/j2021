The properties of\nthe evolution varies with observation frequency. However, observational studies\nremained difficult due to the lack of high fidelity imaging capabilities at\nthese fine temporal scales simultaneously across wide spectral bands. I present\na spectroscopic snapshot imaging (0.5 s, 160 kHz resolution) study of a\ntype-III burst event across 80 - 200 MHz band. By modelling the temporal\nvariability of the source sizes and intensity at every observation frequency,\nthe characteristics of coronal turbulence is studied across a heliocentric\nheight range of ~1.54 - 1.75 $R_\\odot$. To understand the morphological\nevolution of the type-III source, a 2D Gaussian fitting procedure is used. The\nobserved trends in the source area and integrated flux density are analysed in\nthe framework of theoretical and data driven models.Results.The strength of\ndensity fluctuations ($\\delta N/N$) in the corona is derived as a function of\nheight (R). Combined with the archival low frequency data, $\\delta N/N$ values\nacross ~1.5 - 2.2 $R_\\odot$ agree within a few factors. The burst decay time\n($\\tau_{decay}$) and the FWHM of the source showed a power-law dependency with\nfrequency, roughly consistent with the results from data driven models.\nHowever,the values of $\\tau_{decay}$ across frequency are higher than expected.\nThe intrinsic sizes of the burst source were derived correcting for scatter\nbroadening. This roughly matched the expected size of flux tubes at the coronal\nheights explored. I also report the observation of an intrinsic anti-phased\npulsation in area and flux density of the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 08:02:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 07:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 19:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

With the ongoing integration of ML models into everyday life, the\ndeployment and continuous application of models becomes more and more an\nimportant issue. Hence, small models which offer good predictive performance\nbut use small amounts of memory are required. Ensemble pruning is a standard\ntechnique to remove unnecessary classifiers from an ensemble to reduce the\noverall resource consumption and sometimes even improve the performance of the\noriginal ensemble. In this paper, we revisit ensemble pruning in the context of\n`modernly' trained Random Forests where trees are very large. We show that the\nimprovement effects of pruning diminishes for ensembles of large trees but that\npruning has an overall better accuracy-memory trade-off than RF. However,\npruning does not offer fine-grained control over this trade-off because it\nremoves entire trees from the ensemble. To further improve the accuracy-memory\ntrade-off we present a simple, yet surprisingly effective algorithm that\nrefines the predictions in the leaf nodes in the forest via stochastic gradient\ndescent. We evaluate our method against 7 state-of-the-art pruning methods and\nshow that our method outperforms the other methods on 11 of 16 datasets with a\nstatistically significant better accuracy-memory trade-off compared to most\nmethods. We conclude our experimental evaluation with a case study showing that\nour method can be applied in a real-world setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The DPC coupled with the standard Particle\nShifting (PS) technique has given rise to a hybrid approach that we propose to\nalleviate particle clustering issues in the free-surface and splashed regions.\nWe validate the proposed techniques to four benchmark cases: (i) the\noscillating droplet, (ii) the two-dimensional water dam-break, (iii) the\ntwo-dimensional water sloshing, and (iv) the three-dimensional water dam break\nagainst a rigid obstacle. We evaluate their impacts on the stability, accuracy\nand the conservation properties of the test cases. The qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of the results shows that despite its simplicity, the DPC\ntechnique is more effective in reducing the spatial disorder and capturing the\nimpact events compared with the standard and the newly improved hybrid PS\nmethods. Although the hybrid PS technique improves particle distribution at the\nfree surface, it still suffers from the inconsistent implementation of the PS\nequation which unphysically increases the fluid volume and violates the\nconservation of potential energy in the long-term simulations. Overall, the\nconservative DPC algorithm proves to be a simple and efficient alternative\nregularization technique for simulating such highly dynamic free-surface flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 15:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

We formalize the relevant causal structure of problems such as\ndynamic personalized pricing and other operations management problems in the\npresence of potentially high-dimensional user types. The key insight is that an\nindividual-level response is often not causally affected by the state variable\nand can therefore easily be generalized across timesteps and states. When this\nis true, we study implications for (doubly robust) off-policy evaluation and\nlearning by instead leveraging single time-step evaluation, estimating the\nexpectation over a single arrival via data from a population, for fitted-value\niteration in a marginal MDP.

The sparsity does not mean zero-valued entries are massive or\ndominated. Rather, it implies the observed entries are very few, and even fewer\nwith the growth of the tensor; this is ubiquitous in practice. Compared with\nthe existent works, our model not only leverages the structural information\nunderlying the observed entry indices, but also provides extra interpretability\nand flexibility -- it can simultaneously estimate a set of location factors\nabout the intrinsic properties of the tensor nodes, and another set of\nsociability factors reflecting their extrovert activity in interacting with\nothers; users are free to choose a trade-off between the two types of factors.\nSpecifically, we use hierarchical Gamma processes and Poisson random measures\nto construct a tensor-valued process, which can freely sample the two types of\nfactors to generate tensors and always guarantees an asymptotic sparsity. We\nthen normalize the tensor process to obtain hierarchical Dirichlet processes to\nsample each observed entry index, and use a Gaussian process to sample the\nentry value as a nonlinear function of the factors, so as to capture both the\nsparse structure properties and complex node relationships.

This is because malicious clients can collude\nand send in carefully tailored model updates to make the global model\ninaccurate. This motivated the development of Byzantine-resilient federated\nlearning algorithms, such as Krum, Bulyan, FABA, and FoolsGold. However, a\nrecently developed untargeted model poisoning attack showed that all prior\ndefenses can be bypassed. The attack uses the intuition that simply by changing\nthe sign of the gradient updates that the optimizer is computing, for a set of\nmalicious clients, a model can be diverted from the optima to increase the test\nerror rate. In this work, we develop TESSERACT---a defense against this\ndirected deviation attack, a state-of-the-art model poisoning attack.

Selective data transmission based on in-orbit inferences will\naddress these issues to a great extent. Therefore, to decrease the cost of the\nsatellite mission, we propose a novel system design for selective data\ntransmission, based on in-orbit inferences. As the resolution of images plays a\ncritical role in making precise inferences, we also include in-orbit\nsuper-resolution (SR) in the system design.

By analyzing the real-world PMU data, we\nfind it is challenging to directly use this dataset for event classifiers due\nto the low data quality observed in PMU measurements and event logs. To address\nthese challenges, we develop a novel machine learning framework for training\nrobust event classifiers, which consists of three main steps: data\npreprocessing, fine-grained event data extraction, and feature engineering.\nSpecifically, the data preprocessing step addresses the data quality issues of\nPMU measurements (e.g., bad data and missing data); in the fine-grained event\ndata extraction step, a model-free event detection method is developed to\naccurately localize the events from the inaccurate event timestamps in the\nevent logs; and the feature engineering step constructs the event features\nbased on the patterns of different event types, in order to improve the\nperformance and the interpretability of the event classifiers. Based on the\nproposed framework, we develop a workflow for event classification using the\nreal-world PMU data streaming into the system in real-time. Using the proposed\nframework, robust event classifiers can be efficiently trained based on many\noff-the-shelf lightweight machine learning models.

The\nidea is that attacker A first makes the user U connect to his website (or to a\nwell-known site the attacker controls) and transparently collects the\ninformation from U that is used for fingerprinting purposes. Then, A\norchestrates a browser on his own machine to replicate and transmit the same\nfingerprinting information when connecting to W, fooling W to think that U is\nthe one requesting the service rather than A. This will allow the attacker to\nprofile U and compromise U's privacy. We design and implement the Gummy\nBrowsers attack using three orchestration methods based on script injection,\nbrowser settings and debugging tools, and script modification, that can\nsuccessfully spoof a wide variety of fingerprinting features to mimic many\ndifferent browsers (including mobile browsers and the Tor browser). We then\nevaluate the attack against two state-of-the-art browser fingerprinting\nsystems, FPStalker and Panopticlick. Our results show that A can accurately\nmatch his own manipulated browser fingerprint with that of any targeted victim\nuser U's fingerprint for a long period of time, without significantly affecting\nthe tracking of U and when only collecting U's fingerprinting information only\nonce. The TPR (true positive rate) for the tracking of the benign user in the\npresence of the attack is larger than 0.9 in most cases. The FPR (false\npositive rate) for the tracking of the attacker is also high, larger than 0.9\nin all cases. We also argue that the attack can remain completely oblivious to\nthe user and the website, thus making it extremely difficult to thwart in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The survey spans an effective area of\n4139 square degrees and uses the images of over 100 million galaxies to\nreconstruct the convergence field. The second moment of the convergence as a\nfunction of smoothing scale contains information similar to standard shear\n2-point statistics. The third moment, or the skewness, contains additional\nnon-Gaussian information. The data is analysed in the context of the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, varying 5 cosmological parameters and 19 nuisance\nparameters modelling astrophysical and measurement systematics. Our modelling\nof the observables is completely analytical, and has been tested with\nsimulations in our previous methodology study. We obtain a 1.7\\% measurement of\nthe amplitude of fluctuations parameter $S_8\\equiv \\sigma_8\n(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.784\\pm 0.013$. The measurements are shown to be\ninternally consistent across redshift bins, angular scales, and between second\nand third moments.

In this work, we study the clustering of weak\nlensing peaks, and present parameter constraint forecasts for an LSST-like\nsurvey.

We investigate the dependence of the peak\ntwo-point correlation function on the peak height, and find that the clustering\nof low amplitude peaks is complementary to that of high amplitude peaks.\nConsequently, their combination gives significantly tighter constraints than\nthe clustering of high peaks alone. The peak two-point correlation function is\nsignificantly more sensitive to the cosmological parameters $h$ and $w_0$ than\nthe peak abundance, and when the probes are combined, constraints on\n$\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, $S_8$, $h$ and $w_0$ improve by at least a factor of two,\nrelative to the peak abundance alone.

To address this challenge, we quantify\nhow the presence of loss in repeater stations affect the maximum attainable\nrates for quantum communication over linear repeater chains and more complex\nquantum networks. Extending the framework of node splitting, we model the loss\nintroduced at the repeater stations and then prove the corresponding limits.

Standard practice directly analyzes the\nhigh-dimensional candidate predictor space in a linear model; statistical\nanalyses are then substantially hampered by the daunting challenge posed by the\nastronomically large number of correlated predictors with limited sample size.\nWe formulate this problem as variable selection with operator-induced structure\n(OIS), and propose a new method to achieve unconventional dimension reduction\nby utilizing the geometry embedded in OIS. Although the model remains linear,\nwe iterate nonparametric variable selection for effective dimension reduction.\nThis enables variable selection based on ab initio primary variables, leading\nto a method that is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, with\nimproved accuracy.

A\ncommonly used metric to compare meta-heuristic solvers is the time required to\nobtain an optimal solution, known as time to solution. However, for some\napplications it is desirable to have a set of high-quality and diverse\nsolutions, instead of a single optimal one. For these applications, time to\nsolution may not be informative of the performance of a solver, and another\nmetric would be necessary. In particular, it is not known how well quantum\nsolvers sample the configuration space in comparison to their classical\ncounterparts. Here, we apply a recently introduced collective distance measure\nin solution space to quantify diversity by Mohseni et. al. and, based on that,\nwe employ time-to-diversity as a metric for evaluation of meta-heuristics\nsolvers. We use this measure to compare the performance of the D-Wave quantum\nannealing processor with a few classical heuristic solvers on a set of\nsynthetic problems and show that D-Wave quantum annealing processor is indeed a\ncompetitive heuristic, and on many instances outperforms state-of-the-art\nclassical solvers, while it remains on par on other instances. This suggests\nthat a portfolio solver that combines quantum and classical solutions may win\nover all solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 18:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 19:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Two major developments have gained\nsignificant momentum recently: an advanced use of edge resources and the\nintegration of machine learning techniques for engineering applications. This\nevolution raises major challenges, in particular related to the appropriate\ndistribution of computing elements along an edge-to-cloud continuum. About\nthis, Federated Learning has been recently proposed for distributed model\ntraining in the edge. The principle of this approach is to aggregate models\nlearned on distributed clients in order to obtain a new, more general model.\nThe resulting model is then redistributed to clients for further training. To\ndate, the most popular federated learning algorithm uses coordinate-wise\naveraging of the model parameters for aggregation. However, it has been shown\nthat this method is not adapted in heterogeneous environments where data is not\nidentically and independently distributed (non-iid). This corresponds directly\nto some pervasive computing scenarios where heterogeneity of devices and users\nchallenges machine learning with the double objective of generalization and\npersonalization. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation algorithm,\ntermed FedDist, which is able to modify its model architecture (here, deep\nneural network) by identifying dissimilarities between specific neurons amongst\nthe clients. This permits to account for clients' specificity without impairing\ngeneralization. Furthermore, we define a complete method to evaluate federated\nlearning in a realistic way taking generalization and personalization into\naccount.\n  Using this method, FedDist is extensively tested and compared with three\nstate-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on the pervasive domain of Human\nActivity Recognition with smartphones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 19:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

In this study, we developed a conductance-based single compartment\nmodel of an STN neuron, which is able to generate characteristic activity\npatterns observed in experiments including hyperpolarization-induced bursts and\npost-inhibitory rebound bursts. This study focused on the role of three\ncurrents in rhythm generation: T-type calcium (CaT) current, L-type calcium\n(CaL) current, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)\ncurrent. To investigate the effects of these currents in rhythm generation, we\nperformed a bifurcation analysis using slow variables in these currents.\nBifurcation analysis showed that the HCN current promotes single-spike activity\npatterns rather than bursting in agreement with experimental results. It also\nshowed that the CaT current is necessary for characteristic bursting activity\npatterns. In particular, the CaT current enables STN neurons to generate these\nactivity patterns under hyperpolarizing stimuli. The CaL current enriches and\nreinforces these characteristic activity patterns. In hyperpolarization-induced\nbursts or post-inhibitory rebound bursts, the CaL current allows STN neurons to\ngenerate long bursting patterns. Thus, bifurcation analysis explained the\nsynergistic interaction of the CaT and CaL currents, which enables STN neurons\nto respond to hyperpolarizing stimuli in a salient way. The results of this\nstudy implicate the importance of CaT and CaL currents in the pathophysiology\nof the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 19:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Agents are\nconnected through a weighted undirected network of contacts, and the planner's\nobjective is to determine the policy that contains the spread of infection\nbelow a tolerable incidence level, and that maximizes the present discounted\nvalue of real income, in that order of priority. The optimal unique policy\ndepends both on the configuration of the contact network and the tolerable\ninfection incidence. Comparative statics analyses are conducted: (i) they\nreveal the tradeoff between the economic cost of the pandemic and the infection\nincidence allowed; and (ii) they suggest a correlation between different\nmeasures of network centrality and individual lockdown probability with the\ncorrelation increasing with the tolerable infection incidence level. Using\nunique data on the networks of nursing and long-term homes in the U.S., we\ncalibrate our model at the state level and estimate the tolerable COVID-19\ninfection incidence level. We find that laissez-faire (more tolerance to the\nvirus spread) pandemic policy is associated with an increased number of deaths\nin nursing homes and higher state GDP growth. In terms of the death count,\nlaissez-faire is more harmful to nursing homes than more peripheral in the\nnetworks, those located in deprived counties, and those who work for a profit.\nWe also find that U.S. states with a Republican governor have a higher level of\ntolerable incidence, but policies tend to converge with high death count.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 19:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

These\ndevices show potential as the critical link between quantum information\ncontained at frequencies as disparate as those in the optical and microwave\ndomains, thus enabling applications such as long distance networking of\nsuperconducting quantum computers. However, the requirements on the operating\nparameters of the transducers necessary to achieve quantum operation have yet\nto be characterized. In this work we find simple, explicit expressions for the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which doubly-parametric transducers\nin the resolved-sideband, steady-state limit are capable of entangling optical\nand microwave modes. Our analysis treats the transducer as a two-mode bosonic\nGaussian channel capable of both beamsplitter-type and two-mode squeezing-type\ninteractions between optical and microwave modes. For the beamsplitter-type\ninteraction, we find parameter thresholds which distinguish regions of the\nchannel's separability, capacity for bound entanglement, and capacity for\ndistillable entanglement. By contrast, the two-mode squeezing-type interaction\nalways produces distillable entanglement with no restrictions on temperature,\ncooperativities, or losses. Finally, we find the entanglement breaking\nconditions on the reduced one-mode upconversion and downconversion channels\nobtained by initializing the unused input with vacuum while ignoring the unused\noutput. These differences between the entanglement thresholds of the\nbeamsplitter-type and two-mode squeezing-type interactions are then important\nconsiderations in the construction of larger quantum networks that integrate\nmultiple transducers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 20:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

On\nthe other hand, it extends Neural Operators -- generalizations of neural\nnetworks to model mappings between spaces of functions -- in that it can\nparameterize solution operators of SPDEs depending simultaneously on the\ninitial condition and a realization of the driving noise. By performing\noperations in the spectral domain, we show how a Neural SPDE can be evaluated\nin two ways, either by calling an ODE solver (emulating a spectral Galerkin\nscheme), or by solving a fixed point problem. Experiments on various semilinear\nSPDEs, including the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate how the\nNeural SPDE model is capable of learning complex spatiotemporal dynamics in a\nresolution-invariant way, with better accuracy and lighter training data\nrequirements compared to alternative models, and up to 3 orders of magnitude\nfaster than traditional solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 20:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 17:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 07:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 13:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 09:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 11:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 09:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

It is worth claiming that, at the\nmoment, strong evidence that the temperature of the stars is zero during the\nlast orbits before coalescing does not exist. Contrariwise, there are some\ntheoretical predictions suggesting that the star's temperature might even be a\nfew MeV. According to the main theory, the tides transfer mechanical energy and\nangular momentum to the star at the expense of the orbit, where friction within\nthe star converts the mechanical energy into heat. During the inspiral these\neffects are potentially detectable. Different treatments have been used to\nestimate the transfer of the mechanical energy and the size of the tidal\nfriction, leading to different conclusions about the importance of pre-merger\ntidal effects. The present work is dedicated to the study of the effect of\ntemperature on the tidal deformability of neutron stars during the inspiral of\na neutron star system just before the merger. We applied a class of hot\nequations of state originated from various nuclear models and found that even\nfor low values of temperature ($T<1$ MeV) the effects on the basic ingredients\nof tidal deformability are not negligible. However, according to the main\nfinding, the effect of the temperature on the tidal deformability is\nindistinguishable. The consequences of this unexpected result are discussed and\nanalyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 21:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Incorporating historical information has the potential\nto significantly lower the expensive cost associated with collecting ground\ntruth and, more importantly, enable early- and in-season mapping that is\nhelpful to many pre-harvest decisions. In this study, we propose a new approach\nthat can effectively transfer knowledge about the topology (i.e. relative\nposition) of different crop types in the spectral feature space (e.g. the\nhistogram of SWIR1 vs RDEG1 bands) to generate labels, thereby support crop\nclassification in a different year.

We tested this approach for\nmapping corn/soybeans in the US Midwest and paddy rice/corn/soybeans in\nNortheast China using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. Results show that our\napproach automatically generates high-quality labels for crops in the target\nyear immediately after each image becomes available.

In\npractice, one test input may be leveraged by different ML models. Test time\nattacks targeting a single ML model often neglect their impact on other ML\nmodels. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that naively attacking the\nclassifier learning one concept may negatively impact classifiers trained to\nlearn other concepts. For example, for the online image classification\nscenario, when the Gender classifier is under attack, the (wearing) Glasses\nclassifier is simultaneously attacked with the accuracy dropped from 98.69 to\n88.42. This raises an interesting question: is it possible to attack one set of\nclassifiers without impacting the other set that uses the same test instance?\nAnswers to the above research question have interesting implications for\nprotecting privacy against ML model misuse. Attacking ML models that pose\nunnecessary risks of privacy invasion can be an important tool for protecting\nindividuals from harmful privacy exploitation. In this paper, we address the\nabove research question by developing novel attack techniques that can\nsimultaneously attack one set of ML models while preserving the accuracy of the\nother. In the case of linear classifiers, we provide a theoretical framework\nfor finding an optimal solution to generate such adversarial examples. Using\nthis theoretical framework, we develop a multi-concept attack strategy in the\ncontext of deep learning. Our results demonstrate that our techniques can\nsuccessfully attack the target classes while protecting the protected classes\nin many different settings, which is not possible with the existing test-time\nattack-single strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 22:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

In a nutshell, we use the large teacher models to\nguide the lightweight student models to only make correct predictions on a\nsubset of \"easy\" examples; for the \"hard\" examples, we fall-back to the\nteacher. Such an approach allows us to efficiently employ large models in\npractical scenarios where easy examples are much more frequent than rare hard\nexamples. Our proposed use of distillation to only handle easy instances allows\nfor a more aggressive trade-off in the student size, thereby reducing the\namortized cost of inference and achieving better accuracy than standard\ndistillation.

It is motivated by the observation that most problems\nin Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE) can be formulated as that of\ncompleting (from data) a computational graph (or hypergraph) representing\ndependencies between functions and variables. Nodes represent variables, and\nedges represent functions. Functions and variables may be known, unknown, or\nrandom. Data comes in the form of observations of distinct values of a finite\nnumber of subsets of the variables of the graph (satisfying its functional\ndependencies). The underlying problem combines a regression problem\n(approximating unknown functions) with a matrix completion problem (recovering\nunobserved variables in the data). Replacing unknown functions by Gaussian\nProcesses (GPs) and conditioning on observed data provides a simple but\nefficient approach to completing such graphs. Since this completion process can\nbe reduced to an algorithm, as one solves $\\sqrt{2}$ on a pocket calculator\nwithout thinking about it, one could, with the automation of the proposed\nframework, solve a complex CSE problem by drawing a diagram. Compared to\ntraditional kriging, the proposed framework can be used to recover unknown\nfunctions with much scarcer data by exploiting interdependencies between\nmultiple functions and variables. The underlying problem could therefore also\nbe interpreted as a generalization of that of solving linear systems of\nequations to that of approximating unknown variables and functions with noisy,\nincomplete, and nonlinear dependencies. Numerous examples illustrate the\nflexibility, scope, efficacy, and robustness of the proposed framework and show\nhow it can be used as a pathway to identifying simple solutions to classical\nCSE problems (digital twin modeling, dimension reduction, mode decomposition,\netc.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 21:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

The\nlow-energy physics of these systems is governed by interacting fermionic\nquasiparticles with momenta and energies near a Fermi surface in momentum\nspace. Nonequilibrium properties are described by a kinetic equation for the\ndistribution function for quasiparticles proposed by Landau. Quasiparticle\ninteractions with other quasiparticles, phonons or impurities lead to internal\nforces acting on a distribution of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, as well as\ncollision processes that ultimately limit the transport of mass, heat, charge\nand magnetization, as well as limit the coherence times of quasiparticles. For\nFermi liquids that are close to a second order phase transition, e.g. Fermi\nliquids that undergo a superfluid transition, \\emph{incipient} Cooper pairs -\nlong-lived fluctuations of the ordered phase - provide a new channel for\nscattering quasiparticles, as well as corrections to internal forces acting on\nthe distribution of nonequilibrium quasiparticles. We develop the theory of\nquasiparticle transport for Fermi liquids in the vicinity of a BCS-type\nsuperfluid transition starting from Keldysh's field theory for non-equilibrium,\nstrongly interacting fermions. The leading corrections to Fermi liquid theory\nfor non-equilibrium quasiparticle transport near a Cooper instability arise\nfrom the virtual emission and absorption of incipient Cooper pairs. Our theory\nis applicable to quasiparticle transport in superconductors, nuclear matter and\nthe low temperature phases of liquid $^3$He. As an implementation of the theory\nwe calculate the pairing fluctuation corrections to the attenuation of zero\nsound in liquid $^3$He near the superfluid transition and demonstrate\nquantitative agreement with experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 02:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

We find that dilaton-matter couplings that would be excluded in the\nabsence of an axion can become acceptable given an additional small\naxion-matter coupling, and this is possible because the axion-dilaton\ninteractions end up converting the would-be dilaton profile into an axion\nprofile. The trajectories of matter test bodies are then controlled by the much\nweaker axion-matter couplings and can easily be small enough to escape\ndetection.

Customers and servers that arrive into\na matching queue depart as soon as they are matched. It is known that a\nstate-dependent control is needed to ensure the stability of a matching queue.\nHowever, analytically studying the steady-state behaviour of a matching queue,\nin general, is challenging. Therefore, inspired by the heavy-traffic regime in\nclassical queueing theory, we study a matching queue in an asymptotic regime\nwhere the state-dependent control decreases to zero. It turns out that there\nare two different ways the control can be sent to zero, and we model these\nusing two parameters viz., $\\epsilon$ is the magnitude scaling parameter that\ngoes to zero and $\\tau$ is the time scaling parameter that goes to infinity.\nIntuitively, $\\epsilon$ scales the magnitude of the state-dependent control,\nand $\\tau$ is the threshold after which we modulate the control.\n  We show that depending on the relative rates of $\\epsilon$ and $\\tau$, there\nis a phase transition in the limiting regime. We christen the regime when\n$\\epsilon \\tau \\to 0$, the time dominates magnitude (TDM) regime, and the\nlimiting behaviour is a Laplace distribution. The phase transition starts in\nthe regime when, $\\epsilon \\tau $ goes to a nonzero constant when the limiting\ndistribution is a Gibbs distribution, and so we call it the hybrid regime.

For the regression analysis with doubly truncated response\nvariables, the existence of double truncation may bring bias for estimation as\nwell as affect variable selection. We propose a simultaneous estimation and\nvariable selection procedure for the doubly truncated regression, allowing a\ndiverging number of regression parameters. To remove the bias introduced by the\ndouble truncation, a Mann-Whitney-type loss function is used. The adaptive\nLASSO penalty is then added into the loss function to achieve simultaneous\nestimation and variable selection. An iterative algorithm is designed to\noptimize the resulting objective function. We establish the consistency and the\nasymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. The oracle property of the\nproposed selection procedure is also obtained. Some simulation studies are\nconducted to show the finite sample performance of the proposed approach.

To alleviate\nthese limitations, we introduce 3DFaceFill, an analysis-by-synthesis approach\nfor face completion that explicitly considers the image formation process. It\ncomprises three components, (1) an encoder that disentangles the face into its\nconstituent 3D mesh, 3D pose, illumination and albedo factors, (2) an\nautoencoder that inpaints the UV representation of facial albedo, and (3) a\nrenderer that resynthesizes the completed face.

On receiving the\nidentity token, the RP transforms PID_U into a permanent account (denoted as\nAcct) of the user, by an ephemeral trapdoor in the negotiation. Given a user,\nthe account at each RP is unique and different from ID_U, so collusive RPs\ncannot link his identities across these RPs.

Based on HLCD, a manifold-adapted modification of the Cram\\'er-von\nMises distance (HCvMD) is established to measure the statistical divergence\nbetween two Dirac mixtures of arbitrary dimensions. Given a (source) Dirac\nmixture with many components representing an unknown hyperspherical\ndistribution, a (target) Dirac mixture with fewer components is obtained via\nmatching the source in the sense of least HCvMD. As the number of target Dirac\ncomponents is configurable, the underlying distributions is represented in a\nmore efficient and informative way. Based upon this hyperspherical Dirac\nmixture reapproximation (HDMR), we derive a density estimation method and a\nrecursive filter. For density estimation, a maximum likelihood method is\nprovided to reconstruct the underlying continuous distribution in the form of a\nvon Mises-Fisher mixture. For recursive filtering, we introduce the\nhyperspherical reapproximation discrete filter (HRDF) for nonlinear\nhyperspherical estimation of dynamic systems under unknown system noise of\narbitrary form.

Several magnitude-limited samples were built that reproduce various\nlevels of magnification bias ranging from s = 0 to s = 1.2, where s is the\nlogarithmic slope of the cumulative magnitude number counts, in three redshift\nintervals within 1 < z < 1.95.

A large MR, namely a huge response to a\nlow external field, has always been a useful functional feature in industrial\ntechnology and a core goal pursued by physicists and materials scientists.\nConventional large MR materials are mainly manganites, whose colossal MR (CMR)\ncan be as high as -90%. The dominant mechanism is attributed to spin\nconfiguration aligned by the external field, which reduces magnetic scattering\nand thus resistance. In recent years, some new systems have shown an extremely\nlarge unsaturated MR (XMR). Unlike ordinary metals, the positive MR of these\nsystems can reach 103-108% and is persistent under super high magnetic fields.\nThe XMR materials are mainly metals or semimetals, distributed in high-mobility\ntopological or non-topological systems, and some are magnetic, which suggests a\nwide range of application scenarios. Various mechanisms have been proposed for\nthe potential physical origin of XMR, including electron-hole compensation,\nsteep band, ultrahigh mobility, high residual resistance ratio, topological\nfermions, etc. It turns out that some mechanisms play a leading role in certain\nsystems, while more are far from clearly defined. In addition, the researches\non XMR are largely overlapped or closely correlated with other recently rising\nphysics and materials researches, such as topological matters and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials, which makes elucidating the mechanism of XMR\neven more important.

It is designed to build on and exceed the scope and\nscientific/technological accomplishments of Cassini-Huygens, exploring Titan in\nways that were not previously possible, in particular through full close-up and\nin situ coverage over long periods of time. In the proposed mission\narchitecture, POSEIDON consists of two major elements: a spacecraft with a\nlarge set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably in a\nlow-eccentricity polar orbit, and a suite of in situ investigation components,\ni.e. a lake lander, a \"heavy\" drone (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of\nmini-drones, dedicated to the exploration of the polar regions.

Two major\nchallenges for route recommendation are route representation and user\nrepresentation. Different from items that can be identified by unique IDs in\ntraditional recommendation, routes are combinations of links (i.e., a road\nsegment and its following action like turning left) and the number of\ncombinations could be close to infinite. Besides, the representation of a route\nchanges under different scenarios. These facts result in severe sparsity of\nroutes, which increases the difficulty of route representation. Moreover, link\nattribute deficiencies and errors affect preciseness of route representation.\nBecause of the sparsity of routes, the interaction data between users and\nroutes are also sparse. This makes it not easy to acquire user representation\nfrom historical user-item interactions as traditional recommendations do. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel learning framework R4. In R4, we\ndesign a sparse & dense network to obtain representations of routes. The sparse\nunit learns link ID embeddings and aggregates them to represent a route, which\ncaptures implicit route characteristics and subsequently alleviates problems\ncaused by link attribute deficiencies and errors. The dense unit extracts\nimplicit local features of routes from link attributes. For user\nrepresentation, we utilize a series of historical navigation to extract user\npreference.

In this setting, the concern for the parties is\nthe privacy of their data and their optimal allocations. We propose a two-step\napproach to meet the privacy requirements of the parties. In the first step, we\nobtain a reformulated model that is amenable to a decomposition scheme.\nAlthough this scheme eliminates almost all data exchange, it does not provide a\nformal privacy guarantee. In the second step, we provide this guarantee with a\ndifferentially private algorithm at the expense of deviating slightly from the\noptimality.

In this\npaper, we present an efficient bio-inspired event-camera-driven depth\nestimation algorithm. In our approach, we dynamically illuminate areas of\ninterest densely, depending on the scene activity detected by the event camera,\nand sparsely illuminate areas in the field of view with no motion. The depth\nestimation is achieved by an event-based structured light system consisting of\na laser point projector coupled with a second event-based sensor tuned to\ndetect the reflection of the laser from the scene.

Multiple mechanisms are known to give rise to turbulence in\nprotoplanetary disks, which facilitates the accretion onto the central star.\nSmall dust particles that are well coupled to the gas undergo diffusion due to\nthis turbulent motion. Aims. This paper investigates the influence of\nturbulence induced dust diffusion on the equilibrium of protoplanetary disks.\nMethods. The model accounts for dust sublimation, radiative transfer with the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation and dust diffusion. It predicts the\ndensity and temperature profiles as well as the dust-to-gas ratio of the disk.\nResults. It is shown that dust diffusion can have a large impact: assuming the\ndust survives for 104 seconds or longer before it can be evaporated, leads the\ndust diffusion to widen the inner disk considerably. The latter effect is\ngenerated through a feedback mechanism as the diffusion length is much smaller\nthan the disk width. With increasing dust diffusion, the inclination of the\ninner rim towards the stellar radiation becomes steeper until it is almost\nvertical. The temperature range of evaporation and condensation, which is\nlinked to the dust composition, has no influence on this effect. Conclusions.\nFor realistic parameters dust diffusion can not be neglected when determining\nthe equilibrium of the disk. Stronger turbulence inside the disk induces more\ndust diffusion. Therefore, the dust density grows more gradually over a greater\ndistance and less radiation reaches the disk surface. The new equilibrium shape\nof the disk is more inclined towards the star. This effect is universal and\nindependent of the specific dust composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 12:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

To achieve this, we carefully\ndesign a pair of regression constraints, i.e., motion and appearance\nconstraints, that can provide strong regularization on the generated mesh\nsequences. Our AniFormer achieves high-fidelity, realistic, temporally coherent\nanimated results and outperforms compared start-of-the-art methods on\nbenchmarks of diverse categories.

Any deliberate discrimination of traffic of one application\nwhile favoring others violates the principle of neutrality. Many countries have\nenforced laws against such discrimination. To enforce such laws, one requires\ntools to detect any net neutrality violations. However, detecting such\nviolations is challenging as it is hard to separate any degradation in quality\ndue to natural network effects and selective degradation. Also, legitimate\ntraffic management and deliberate discrimination methods can be technically the\nsame, making it further challenging to distinguish them.\n  We developed an end-to-end measurement framework named FairNet to detect\ndiscrimination of traffic. It compares the performance of similar services. Our\nfocus is on HTTPS streaming services which constitute a predominant portion of\nthe Internet traffic. The effect of confounding factors (congestion, traffic\nmanagement policy, dynamic rate adaptation) is made `similar' on the test\nservices to ensure a fair comparison. FairNet framework uses a ``replay\nserver'' and user-client that exchanges correctly identifiable traffic streams\nover the Internet. The Server Name Indication (SNI) field in the TLS handshake,\nwhich goes in plaintext, ensures that the traffic from the replay server\nappears to network middle-boxes as that coming from its actual server. We\nvalidated that appropriate SNIs results in the correct classification of\nservices using a commercial traffic shaper. FairNet uses two novel algorithms\nbased on application-level throughput and connection status to detect traffic\ndiscrimination. We also validated the methodology's effectiveness by collecting\nnetwork logs through mobile apps over the live Internet and analyzing them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 12:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Because these jets are not fully opaque in chromospheric\nlines, one cannot study their spectra without the highly complex considerations\nof radiative transfer in spectral lines from the atmosphere behind the fan. We\nget around this by taking advantage of a unique set of observations of the\nH$\\alpha$ line along with the Ca II 8542 and Ca II K lines obtained with the\nSwedish 1-m Solar Telescope where a fan-shaped jet was backlit by an X9.3\nflare. The H$\\alpha$ flare ribbon emission profiles from behind the fan are\nhighly broadened and flattened, allowing us to investigate the fan as if it\nwere backlit by continuous emission. Using this model we derived the opacity\nand velocity of the material in the jet and what we believe to be the first\nobservationally derived estimate of the mass and density of material in a\nfan-shaped jet. Using inversions of Ca II 8542 emission via STiC, we were also\nable to estimate the temperature in the jet. Finally, we use the masses and POS\nand LOS velocities as functions of time to investigate the downward supply of\nenergy and momentum to the photosphere in the collapse of this jet, and\nevaluate it as a potential driver for a sunquake beneath.

Although built at a high cost, they remain\n\\emph{under-exploited} -- practitioners usually pick one PTM from the provided\nmodel hub by popularity and then fine-tune the PTM to solve the target task.\nThis na\\\"ive but common practice poses two obstacles to full exploitation of\npre-trained model hubs: first, the PTM selection by popularity has no\noptimality guarantee, and second, only one PTM is used while the remaining PTMs\nare ignored.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new paradigm for exploiting model hubs that is\nintermediate between these extremes.

In essence, the generation hosting capacity is determined\nagainst the set of limiting factors--voltage, thermal (conductor loading),\nreverse flow (at the feeder head, station transformer, or substation), and\nchange in the voltage (due to sudden change in generation output)). Not that\nlong ago, California Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) added a new criterion that\ndoes not allow reverse flow at the supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) points that can change the system configuration, aiming to prevent the\npotential transfer of reverse flow to an adjacent feeder.

Given a power spectrum, the ensuing cosmic microwave background\nis calculated and compared to the observed one. Thus, one focus of modern\ncosmology is building well-motivated inflationary models that predict the\nprimordial power spectrum observables. The common practice uses analytic terms\nfor the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the index running $\\alpha$, forgoing\nthe effort required to evaluate the model numerically. However, the validity of\nthese terms has never been rigorously probed and relies on perturbative\nmethods, which may lose their efficacy for large perturbations. The requirement\nfor more accurate theoretical predictions becomes crucial with the advent of\nhighly sensitive measuring instruments. This paper probes the limits of the\nperturbative treatment that connects inflationary potential parameters to\nprimordial power spectrum observables. We show that the validity of analytic\napproximations of the scalar index roughly respects the large-field/small-field\ndichotomy. We supply an easily calculated measure for relative perturbation\namplitude and show that, for large field models, the validity of analytical\nterms extends to $\\sim 3\\%$ perturbation relative to a power-law inflation\nmodel. Conversely, the analytical treatment loses its validity for small-field\nmodels with as little as $0.1\\%$ perturbation relative to the small-field\ntest-case. By employing the most general artificial neural networks and\nmultinomial functions up to the twentieth degree and demonstrating their\nshortcomings, we show that no reasonable analytic expressions correlating small\nfield models to the observables the yield exists.

Two related key issues are\naddressed: 1) the random-fuzzy dual interpretation of unknown quantity being\nestimated; 2) the principle of selecting sigma-max operator for practical\nproblems, such as estimation and recognition. Our perspective, conceived from\ndefinitions of randomness and fuzziness, is that continuous unknown quantity\ninvolved in estimation with inaccurate prior should be more appropriately\nmodeled as randomness and handled by sigma inference; whereas discrete unknown\nquantity involved in recognition with insufficient (and inaccurate) prior could\nbe better modeled as fuzziness and handled by max inference. The philosophy was\ndemonstrated by an updated version of the well-known interacting multiple model\n(IMM) filter, for which the jump Markovian System is reformulated as a hybrid\nuncertainty system, with continuous state evolution modeled as usual as\nmodel-conditioned stochastic system and discrete mode transitions modeled as\nfuzzy system by a possibility (instead of probability) transition matrix, and\nhypotheses mixing is conducted by using the operation of \"max\" instead of\n\"sigma\". For our example of maneuvering target tracking using simulated data\nfrom both a short-range fire control radar and a long-range surveillance radar,\nthe updated IMM filter shows significant improvement over the classic IMM\nfilter, due to its peculiarity of hard decision of system model and a faster\nresponse to the transition of discrete mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 14:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 00:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 07:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

A general\nmapping problem aims to obtain an optimal mapping that minimizes an energy\nfunctional subject to the given constraints. Existing methods to solve the\nmapping problems are often inefficient and can sometimes get trapped in local\nminima. An extra challenge arises when the optimal mapping is required to be\ndiffeomorphic. In this work, we address the problem by proposing a\ndeep-learning framework based on the Quasiconformal (QC) Teichmuller theories.\nThe main strategy is to learn the Beltrami coefficient (BC) that represents a\nmapping as the latent feature vector in the deep neural network. The BC\nmeasures the local geometric distortion under the mapping, with which the\ninterpretability of the deep neural network can be enhanced. Under this\nframework, the diffeomorphic property of the mapping can be controlled via a\nsimple activation function within the network. The optimal mapping can also be\neasily regularized by integrating the BC into the loss function. A crucial\nadvantage of the proposed framework is that once the network is successfully\ntrained, the optimized mapping corresponding to each input data information can\nbe obtained in real time. To examine the efficacy of the proposed framework, we\napply the method to the diffeomorphic image registration problem.

Recently, with powerful representation for\npairwise text-image inputs via early interaction, the accuracy of\nvision-language (VL) transformers has outperformed existing methods for\ntext-image retrieval. However, when the same paradigm is used for inference,\nthe efficiency of the VL transformers is still too low to be applied in a real\ncross-modal SE. Inspired by the mechanism of human learning and using\ncross-modal knowledge, this paper presents a novel Vision-Language Decomposed\nTransformer (VLDeformer), which greatly increases the efficiency of VL\ntransformers while maintaining their outstanding accuracy. By the proposed\nmethod, the cross-model retrieval is separated into two stages: the VL\ntransformer learning stage, and the VL decomposition stage. The latter stage\nplays the role of single modal indexing, which is to some extent like the term\nindexing of a text SE. The model learns cross-modal knowledge from\nearly-interaction pre-training and is then decomposed into an individual\nencoder. The decomposition requires only small target datasets for supervision\nand achieves both $1000+$ times acceleration and less than $0.6$\\% average\nrecall drop.

These long-time\nbehaviours, however, often mask more complex dynamics, such as the side-to-side\nsnakelike motion exhibited by spermatozoa as they swim, propelled by the\nfrequent and periodic beating of their flagellum. Many models of motion neglect\nthese effects in favour of smoother long-term behaviours, which are often of\ngreater practical interest than the small-scale oscillatory motion. Whilst it\nmay be tempting to ignore any yawing motion, simply assuming that any effects\nof rapid oscillations cancel out over a period, a precise quantification of the\nimpacts of high-frequency yawing is lacking. In this study, we systematically\nevaluate the long-term effects of general high-frequency oscillations on\ntranslational and angular motion, cast in the context of microswimmers but\napplicable more generally. Via a multiple-scales asymptotic analysis, we show\nthat rapid oscillations can cause a long-term bias in the average direction of\nprogression. We identify sufficient conditions for an unbiased long-term effect\nof yawing, and we quantify how yawing modifies the speed of propulsion and the\neffective hydrodynamic shape when in shear flow. Furthermore, we investigate\nand justify the long-time validity of the derived leading-order solutions and,\nby direct computational simulation, we evidence the relevance of the presented\nresults to a canonical microswimmer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Rev. Lett. 66,\n1713-1716 (1991)], have been generalized to diverse practical scenarios,\nyielding novel physical intuitions and possibilities of application for those\nphenomena. The properties of materials, in particular, the electrical\npermittivity and permeability, exert significant influences on the\nCasimir-Cifshitz energies and forces, and hence on the corresponding premelting\nand formation of ice. To address these influences in detail and explore the\nresulting physics, here we revisit and extend the analyses of previous work,\nwith both the dielectric data utilized there and the latest dielectric\nfunctions for ice and cold water. While our previous results are rederived, an\nerror there has also been spotted. For the four-layer cases considered by some\nof us, the existence of stable configurations depending on the initial\nconditions has been confirmed, and different types of stability corresponding\nto minima of the Casimir-Lifshitz free energy are demonstrated. As the new\ndielectric functions for ice and cold water deviate considerably from those\nused by Elbaum and Schick, their vital impacts on three- and four-layer\nconfigurations are therefore being reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 07:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Besides the challenges of development, testing,\nand logistics, another factor that might play a significant role in the fight\nagainst the pandemic are people who are hesitant to get vaccinated, or even\nstate that they will refuse any vaccine offered to them. Two groups of people\ncommonly referred to as a) pro-vaxxer, those who support vaccinating people b)\nvax-skeptic, those who question vaccine efficacy or the need for general\nvaccination against Covid-19.

Starting with the\nbreakthrough work of Long et al.

Aside from seeking solutions in general model design for information\nshrinkage due to pooling, urban-scene image itself has intrinsic features like\npositional patterns [3]. Our project seeks an advanced and integrated solution\nthat specifically targets urban-scene image semantic segmentation among the\nmost novel approaches in the current field. We re-implement the cutting edge\nmodel DeepLabv3+ [4] with ResNet-101 [5] backbone as our strong baseline model.\nBased upon DeepLabv3+, we incorporate HANet [3] to account for the vertical\nspatial priors in urban-scene image tasks. To boost up model efficiency and\nperformance, we further explore the Atrous Spatial Pooling (ASP) layer in\nDeepLabv3+ and infuse a computational efficient variation called \"Waterfall\"\nAtrous Spatial Pooling (WASP) [6] architecture in our model. We find that our\ntwo-step integrated model improves the mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU)\nscore gradually from the baseline model. In particular, HANet successfully\nidentifies height-driven patterns and improves per-class IoU of common class\nlabels in urban scenario like fence and bus. We also demonstrate the\nimprovement of model efficiency with help of WASP in terms of computational\ntimes during training and parameter reduction from the original ASPP module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 08:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

More specifically, we investigate this question using a\nnovel dataset on internet display advertising auctions that exploits a\nstaggered adoption by different publishers (sellers) of first-price auctions\n(FPAs), instead of the traditional second-price auctions (SPAs). Event study\nregression estimates indicate that, immediately after the auction format\nchange, the revenue per sold impression (price) jumped considerably for the\ntreated publishers relative to the control publishers, ranging from 35% to 75%\nof the pre-treatment price level of the treatment group. Further, we observe\nthat in later auction format changes the increase in the price levels under\nFPAs relative to price levels under SPAs dissipates over time, reminiscent of\nthe celebrated revenue equivalence theorem. We take this as evidence of\ninitially insufficient bid shading after the format change rather than an\nimmediate shift to a new Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Prices then went down as\nbidders learned to shade their bids. We also show that bidders' sophistication\nimpacted their response to the auction format change. Our work constitutes one\nof the first field studies on bidders' responses to auction format changes,\nproviding an important complement to theoretical model predictions.
