This technique is\ncalled distributed transmit beamforming. Beamforming (BF) relies on the BF\nradios having frequency synchronized carriers and phases adjusted for coherent\ncombining. Both requirements are typically met by exchanging preambles with the\ndestination. However, since BF aims to increase the communication range, the\nindividually transmitted preambles are typically at low SNR and their lengths\nare constrained by the channel coherence time. These noisy preambles lead to\nerrors in frequency and phase estimation, which result in randomly changing BF\ngains. To build reliable distributed BF systems, the impact of estimation\nerrors on the BF gains need to be considered in the design. In this work,\nassuming a destination-led BF protocol and Kalman filter for frequency\ntracking, we optimize the number of BF radios and the preamble lengths to\nachieve reliable BF gain. To do that, we characterize the relations between the\nBF gains distribution, the channel coherence time, and design parameters like\nthe SNR, preamble lengths, and the number of radios. The proposed relations are\nverified using simulations and via experiments using software-defined radios in\na lab and on UAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 16:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We model the QRF orientations as coherent\nstates which give rise to a covariant POVM, furnishing a consistent probability\ninterpretation and encompassing non-ideal QRFs whose orientations are not\nperfectly distinguishable.

We show examples of\nspin-resolved valence-band mapping in the UV, VUV, soft- and hard-X-ray range.\nSpin mapping of the Heusler compounds Co$_2$MnGa and\nCo$_2$Fe$_{0.4}$Mn$_{0.6}$Si at $h\\nu=6$~eV prove that the second compound is a\nhalf-metallic ferromagnet. Analysis of the Tamm state on Re(0001) using\nVUV-excitation reveals a Rashba-type spin texture. Bulk band structure\nincluding Fermi surface, Fermi velocity distribution $v_F(k,E_F)$, full CDAD\ntexture and spin signature of W(110) have been derived via tomographic mapping\nwith soft X-rays. Hard X-rays enable accessing large k$_{par}$-regions so that\nthe final-state sphere crosses many Brillouin zones in $k$-space with different\n$k_z$. At $h\\nu=5.3$~keV this fast 4D mapping mode (at fixed $h\\nu$) revealed\nthe temperature dependence of the Fermi surface of the Kondo system\nYbRh$_2$Si$_2$. Probing the true bulk spin polarization of Fe$_3$O$_4$ at\n$h\\nu=5$~keV proved its half-metallic nature. The emerging method of ToF-MM\nwith fs X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser enables simultaneous valence,\ncore-level and photoelectron diffraction measurements in the ultrafast regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 16:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 10:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Observations are available of\nplanetary systems and of some protoplanetary disks, which can serve as a\nstarting point for these investigations. Detected systems reveal different\narchitectures of planets. One particularly interesting case to consider is the\nKepler-223 system, which contains a rare configuration of four planets in a\nresonance chain, implying a certain migration history. We aim to use the\norbital configuration of Kepler-223's planets to constrain the parameters of\nthe protoplanetary disk that allow for the formation of a chain of mean-motion\nresonances that resembles the one of Kepler-223. The parameters we aim to\ninvestigate are primarily the disk viscosity and surface density. We use the\nswift_symba N-body integrator with additional dissipative forces to mimic\nplanet-disk interactions. We constrain the surface densities and viscosities\nthat allow the formation of a resonant chain like that of Kepler-223.

Unlike other machine-learning approaches,\nreservoir computing relaxes the need for optimization of intra-network\nparameters, and is thus particularly attractive for near-term\nhardware-efficient quantum implementations. However, the complete description\nof practical quantum reservoir computers requires accounting for their\nplacement in a quantum measurement chain, and its conditional evolution under\nmeasurement. Consequently, training and inference has to be performed using\nfinite samples from obtained measurement records. Here we describe a framework\nfor reservoir computing with nonlinear quantum reservoirs under continuous\nheterodyne measurement. Using an efficient truncated-cumulants representation\nof the complete measurement chain enables us to sample stochastic measurement\ntrajectories from reservoirs of several coupled nonlinear bosonic modes under\nstrong excitation.

We propose the\nfollowing dominant factors that might be responsible for low k$_L$ behavior in\nthese materials: 1) softening of transverse acoustic (TA) phonon modes despite\nlow atomic mass, 2) low lying optic (LLO) phonon modes fall deep into acoustic\nmode region which enhances overlap between longitudinal acoustic (LA) and LLO\nphonon modes which increases scattering phase space, 3) short phonon lifetimes\nand high scattering rates, 4) relatively high density (\\r{ho}) and large\nGr\\\"uneisen parameter.

Recent works have demonstrated that FL is vulnerable to model\npoisoning attacks. Several server-based defense approaches (e.g. robust\naggregation), have been proposed to mitigate such attacks. However, we\nempirically show that under extremely strong attacks, these defensive methods\nfail to guarantee the robustness of FL. More importantly, we observe that as\nlong as the global model is polluted, the impact of attacks on the global model\nwill remain in subsequent rounds even if there are no subsequent attacks. In\nthis work, we propose a client-based defense, named White Blood Cell for\nFederated Learning (FL-WBC), which can mitigate model poisoning attacks that\nhave already polluted the global model. The key idea of FL-WBC is to identify\nthe parameter space where long-lasting attack effect on parameters resides and\nperturb that space during local training. Furthermore, we derive a certified\nrobustness guarantee against model poisoning attacks and a convergence\nguarantee to FedAvg after applying our FL-WBC. We conduct experiments on\nFasionMNIST and CIFAR10 to evaluate the defense against state-of-the-art model\npoisoning attacks. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively\nmitigate model poisoning attack impact on the global model within 5\ncommunication rounds with nearly no accuracy drop under both IID and Non-IID\nsettings. Our defense is also complementary to existing server-based robust\naggregation approaches and can further improve the robustness of FL under\nextremely strong attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We find that the scattering cross section is not at\nall represented by the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton picture of potential scattering\nfrom two localized sources with half the mass at each source. We discuss how\nour result would be lethal to the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton description of\ngravitation interacting with quantum matter and would be conducive to\nconsidering the gravitational field to be quantized. We comment on the\nexperimental feasibility of observing such effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

The selection mechanism is commonly integrated into the model\nitself by specifying a two-component cascaded system consisting of a rationale\ngenerator, which makes a binary selection of the input features (which is the\nrationale), and a predictor, which predicts the output based only on the\nselected features. The components are trained jointly to optimize prediction\nperformance. In this paper, we reveal a major problem with such cooperative\nrationalization paradigm -- model interlocking. Interlocking arises when the\npredictor overfits to the features selected by the generator thus reinforcing\nthe generator's selection even if the selected rationales are sub-optimal. The\nfundamental cause of the interlocking problem is that the rationalization\nobjective to be minimized is concave with respect to the generator's selection\npolicy. We propose a new rationalization framework, called A2R, which\nintroduces a third component into the architecture, a predictor driven by soft\nattention as opposed to selection. The generator now realizes both soft and\nhard attention over the features and these are fed into the two different\npredictors. While the generator still seeks to support the original predictor\nperformance, it also minimizes a gap between the two predictors. As we will\nshow theoretically, since the attention-based predictor exhibits a better\nconvexity property, A2R can overcome the concavity barrier. Our experiments on\ntwo synthetic benchmarks and two real datasets demonstrate that A2R can\nsignificantly alleviate the interlock problem and find explanations that better\nalign with human judgments.

Similarly, potential energy can be due to the inter- and intra-halo\ninteractions. Intra-halo virial equilibrium is established much faster than\ninter-halo. Change of energy of entire system comes from virilization in halos.\nAt statistically steady state, continuous mass exchange is required to sustain\ngrowth of total halo mass $M_h\\propto a^{1/2}$ and energy $E\\propto a^{3/2}$,\nwhere $a$ is scale factor. Inverse cascade is identified for kinetic energy\nthat is transferred from the smallest scale to large mass scales. This is\nsustained by the direct cascade of potential energy from large to small scale.\nBoth energies have a scale- and time-independent flux in propagation range that\nis proportional to mass flux. Energy cascade is mostly facilitated by mass\ncascade, which can be quantitatively described by mass accretion of typical\nhalos. Halo radial, angular momentum, and angular velocity are modelled and\ninverse cascade is identified for the coherent radial and rotational motion in\nhalos. In turbulence, vortex stretching (shape changing) along its axis of spin\nenables energy cascade from large to small length scales. However, change in\nhalo shape is not the dominant mechanism for energy cascade as the moment of\ninertial gained from shape changing is less than 2 times. Large halos exhibit\npreference for prolateness over oblateness and most halos have spin axis\nperpendicular to major axis. Since mass cascade is local in mass space, halo\nshape evolves continuously in mass space with halos formed by incrementally\ninheriting structure from progenitor halos. A unique evolution path of halos is\nfound that gradually approaches sphere with increasing size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 05:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

However, many real-world graphs -\ni.e., heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) - evolve dynamically in the context\nof heterogeneous graph structures. The dynamics associated with heterogeneity\nhave posed new challenges for HTG representation learning. To solve this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose heterogeneous temporal graph neural network\n(HTGNN) to integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving\nthe heterogeneity to learn node representations over HTGs. Specifically, in\neach layer of HTGNN, we propose a hierarchical aggregation mechanism, including\nintra-relation, inter-relation, and across-time aggregations, to jointly model\nheterogeneous spatial dependencies and temporal dimensions. To retain the\nheterogeneity, intra-relation aggregation is first performed over each slice of\nHTG to attentively aggregate information of neighbors with the same type of\nrelation, and then intra-relation aggregation is exploited to gather\ninformation over different types of relations; to handle temporal dependencies,\nacross-time aggregation is conducted to exchange information across different\ngraph slices over the HTG. The proposed HTGNN is a holistic framework tailored\nheterogeneity with evolution in time and space for HTG representation learning.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on the HTGs built from different real-world\ndatasets and promising results demonstrate the outstanding performance of HTGNN\nby comparison with state-of-the-art baselines.

Unlike conventional representations that treat\nvideos as frame sequences, we represent videos as neural networks taking frame\nindex as input. Given a frame index, NeRV outputs the corresponding RGB image.\nVideo encoding in NeRV is simply fitting a neural network to video frames and\ndecoding process is a simple feedforward operation. As an image-wise implicit\nrepresentation, NeRV output the whole image and shows great efficiency compared\nto pixel-wise implicit representation, improving the encoding speed by 25x to\n70x, the decoding speed by 38x to 132x, while achieving better video quality.\nWith such a representation, we can treat videos as neural networks, simplifying\nseveral video-related tasks. For example, conventional video compression\nmethods are restricted by a long and complex pipeline, specifically designed\nfor the task. In contrast, with NeRV, we can use any neural network compression\nmethod as a proxy for video compression, and achieve comparable performance to\ntraditional frame-based video compression approaches (H.264, HEVC \\etc).\nBesides compression, we demonstrate the generalization of NeRV for video\ndenoising.

This anisotropy triggers a class of\nbuoyancy instabilities that destabilize the ICM, and whose turbulent motions\ncan augment or impede heat transport. We focus on the magneto-thermal\ninstability (MTI), which may be active in the periphery of galaxy clusters.

We simulate MTI\nturbulence with a Boussinesq code, SNOOPY, which, in contrast to previous work,\nallows us to perform an extensive sampling of the parameter space.

Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new\nimaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in the COSMOS field. This\npaper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of this new imaging\ndata to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection\nand multi-wavelength photometry is performed for 1.7 million sources across the\n$2\\,\\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ of the COSMOS field, $\\sim$966,000 of which are measured\nwith all available broad-band data using both traditional aperture photometric\nmethods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer,\nwhich we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric\ncatalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in\neach catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a\ncomparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and\nof the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency\nin the resulting photometric redshifts. The $i<21$ sources have sub-percent\nphotometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at $25<i<27$ reach\na precision of $5\\,\\%$. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of\nprevious, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to\nCOSMOS2015, reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one\nmagnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift\nsolutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual\nastronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC IRSA, and CDS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

RR Lyrae stars are useful standard candles allowing one to derive\naccurate distances for old star clusters.

Both\nMHD models treat the solar wind as a single-ion plasma for protons, which\ninclude thermal solar wind ions, pick-up ions (PUIs), and electrons. Our ENA\nprescription partitions the plasma into three distinct ion populations (thermal\nsolar wind, PUIs transmitted and ones energized at the termination shock) and\nmodels the populations with Maxwellian distributions. Both kinetic-MHD\nheliospheric models produce a heliotail with heliosheath plasma organized by\nthe solar magnetic field into two distinct north and south columns that become\nlobes of high mass flux flowing down the heliotail, though in the BU model the\nISM flows between the two lobes at distances in the heliotail larger than 300\nAU.

This problem is present in other ENA models with the Maxwellian\napproximation of multiple ion species and indicates that a higher neutral\ndensity or some acceleration of PUIs in the heliosheath is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 19:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Aside\nfrom depleted stocks caused by overfishing, illegal encroachments by fishermen\nfrom one nation into another's legal waters are a common occurrence. This\nbehavior presumably could be stopped via strong monitoring, controls, and\nsurveillance (MCS), but MCS is routinely rated below standards for nations\nbordering the ECS. This paper generalizes the ECS to a model of a congested\nmaritime environment, defined as an environment where multiple nations can fish\nin the same waters with equivalent operating costs, and uses game-theoretic\nanalysis to explain why the observed behavior persists in the ECS. The paper\nfinds that nations in congested environments are incentivized to issue\nexcessive quotas, which in turn tacitly encourages illegal fishing and extracts\nillegal rent from another's legal waters. This behavior couldn't persist in the\nface of strong MCS measures, and states are thus likewise incentivized to use\npoor MCS. A bargaining problem is analyzed to complement the noncooperative\ngame, and a key finding is the nation with lower nonoperating costs has great\nleverage during the bargain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 19:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 01:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

We\nused a data set associated with a COVID-19 drug re-purposing study from Oak\nRidge National Laboratory. This study identified existing candidate coronavirus\ntreatments, including drugs and approved compounds, which had been analyzed and\nranked according to their potential for blocking the ability of the SARS-COV-2\nvirus to invade human cells. We investigated the occurrence of these candidates\nin temporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus.

We identified\nthree classes of behaviors: those where frequency and contextual shifts were\nsmall and positively correlated; those where there was no correlation between\nfrequency and contextual changes; and those where there was a negative\ncorrelation between frequency and contextual shift. We speculate that the\nlatter two patterns are indicative that a target candidate therapeutics is\nundergoing active evaluation.

Twenty-five participants performed multiple\nsuturing tasks using our simulator. The YOLO network has been modified to a\nmulti-task network, for the purpose of tool localization and tool-hand\ninteraction detection. This was accomplished by splitting the YOLO detection\nheads so that they supported both tasks with minimal addition to computer\nrun-time. Furthermore, based on the outcome of the system, motion metrics were\ncalculated. These metrics included traditional metrics such as time and path\nlength as well as new metrics assessing the technique participants use for\nholding the tools. The dual-task network performance was similar to that of two\nnetworks, while computational load was only slightly bigger than one network.\nIn addition, the motion metrics showed significant differences between experts\nand novices. While video capture is an essential part of minimally invasive\nsurgery, it is not an integral component of open surgery. Thus, new algorithms,\nfocusing on the unique challenges open surgery videos present, are required. In\nthis study, a dual-task network was developed to solve both a localization task\nand a hand-tool interaction task.

Although DRL can be used to\nsolve complex problems, DRL frameworks still struggle to compete with\nstate-of-the-art heuristics showing a substantial performance gap. This paper\nproposes a novel hierarchical problem-solving strategy, termed learning\ncollaborative policies (LCP), which can effectively find the near-optimum\nsolution using two iterative DRL policies: the seeder and reviser. The seeder\ngenerates as diversified candidate solutions as possible (seeds) while being\ndedicated to exploring over the full combinatorial action space (i.e., sequence\nof assignment action). To this end, we train the seeder's policy using a simple\nyet effective entropy regularization reward to encourage the seeder to find\ndiverse solutions. On the other hand, the reviser modifies each candidate\nsolution generated by the seeder; it partitions the full trajectory into\nsub-tours and simultaneously revises each sub-tour to minimize its traveling\ndistance. Thus, the reviser is trained to improve the candidate solution's\nquality, focusing on the reduced solution space (which is beneficial for\nexploitation). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed two-policies\ncollaboration scheme improves over single-policy DRL framework on various\nNP-hard routing problems, including TSP, prize collecting TSP (PCTSP), and\ncapacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 19:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

A\nstriking example is the opposite doping dependence of the CDW ordering\nwavevector in La-based and Y-based compounds, the two families where charge\nordering is strongest and best characterized. Here we report a combined\nresonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) and neutron scattering study of charge\nand spin density waves in isotopically enriched La$_{1.8-x}$ Eu$_{0.2}$\nSr$_{x}$ CuO$_{4}$ over a range of doping $0.07 \\leq x \\leq 0.20$. For all\ndopings studied by RSXS, we find that the CDW amplitude is approximately\ntemperature-independent and develops well above experimentally accessible\ntemperatures. Surprisingly, the CDW ordering wavevector shows a non-monotonic\ntemperature dependence, with a sudden change occurring at temperatures near the\nSDW onset temperature. We describe this behavior with a Landau-Ginzburg theory\nfor an incommensurate CDW in a metallic system with a finite charge\ncompressibility and CDW-SDW coupling. Our Landau-Ginzburg analysis suggests\nthat the ordering wavevector at high temperatures decreases with increased\ndoping.

However, the lack of an efficient parameter\nlearning algorithm for CT-HMM restricts its use to very small models or\nrequires unrealistic constraints on the state transitions. In this paper, we\npresent the first complete characterization of efficient EM-based learning\nmethods for CT-HMM models, as well as the first solution to decoding the\noptimal state transition sequence and the corresponding state dwelling time. We\nshow that EM-based learning consists of two challenges: the estimation of\nposterior state probabilities and the computation of end-state conditioned\nstatistics. We solve the first challenge by reformulating the estimation\nproblem as an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. The\nsecond challenge is addressed by adapting three distinct approaches from the\ncontinuous time Markov chain (CTMC) literature to the CT-HMM domain.\nAdditionally, we further improve the efficiency of the most efficient method by\na factor of the number of states. Then, for decoding, we incorporate a\nstate-of-the-art method from the (CTMC) literature, and extend the end-state\nconditioned optimal state sequence decoding to the CT-HMM case with the\ncomputation of the expected state dwelling time. We demonstrate the use of\nCT-HMMs with more than 100 states to visualize and predict disease progression\nusing a glaucoma dataset and an Alzheimer's disease dataset, and to decode and\nvisualize the most probable state transition trajectory for individuals on the\nglaucoma dataset, which helps to identify progressing phenotypes in a\ncomprehensive way.

The forecasted values of a single time series can depend on the\nhistory of other time series in the same cluster, accounting for intra-cluster\nsimilarity while minimizing potential noise in predictions by ignoring\ninter-cluster effects. Our framework -- which we refer to as\n\"cluster-and-conquer\" -- is highly general, allowing for any time-series\nforecasting and clustering method to be used in each step. It is\ncomputationally efficient and embarrassingly parallel. We motivate our\nframework with a theoretical analysis in an idealized mixed linear regression\nsetting, where we provide guarantees on the quality of the estimates.

Following a\nrecently proposed boundary flow and VSL control model that is based on the\nLax-Hopf solution to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, this paper\nproposes a two-stage stochastic model to tackle the uncertainties in demand.\nOur model assumes the demand follows a discrete distribution and the speed\nlimit can be chosen from a pre-defined set with reasonable values. The first\nstage tries to find the optimal inflow control, which is the here-and-now\ndecision, by considering the speed limit control downstream, and the second\nstage is to determine the optimal speed limit after observing the real demand.\nThose controls are coordinated by using a rolling horizon scheme. The case\nstudy shows the proposed model outperforms three deterministic models, which\nuse the minimum, mean value and maximum of the demand as model input, under\nvarious scenarios. With ensuring the maximum of throughput, the proposed model\nis demonstrated to be able to reduce the fluctuation of entry flow without a\nsignificant increase in blocked vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

This\npaper proposes a novel Memory-Economic Sparse Training (MEST) framework\ntargeting for accurate and fast execution on edge devices. The proposed MEST\nframework consists of enhancements by Elastic Mutation (EM) and Soft Memory\nBound (&S) that ensure superior accuracy at high sparsity ratios. Different\nfrom the existing works for sparse training, this current work reveals the\nimportance of sparsity schemes on the performance of sparse training in terms\nof accuracy as well as training speed on real edge devices. On top of that, the\npaper proposes to employ data efficiency for further acceleration of sparse\ntraining. Our results suggest that unforgettable examples can be identified\nin-situ even during the dynamic exploration of sparsity masks in the sparse\ntraining process, and therefore can be removed for further training speedup on\nedge devices. Comparing with state-of-the-art (SOTA) works on accuracy, our\nMEST increases Top-1 accuracy significantly on ImageNet when using the same\nunstructured sparsity scheme. Systematical evaluation on accuracy, training\nspeed, and memory footprint are conducted, where the proposed MEST framework\nconsistently outperforms representative SOTA works.

A\nstandard multi-task learning objective is to minimize the average loss across\nall tasks. While straightforward, using this objective often results in much\nworse final performance for each task than learning them independently. A major\nchallenge in optimizing a multi-task model is the conflicting gradients, where\ngradients of different task objectives are not well aligned so that following\nthe average gradient direction can be detrimental to specific tasks'\nperformance. Previous work has proposed several heuristics to manipulate the\ntask gradients for mitigating this problem. But most of them lack convergence\nguarantee and/or could converge to any Pareto-stationary point. In this paper,\nwe introduce Conflict-Averse Gradient descent (CAGrad) which minimizes the\naverage loss function, while leveraging the worst local improvement of\nindividual tasks to regularize the algorithm trajectory. CAGrad balances the\nobjectives automatically and still provably converges to a minimum over the\naverage loss.

Due to the fundamental differences between algorithmic reasoning\nknowledge and feature extractors such as used in Computer Vision or NLP, we\nhypothesise that standard transfer techniques will not be sufficient to achieve\nsystematic generalisation. To investigate this empirically we create a dataset\nincluding 9 algorithms and 3 different graph types. We validate this\nempirically and show how instead multi-task learning can be used to achieve the\ntransfer of algorithmic reasoning knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Existing meta-learning algorithms randomly sample meta-training tasks\nwith a uniform probability, under the assumption that tasks are of equal\nimportance. However, it is likely that tasks are detrimental with noise or\nimbalanced given a limited number of meta-training tasks. To prevent the\nmeta-model from being corrupted by such detrimental tasks or dominated by tasks\nin the majority, in this paper, we propose an adaptive task scheduler (ATS) for\nthe meta-training process. In ATS, for the first time, we design a neural\nscheduler to decide which meta-training tasks to use next by predicting the\nprobability being sampled for each candidate task, and train the scheduler to\noptimize the generalization capacity of the meta-model to unseen tasks. We\nidentify two meta-model-related factors as the input of the neural scheduler,\nwhich characterize the difficulty of a candidate task to the meta-model.\nTheoretically, we show that a scheduler taking the two factors into account\nimproves the meta-training loss and also the optimization landscape. Under the\nsetting of meta-learning with noise and limited budgets, ATS improves the\nperformance on both miniImageNet and a real-world drug discovery benchmark by\nup to 13% and 18%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art task schedulers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Realization of\ntopology as a generic property of materials has led to numerous predictions of\ntopological effects. Although most of the classical topological effects,\ndirectly resulting from the presence of the spin-momentum-locked topological\nsurface states (TSS), were experimentally confirmed soon after the theoretical\nprediction of TIs, many topological quantum effects remained elusive for a long\nwhile. It turns out that native defects, particularly interfacial defects, have\nbeen the main culprit behind this impasse. Even after quantum regime is\nachieved for the bulk states, TSS still tends to remain in the classical regime\ndue to high density of interfacial defects, which frequently donate mobile\ncarriers due to the very nature of the topologically-protected surface states.\nHowever, with several defect engineering schemes that suppress these effects, a\nseries of topological quantum effects have emerged including quantum anomalous\nHall effect, quantum Hall effect, quantized Faraday/Kerr rotations, topological\nquantum phase transitions, axion insulating state, zeroth-Landau level state,\netc. Here, we review how these defect engineering schemes have allowed\ntopological surface states to pull out of the murky classical regime and reveal\ntheir elusive quantum signatures, over the past decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Since such models reason about vectors of numbers, source code needs\nto be converted to a code representation before vectorization.

However, there is no systematic study to\nunderstand the effect of code representation on learning performance. Through a\ncontrolled experiment, we examine the impact of various code representations on\nmodel accuracy and usefulness in deep learning-based program repair. We train\n21 different generative models that suggest fixes for name-based bugs,\nincluding 14 different homogeneous code representations, four mixed\nrepresentations for the buggy and fixed code, and three different embeddings.\nWe assess if fix suggestions produced by the model in various code\nrepresentations are automatically patchable, meaning they can be transformed to\na valid code that is ready to be applied to the buggy code to fix it. We also\nconduct a developer study to qualitatively evaluate the usefulness of inferred\nfixes in different code representations. Our results highlight the importance\nof code representation and its impact on learning and usefulness. Our findings\nindicate that (1) while code abstractions help the learning process, they can\nadversely impact the usefulness of inferred fixes from a developer's point of\nview; this emphasizes the need to look at the patches generated from the\npractitioner's perspective, which is often neglected in the literature, (2)\nmixed representations can outperform homogeneous code representations, (3) bug\ntype can affect the effectiveness of different code representations; although\ncurrent techniques use a single code representation for all bug types, there is\nno single best code representation applicable to all bug types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 23:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 02:49:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 07:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

To harness these computational benefits, SNN need to be\ntrained by learning algorithms that adhere to brain-inspired neuromorphic\nprinciples, namely event-based, local, and online computations. Yet, the\nstate-of-the-art SNN training algorithms are based on backprop that does not\nfollow the above principles. Due to its limited biological plausibility, the\napplication of backprop to SNN requires non-local feedback pathways for\ntransmitting continuous-valued errors, and relies on gradients from future\ntimesteps. The introduction of biologically plausible modifications to backprop\nhas helped overcome several of its limitations, but limits the degree to which\nbackprop is approximated, which hinders its performance. We propose a\nbiologically plausible gradient-based learning algorithm for SNN that is\nfunctionally equivalent to backprop, while adhering to all three neuromorphic\nprinciples. We introduced multi-compartment spiking neurons with local\neligibility traces to compute the gradients required for learning, and a\nperiodic \"sleep\" phase to further improve the approximation to backprop during\nwhich a local Hebbian rule aligns the feedback and feedforward weights.

This study will act as a baseline for\nanswering the question of where WO-type stars fall in WR evolution.

Here we present evidence\nthat the bulk state has a very unusual nature, containing electrons and holes\nbound by Coulomb attraction (excitons) that spontaneously form in thermal\nequilibrium. On cooling from room temperature to 100 K the conductivity\ndevelops a V-shaped dependence on electrostatic doping, while the chemical\npotential develops a ~43 meV step at the neutral point. These features are much\nsharper than is possible in an independent-electron picture, but they can be\nlargely accounted for by positing that some of the electrons and holes are\npaired in equilibrium. Our calculations from first principles show that the\nexciton binding energy is larger than 100 meV and the radius as small as 4 nm,\nexplaining their formation at high temperature and doping levels. Below 100 K\nmore strongly insulating behavior is seen, suggesting that a charge-ordered\nstate forms. The observed absence of charge density waves in this state appears\nsurprising within an excitonic insulator picture, but we show that it can be\nexplained by the symmetries of the exciton wave function.

This paper presents Object-aware REgularizatiOn\n(OREO), a simple technique that regularizes an imitation policy in an\nobject-aware manner. Our main idea is to encourage a policy to uniformly attend\nto all semantic objects, in order to prevent the policy from exploiting\nnuisance variables strongly correlated with expert actions. To this end, we\nintroduce a two-stage approach: (a) we extract semantic objects from images by\nutilizing discrete codes from a vector-quantized variational autoencoder, and\n(b) we randomly drop the units that share the same discrete code together,\ni.e., masking out semantic objects.

A crucial step is to\nmanipulate sequential future motion while retaining the appearance\ncharacteristic.Previous work has either relied on crafted 3D human models or\ntrained a separate model specifically for each target person, which is not\nscalable in practice.This work studies a more general setting, in which we aim\nto learn a single model to parsimoniously transfer motion from a source video\nto any target person given only one image of the person, named as Collaborative\nParsing-Flow Network (CPF-Net). The paucity of information regarding the target\nperson makes the task particularly challenging to faithfully preserve the\nappearance in varying designated poses. To address this issue, CPF-Net\nintegrates the structured human parsing and appearance flow to guide the\nrealistic foreground synthesis which is merged into the background by a\nspatio-temporal fusion module. In particular, CPF-Net decouples the problem\ninto stages of human parsing sequence generation, foreground sequence\ngeneration and final video generation. The human parsing generation stage\ncaptures both the pose and the body structure of the target. The appearance\nflow is beneficial to keep details in synthesized frames. The integration of\nhuman parsing and appearance flow effectively guides the generation of video\nframes with realistic appearance.

Muons are the most abundant cosmic\nradiation on Earth, however, their flux at sea level is approximately 10,000\nmin^-1m^-2 much less than that of induced radiation. In addition, cosmic ray\nmuon flux depends on not only various natural conditions (e.g., zenith angle,\naltitude, or solar activities) but also the geometric characteristic of\ndetectors. Since the low muon flux typically results in long measurement times,\nan accurate estimation of measurable muon counts is important for muon\napplications. Here we propose a simple and versatile semi-empirical model to\nimprove the accuracy in muon flux estimation at all zenith angles by\nincorporating the geometric parameters of detectors, and we name this the\nEffective Solid Angle model.

Following\nthis thread of thoughts, we investigate this connection through the notion of\nExtended Double Covers of signed graphs, which was recently introduced by\nNaserasr, Sopena and Zaslavsky.

Correct PDN design must account for considerations related to\npower bumps, currents, blockages, and signal congestion distribution patterns.\nThis work proposes a machine learning-based methodology that employs a set of\npredefined PDN templates. At the floorplan stage, coarse estimates of current,\ncongestion, macro/blockages, and C4 bump distributions are used to synthesize a\ngrid for early design. At the placement stage, the grid is incrementally\nrefined based on more accurate and fine-grained distributions of current and\ncongestion. At each stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) selects an\nappropriate PDN template for each region on the chip, building a\nsafe-by-construction PDN that meets IR drop and electromigration (EM)\nspecifications. The CNN is initially trained using a large\nsynthetically-created dataset, following which transfer learning is leveraged\nto bridge the gap between real-circuit data (with a limited dataset size) and\nsynthetically-generated data. On average, the optimization of the PDN frees\nthousands of routing tracks in congestion-critical regions, when compared to a\nglobally uniform PDN, while staying within the IR drop and EM limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 05:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

A popular\napproach to solving this problem is maintaining a proxy model, e.g., a deep\nneural network (DNN), that approximates the true objective function. Here, the\nmain challenge is how to avoid adversarially optimized inputs during the\nsearch, i.e., the inputs where the DNN highly overestimates the true objective\nfunction. To handle the issue, we propose a new framework, coined robust model\nadaptation (RoMA), based on gradient-based optimization of inputs over the DNN.\nSpecifically, it consists of two steps: (a) a pre-training strategy to robustly\ntrain the proxy model and (b) a novel adaptation procedure of the proxy model\nto have robust estimates for a specific set of candidate solutions. At a high\nlevel, our scheme utilizes the local smoothness prior to overcome the\nbrittleness of the DNN.

However, CNNs are\nprone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This\ndependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image\nperturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating\ncarefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust\nrepresentations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning\nutilizes positive pairs that preserve semantic information while perturbing\nsuperficial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate\nnegative samples in a reversed way, where only the superfluous instead of the\nsemantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and\npatch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve\nbetter generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze\nour method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture\nfeatures are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and\nespecially finer classes.

In particular, in spite of the diversity of the\nmultimodal tasks, previous work claims that a single meta-learner trained on a\nmultimodal distribution can sometimes outperform multiple specialized\nmeta-learners trained on individual unimodal distributions. The improvement is\nattributed to knowledge transfer between different modes of task distributions.\nHowever, there is no deep investigation to verify and understand the knowledge\ntransfer between multimodal tasks. Our work makes two contributions to\nmultimodal meta-learning. First, we propose a method to quantify knowledge\ntransfer between tasks of different modes at a micro-level. Our quantitative,\ntask-level analysis is inspired by the recent transference idea from multi-task\nlearning. Second, inspired by hard parameter sharing in multi-task learning and\na new interpretation of related work, we propose a new multimodal meta-learner\nthat outperforms existing work by considerable margins. While the major focus\nis on multimodal meta-learning, our work also attempts to shed light on task\ninteraction in conventional meta-learning.

Thermally-driven nanomagnetic logic\ngates, which are driven solely by the ambient thermal energy, hold great\npromise for energy-efficient operation, but have the disadvantage of slow\noperating speeds due to the lack of spatial selectivity of currently-employed\nglobal heating methods.

We introduce the Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffect Revolutions technique, which can access spin-orbit angles of small\nplanets by exploiting the full information contained in spectral transit time\nseries. We validated the technique on published HARPS-N data of the\nmini-Neptune HD3167c, refining its high sky-projected spin-orbit angle\n(-108.9+5.4-5.5 deg), and we applied it to new ESPRESSO observations of the\nsuper-Earth HD3167b, revealing an aligned orbit (-6.6+6.6-7.9 deg).\nSurprisingly different variations in the contrast of the stellar lines occulted\nby the planets can be reconciled with a latitudinal dependence of the stellar\nline shape. In this scenario, a joint fit to both datasets constrains the\ninclination of the star (111.6+3.1-3.3 deg) and the 3D spin-orbit angles of\nHD3167b (29.5+7.2-9.4 deg) and HD3167c (107.7+5.1-4.9 deg). The projected\nspin-orbit angles do not depend on the model for the line contrast variations,\nand so, with a mutual inclination of 102.3+7.4-8.0 deg, we conclude that the\ntwo planets are on perpendicular orbits.

Here, we show that, thanks to their collective nature, the lattice\nresonances of a periodic array of metallic nanoparticles can mediate an\nefficient long-range coupling between dipole emitters placed near the array.\nSpecifically, using a coupled dipole approach, we calculate the Green tensor of\nthe array connecting two points and analyze its spectral and spatial\ncharacteristics.

To explore this idea, we perform Particle-in-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations for weak quasi-perpendicular shocks in high-$\\beta$ ($\\beta=P_{\\rm\ngas}/P_{B}$) plasmas with power-law suprathermal electrons in addition to\nMaxwellian thermal electrons. We find that suprathermal electrons enhance the\nexcitation of electron-scale waves via the EFI and WI. However, they do not\naffect the ion reflection and the ensuing generation of ion-scale waves via the\nAIC instability. The presence of ion-scale waves is the key for the\npreacceleration of electrons up to the injection momentum, thus the shock\ncriticality condition for electron injection to DSA is preserved. Based on the\nresults, we conclude that preexisting nonthermal electrons in the preshock\nregion alone would not resolve the issue of electron preacceleration at\nsubcritical ICM shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 07:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 03:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

It is based on a mean-field\napproach that computes the turbulent kinetic energy at unresolved scales (the\nso-called subgrid scales) and modifies the induction equation to account for\nthe corresponding $\\alpha$ dynamo. Our subgrid model depends on one free\nparameter, the quenching parameter, that controls the saturation of the subgrid\ndynamo.

We investigate the synthetic observational signatures from numerical\nmodels of coronal heating in an arcade to determine what features are\nassociated with such heating, and what tools can be used to identify them.\n  Methods. We consider two simulations of coronal arcades driven by footpoint\nmotions with different characteristic timescales. Forward modelling is then\nused, and the synthetic emission data is analysed.\n  Results. The total intensity and Doppler velocities clearly show the magnetic\nstructure of the coronal arcade. Contrasts in the local Doppler shift also\nhighlight the locations of separatrix surfaces. The distinguishing feature of\nthe AC and DC models is that of the frequencies. Through FFT analysis of the\nDoppler velocities, when short timescale footpoint motions are present, higher\nfrequencies are observed. For longer timescale motions, the dominant signal is\nthat of lower frequencies; however, higher frequencies were also detected,\nwhich matched the natural Alfv\\'en frequency of the background magnetic field.\nAlfv\\'enic wave signatures were identified in both models with fast wave\nsignatures observable in the AC model.

This model gives rise to a yield stress behavior, where the\nunyielded state of the material is described as a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic\nsolid and the yielded state as a viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid. Yielding of an\ninitially solid drop of Carbopol is simulated under successively increasing\nshear rates. We proceed to examine the roles of nondimensional parameters on\nthe yielding process; in particular, the Bingham number ($Bi$), capillary\nnumber ($Ca$), Weissenberg number ($Wi$), and ratio of solvent and total drop\nviscosity. We find that all of these parameters, and not only $Bi$, have a\nsignificant influence on the drop dynamics. Numerical simulations predict that\nthe volume of the unyielded region inside the droplet increases with $Bi$ and\n$Wi$, while it decreases with $Ca$ at low $Wi$ and $Bi$. A new regime map is\nobtained for the prediction of the yielded, unyielded, and partly yielded modes\nas a function of $Bi$ and $Wi$. The drop deformation is studied and explained\nby examining the stresses in the vicinity of the drop interface. The\ndeformation has a complex dependence on $Bi$ and $Wi$. At low $Bi$, the droplet\ndeformation shows a nonmonotonic behavior with an increasing $Wi$. In contrast,\nat moderate and high $Bi$, droplet deformation always increases with $Wi$.\nMoreover, it is found that the deformation increases with $Ca$ and with the\nsolvent to total drop viscosity ratio. A simple ordinary differential equation\nmodel is developed to explain the various behaviours observed numerically. The\npresented results are in contrast with the heuristic idea that viscoelasticity\nin the dispersed phase always inhibits deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Importance sampling approaches might play a key role in budgeted\ntraining regimes, i.e. when limiting the number of training iterations. These\napproaches aim at dynamically estimating the importance of each sample to focus\non the most relevant and speed up convergence. This work explores this paradigm\nand how a budget constraint interacts with importance sampling approaches and\ndata augmentation techniques. We show that under budget restrictions,\nimportance sampling approaches do not provide a consistent improvement over\nuniform sampling. We suggest that, given a specific budget, the best course of\naction is to disregard the importance and introduce adequate data augmentation;\ne.g. when reducing the budget to a 30% in CIFAR-10/100, RICAP data augmentation\nmaintains accuracy, while importance sampling does not.

The model has recently gained much traction due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic since the public perception of vaccines plays a significant\nrole in disease dynamics. This paper studies the vaccination game in the\nthermodynamic limit with an analytical method derived from the 1D Ising model\ncalled Nash equilibrium mapping. The individual dilemma regarding Vaccination\ncomes from an internal conflict wherein one tries to balance the perceived\nadvantages of immunizing with the apparent risks associated with Vaccination\nwhich they hear through different news media. We compare the results of Nash\nequilibrium(NE) mapping to other 1D Ising-based models, namely Darwinian\nevolution and agent-based simulation. This study aims to analyze the behaviour\nof an infinite population regarding what fraction of people choose to vaccinate\nor not vaccinate. While Nash equilibrium mapping and agent-based simulation\nagree mostly, Darwinian evolution strays far from the two models. It fails to\npredict the equilibrium behaviour of players in the population reasonably. We\napply the results of our study to analyze the Astra-Zeneca(AZ) COVID-19 vaccine\nrisk versus disease deaths debate, both via NE mapping and agent-based method.\nBoth predict near 100% AZ vaccine coverage for people above 40, notwithstanding\nthe risk. At the same time, younger people show a slight reluctance. We predict\nthat while government intervention via vaccination mandates and advertisement\ncampaigns is unnecessary for the older population, for the younger population\n(ages: 20-39), some encouragement from the government via media campaigns and\nvaccine mandates may be necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 01:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

In particular, we show that\n1-token games characterise HDness for all quantitative (and Boolean) automata\non finite words, as well as discounted-sum (DSum), Inf and Reachability\nautomata on infinite words, and that 2-token games characterise HDness of\nLimInf and LimSup automata, as well as Sup automata on infinite words. Using\nthese characterisations, we provide solutions to the HDness problem of Safety,\nReachability, Inf and Sup automata on finite and infinite words in PTime, of\nDSum automata on finite and infinite words in NP$\\cap$co-NP, of LimSup automata\nin quasipolynomial time, and of LimInf automata in exponential time, where the\nlatter two are only polynomial for automata with a logarithmic number of\nweights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 09:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 17:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 13:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

As CAMs only highlight the\nmost discriminative regions of objects, the generated pseudo labels are usually\nunsatisfactory to serve directly as supervision. To solve this, most existing\napproaches follow a multi-training pipeline to refine CAMs for better\npseudo-labels, which includes: 1) re-training the classification model to\ngenerate CAMs; 2) post-processing CAMs to obtain pseudo labels; and 3) training\na semantic segmentation model with the obtained pseudo labels. However, this\nmulti-training pipeline requires complicated adjustment and additional time. To\naddress this, we propose a class-conditional inference strategy and an\nactivation aware mask refinement loss function to generate better pseudo labels\nwithout re-training the classifier. The class conditional inference-time\napproach is presented to separately and iteratively reveal the classification\nnetwork's hidden object activation to generate more complete response maps.\nFurther, our activation aware mask refinement loss function introduces a novel\nway to exploit saliency maps during segmentation training and refine the\nforeground object masks without suppressing background objects.

Miscalibrated polarization angles\ninduce a mixing of E- and B-modes that obscures the primordial B-mode signal.\nWe introduce an iterative angular power spectra maximum likelihood-based method\nto calculate polarization angles from the multi-frequency signal. The basis\nbehind this methodology grounds on nulling the EB power spectra.

While the transit signal of a\nJupiter-sized object can typically be detected to a high level of confidence\nwith small telescope apertures as well, the shallow transit dips of planets\nwith the size of Neptune and smaller are more challenging to reveal. We employ\nnew observational data to illustrate the photometric follow-up capabilities of\nmeter-sized telescopes for shallow exoplanet transits. We describe in detail\nthe capability of distinguishing the photometric signal of an exoplanet transit\nfrom an underlying trend in the light curve. The transit depths of the six\ntargets we observed, Kepler-94b, Kepler-63b, K2-100b, K2-138b, K2-138c, and\nK2-138e, range from 3.9 ppt down to 0.3 ppt. For five targets of this sample,\nwe provide the first ground-based photometric follow-up. We detect or rule out\nthe transit features significantly in single observations for the targets that\nshow transits of 1.3 ppt or deeper. The shallower transit depths of two targets\nof 0.6 and 0.8 ppt were detected tentatively in single light curves, and were\ndetected significantly by repeated observations. Only for the target of the\nshallowest transit depth of 0.3 ppt were we unable to draw a significant\nconclusion despite combining five individual light curves. An\ninjection-recovery test on our real data shows that we detect transits of 1.3\nppt depth significantly in single light curves if the transit is fully covered,\nincluding out-of-transit data toward both sides, in some cases down to 0.7 ppt\ndepth. For Kepler-94b, Kepler-63b, and K2-100b, we were able to verify the\nephemeris. In the case of K2-138c with a 0.6 ppt deep transit, we were able to\nrefine it, and in the case of K2-138e, we ruled out the transit in the time\ninterval of more than +-1.5 sigma of its current literature ephemeris.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 10:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

To substantiate the\nphysical relevance of the LES model, a set of experimental aerosol\nconcentration measurements are carried out, and their results are used for\nvalidating the LES model results.

To scale such GNNs to large graphs, various neighbor-,\nlayer-, or subgraph-sampling techniques are proposed to alleviate the \"neighbor\nexplosion\" problem by considering only a small subset of messages passed to the\nnodes in a mini-batch. However, sampling-based methods are difficult to apply\nto GNNs that utilize many-hops-away or global context each layer, show unstable\nperformance for different tasks and datasets, and do not speed up model\ninference.

Moreover,\nmany existing mechanisms directly use the contextual information to recalibrate\nthe input, which unilaterally enhances the propagation of the informative\nfeatures, but does not suppress the useless ones.

However, existing video architectures usually generate it by using\na simple, global average pooling (GAP) method, which has limited ability to\ncapture complex dynamics of videos. For image recognition task, there exist\nevidences showing that covariance pooling has stronger representation ability\nthan GAP. Unfortunately, such plain covariance pooling used in image\nrecognition is an orderless representative, which cannot model spatio-temporal\nstructure inherent in videos. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nTemporal-attentive Covariance Pooling(TCP), inserted at the end of deep\narchitectures, to produce powerful video representations. Specifically, our TCP\nfirst develops a temporal attention module to adaptively calibrate\nspatio-temporal features for the succeeding covariance pooling, approximatively\nproducing attentive covariance representations. Then, a temporal covariance\npooling performs temporal pooling of the attentive covariance representations\nto characterize both intra-frame correlations and inter-frame\ncross-correlations of the calibrated features. As such, the proposed TCP can\ncapture complex temporal dynamics. Finally, a fast matrix power normalization\nis introduced to exploit geometry of covariance representations. Note that our\nTCP is model-agnostic and can be flexibly integrated into any video\narchitectures, resulting in TCPNet for effective video recognition. The\nextensive experiments on six benchmarks (e.g., Kinetics, Something-Something V1\nand Charades) using various video architectures show our TCPNet is clearly\nsuperior to its counterparts, while having strong generalization ability.

Its\nobjective is to reduce a given grid of coloured blocks down to a goal number or\nfewer. This is achieved by the avatar character repeatedly shooting the block\nit holds into the grid. Plotting is an example of a planning problem: given a\nmodel of the environment, a planning problem asks us to find a sequence of\nactions that can lead from an initial state of the environment to a given goal\nstate while respecting some constraints. The key difficulty in modelling\nPlotting is in capturing the way the puzzle state changes after each shot. A\nsingle shot can affect multiple tiles directly, and the grid is affected by\ngravity so numerous other tiles can be affected indirectly. We present and\nevaluate a constraint model of the Plotting problem that captures this\ncomplexity. We also discuss the difficulties and inefficiencies of modelling\nPlotting in PDDL, the standard language used for input to specialised AI\nplanners. We conclude by arguing that AI planning could benefit from a richer\nmodelling language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 12:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

While the case of Hawrami and Zaza has\nremained unexplored and under-examined, an almost unanimous agreement exists\nabout the classification of Kurmanji and Sorani as Kurdish dialects. The\nrelated studies to address the mentioned cases are primarily qualitative.\nHowever, computational linguistics could approach the question from a\nquantitative perspective.

However, investigations of phase transitions at high particle\nconcentration and across the volume phase transition temperature in particular,\nare challenging due to the deformability and possibility for interpenetration\nbetween microgels.

Machine learning has the potential to partly fulfill this task rapidly\nand objectively, as geological mapping is comparable to a semantic segmentation\nproblem. Because this method requires a high-quality dataset, we developed a\ndata augmentation workflow that uses a 3D geological and magnetic\nsusceptibility model as input. The workflow uses soft-constrained Multi-Point\nStatistics, to create many synthetic 3D geological models, and Sequential\nGaussian Simulation algorithms, to populate the models with the appropriate\nmagnetic distribution. Then, forward modeling is used to compute the airborne\nmagnetic responses of the synthetic models, which are associated with their\ncounterpart surficial lithologies. A Gated Shape Convolutional Neural Network\nalgorithm was trained on a generated synthetic dataset to perform geological\nmapping of airborne magnetic data and detect lithological contacts. The\nalgorithm also provides attention maps highlighting the structures at different\nscales, and clustering was applied to its high-level features to do a\nsemi-supervised segmentation of the area. The validation conducted on a portion\nof the synthetic dataset and data from adjacent areas shows that the\nmethodology is suitable to segment the surficial geology using airborne\nmagnetic data.

To validate this strategy, we performed the\nexcited state calculations at the FC and CI geometries of ethylene and phenol\nblue at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level of\ntheory, and found that the energy errors were at most 2 kcal mol$^{-1}$ even on\nthe ibm_kawasaki device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 03:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 15:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

The Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Phase Dispersion Minimization\n(PDM) techniques have been used previously to claim detections of QPOs in AGN\nlight curves. In this paper we perform Monte Carlo simulations to empirically\ntest QPO detection feasibility in the presence of red noise. Given the\ncommunity's access to large databases of monitoring light curves via large-area\nmonitoring programmes, our goal is to provide guidance to those searching for\nQPOs via data trawls. We simulate evenly-sampled pure red noise light curves to\nestimate false alarm probabilities; false positives in both tools tend to occur\ntowards timescales longer than (very roughly) one-third of the light curve\nduration. We simulate QPOs mixed with pure red noise and determine the\ntrue-positive detection sensitivity; in both tools, it depends strongly on the\nrelative strength of the QPO against the red noise and on the steepness of the\nred noise PSD slope. We find that extremely large values of peak QPO power\nrelative to red noise (typically $\\sim 10^{4-5}$) are needed for a 99.7 per\ncent true-positive detection rate. Given that the true-positive detections\nusing the ACF or PDM are generally rare to obtain, we conclude that period\nsearches based on the ACF or PDM must be treated with extreme caution when the\ndata quality is not good.

Mineral particles are like humans: they appear different\ndespite having a same geological origin. Then, do the particles have some sort\nof 'phenotypic trait' in the geometries as we do? How can we characterize the\nphenotypic trait of particle geometries? This paper discusses a new perspective\non how the phenotypic trait can be discovered in the particle geometries and\nhow the 'variation' and 'average' of the geometry can be quantified. The key\nidea is using the power-law between particle surface-area-to-volume ratio\n($A/V$) and the particle volume ($V$) that uncovers the phenotypic trait in\nterms of ${\\alpha}$ and ${\\beta}^*$: From the log-transformed relation of $V =\n(A/V)^{\\alpha} {\\times} {\\beta}^*$, the power value ${\\alpha}$ represents the\nrelation between shape and size, while the term ${\\beta}^*$ (evaluated by\nfixing ${\\alpha}$ = -3) informs the angularity of the average shape in the\ngranular material. In other words, ${\\alpha}$ represents the 'variation' of the\ngeometry while ${\\beta}^*$ is concerned with the 'average' geometry of a\ngranular material. Furthermore, this study finds that $A/V$ and $V$ can be also\nused to characterize individual particle shape in terms of Wadell's true\nSphericity ($S$). This paper also revisits the $M = A/V {\\times} L/6$ concept\noriginally introduced by Su et al. (2020) and finds the shape index $M$ is an\nextended form of $S$ providing additional information about the particle\nelongation.

Clumps for which failed cores are the dominant core type\nexperience star formation histories with peaks and troughs.

We\nidentify three main parameters shaping the star formation history of a clump:\nthe star and core formation efficiencies per free-fall time, and the time-scale\non which failed cores return to the clump gas.

In MRI, restricted by hardware\ncapacity, scan time, and patient cooperation ability, isotropic 3D HR image\nacquisition typically requests long scan time and, results in small spatial\ncoverage and low SNR. Recent studies showed that, with deep convolutional\nneural networks, isotropic HR MR images could be recovered from low-resolution\n(LR) input via single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms. However, most\nexisting SISR methods tend to approach a scale-specific projection between LR\nand HR images, thus these methods can only deal with a fixed up-sampling rate.\nFor achieving different up-sampling rates, multiple SR networks have to be\nbuilt up respectively, which is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. In\nthis paper, we propose ArSSR, an Arbitrary Scale Super-Resolution approach for\nrecovering 3D HR MR images. In the ArSSR model, the reconstruction of HR images\nwith different up-scaling rates is defined as learning a continuous implicit\nvoxel function from the observed LR images. Then the SR task is converted to\nrepresent the implicit voxel function via deep neural networks from a set of\npaired HR-LR training examples. The ArSSR model consists of an encoder network\nand a decoder network. Specifically, the convolutional encoder network is to\nextract feature maps from the LR input images and the fully-connected decoder\nnetwork is to approximate the implicit voxel function. Due to the continuity of\nthe learned function, a single ArSSR model can achieve arbitrary up-sampling\nrate reconstruction of HR images from any input LR image after training.\nExperimental results on three datasets show that the ArSSR model can achieve\nstate-of-the-art SR performance for 3D HR MR image reconstruction while using a\nsingle trained model to achieve arbitrary up-sampling scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 14:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 03:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Finally, with this motivation, we fit our\nnumerical result with universal relations for axial quasi-normal modes using\nfive type of realistic equations of state.

It has been recognized that the\nminimization of dispersion error is an effective method to improve the\nprecision. In addition, the proper dissipation of a scheme is important to\nrestrain the non-physics oscillations and reserve details of flows\nsimultaneously. The authors have previously proposed a scale sensor to adjust\nthe numerical dissipation of a fourth-order finite difference scheme according\nto the local scale of the flow. In this paper, the scale sensor is further\nmodified for the sixth-order finite difference scheme to achieve minimized\ndispersion and adaptive dissipation properties. Firstly, the scale sensor\nquantifies the local length scale of the numerical solution as the effective\nscaled wavenumber. Then, the dispersion-dissipation condition is used to\nconstruct the relationship between the dissipation/dispersion parameter and the\neffective scaled wavenumber. Therefore, a sixth-order finite difference scheme\nwith minimized dispersion and adaptive dissipation (MDAD6th) is proposed.\nSeveral benchmark test cases with broadband length scales are presented to\nclarify the high resolution of the new scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

This interaction is given by a divergent loop diagram,\nhowever, it turns out that the divergent part is equal to zero as a consequence\nof the CKM matrix unitarity in the SM. Therefore, we are able to predict the\neffective interaction of the CS boson with quarks of different flavors without\nintroducing new unknown parameters to the model, using only parameters of the\ninitial effective Lagrangian. Our result shows that the effective interaction\nof the CS boson with down-type quarks is sufficiently stronger compared with\nup-type quarks.

Once the different notions of SSB will be\nclarified/reviewed, Goldstone's theorem will be stated and proved. A prediction\nof this theorem is the existence of gapless particles, called Nambu-Goldstone\nmodes (NG modes). From the discussion on Goldstone's results, some aspects of\nthe NG modes will emerge. Besides to be gapless, they are systematically weakly\ncoupled at low energy. Therefore, an effective field theory (EFT) building tool\ncalled ``coset construction'' will be presented to explicitly display these\nspecific features of the NG modes. The coset construction suits our goal since\nit is mainly based on the symmetry realisation of the perturbed theory around\nthe background inducing SSB. From the general obtained EFT, a counting rule for\nthe NG modes will be derived. The limitations of this rule as well as the still\nongoing generalisation will be discussed (e.g. spacetime symmetry breaking).\nThe tools developed during this course will be illustrated with a concrete\nexample in physics: ferromagnetism.

On the other hand, although model selection is\nindispensable in statistical analysis, an information criterion for selecting\nan appropriate regression structure has just started to be developed. In this\npaper, based on the original definition of Akaike information criterion (AIC;\n\\citealt{Aka73}), we derive an AIC-type criterion for propensity score\nanalysis. Here, we define a risk function based on the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence as the cornerstone of the information criterion and treat a general\ncausal inference model that is not necessarily a linear one. The causal effects\nto be estimated are those in the general population, such as the average\ntreatment effect on the treated or the average treatment effect on the\nuntreated. In light of the fact that this field attaches importance to doubly\nrobust estimation, which allows either the model of the assignment variable or\nthe model of the outcome variable to be wrong, we make the information\ncriterion itself doubly robust so that either one can be wrong and it will\nstill be an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the risk function. In\nsimulation studies, we compare the derived criterion with an existing criterion\nobtained from a formal argument and confirm that the former outperforms the\nlatter. Specifically, we check that the divergence between the estimated\nstructure from the derived criterion and the true structure is clearly small in\nall simulation settings and that the probability of selecting the true or\nnearly true model is clearly higher. Real data analyses confirm that the\nresults of variable selection using the two criteria differ significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 04:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 15:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

The limit $q\\to 0$, equivalent to the\nvalue of the KBI in the TL, is obtained via the spatial block-analysis method.\nWhen compared to the latter, our approach gives nearly identical results for\nall values of $V$.

While many such\nnetworks can upscale low-resolution (LR) images using just the raw pixel-level\ninformation, the ill-posed nature of SR can make it difficult to accurately\nsuper-resolve an image which has undergone multiple different degradations.\nAdditional information (metadata) describing the degradation process (such as\nthe blur kernel applied, compression level, etc.) can guide networks to\nsuper-resolve LR images with higher fidelity to the original source. Previous\nattempts at informing SR networks with degradation parameters have indeed been\nable to improve performance in a number of scenarios. However, due to the\nfully-convolutional nature of many SR networks, most of these metadata fusion\nmethods either require a complete architectural change, or necessitate the\naddition of significant extra complexity. Thus, these approaches are difficult\nto introduce into arbitrary SR networks without considerable design\nalterations. In this paper, we introduce meta-attention, a simple mechanism\nwhich allows any SR CNN to exploit the information available in relevant\ndegradation parameters. The mechanism functions by translating the metadata\ninto a channel attention vector, which in turn selectively modulates the\nnetwork's feature maps. Incorporating meta-attention into SR networks is\nstraightforward, as it requires no specific type of architecture to function\ncorrectly. Extensive testing has shown that meta-attention can consistently\nimprove the pixel-level accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks when\nprovided with relevant degradation metadata. For PSNR, the gain on\nblurred/downsampled (X4) images is of 0.2969 dB (on average) and 0.3320 dB for\nSOTA general and face SR models, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Prior KD\napproaches, despite their gratifying results, have largely relied on the\npremise that \\emph{in-domain} data is available to carry out the knowledge\ntransfer. Such an assumption, unfortunately, in many cases violates the\npractical setting, since the original training data or even the data domain is\noften unreachable due to privacy or copyright reasons. In this paper, we\nattempt to tackle an ambitious task, termed as \\emph{out-of-domain} knowledge\ndistillation~(OOD-KD), which allows us to conduct KD using only OOD data that\ncan be readily obtained at a very low cost. Admittedly, OOD-KD is by nature a\nhighly challenging task due to the agnostic domain gap. To this end, we\nintroduce a handy yet surprisingly efficacious approach, dubbed\nas~\\textit{MosaicKD}. The key insight behind MosaicKD lies in that, samples\nfrom various domains share common local patterns, even though their global\nsemantic may vary significantly; these shared local patterns, in turn, can be\nre-assembled analogous to mosaic tiling, to approximate the in-domain data and\nto further alleviating the domain discrepancy.

We show\nthat this is due to the surface roughness of the asteroid particles which\nreduces the van der Waals interaction between the particles by a factor of\n$100$ for micrometer sized particles and even more for larger particles. We\nshow that surface roughness results in an interaction force which is\nindependent of the size of the particles, in contrast to the linear size\ndependency expected for particles with smooth surfaces. Thus, two stone\nfragments of size $100 \\ {\\rm nm}$ attract each other with the same\nnon-gravitational force as two fragments of size $10 \\ {\\rm m}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

CARS is often used to study combustion,\nwhere the measured spectra can be used to simultaneously recover multiple flow\nparameters from the reacting gas such as temperature and relative species mole\nfractions. This is typically done by using numerical optimization to find the\nflow parameters for which a theoretical model of the CARS spectra best matches\nthe actual measurements.

Here a bidimensional \"soft\" billiard, classically modeled from an\noptical lattice hamiltonian system, is used to study diffusion transitions with\nthe control parameters variation. Sudden transitions between normal and\nballistic regimes are found and characterized by inspection of the topological\nchanges in phase-space. Transitions correlated with increases in global\nstability area are shown to occur for energy levels where local maxima points\nbecome accessible, deviating trajectories approaching it. These instabilities\npromote a slowing down of the dynamics and an island myriad bifurcation\nphenomenon, along with the suppression of long flights within the lattice.\nOther diffusion regime variations occurring during small intervals of control\nparameters are shown to be related to the emergence of a set of orbits with\nlong flights, thus altering the total average displacement for long integration\ntimes but without global changes in phase-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 19:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 12:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

As countries go into lockdown the use of the\ninternet to perform tasks remotely has increased in record numbers. As per the\ntrend and at times addictive nature of its usage, it is unlikely that the usage\nof the internet will decrease in the future reducing its current contribution\nto climate change. Considering the sustainability perspective, this study\ninvestigates whether the pervasive nature of internet usage could be reduced by\nsimply inducing awareness.

To access this information, a dense measurement of\nthe deformation of soft fingertips is necessary. Recently, tactile sensors that\nrely on a camera looking at a deformable membrane have demonstrated that a\ndense measurement of the contact is possible. However, their manufacturing can\nbe time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we show a new design method that\nuses multi-color additive manufacturing and silicone casting to efficiently\nmanufacture soft marker-based tactile sensors that are able to capture with\nhigh-resolution the three-dimensional deformation field at the interface. Each\nmarker is composed of two superimposed color filters. The subtractive color\nmixing encodes the normal deformation of the membrane, and the lateral\ndeformation is found by centroid detection. With this manufacturing method, we\ncan reach a density of 400 markers on a 21 mm radius hemisphere, allowing for\nregular and dense measurement of the deformation. We calibrated and validated\nthe approach by finding the curvature of objects with a threefold increase in\naccuracy as compared to previous implementations. The results demonstrate a\nsimple yet effective approach to manufacturing artificial fingertips for\ncapturing a rich image of the tactile interaction at the location of contact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 10:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}
