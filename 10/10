Here we have applied Voronoi tessellations to quantify the\ncell size variation in 2D cross-sections of biological and engineered cellular\nmaterials, using a disorder parameter (d) ranging between 0 (highly disordered)\nto 1.0 (regular hexagonal honeycomb). We demonstrate that various plant, fungi,\nand animal cellular materials show characteristic ranges of disorder.

If the nanostructure is\nchiral (i.e., it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image), then its optical\nresponse, both in near-field and far-field, depends on the handedness of the\nincident light. In contrast, achiral structures exhibit identical far-field\nresponses for left- and right-circular polarization. Here, we show that a\nperfectly achiral nanostructure, a plasmonic metamolecule with trigonal D3h\nsymmetry, exhibits a near-field response that is sensitive to the handedness of\nlight. This effect stems from the near-field interference between the different\nplasmonic modes sustained by the plasmonic metamolecule under circularly\npolarized light excitation. The local chirality in a plasmonic trimer is then\nexperimentally evidenced with nanoscale resolution using a molecular probe. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the optical near-field chirality can be imprinted\ninto the photosensitive polymer, turning an optical chirality into a\ngeometrical chirality that can be imaged using atomic force microscopy. These\nresults are of interest for the field of polarization-sensitive photochemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 18:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Several error mitigation techniques have been studied to lessen the\neffect of noise on this algorithm. Recently, Majumdar et al. proposed a Depth\nFirst Search (DFS) based method to reduce $n-1$ CNOT gates in the ansatz design\nof QAOA for finding Max-Cut in a graph G = (V, E), |V| = n. However, this\nmethod tends to increase the depth of the circuit, making it more prone to\nrelaxation error.

If a query specificity can be identified at the run time, it can be\nused to significantly improve the search results as well as quality of\nsuggestions to alter the query. However, with millions of queries coming every\nday on a commercial search engine, it is non-trivial to develop a horizontal\ntechnique to determine query specificity at run time. Existing techniques\nsuffer either from lack of enough training data or are dependent on information\nsuch as query length or session information. In this paper, we show that such\nmethodologies are inadequate or at times misleading. We propose a novel\nmethodology, to overcome these limitations. First, we demonstrate a\nheuristic-based method to identify Exploratory or Lookup intent queries at\nscale, classifying millions of queries into the two classes with a high\naccuracy, as shown in our experiments. Our methodology is not dependent on\nsession data or on query length. Next, we train a transformer-based deep neural\nnetwork to classify the queries into one of the two classes at run time. Our\nmethod uses a bidirectional GRU initialized with pretrained BERT-base-uncased\nembeddings and an augmented triplet loss to classify the intent of queries\nwithout using any session data. We also introduce a novel Semi-Greedy Iterative\nTraining approach to fine-tune our model. Our model is deployable for real time\nquery specificity identification with response time of less than one\nmillisecond. Our technique is generic, and the results have valuable\nimplications for improving the quality of search results and suggestions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 20:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Secondly, to handle occlusions caused by large\nviewpoint and motion changes, we take advantage of the appearance flow obtained\nfrom the source image itself (\"self-appearance\"), which essentially \"borrows\"\nsimilar structures from other regions of an image to inpaint missing regions.\nFinally, our framework is also able to leverage the information from additional\nreference views which help to drive the source identity in spite of varying\nmotion state. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nthe state-of-the-arts by a significant margin (~40%), across six benchmarks\nvarying from human faces, human bodies to robots and cartoon characters. Model\ngenerality analysis indicates that our approach generalises the best across\ndifferent object categories as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 22:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

However, clinical acceptance of these synthetic images\npose a significant challenge as they are subject to strict evaluation\nprotocols. A commonly established drawback of the CycleGAN, the introduction of\nartifacts in generated images is unforgivable in the case of medical images. In\nan attempt to alleviate this drawback, we explore different constraints of the\nCycleGAN along with investigation of adaptive control of these constraints. The\nbenefits of imposing additional constraints on the CycleGAN, in the form of\nstructure retaining losses is also explored. A generalized frequency loss\ninspired by arxiv:2012.12821 that preserves content in the frequency domain\nbetween source and target is investigated and compared with existing losses\nsuch as the MIND loss arXiv:1809.04536.

Furthermore, no observable artifacts or loss in\nimage quality is found, which is critical for acceptance of these synthetic\nimages. The synthetic medical images thus generated are also evaluated using\ndomain-specific evaluation and using segmentation as a downstream task, in\norder to clearly highlight their applicability to clinical workflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 22:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 13:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The shape of the ground plane can drastically\nchange the patterns of the electromagnetic radiation of a monopole antenna as\nwell as its RF performance. Extensive work has been done on the numerical\nmodeling of arbitrarily shaped ground planes. However, due to their geometric\ncomplexity, there is very little work reported on the practical testing\ncomponent of physical antennas with these obscure ground plane structures. This\nthesis illustrates how the additive manufacturing process presented can be used\nto physically realize arbitrarily shaped ground planes and provides a low-cost\nprocess to verify the numerical model. Ground Planes were modified while\nmaintaining the same antenna length to evaluate the impact on antenna\nperformance. The antenna was not optimized or changed to a standard antenna\ndesign. Varying radius spherical ground planes are modelled, as well as\nmodified ground plane structures to evaluate the impact of the ground plane on\na 1.3GHz monopole antenna's performance and in some cases to modify the\nantenna's performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, and radiation pattern.\nDesigns such as the planar ground with horn was found to enhance monopole\nbandwidth by more than 5 times that of a standard planar ground but\nsignificantly deteriorate the antenna's radiation pattern. Moreover, complex\ngeometry such as the fin sphere ground plane offered a 25% increase in gain\nrelative to the standard sphere ground. Designs like the edge-mounted sphere\ncan offer directive gain and radiation characteristics simply by altering the\nantennas' location mount location with respect to its ground plane.

Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is\nthe most widely used reconstruction algorithm on hardware implementation\nbecause OMP obtains good quality reconstruction results under a proper time\ncost. OMP includes Dot Product (DP) and Least Square Problem (LSP). These two\nparts have numerous division calculations and considerable vector-based\nmultiplications, which limit the implementation of real-time reconstruction on\nhardware. In the theory of CS, besides the reconstruction algorithm, the choice\nof sensing matrix affects the quality of reconstruction. It also influences the\nreconstruction efficiency by affecting the hardware architecture. Thus,\ndesigning a real-time hardware architecture of OMP needs to take three factors\ninto consideration. The choice of sensing matrix, the implementation of DP and\nLSP. In this paper, a sensing matrix, which is sparsity and contains zero\nvectors mainly, is adopted to optimize the OMP reconstruction to break the\nbottleneck of reconstruction efficiency.

A widely popular smoother is the Rauch-Tung-Striebel\n(RTS) algorithm, which achieves minimal mean-squared error recovery with low\ncomplexity in dynamic systems that are represented as linear Gaussian state\nspace (SS) models. However, this model-based algorithm is limited in systems\nthat are only partially known, as well as non-linear and non-Gaussian. In this\nwork we propose RTSNet, a highly efficient model-based and data-driven\nsmoothing algorithm suitable for partially known SS models. RTSNet integrates\ndedicated trainable models into the flow of the classical RTS smoother, while\niteratively refining its sequence estimate via deep unfolding methodology. As a\nresult, RTSNet learns from data to reliably smooth when operating under model\nmismatch and non-linearities while retaining the efficiency and\ninterpretability of the model-based RTS algorithm. Our empirical study\ndemonstrates that RTSNet overcomes non-linearities and model mismatch,\noutperforming classic smoothers operating with both mismatched and accurate\ndomain knowledge. Moreover, while RTSNet is based on compact neural networks,\nwhich leads to faster training and inference times, it is shown to outperform\npreviously proposed deep smoothers in non-linear settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 06:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 16:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 08:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

The delineation\nprocedure is typically performed manually which exposes two major issues: cost\nand reproducibility. Delineation is a time-consuming process that is subject to\ninter- and intra-observer variability. While methods have been proposed to\npredict GTV contours, typical approaches ignore variability and therefore fail\nto utilize the valuable confidence information offered by multiple contours.\nMaterials and methods: In this work we propose an automatic GTV contouring\nmethod for soft-tissue sarcomas from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images,\nusing deep learning by integrating inter- and intra-observer variability in the\nlearned model. Sixty-eight patients with soft tissue and bone sarcomas were\nconsidered in this evaluation, all underwent pre-operative CT imaging used to\nperform GTV delineation. Four radiation oncologists and radiologists performed\nthree contouring trials each for all patients. We quantify variability by\ndefining confidence levels based on the frequency of inclusion of a given voxel\ninto the GTV and use a deep convolutional neural network to learn GTV\nconfidence maps. Results: Results were compared to confidence maps from the\nfour readers as well as ground-truth consensus contours established jointly by\nall readers. The resulting continuous Dice score between predicted and true\nconfidence maps was 87% and the Hausdorff distance was 14 mm. Conclusion:\nResults demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to predict accurate\ncontours while utilizing variability and as such it can be used to improve\nclinical workflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 07:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) based on the coarse-to-fine strategy have been widely used in\nthis field. However, multi-lesion segmentation remains to be challenging due to\nthe uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity of tissues.\nIn addition, the commonly adopted cascaded strategy is rather demanding in\nterms of hardware, which limits the potential of clinical deployment. To\naddress the problems above,we propose a novel Prior Attention Network (PANet)\nthat follows the coarse-to-fine strategy to perform multi-lesion segmentation\nin medical images. The proposed network achieves the two steps of segmentation\nin a single network by inserting lesion-related spatial attention mechanism in\nthe network. Further, we also propose the intermediate supervision strategy for\ngenerating lesion-related attention to acquire the regions of interest (ROIs),\nwhich accelerates the convergence and obviously improves the segmentation\nperformance. We have investigated the proposed segmentation framework in two\napplications: 2D segmentation of multiple lung infections in lung CT slices and\n3D segmentation of multiple lesions in brain MRIs. Experimental results show\nthat in both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks our proposed network achieves better\nperformance with less computational cost compared with cascaded networks.

However, our in-depth\nempirical results show that the approximation will often distort the loss\nlandscape, leading to the biased objective to optimize and in turn inaccurate\ngradient estimation for architecture parameters. This work turns to zero-order\noptimization and proposes a novel NAS scheme, called ZARTS, to search without\nenforcing the above approximation. Specifically, three representative\nzero-order optimization methods are introduced: RS, MGS, and GLD, among which\nMGS performs best by balancing the accuracy and speed.

Such methods often fail\nto provide high-fidelity texture without relying on 3D facial scans during\ntraining. In contrast, the complementary task of 3D facial generation has not\nreceived as much attention. As opposed to the 2D texture domain, where GANs\nhave proven to produce highly realistic facial images, the more challenging 3D\ngeometry domain has not yet caught up to the same levels of realism and\ndiversity.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel unified pipeline for both tasks, generation\nof both geometry and texture, and recovery of high-fidelity texture. Our\ntexture model is learned, in an unsupervised fashion, from natural images as\nopposed to scanned texture maps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst such unified framework independent of scanned textures.\n  Our novel training pipeline incorporates a pre-trained 2D facial generator\ncoupled with a deep feature manipulation methodology.

We constantly try to build bridges between the\nconcrete uses of E|X-Y| and the underlying probabilistic model. An alternative\ninterpretation of this distance is also examined, as well as its relation to\nthe Gini index (economics) and the Lukaszyk-Karmovsky distance (physics). The\nmain contributions are the following: (a) We show that under independence,\ntriangle inequality holds for the normalized form E|X-Y|/(E|X| + E|Y|). (b) In\norder to present a concrete advance, we determine the analytic form of E|X-Y|\nand of its normalized expression when X and Y are independent with Gaussian or\nuniform distribution. The resulting formulas generalize relevant tools already\nin use in areas such as physics and economics. (c) We propose with all the\nrequired rigor a brief one-dimensional introduction to the optimal transport\nproblem, essentially for a L1 cost function.

While the latter type of methods learning an\nembedding space achieves substantial improvement for speech separation, we\nargue that the embedding space defined by only one latent domain does not\nsuffice to provide a thoroughly separable encoding space for speech separation.\nIn this paper, we propose the Stepwise-Refining Speech Separation Network\n(SRSSN), which follows a coarse-to-fine separation framework. It first learns a\n1-order latent domain to define an encoding space and thereby performs a rough\nseparation in the coarse phase.

Seismic imaging is an ill-posed inverse\nproblem because of bandwidth and aperture limitations, which is hampered by the\npresence of noise and linearization errors. Many regularization methods, such\nas transform-domain sparsity promotion, have been designed to deal with the\nadverse effects of these errors, however, these methods run the risk of biasing\nthe solution and do not provide information on uncertainty in the image space\nand how this uncertainty impacts certain tasks on the image. A systematic\napproach is proposed to translate uncertainty due to noise in the data to\nconfidence intervals of automatically tracked horizons in the image. The\nuncertainty is characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and to\nassess these uncertainties, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution\nof the CNN weights, used to parameterize the image. Compared to traditional\npriors, it is argued in the literature that these CNNs introduce a flexible\ninductive bias that is a surprisingly good fit for a diverse set of problems.\nThe method of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics is employed to sample from\nthe posterior distribution. This method is designed to handle large scale\nBayesian inference problems with computationally expensive forward operators as\nin seismic imaging. Aside from offering a robust alternative to maximum a\nposteriori estimate that is prone to overfitting, access to these samples allow\nus to translate uncertainty in the image, due to noise in the data, to\nuncertainty on the tracked horizons.

Predicting mass of such embedded planets is of fundamental\nimportance in comparing those disk architectures with the observed diversity of\nexoplanets. The prediction, however, depends on the assumption that whether the\nsame gap structure exists in the dust component alone or in the gas component\nas well. We assume a planet can only open a gap in the gas component when its\nmass exceeds the pebble isolation mass by considering the core accretion\nscenario. We then propose two criteria to distinguish if a gap is opened in the\ndust disk alone or the gas gap as well when observation data on the gas profile\nis not available. We apply the criteria to 35 disk systems with a total of 55\ngaps compiled from previous studies, and classify each gap into four different\ngroups.

Various methods have been used to monitor\ninduction motors such as thermal monitoring and vibration analysis. This paper\nintroduces an alternative method which is to use an inductive coupling method\nto extract in-circuit impedance of induction motor. This method allows for an\nonline measurement of the system under test (SUT) preventing any unnecessary\nshutdowns. These unnecessary shutdowns may incur a loss of revenue for relevant\nindustries that depends heavily on induction motor operations. Two sets of\nexperiments were conducted in this paper, the first experiment was to examine\nthe accuracy of the proposed method by simulating various SUT using simulated\nresistor, inductor, and capacitor (RLC) network. The next experiment was to\ndetect incipient stator faults such as turn to turn faults in an induction\nmotor. This proposed method measures the impedance of the stator winding of an\ninduction motor to identify abnormalities. In addition, this method allows for\nan accurate in-circuit impedance measurement without the influence of motor\nload and frequency changes as well as faults such as bearing and rotor faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 05:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

Aggregate reviews in form of rating (stars) have\nbecome noticeable indicators of product quality and vendor performance to\nprospective consumers at first sight. Consumers subjected to product discount\ndeadlines search for ways in which they could evaluate product and vendor\nservice using a comprehensible benchmark. Considering the effect of time\npressure on consumers, aggregate reviews, known as review valence, become a\nviable indicator of product quality. This study investigates how purchase\ndecisions for new products are affected by past customer aggregate ratings when\na soon-to-expire discount is being offered. We examine the role that a\nconsumer's attitude towards review valence (RV) plays as an antecedent to that\nconsumer's reliance on RV in a purchase decision for time-discounted search\ngoods. Considering review credibility, diagnosticity, and effectiveness as\ndeterminants of consumer attitude in a time-constrained search and purchase\nenvironment, we follow the approach-avoidance conflict theory to examine the\nrole of review valence and perceived uncertainty in a time-constrained\nenvironment. The data was collected through an online survey and analyzed using\nstructural equation modelling. This study provides significant implications for\npractitioners as they can better understand how review valence can influence a\npurchase decision. Empirical analysis includes two contributions: 1. It helps\nto understand how consumer attitude toward review valence, when positively\ninfluenced by the determinants, can lead to reliance on review valence, further\ninfluencing purchase decision; 2. Time constrained purchase-related perceived\nuncertainty negatively moderates the relationship between consumer attitude and\nreliance on review valence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 19:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Generative Pretraining\nTransformer 2 (GPT2) is one of the state of the art approaches that have\nexcellent successes. In this paper, we took the first step to investigate the\npower of GPT2 in traditional Vietnamese poetry generation. In the earlier time,\nour experiment with base GPT2 was quite good at generating the poem in the\nproper template. Though it can learn the patterns, including rhyme and tone\nrules, from the training data, like almost all other text generation\napproaches, the poems generated still has a topic drift and semantic\ninconsistency. To improve the cohesion within the poems, we proposed a new\nmodel SP-GPT2 (semantic poem GPT2) which was built on the top GPT2 model and an\nadditional loss to constrain context throughout the entire poem. For better\nevaluation, we examined the methods by both automatic quantitative evaluation\nand human evaluation. Both automatic and human evaluation demonstrated that our\napproach can generate poems that have better cohesion without losing the\nquality due to additional loss.

Their characteristics are\nsimilar to the aftershocks in one of two clusters: 1) the fifth DPRK (DPRK5)\ntest (mb(IDC)=5.09) conducted on September 9, 2016, which induced the first\nDPRK aftershock in the sequence detected at 1:50:48 UTC on September 11, 2016;\n2) the sixth DPRK (DPRK6) explosion (mb(IDC)=6.07), which generates its\naftershock sequence with characteristics significantly different from the\naftershocks in the DPRK5 sequence. The length, intensity, and alternating\ncharacter of these sequences suggest specific mechanisms of energy release\nlikely associated with the interaction of the damaged zones of the DPRK5 and\nDPRK6 and the collapse of their cavities with progressive propagation of the\ncollapsing chimneys to the free surface. According to the depth estimates based\non the moment tensor modelling, the DPRK5 and DPRK6 were conducted at\npractically the same depths. The difference in magnitudes suggests that their\ndamaged zones differ by a factor of 2 or more. The first aftershock of the\nDPRK6 (mb(IDC=4.12) 8.5 minutes after the test is evidence of the cavity\ncollapse and creation of a chimney, which did not reach the surface.
