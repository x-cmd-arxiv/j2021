In addition, these methods only\nutilize single label to integrate supervision information of data for hashing\nfunction learning, which may result in inferior network generalization\nperformance and relatively low-quality hash codes since the inter-class\ninformation of data is totally ignored. In this paper, we propose a dual\nsemantic asymmetric hashing (DSAH) method, which generates discriminative hash\ncodes under three-fold constraints. Firstly, DSAH utilizes class prior to\nconduct class structure quantization so as to transmit class information during\nthe quantization process. Secondly, a simple yet effective label mechanism is\ndesigned to characterize both the intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability of data, thereby achieving semantic-sensitive binary code\nlearning. Finally, a meaningful pairwise similarity preserving loss is devised\nto minimize the distances between class-related network outputs based on an\naffinity graph. With these three main components, high-quality hash codes can\nbe generated through network.

In this paper, we investigate flat-band plasmons in the\nhole-doped twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ (tb-MoS$_2$) by employing a full\ntight-binding model and the random phase approximation. When considering\nlattice relaxations in tb-MoS$_2$, the flat band is not separated from remote\nvalence bands, which makes the contribution of interband transitions in\ntransforming the plasmon dispersion and energy significantly different. In\nparticular, low-damped and quasi-flat plasmons emerge if we only consider\nintraband transitions in the doped flat band, whereas a $\\sqrt q$ plasmon\ndispersion emerges if we also take into account interband transitions between\nthe flat band and remote bands. Furthermore, the plasmon energies are tunable\nwith twist angles and doping levels. However, in a rigid sample that suffers no\nlattice relaxations, lower-energy quasi-flat plasmons and higher-energy\ninterband plasmons can coexist. For rigid tb-MoS$_2$ with a high doping level,\nstrongly enhanced interband transitions quench the quasi-flat plasmons. Based\non the lattice relaxation and doping effects, we conclude that two conditions,\nthe isolated flat band and a properly hole-doping level, are essential for\nobserving the low-damped and quasi-flat plasmon mode in twisted bilayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides.

It is based\non a discretization of the Fourier extension operators in terms of\nquadratically modulated wave packets. Using this new point of view, and by\ncombining natural scalar and mixed norm quantities from appropriate level sets,\nwe prove that all the $L^{2}$-based $k$-linear extension conjectures are true\nup to the endpoint for every $1 \\leq k \\leq d+1$ if one of the functions\ninvolved is a full tensor.

Under additional tensor hypotheses, we show that one can\nimprove the conjectured threshold of these problems in some cases. In general,\nthe largely unknown multilinear extension theory beyond $L^{2}$ inputs remains\nopen even in the bilinear case; with this new point of view, and still under\nthe previous tensor hypothesis, we obtain the near-restriction target for the\n$k$-linear extension operator if the inputs are in a certain $L^{p}$ space for\n$p$ sufficiently large.

A central question\nin ODE modeling is to infer the significance of individual regulatory effect of\none signal variable on another.

In this article, we construct post-regularization confidence band for\nindividual regulatory function in ODE with unknown functionals and noisy data\nobservations. Our proposal is the first of its kind, and is built on two novel\ningredients. The first is a new localized kernel learning approach that\ncombines reproducing kernel learning with local Taylor approximation, and the\nsecond is a new de-biasing method that tackles infinite-dimensional functionals\nand additional measurement errors. We show that the constructed confidence band\nhas the desired asymptotic coverage probability, and the recovered regulatory\nnetwork approaches the truth with probability tending to one. We establish the\ntheoretical properties when the number of variables in the system can be either\nsmaller or larger than the number of sampling time points, and we study the\nregime-switching phenomenon.

They have applications in\nseveral domains including e-commerce, recommendation systems and document\nanalysis. Existing decomposition algorithms use a bottom-up approach that\nconstructs the hierarchy in an increasing order of subgraph density. They\niteratively peel the entities with minimum butterfly count i.e. remove them\nfrom the graph and update the butterfly count of other entities. However, the\namount of butterflies in large bipartite graphs makes bottom-up peeling\ncomputationally demanding. Furthermore, the strict order of peeling entities\nresults in a numerous sequentially dependent iterations, which makes\nparallelization challenging.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Parallel Bipartite Network peelinG (PBNG)\nframework which adopts a two-phased peeling approach to relax the order of\npeeling, and in turn, reduce synchronization. The first phase divides the\ndecomposition hierarchy into several partitions using very few peeling\niterations. The second phase concurrently processes these partitions to\ngenerate the final hierarchy, and requires no global synchronization. The\ntwo-phased peeling further enables batching optimizations that dramatically\nimprove the computational efficiency.\n  We empirically evaluate PBNG using several real-world bipartite graphs.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art frameworks and decomposition algorithms, PBNG\nachieves up to four orders of magnitude reduction in synchronization and two\norders of magnitude speedup, respectively. We also present the first\ndecomposition results of some of the largest public real-world datasets, which\nPBNG can peel in few minutes but existing algorithms fail to process even in\nseveral days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 19:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

In order to enable\nsuch knowledge distillation across two different visual tasks, we introduce a\nsmall, trainable network that translates the predicted depth map to a semantic\nsegmentation map, which can then be supervised by the teacher network.

In this work, we ask: how does one detect if\na channel is useful in preparing negative conditional entropy states? We answer\nthis question by introducing the class of A-unital channels, which we show are\nthe largest class of conditional entropy non-decreasing channels. We also prove\nthat A-unital channels are precisely the completely free operations for the\nclass of states with non-negative conditional entropy. Furthermore, we study\nthe relationship between A-unital channels and other classes of channels\npertinent to the resource theory of entanglement. We then prove similar results\nfor ACVENN: a previously defined, relevant class of states and also relate the\nmaximum and minimum conditional entropy of a state with its von Neumann\nentropy.\n  The definition of A-unital channels naturally lends itself to a procedure for\ndetermining membership of channels in this class. Thus, our work is valuable\nfor the detection of resourceful channels in the context of conditional\nentropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 21:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 16:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 14:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is a popular approach to solve the\nproblem. This paper focuses on primal heuristics used with Dantzig-Wolfe\ndecomposition. We propose two primal heuristics: one based on decomposition and\none based on machine learning. The first one uses the fractional solution to\nthe restricted master problem to fix a subset of the integer variables. In each\niteration of the column generation procedure, the primal heuristic obtains the\nfractional solution, checks whether each binary variable satisfies the\nintegrality constraint and fix those which do. The remaining variables are then\noptimised quickly by a solver to find a feasible, near-optimal solution to the\noriginal instance. The other primal heuristic based on machine learning is of\ninterest when the problems are to be solved repeatedly with different demand\ndata but with the same problem structure. The primal heuristic uses a\npre-trained neural network to fix a subset of the integer variables. In the\ntraining phase, a neural network is trained to predict for any demand data and\nfor each binary variable how likely it is that the variable takes each of two\npossible values. After the training, given an instance to be solved, the\nprediction of the model is used with a rounding threshold to fix some binary\nvariables.

Thanks to this\nmethodology, we are able to study for the first time the topological structure\nof NFT networks and show that their properties (degree distribution and others)\nare similar to those of interaction graphs in social networks. Time-dependent\nanalysis metrics, useful to characterize market influencers and interactions\nbetween different wallets, are also introduced. Based on those, we identify\nacross a number of NFT networks the widespread presence of both investors\naccumulating NFTs and individuals who make large profits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 22:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

This paper presents a new formulation of time delay oscillators\nsubject to injection that describes all the essential features of their\ndynamics and phase noise. The common assumptions of a single mode oscillator\nand weak injection are removed. This is important to correctly predict the\nlocking range, the suppression of sidemodes and the phase noise spectrum. The\nfindings of the analysis are validated by experimental measurements provided by\nan optoelectronic oscillator under injection by an external source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

In a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, social\ninfluence can determine whether life-saving information is adopted. Existing\nliterature studying online social influence suffers from several drawbacks.\nFirst, a disconnect appears between psychology approaches, which are generally\nperformed and tested in controlled lab experiments, and the quantitative\nmethods, which are usually data-driven and rely on network and event analysis.\nThe former are slow, expensive to deploy, and typically do not generalize well\nto topical issues (such as an ongoing pandemic); the latter often oversimplify\nthe complexities of social influence and ignore psychosocial literature. This\nwork bridges this gap and presents three contributions towards modeling and\nempirically quantifying online influence. The first contribution is a\ndata-driven Generalized Influence Model that incorporates two novel\npsychosocial-inspired mechanisms: the conductance of the diffusion network and\nthe social capital distribution. The second contribution is a framework to\nempirically rank users' social influence using a human-in-the-loop active\nlearning method combined with crowdsourced pairwise influence comparisons.

For superconducting quantum processors, though isolated one- or\ntwo-qubit gates have been demonstrated with high-fidelity, implementing these\ngates in parallel commonly shows worse performance. Generally, this degradation\nis attributed to various crosstalks between qubits, such as quantum crosstalk\ndue to residual inter-qubit coupling. An understanding of the exact nature of\nthese crosstalks is critical to figuring out respective mitigation schemes and\nimproved qubit architecture designs with low crosstalk. Here we give a\ntheoretical analysis of quantum crosstalk impact on simultaneous gate\noperations in a qubit architecture, where fixed-frequency transmon qubits are\ncoupled via a tunable bus, and sub-100-ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates can be\nrealized by applying a baseband flux pulse on the bus. Our analysis shows that\nfor microwave-driven single-qubit gates, the dressing from the qubit-qubit\ncoupling can cause non-negligible cross-driving errors when qubits operate near\nfrequency collision regions. During CZ gate operations, although unwanted\nnear-neighbor interactions are nominally turned off, sub-MHz parasitic\nnext-near-neighbor interactions involving spectator qubits can still exist,\ncausing considerable leakage or control error when one operates qubit systems\naround these parasitic resonance points. To ensure high-fidelity simultaneous\noperations, there could raise a request to figure out a better way to balance\nthe gate error from target qubit systems themselves and the error from\nnon-participating spectator qubits. Overall, our analysis suggests that towards\nuseful quantum processors, the qubit architecture should be examined carefully\nin the context of high-fidelity simultaneous gate operations in a scalable\nqubit lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 01:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 02:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 12:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 07:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The generalization ability of face presentation\nattack detection models to unseen attacks has become a key issue for real-world\ndeployment, which can be improved when models are trained with face images from\ndifferent input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality,\ndue to legal and privacy issues, training data (both real face images and spoof\nimages) are not allowed to be directly shared between different data sources.\nIn this paper, to circumvent this challenge, we propose a Federated Test-Time\nAdaptive Face Presentation Attack Detection with Dual-Phase Privacy\nPreservation framework, with the aim of enhancing the generalization ability of\nfPAD models in both training and testing phase while preserving data privacy.\nIn the training phase, the proposed framework exploits the federated learning\ntechnique, which simultaneously takes advantage of rich fPAD information\navailable at different data sources by aggregating model updates from them\nwithout accessing their private data. To further boost the generalization\nability, in the testing phase, we explore test-time adaptation by minimizing\nthe entropy of fPAD model prediction on the testing data, which alleviates the\ndomain gap between training and testing data and thus reduces the\ngeneralization error of a fPAD model. We introduce the experimental setting to\nevaluate the proposed framework and carry out extensive experiments to provide\nvarious insights about the proposed method for fPAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 02:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

We further prove that the regret of the proposed algorithm\nis $\\tilde{O}(C^2d\\sqrt{\\sum_{t = 1}^T \\sigma_t^2} + C^2R\\sqrt{dT})$, where $d$\nis the dimension of context vectors, $T$ is the number of rounds, $R$ is the\nrange of noise and $\\sigma_t^2,t=1\\ldots,T$ are the variances of instantaneous\nreward. We also prove a gap-dependent regret bound for the proposed algorithm,\nwhich is instance-dependent and thus leads to better performance on good\npractical instances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nvariance-aware corruption-robust algorithm for contextual bandits. Experiments\non synthetic data corroborate our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 02:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Primitive is a sequence of elementary\nactions with certain exit conditions, such as \"pushing down the peg until\ncontact\". Since the primitive is an abstraction of robot control commands and\nencodes human prior knowledge, it reduces the exploration difficulty and yields\nbetter learning efficiency. In this paper, we learn robot assembly skills via\nprimitives. Specifically, we formulate insertion primitives as parameterized\nactions: hybrid actions consisting of discrete primitive types and continuous\nprimitive parameters. Compared with the previous work using a set of\ndiscretized parameters for each primitive, the agent in our method can freely\nchoose primitive parameters from a continuous space, which is more flexible and\nefficient. To learn these insertion primitives, we propose Twin-Smoothed\nMulti-pass Deep Q-Network (TS-MP-DQN), an advanced version of MP-DQN with twin\nQ-network to reduce the Q-value over-estimation. Extensive experiments are\nconducted in the simulation and real world for validation. From experiment\nresults, our approach achieves higher success rates than three baselines:\nMP-DQN with parameterized actions, primitives with discrete parameters, and\ncontinuous velocity control. Furthermore, learned primitives are robust to\nsim-to-real transfer and can generalize to challenging assembly tasks such as\ntight round peg-hole and complex shaped electric connectors with promising\nsuccess rates.

However, those algorithms suppose that\nweight parameters of regularizers, called hyperparameters hereafter, are\npre-fixed, and it is a crucial matter how the best hyperparameter should be\nselected. In this paper, we focus on the hyperparameter selection of\nregularizers related to the $\\ell_p$ function with $0<p\\le 1$ and apply a\nbilevel programming strategy, wherein we need to solve a bilevel problem, whose\nlower-level problem is nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex and non-Lipschitz.\nRecently, for solving a bilevel problem for hyperparameter selection of the\npure $\\ell_p\\ (0<p \\le 1)$ regularizer Okuno et al. discovered new necessary\noptimality conditions, called SB(scaled bilevel)-KKT conditions, and further\nproposed a smoothing-type algorithm using a certain smoothing function.\nHowever, this optimality measure is loose in the sense that there could be many\npoints that satisfy the SB-KKT conditions. In this work, we propose new bilevel\nKKT conditions, which are new necessary optimality conditions tighter than the\nones proposed by Okuno et al.

We train different models for each\nproblem and we also draw comparisons between building a custom CNN\n(Convolutional Neural Network) architecture and using various CNN architectures\nas feature extractors, namely VGG16 pre-trained on VGGFace, Res-Net50 and\nSE-ResNet50 pre-trained on VGGFace2 dataset and training over those extracted\nfeatures. We also provide baseline performance of various machine learning\nalgorithms on the feature extraction which gave us the best results. It was\nobserved that even simple linear regression trained on such extracted features\noutperformed training CNN, ResNet50 and ResNeXt50 from scratch for age\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 04:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

We consider the\nadditive variance and additive CI approaches for the difference, in which\neither the CI for the weighted difference, or the CI for the weighted effect in\neach group, or the variance for the weighted difference is calculated as the\nweighted sum of the corresponding stratum-specific statistics. The CI for the\nratio is derived by the Fieller and log-ratio methods. The weights can be\nrandom quantities under the assumption of a constant effect across strata, but\nthis assumption is not needed for fixed weights. These methods can be easily\napplied to different endpoints in that they require only the point estimate,\nCI, and variance estimate for the measure of interest in each group across\nstrata. The methods are illustrated with two real examples. In one example, we\nderive the MOVER CIs for the risk difference and risk ratio for binary\noutcomes. In the other example, we compare the restricted mean survival time\nand milestone survival in stratified analysis of time-to-event outcomes.\nSimulations show that the proposed MOVER CIs generally outperform the standard\nlarge sample CIs, and that the additive CI approach performs slightly better\nthan the additive variance approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 04:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

First-principle\nsimulations corroborate the doping evolution of the band structure observed in\nARPES, and affirm that the CDW instability does not occur once the VHS is\npushed above the Fermi level, explaining the absence of the CDW ordering in our\ndoped samples Cs(V$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results demonstrate a\ncompetition between the CDW and superconducting orders in the kagome-metal\nsuperconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, although the superconductivity is likely\ninconsequential of the CDW order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 05:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Owing to the solar mass loss during the\ngiant branch, 40\\% of the JTAs are lost but the vast majority of MBAs and TNOs\nsurvive. During the WD phase, objects from all three populations are\nsporadically scattered onto the WD, implying ongoing accretion. For young\ncooling ages $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, accretion of MBAs predominates; our predicted\naccretion rate $\\sim10^6$ g/s falls short of observations by two orders of\nmagnitude. On Gyr timescales, thanks to the consumption of the TNOs that kicks\nin $\\gtrsim 100$ Myr, the rate oscillates around $10^6-10^7$ g/s until several\nGyr and drops to $\\sim10^5$ g/s at 10 Gyr.

The lower\nradiation levels on the rim of the NSW allowed utilizing commercial electronic\nchips, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), in the trigger chain of\nthe sTGC detectors. Those FPGAs require an ultra-low jitter clock for the\nproper operation of their Gigabit transceivers (4.8 Gbps serial links). The\ninitial design was based on a clock provided by a radiation tolerant ASIC\ndesigned at CERN, but due to its intrinsic jitter and consequent marginal error\nrate on the transmission lines, a different approach had to be chosen. An\nadditional clock source based on commercial jitter cleaners, fan-out chips and\noptical transmitters driving dedicated fibers was built. The new scheme\nprovides 64 low-jitter clocks (32 main and redundant) from the\nradiation-protected area (USA15) to the trigger electronics over 60 m of OM3\nfiber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 06:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

We explored the outcomes of ram pressure stripping by\nstudying the non-thermal radio emission of the jellyfish galaxy JW100 in the\ncluster Abell 2626 ($z=0.055$) by combining LOFAR, MeerKAT, and VLA\nobservations from 0.144 to 5.5 GHz. We studied the integrated spectra of the\nstellar disk, the stripped tail and the AGN, mapped the spectral index over the\ngalaxy, and constrained the magnetic field intensity to be between 11 and 18\n$\\mu$G in the disk and $<10$ $\\mu$G in the tail. The stellar disk radio\nemission is dominated by a radiatively old plasma, likely related to an older\nphase of high star formation rate. This suggests that the star formation was\nquickly quenched by a factor of 4 in a few $10^7$ yr.

Here, we asked whether\nmitochondrial dynamics may allow individual mitochondria to `collect' a full\ncopy of the mtDNA genome over time, by facilitating exchange between\nindividuals. Akin to trade on a social network, exchange of mtDNA fragments\nacross organelles may lead to the emergence of full `effective' genomes in\nindividuals over time. We characterise the collective dynamics of mitochondria\nin \\emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} hypocotyl cells using a recent approach\ncombining single-cell timelapse microscopy, video analysis, and network\nscience. We then use a quantitative model to predict the capacity for the\nsharing and accumulation of genetic information through the networks of\nencounters between mitochondria. We find that biological encounter networks are\nstrikingly well predisposed to support the collection of full genomes over\ntime, outperforming a range of other networks generated from theory and\nsimulation. Using results from the coupon collector's problem, we show that the\nupper tail of the degree distribution is a key determinant of an encounter\nnetwork's performance at this task and discuss how features of mitochondrial\ndynamics observed in biology facilitate the emergence of full effective\ngenomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 08:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

How this complex behaviour is formed in the\nsolar corona is not yet known, since it requires omnipresent fluctuations,\nwhich constantly emit material to feed the wind. In this article we analysed 14\nupflow regions in the solar corona to find potential sources for plasma flow.\nThe upflow regions were derived from spectroscopic data from the EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode determining their Doppler velocity and\ndefining regions which have blueshifts stronger than $-6\\,km\\,s^{-1}$. To\nidentify the sources of this blueshift data from the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the X-ray Telescope (XRT), onboard\nHinode, were used. The analysis revealed that only 5 out of 14 of the upflows\nwere associated with frequent transients, like obvious jets or bright points.\nIn contrast to that, seven events were associated with small-scale features,\nwhich show a large variety of dynamics.

The\ndefinition and the study of observables sensitive to high-energy dynamics in\nthe context of heavy-flavor physics has the double advantage of (i) allowing to\nget a stabilization of the BFKL series under higher-order corrections and (ii)\nproviding us with an auxiliary tool to investigate heavy-flavor production in\nwider kinematical ranges. Hence, we propose a scientific program on\nheavy-flavor physics at high-energy with the goal of considering both open\n(heavy-jet) and bound states ($\\Lambda$ baryons, heavy-light mesons and\nquarkonia).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 10:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

However, static or scarcely random\nchannels require artificially induced dynamics to improve the secrecy\nperformance, e.g., using intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). One key\nchallenge is that the induced random phase from IRS is also reflected in the\ndirection to eavesdroppers (Eve). This leakage enables Eve nodes to estimate\nthe legitimate channels and secret key via a globally known pilot sequence. To\nmitigate the secret key leakage issue, we propose to exploit random matrix\ntheory to inform the design of a new physical layer secret key generation\n(PL-SKG) algorithm.

The key characteristic of an efficient\nmapping is its ability to translate local fermionic interactions into local\nqubit interactions, leading to easy-to-simulate qubit Hamiltonians.\n  All fermion-qubit mappings must use a numbering scheme for the fermionic\nmodes in order for translation to qubit operations. We make a distinction\nbetween the unordered, symbolic labelling of fermions and the ordered, numeric\nlabelling of the qubits to which the fermionic system maps. This separation\nshines light on a new way to design fermion-qubit mappings by making use of the\nextra degree of freedom -- the enumeration scheme for the fermionic modes. This\nallows well-defined concepts of optimal fermion-qubit mappings: for example,\nthe main focus of this paper is in identifying Jordan-Wigner transformations\nthat minimise the average number of Pauli matrices in the terms of the qubit\nHamiltonians they produce. Given a fermionic system, it does not expend any\nresources to choose the optimal fermionic enumeration schemes for practical\ncost functions of the target qubit Hamiltonian.\n  We demonstrate how Mitchison and Durbin's enumeration pattern is optimal for\nminimising the average Pauli weight of Jordan-Wigner transformations of the\nsystems interacting in square fermionic lattices. This leads to qubit\nHamiltonians consisting of terms with average Pauli weights 13.9% shorter than\npreviously known. Furthermore, by adding only two ancilla qubits we introduce a\nnew class of fermion-qubit mappings, and reduce the average Pauli weight of\nHamiltonian terms by 37.9% compared to previous methods. For other natural\n$n$-mode fermionic systems we find enumeration patterns which result in\n$n^{1/4}$ improvement in average Pauli weight over na\\\"ive enumeration schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 10:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 14:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 14:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 16:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Thin-Plate-Spline\n(TPS) transformation has achieved great success in scene text recognition.\nInspired by this, we reversely think of its usage and sophisticatedly take TPS\nas an exquisite representation for arbitrary shape text representation. The TPS\nrepresentation is compact, complete, and efficient. With the predicted TPS\nparameters, the detected text region can be directly rectified to a\nnear-horizontal one to assist the subsequent recognition.

To\naccurately locate COVID-19 lesions and assist doctors to make the best\ndiagnosis and treatment plan, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is\npresented for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT images. Methods: Considering\nthe fact that a large number of COVID-19 CT images and the corresponding lesion\nannotations are difficult to obtained, a transfer learning strategy is employed\nto make up for the shortcoming and alleviate the overfitting problem. Based on\nthe reality that traditional single deep learning framework is difficult to\nextract COVID-19 lesion features effectively, which may cause some lesions to\nbe undetected. To overcome the problem, a deep-supervised ensemble learning\nnetwork is presented to combine with local and global features for COVID-19\nlesion segmentation.

On the other hand, foundry-based silicon photonics (SiPh) has\nhad remarkable success in providing versatile functionality in a scalable and\nlow-cost manner, but its available chip-based light sources lack the capacity\nfor parallelization, which limits the scope of SiPh applications. Here, we\nbridge these two technologies by using a power-efficient and\noperationally-simple AlGaAs on insulator microcomb source to drive CMOS SiPh\nengines.

Motivated by\nthis consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that recovers the label\ndistribution as a label enhancement (LE) process and trains the predictive\nmodel iteratively in every epoch. Specifically, we assume the true posterior\ndensity of the latent label distribution takes on the variational approximate\nDirichlet density parameterized by an inference model. Then the evidence lower\nbound is deduced for optimizing the inference model and the label distributions\ngenerated from the variational posterior are utilized for training the\npredictive model. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

With the rise of highly portable, wireless, and low-cost\nultrasound devices and automatic ultrasound acquisition techniques, an\nautomated interpretation method requiring only a limited set of views as input\ncould make preliminary cardiovascular disease diagnoses more accessible. In\nthis study, we developed a deep learning (DL) method for automated detection of\nimpaired left ventricular (LV) function and aortic valve (AV) regurgitation\nfrom apical four-chamber (A4C) ultrasound cineloops and investigated which\nanatomical structures or temporal frames provided the most relevant information\nfor the DL model to enable disease classification.\n  Methods and Results. A4C ultrasounds were extracted from 3,554\nechocardiograms of patients with either impaired LV function (n=928), AV\nregurgitation (n=738), or no significant abnormalities (n=1,888). Two\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained separately to classify the\nrespective disease cases against normal cases. The overall classification\naccuracy of the impaired LV function detection model was 86%, and that of the\nAV regurgitation detection model was 83%. Feature importance analyses\ndemonstrated that the LV myocardium and mitral valve were important for\ndetecting impaired LV function, while the tip of the mitral valve anterior\nleaflet, during opening, was considered important for detecting AV\nregurgitation.\n  Conclusion. The proposed method demonstrated the feasibility of a 3D CNN\napproach in detection of impaired LV function and AV regurgitation using A4C\nultrasound cineloops.

The technique works on any fractal that belongs to the\nNon-overlapping-Bounding-Boxes (NBB) class of discrete fractals, and can be\nextended to three dimensions as well. Results using an A100 GPU on the\nSierpinski Triangle as a case study show up to $\\sim11\\times$ of speedup and a\nmemory usage reduction of $234\\times$ with respect to a Bounding Box approach.\nThese results show that the proposed compact approach can allow the scientific\ncommunity to tackle larger problems that did not fit in GPU memory before, and\nrun even faster than a bounding box approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 13:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

However, some key factors (e.g., software\nconfiguration, trigger method) are often missing, so we can not directly\nreproduce the failure without extra attempts. Even worse, highly customized\nconfiguration options of programs create a barrier for reproducing the\nvulnerabilities that only appear under some specific combinations of\nconfigurations. In this paper, we address the problem mentioned above --\nreproducing the configuration-related vulnerability. We try to solve it by\nproposing a binary similarity-based method to infer the specific building\nconfigurations via the binary from crash report. The main challenges are as\nfollows: precise compilation option inference, program configuration inference,\nand source-code-to-binary matching. To achieve the goal, we implement RoBin, a\nbinary similarity-based building configuration inference tool. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness, we test RoBin on 21 vulnerable cases upon 4 well-known\nopen-source programs. It shows a strong ability in pinpointing the building\nconfigurations causing the vulnerability. The result can help developers\nreproduce and diagnose the vulnerability, and finally, patch the programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 14:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

For\ndynamical systems with external forcing, the identified model should not only\nbe suitable for a specific forcing function but should generally approximate\nthe input-output behavior of the underlying dynamics. A novel methodology for\nmodeling those classes of dynamical systems is proposed in the present work,\nusing wavelets in conjunction with the input-output dynamic mode decomposition\n(ioDMD). Our non-intrusive approach constructs numerical models directly from\ntrajectories of the full model's inputs and outputs, without requiring the\nfull-model operators. These trajectories are generated by running a simulation\nof the full model or observing the original dynamical systems' response to\ninputs in an experimental framework. Hence, the present methodology is\napplicable for dynamical systems whose internal state vector measurements are\nnot available. Instead, data from only a few output locations are only\naccessible, as often the case in practice. The present methodology's\napplicability is explained by modeling the input-output response of a finite\nelement beam model. The WDMD provides a linear state-space representation of\nthe dynamical system using the response measurements and the corresponding\ninput forcing functions. The developed state-space model is then used to\nsimulate the beam's response towards different types of forcing functions. The\nmethod is further validated on an experimental data set using modal analysis on\na simple free-free beam, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methodology\nas an appropriate candidate for modeling practical dynamical systems despite\nhaving no access to internal state measurements and treating the full model as\na black-box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 14:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Efficient\nalgorithms for many operations useful in probabilistic reasoning on these\nmodels critically depend on imposing structural restrictions to the underlying\nAC. Generally, adding structural restrictions yields new tractable operations\nbut increases the size of the AC. In this paper we study the relative\nsuccinctness of classes of AC with different combinations of common\nrestrictions. Building on existing results for Boolean circuits, we derive an\nunconditional succinctness map for classes of monotone AC -- that is, AC whose\nconstant labels are non-negative reals -- respecting relevant combinations of\nthe restrictions we consider. We extend a small part of the map to classes of\npositive AC.

In order to reliably use\nGRBs to this end, we first need to have a well-developed grasp of the mechanism\nthat produces the radiation within GRB jets and how that relates to their\nstructure. One model for the emission mechanism of GRBs invokes radiation\nproduced deep in the jet which eventually escapes the jet at its photosphere.\nWhile this model has been able to explain a number of observed GRB\ncharacteristics, it is currently lacking in predictive power and in ability to\nfully reproduce GRB spectra. In order to address these shortcomings of the\nmodel, we have expanded the capabilities of the MCRaT code, a state of the art\nradiative transfer code that can now simulate optical to gamma ray radiation\npropagating in a hydrodynamically simulated GRB jet. Using the MCRaT code, we\nhave constructed mock observed light curves, spectra, and polarization from\noptical to gamma ray energies for the simulated GRBs.

Optimally leveraging this probe requires accurate theoretical\npredictions regarding the abundance of subhaloes. These predictions are\nhampered by artificial disruption in numerical simulations, by large\nhalo-to-halo variance, and by the fact that the results depend on the baryonic\nphysics of galaxy formation. In particular, numerical simulations have shown\nthat the formation of a central disc can drastically reduce the abundance of\nsubstructure compared to a dark matter-only simulation, which has been\nattributed to enhanced destruction of substructure due to disc shocking. We\nexamine the impact of discs on substructure using the semi-analytical subhalo\nmodel SatGen, which accurately models the tidal evolution of substructure free\nof the numerical disruption that still hampers $N$-body simulations. Using a\nsample of 10,000 merger trees of Milky Way-like haloes, we study the\ndemographics of subhaloes that are evolved under a range of composite halo-disc\npotentials with unprecedented statistical power. We find that the overall\nsubhalo abundance is relatively insensitive to properties of the disc aside\nfrom its total mass. For a disc that contains $5\\%$ of $M_\\mathrm{vir}$, the\nmean subhalo abundance within $r_\\mathrm{vir}$ is suppressed by\n${\\lesssim}10\\%$ relative to the no-disc case, a difference that is dwarfed by\nhalo-to-halo variance. For the same disc mass, the abundance of subhaloes\nwithin 50 kpc is reduced by ${\\sim}30\\%$.

Only recently, it has become possible to\ncontrol single-electrons in BLG quantum dots (QDs) and to understand their\nspin-valley texture, while the relaxation dynamics have remained mostly\nunexplored. Here, we report spin relaxation times ($T_1$) of single-electron\nstates in BLG QDs. Using pulsed-gate spectroscopy, we extract relaxation times\nexceeding 200 $\\mu$s at a magnetic field of 1.9 T. The $T_1$ values show a\nstrong dependence on the spin splitting, promising even longer $T_1$ at lower\nmagnetic fields, where our measurements are limited by the signal-to-noise\nratio.

Since the\nearly days, many developments have been made to improve the performance of the\nsystem. PSNR of the received signal, secure transmission channel, quality of\nencoding used, etc. are some of the key attributes of a good system. To ensure\nsecurity, the most commonly used technique is cryptography in which the message\nis altered with respect to a key and using the same, the encoded message is\ndecoded at the receiver side. A complementary technique that is popularly used\nto insure security is steganography. The advancements in Artificial\nIntelligence(AI) have paved way for performing steganography in an intelligent,\ntamper-proof manner. The recent discovery by researchers in the field of Deep\nLearning(DL), an unsupervised learning network known as the Generative\nAdversarial Networks(GAN) has improved the performance of this technique\nexponentially. It has been demonstrated that deep neural networks are highly\nsensitive to tiny perturbations of input data, giving rise to adversarial\nexamples. Though this property is usually considered a weakness of learned\nmodels, it could be beneficial if used appropriately. The work that has been\naccomplished by MIT for this purpose, a deep-neural model by the name of\nSteganoGAN, has shown obligation for using this technique for steganography. In\nthis work, we have proposed a novel approach to improve the performance of the\nexisting system using latent space compression on the encoded data.

Therefore, it is important to provide the\noccupant comfort requirements in buildings in an energy efficient manner.\nHowever, buildings are large scale complex systems, susceptible to sensor,\nactuator or communication network failures in their thermal control\ninfrastructure, that can affect their performance in terms of occupant comfort\nand energy efficiency. The degree of decentralization in the control\narchitecture determines a fundamental tradeoff between performance and\nrobustness. This thesis studies the problem of thermal control of buildings\nfrom the perspective of partitioning them into clusters for decentralized\ncontrol, to balance underlying performance and robustness requirements.\nMeasures of deviation in performance and robustness between centralized and\ndecentralized architectures in the Model Predictive Control framework are\nderived. Appropriate clustering algorithms are then proposed to determine\ndecentralized control architectures which provide a satisfactory trade-off\nbetween the underlying performance and robustness objectives. Two different\npartitioning methodologies the CLF-MCS method and the OLF-FPM method are\ndeveloped and compared. The problem of decentralized control design based on\nthe architectures obtained using these methodologies is also considered. It\nentails the use of decentralized extended state observers to address the issue\nof unavailability of unknown states and disturbances in the system. The\npotential use of the proposed control architecture selection and decentralized\ncontrol design methodologies is demonstrated in simulation on a real world\nmulti-zone building.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 03:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

From the behavior of\ninversion curves in the $T-P$ plane, it is observed that there exists only\nminimum inversion temperatures for BTZ black holes. The relevant calculations\nfor rotating BTZ black holes are almost straightforward, while it is more\nchallenging to address when a charge parameter is added. In the case of charged\nBTZ metrics, the black hole system can be considered in two possible\nthermodynamical schemes and it is explicitly proved that the Joule-Thomson\nexpansion is present in a specific scheme (referred to as scheme II) in which\nthermodynamic instabilities do not arise. The existence of Joule-Thomson\nexpansion in all three BTZ cases strongly indicates that these\nlower-dimensional black hole spacetimes can be considered as interacting\nstatistical systems like their higher-dimensional cousins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 13:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Herein, two-dimensional (2D) metagratings composed of\na 2D periodic array of rectangular holes in a metallic medium are proposed for\ndiffraction pattern control. We first present an analytical method for\ndiffraction analysis of 2D compound metallic metagrating (a periodic metallic\nstructure with more than one rectangular hole in each period). Closed-form and\nanalytical expressions are presented for the reflection coefficients of\ndiffracted orders for the first time. Next, we verify the proposed method's\nresults against full-wave simulations and demonstrate their excellent\nagreement. As a proof of principle, two applications are presented using the\nproposed analytical method. The first application is a perfect out-of-plane\nreflector that transfers a normal transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized plane wave\nto an oblique transverse-electric (TE) polarized plane wave in the $y-z$ plane.\nThe second one is a five-channel beam splitter with an arbitrary power\ndistribution between channels. Using the proposed analytical method, we\ndesigned these metagratings without requiring even a single optimization in a\nfull-wave solver. The performance of the designed metagratings is better than\npreviously reported structures in terms of power efficiency and relative\ndistribution error. Our analytical results reveals that 2D metagratings can be\nused for manipulating EM waves in the plane and out of the plane of incidence\nwith very high efficiency, thereby leading to extensive applications in a wide\nrange of frequencies from microwave to terahertz (THz) regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 14:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

However, many of these\nsame researchers are expressing growing concern about applications of machine\nlearning for surveillance (Nanayakkara et al., 2021). This paper presents a\nbrief overview of strategies for resisting these surveillance technologies and\ncalls for greater collaboration between machine learning and human-computer\ninteraction researchers to address the threats that these technologies pose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 03:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

The reported switching\nmechanism can be classified into either localized or bulk effect. The localized\neffect is commonly observed in GO-RRAM with active electrode e.g. Cu and Al.\nThe switching mechanism includes metallic conduction filament evolution or\nmodification of interfacial resistance between GO layer and electrodes. On the\nother hand, the bulk effect involves hybridization state change of the entire\nGO layer and is typically observed in devices with inert electrode e.g. Pt and\nAu. Numerous compact models have been proposed for RRAM that are based on\nlocalized switching mechanism. However, compact modeling of GO-RRAM based on\nbulk mechanism is still lacking. Thus, this paper presents a compact model for\nGO-RRAM that relies on hybridization state modulation. The proposed model\nassociates the resistance switching mechanism with the electricaldriven\nmodification of sp2 clusters density in the switching layer. A SPICE model\nincorporating the proposed compact model is developed for parameter\ncalibration. The simulated I-V characteristic exhibits strong correlation with\nthe experimental data. Hereby, we regard the proposed compact model as an\nacceptable and close description of GO-RRAM operation that depends on the bulk\nswitching mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 05:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

In this paper we present a medium access control\nprotocol which allows spectrum collaboration with minimal regret and high\nspectral efficiency in highly loaded networks. We present a fully-distributed\nalgorithm for spectrum collaboration in congested ad-hoc networks. The\nalgorithm jointly solves both the channel allocation and access scheduling\nproblems. We prove that the algorithm has an optimal logarithmic regret. Based\non the algorithm we provide a medium access control protocol which allows\ndistributed implementation of the algorithm in ad-hoc networks. The protocol\nutilizes single-channel opportunistic carrier sensing to carry out a\nlow-complexity distributed auction in time and frequency. We also discuss\npractical implementation issues such as bounded frame size and speed of\nconvergence. Computer simulations comparing the algorithm to state-of-the-art\ndistributed medium access control protocols show the significant advantage of\nthe proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 10:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}
