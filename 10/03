The context of\nthis research is part of the broad and active field of Computational\nMicromechanics, which has emerged as an effective tool both to understand the\ninfluence of complex microstructures on the macro-mechanical response of\nengineering materials and to tailor-design innovative materials for specific\napplications through a proper modification of their microstructure. The\ncomputational framework presented in this thesis is based on the Virtual\nElement Method (VEM), a recently developed numerical technique able to provide\nrobust numerical results even with highly-distorted meshes. The peculiar\nfeatures of VEM have been exploited to analyse two-dimensional representations\nof heterogeneous materials microstructures. Ad-hoc polygonal multi-domain\nmeshing strategies have been developed and tested to exploit the discretisation\nfreedom that VEM allows. To further simplify the preprocessing stage of the\nanalysis and reduce the total computational cost, a novel hybrid formulation\nfor analysing multi-domain problems has been developed by combining the Virtual\nElement Method with the well-known Boundary Element Method (BEM). The hybrid\napproach has been used to study both composite material transverse behaviour in\npresence of inclusions with complex geometries and damage and crack propagation\nin the matrix phase. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the\npotential of the developed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 16:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

One way for further confirmations\nmay be searching for other characteristic signatures, such as those in their\nbroad emission lines (BELs), if any, which require a thorough understanding on\nthe response of BELs to the BBH systems. In Ji et al.

In this paper, we explore how the BEL profiles vary when the BLR is\nmisaligned from the BBH orbital plane with different offset angles under both\nthe BBH-DB and BBH-IntDB scenarios. Given a fixed inclination angle of the BBH\norbital plane viewed in edge-on and similar continuum light curves produced by\nthe two scenarios, increasing offset angles make the initial opening angle of\nthe circumbinary BLR enlarged due to orbital precession caused by the BBH\nsystem, especially for clouds in the inner region, which result in Lorentz-like\nBEL profiles for the BBH-DB model but still Gaussian-like profiles for the\nBBH-IntDB model at the vertical BLR case. The amplitude of profile variations\ndecrease with increasing offset angles for the BBH-DB scenario, while keep\nnearly constant for the BBH-IntDB scenario, since the Doppler boosting effect\nis motion direction preferred but the intrinsic variation is radiated\nisotropically. If the circumbinary BLR is composed of a coplanar and a vertical\ncomponents with their number of clouds following the mass ratio of the BBHs,\nthen the bi-BLR features are more significant for the BBH-IntDB model that\nrequire larger mass ratio to generate similar continuum variation than the\nBBH-DB model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 16:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 05:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Recent approaches ensure\nsafe robot operation in uncertain environments through a supervisory control\nscheme, sometimes called \"shielding\", which overrides the robot's nominal plan\nwith a safety fallback strategy when a safety-critical event is imminent. These\nreactive \"last-resort\" strategies (typically in the form of aggressive\nemergency maneuvers) focus on preserving safety without efficiency\nconsiderations; when the nominal planner is unaware of possible safety\noverrides, shielding can be activated more frequently than necessary, leading\nto degraded performance.

Larger dust grains\nwill concentrate in gaseous rings more compactly due to stronger aerodynamic\ndrag.

Using MCRT simulations, we self-consistently\nconstruct ring models by iterating the ring's thermal structure, hydrostatic\nequilibrium, and dust concentration. We set up rings with two dust populations\nhaving different settling and radial concentration due to their different\nsizes. We find two mechanisms that can lead to temperature dips around the\nring. When the disk is optically thick, the temperature drops outside the ring,\nwhich is the shadowing effect found in previous works adopting a single-dust\npopulation in the disk. When the disk is optically thin, a second mechanism due\nto excess cooling of big grains is found. Big grains cool more efficiently,\nwhich leads to a moderate temperature dip within the ring where big dust\nresides. This dip is close to the center of the ring. Such temperature dip\nwithin the ring can lead to particle pile-up outside the ring and feedback to\nthe dust distribution and thermal structure. We couple the MCRT calculations\nwith a 1D dust evolution model and show that the ring evolves to a different\nshape and may even separate to several rings. Overall, dust concentration\nwithin rings has moderate effects on the disk's thermal structure, and\nself-consistent model is crucial not only for protoplanetary disk observations\nbut also for planetesimal and planet formation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 18:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Despite a plethora of experimental\ndiscoveries, the nature of these orders and how they transiently appear remain\nunclear. To this end, we investigate a nonequilibrium charge density wave (CDW)\nin rare-earth tritellurides, which is suppressed in equilibrium but emerges\nafter photoexcitation. Using a pump-pump-probe protocol implemented in\nultrafast electron diffraction, we demonstrate that the light-induced CDW\nconsists solely of order parameter fluctuations, which bear striking\nsimilarities to critical fluctuations in equilibrium despite differences in the\nlength scale. By calculating the dynamics of CDW fluctuations in a\nnonperturbative model, we further show that the strength of the light-induced\norder is governed by the amplitude of equilibrium fluctuations. These findings\nhighlight photoinduced fluctuations as an important ingredient for the\nemergence of transient orders out of equilibrium. Our results further suggest\nthat materials with strong fluctuations in equilibrium are promising platforms\nto host \"hidden\" orders after laser excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 18:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

These new candidates need\nto be confirmed as real GCs and properly characterised. We investigate the\nphysical nature of FSR 1776. This object was originally classified as an\nintermediate-age open cluster and has recently been re-discovered independently\nand classified as a GC candidate (Minni 23). Firstly, we aim at confirming its\nGC nature; secondly we determine its physical parameters. The confirmation of\nthe cluster existence is checked using the radial velocity (RV) distribution of\na MUSE data cube centred at FSR 1776. The cluster parameters are derived from\nisochrone fitting to the RV-cleaned colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from\nvisible and near-infrared photometry. The predicted RV distribution for the FSR\n1776 coordinates, considering only contributions from the bulge and disc field\nstars, is not enough to explain the observed MUSE RV distribution.

In this paper, we\npresent a theoretical analysis of Thompson Sampling, with a focus on\nfrequentist regret bounds. In this setting, we show that the standard Thompson\nSampling is not aggressive enough in exploring new actions, leading to\nsuboptimality in some pessimistic situations. A simple modification called\nFeel-Good Thompson Sampling, which favors high reward models more aggressively\nthan the standard Thompson Sampling, is proposed to remedy this problem. We\nshow that the theoretical framework can be used to derive Bayesian regret\nbounds for standard Thompson Sampling, and frequentist regret bounds for\nFeel-Good Thompson Sampling. It is shown that in both cases, we can reduce the\nbandit regret problem to online least squares regression estimation. For the\nfrequentist analysis, the online least squares regression bound can be directly\nobtained using online aggregation techniques which have been well studied. The\nresulting bandit regret bound matches the minimax lower bound in the finite\naction case. Moreover, the analysis can be generalized to handle a class of\nlinearly embeddable contextual bandit problems (which generalizes the popular\nlinear contextual bandit model).

Despite the integrated pest mechanical\naspect, only a few works on automatic classification have handled images with\norange mite characteristics, which means tiny and noisy regions of interest. On\nthe computational side, attention-based models have gained prominence in deep\nlearning research, and, along with weakly supervised learning algorithms, they\nhave improved tasks performed with some label restrictions. In agronomic\nresearch of pests and diseases, these techniques can improve classification\nperformance while pointing out the location of mites and insects without\nspecific labels, reducing deep learning development costs related to generating\nbounding boxes. In this context, this work proposes an attention-based\nactivation map approach developed to improve the classification of tiny regions\ncalled Two-Weighted Activation Mapping, which also produces locations using\nfeature map scores learned from class labels. We apply our method in a\ntwo-stage network process called Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning\nGuided by Saliency Maps.

A recent influential paper of Jonas and Kording, that examines a\nmicroprocessor using techniques from neuroscience, suggests that common\ntechniques to understand neural systems are inadequate. Part of the difficulty,\nas a previous work of Lazebnik noted, lies in lack of formal language. We\nprovide a theoretical framework for defining reverse engineering of\ncomputational systems, motivated by the neuroscience context. Of specific\ninterest are recent works where, increasingly, interventions are being made to\nalter the function of the neural circuitry to both understand the system and\ntreat disorders. Starting from Lazebnik's viewpoint that understanding a system\nmeans you can ``fix it'', and motivated by use-cases in neuroscience, we\npropose the following requirement on reverse engineering: once an agent claims\nto have reverse-engineered a neural circuit, they subsequently need to be able\nto: (a) provide a minimal set of interventions to change the input/output (I/O)\nbehavior of the circuit to a desired behavior; (b) arrive at this minimal set\nof interventions while operating under bounded rationality constraints (e.g.,\nlimited memory) to rule out brute-force approaches. Under certain assumptions,\nwe show that this reverse engineering goal falls within the class of\nundecidable problems. Next, we examine some canonical computational systems and\nreverse engineering goals (as specified by desired I/O behaviors) where reverse\nengineering can indeed be performed. Finally, using an exemplar network, the\n``reward network'' in the brain, we summarize the state of current\nneuroscientific understanding, and discuss how computer-science and\ninformation-theoretic concepts can inform goals of future neuroscience studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 23:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The key difficulty in those domains\nis that a positive reward signal becomes {\\em exponentially rare} as the\nminimal solution length increases. So, an RL approach loses its training\nsignal. There has been promising recent progress by using a curriculum-driven\nlearning approach that is designed to solve a single hard instance. We present\na novel {\\em automated} curriculum approach that dynamically selects from a\npool of unlabeled training instances of varying task complexity guided by our\n{\\em difficulty quantum momentum} strategy.

Our RL agent can\nsolve hard instances that are far out of reach for any previous\nstate-of-the-art Sokoban solver. In particular, our approach can uncover plans\nthat require hundreds of steps, while the best previous search methods would\ntake many years of computing time to solve such instances.

Based on the space of challenge-response pairs\n(CRPs), it has two categories:weak PUF and strong PUF. Though designing a\nreliable and secure lightweight strong PUF is challenging, there is continuing\nefforts to fulfill this gap due to wide range of applications enabled by strong\nPUF. It was prospected that the combination of MAX and MIN bit-wise operation\nis promising for improving the modeling resilience when MAX and MIN are\nemployed in the PUF recomposition. The main rationale lies on the fact that\neach bit-wise might be mainly vulnerable to one specific type of modeling\nattack, combining them can have an improved holistic resilience. This work is\nto first evaluate the main PUF performance, in particular,uniformity and\nreliability of the OR-AND-XOR-PUF(OAX-PUF)-(x, y, z)-OAX-PUF. Compared with the\nmost used l-XOR-PUF, the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF eventually exhibits better\nreliability given l=x+y+z without degrading the uniformity retaining to be 50%.\nWe further examine the modeling resilience of the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF with four\npowerful attacking strategies to date, which are Logistic Regression (LR)\nattack, reliability assisted CMA-ES attack, multilayer perceptron (MLP) attack,\nand the most recent hybrid LR-reliability attack.

However, it\nshows no notable modeling accuracy drop against other three attacks, though the\nattacking times have been greatly prolonged to LR and hybrid LR-reliability\nattacks. Overall, the OAX recomposition could be an alternative lightweight\nrecomposition method compared to XOR towards constructing strong PUFs if the\nunderlying PUF, e.g., FF-APUF, has exhibited improved resilience to modeling\nattack, because the OAX incurs smaller reliability degradation compared to XOR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 02:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 10:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 03:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Here we report the result of full simulations\nfor collisional evolution from dust to planets in a whole disk. Dust growth\nwith realistic porosity allows the formation of icy planetesimals in the inner\ndisk (> 10 au), while pebbles formed in the outer disk drift to the inner disk\nand there grow to planetesimals. The growth of those pebbles to planetesimals\nsuppresses their radial drift and supplies small planetesimals sustainably in\nthe vicinity of cores. This enables rapid formation of sufficiently massive\nplanetary cores within 0.2-0.4 million years, prior to the planetary migration.\nOur models shows first gas giants form at 2-7 au in rather common\nprotoplanetary disks, in agreement with the exoplanet and solar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 03:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

We suggest that the 16.1-MeV state is a possible candidate\nfor the $\\alpha$ condensed state predicted by the cluster-model calculations on\nthe basis of the good correspondence between the experimental and calculated\nlevel structures. However, the theoretical $IS1$ transition strength for this\nstate is significantly smaller than the measured value. Further experimental\ninformation is strongly desired to establish the $\\alpha$ condensed state in\n$^{13}$C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 06:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

In this study, we propose a method to replace a part of the\noracle's work in stream-based AL by self-training with weak labeling using a\nrobot arm. A camera attached to a robot arm takes a series of image data\nrelated to a streamed object, which should have the same label.

Fingerprint matching is a vital and challenging issue in\nfingerprint recognition systems. Most fingerprint matching algorithms are\nminutiae-based. The minutiae in fingerprints can be determined by their\ndiscontinuity. Ridge ending and ridge bifurcation are two frequently used\nminutiae in most fingerprint-based matching algorithms.\n  This paper presents a new minutiae-based fingerprint matching using the onion\npeeling approach. In the proposed method, fingerprints are aligned to find the\nmatched minutiae points. Then, the nested convex polygons of matched minutiae\npoints are constructed and the comparison between peer-to-peer polygons is\nperformed by the turning function distance. Simplicity, accuracy, and low time\ncomplexity of the Onion peeling approach are three important factors that make\nit a standard method for fingerprint matching purposes. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm is evaluated on the database $FVC2002$. The results show\nthat fingerprints of the same fingers have higher scores than different\nfingers.

Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and\napply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a\nrepresentation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic\ngraphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the\nrelevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem\nby combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e.,\nmulti-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention\nscores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have\nsome apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not\nexplicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop\nneighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand,\nranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and\nresult in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural\nNetworks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer\nnetwork to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop\nneighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the\nrelationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract\nhigh-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in\nGPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with\nheterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the\nclassification performance of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, analyses\nalso reveal the privilege of the proposed GPNN in filtering out irrelevant\nneighbors and reducing over-smoothing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 10:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 08:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Particularly, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable success in various molecular generation and prediction\ntasks. In cases where labeled data is scarce, GNNs can be pre-trained on\nunlabeled molecular data to first learn the general semantic and structural\ninformation before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, most existing\nself-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs only focus on node-level or\ngraph-level tasks. These approaches cannot capture the rich information in\nsubgraphs or graph motifs. For example, functional groups (frequently-occurred\nsubgraphs in molecular graphs) often carry indicative information about the\nmolecular properties. To bridge this gap, we propose Motif-based Graph\nSelf-supervised Learning (MGSSL) by introducing a novel self-supervised motif\ngeneration framework for GNNs. First, for motif extraction from molecular\ngraphs, we design a molecule fragmentation method that leverages a\nretrosynthesis-based algorithm BRICS and additional rules for controlling the\nsize of motif vocabulary. Second, we design a general motif-based generative\npre-training framework in which GNNs are asked to make topological and label\npredictions. This generative framework can be implemented in two different\nways, i.e., breadth-first or depth-first.

To further ensure that\nthe predicted shape and pose distributions match the visual evidence in the\ninput image, we implement a differentiable rejection sampler to impose a\nreprojection loss between ground-truth 2D joint coordinates and samples from\nthe predicted distributions, projected onto the image plane. We show that our\nmethod is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of 3D shape and pose\nmetrics on the SSP-3D and 3DPW datasets, while also yielding a structured\nprobability distribution over 3D body shape and pose, with which we can\nmeaningfully quantify prediction uncertainty and sample multiple plausible 3D\nreconstructions to explain a given input image.

To reduce these language biases, recent VQA works introduce an\nauxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of targeted VQA model,\nand achieve dominating performance on diagnostic benchmarks for\nout-of-distribution testing. However, due to complex model design, these\nensemble-based methods are unable to equip themselves with two indispensable\ncharacteristics of an ideal VQA model: 1) Visual-explainable: The model should\nrely on the right visual regions when making decisions. 2) Question-sensitive:\nThe model should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in questions. To\nthis end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing\nand Training (CSST) strategy. After training with CSST, VQA models are forced\nto focus on all critical objects and words, which significantly improves both\nvisual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities. Specifically, CSST is\ncomposed of two parts: Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) and\nCounterfactual Samples Training (CST). CSS generates counterfactual samples by\ncarefully masking critical objects in images or words in questions and\nassigning pseudo ground-truth answers. CST not only trains the VQA models with\nboth complementary samples to predict respective ground-truth answers, but also\nurges the VQA models to further distinguish the original samples and\nsuperficially similar counterfactual ones. To facilitate the CST training, we\npropose two variants of supervised contrastive loss for VQA, and design an\neffective positive and negative sample selection mechanism based on CSS.\nExtensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of CSST.

We show that ECE is a natural\nextension to multiple agents of Maximum Entropy optimality for single agents.\nWe solve both the \"forward\" and \"inverse\" problems for the multi-agent ECE\ngame. For the forward problem, we provide a Riccati algorithm to compute\nclosed-form ECE feedback policies for the agents, which are exact in the\nLinear-Quadratic-Gaussian case. We give an iterative variant to find locally\nECE feedback policies for the nonlinear case. For the inverse problem, we\npresent an algorithm to infer the cost functions of the multiple interacting\nagents given noisy, boundedly rational input and state trajectory examples from\nagents acting in an ECE. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated in\na simulated multi-agent collision avoidance scenario, and with data from the\nINTERACTION traffic dataset. In both cases, we show that, by taking into\naccount the agents' game theoretic interactions using our algorithm, a more\naccurate model of agents' costs can be learned, compared with standard inverse\noptimal control methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 15:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The prevailing spatiotemporal sequence prediction\nmethods apply ConvRNN structure which combines the Convolution and Recurrent\nneural network. Although improvements based on ConvRNN achieve remarkable\nsuccess, these methods ignore capturing both local and global spatial features\nsimultaneously, which degrades the nowcasting in the region of heavy rainfall.\nTo address this issue, we proposed the Region Attention Block (RAB) and embed\nit into ConvRNN to enhance the forecast in the area with strong rainfall.\nBesides, the ConvRNN models are hard to memory longer history representations\nwith limited parameters.

In this study, we use a novel class of neural\nnetworks, known as neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), to develop\ndata-driven material models that automatically satisfy polyconvexity of the\nstrain energy function with respect to the deformation gradient, a condition\nneeded for the existence of minimizers for boundary value problems in\nelasticity.

By considering a new event as a task, we design an actor-critic learning\nscheme to compute the optimal policy on estimating the viewers' high-bandwidth\nconnections. To ensure fast adaptation to new connections or changes among\nviewers during an event, we implement a prioritized replay memory buffer based\non the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the reward/throughput of the viewers'\nconnections.

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed model, with an average relative gain of 25% against\nstate-of-the-art strategies. For reproduction purposes, our evaluation datasets\nand implementation are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/stefanosantaris/melanie\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 14:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

However, closer\ninspection shows that the slopes are not truly straight, instead, more often\nthey have convex shapes, although with small convexity. Similar curvature is\nobserved on the sand dunes' surfaces. We derive equations together with\nexperiments on 10 types of granular materials to show that, in general, the\nslope of the granular heap is convex while the straight slope is a critical\nstate that rarely occurs. The angle of repose is allowed to vary within a\nnarrow range around a critical value. If the angle of repose is slightly\ngreater (smaller) than the critical value, the slope is convex (concave). The\nmodel also answers why the surfaces of granular heaps, including sand dunes,\nare more often convex rather than concave or straight, and advocate the\nsimultaneous estimation of the coefficient of friction on the grain and the\ntype of packing in the heap. The results might open new understandings related\nto granular material properties as well as sand transport and geological\nrecords in several deserts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 07:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}
