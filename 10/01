It is necessary\nto maximize the accuracy of clustering as the network structure changes, but\nalso to minimize the two consecutive clustering differences between the two\nresults. There is a trade-off relationship between these two objectives. In\nthis paper, we propose a Feature Transfer Based Multi-Objective Optimization\nGenetic Algorithm (TMOGA) based on transfer learning and traditional\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm framework. The main idea is to extract\nstable features from past community structures, retain valuable feature\ninformation, and integrate this feature information into current optimization\nprocesses to improve the evolutionary algorithms. Additionally, a new\ntheoretical framework is proposed in this paper to analyze community detection\nproblem based on information theory. Then, we exploit this framework to prove\nthe rationality of TMOGA.

We address this issue by modeling a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) for a simulated AV-pedestrian interaction at an unmarked\ncrosswalk. The AV's PCAM decision policy is learned through deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). Since modeling pedestrians realistically is challenging, we\ncompare two levels of intelligent pedestrian behavior.

Twelve\ndifferent alloys -- some of existing (heritage) type but also other\nnewly-designed ones -- are considered. A strong inter-dependence of alloy\ncomposition and processability is demonstrated. Stereological procedures are\ndeveloped to enable the two dominant defect types found -- solidification\ncracks and solid-state ductility dip cracks -- to be distinguished and\nquantified. Differential scanning calorimetry, creep stress relaxation tests at\n1000$^\\circ$C and measurements of tensile ductility at 800$^\\circ$C are used to\ninterpret the effects of alloy composition. A model for solid-state cracking is\nproposed, based on an incapacity to relax the thermal stress arising from\nconstrained differential thermal contraction; its development is supported by\nexperimental measurements using a constrained bar cooling test. A modified\nsolidification cracking criterion is proposed based upon solidification range\nbut including also a contribution from the stress relaxation effect.

To address the issue, we propose a novel\nmultitask learning network with a bending loss regularizer to separate\noverlapped nuclei accurately. The newly proposed multitask learning\narchitecture enhances the generalization by learning shared representation from\nthree tasks: instance segmentation, nuclei distance map prediction, and\noverlapped nuclei distance map prediction.

Minimizing the\nbending loss avoids generating contours that encompass multiple nuclei.

As the event progresses, two flare ribbons spread away from the\nmagnetic polarity inversion line. The width of the newly brightened front along\nthe extension of the ribbon is highly intermittent in both space and time,\npresumably reflecting non-uniformities in the structure and/or dynamics of the\nflare current sheet. Furthermore, the ribbon width grows most rapidly in\nregions exhibiting concentrated non-thermal HXR emission, with sharp increases\nslightly preceding the HXR bursts. The light curve of the ultraviolet emission\nmatches the HXR light curve at photon energies above 25 keV. In other regions\nthe ribbon-width evolution and light curves do not temporally correlate with\nthe HXR emission. This indicates that the production of non-thermal electrons\nis highly non-uniform within the flare current sheet. Our results suggest a\nstrong connection between the production of non-thermal electrons and the\nlocally enhanced perpendicular extent of flare ribbon fronts, which in turn\nreflects inhomogeneous structure and/or reconnection dynamics of the current\nsheet. Despite this variability, the ribbon fronts remain nearly continuous,\nquasi-one-dimensional features. Thus, although the reconnecting coronal current\nsheets are highly structured, they remain quasi-two-dimensional and the\nmagnetic energy release occurs systematically, rather than stochastically,\nthrough the volume of reconnecting magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 17:57:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 15:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

First, the brightness is significantly reduced at long\nsubmillimeter wavelengths compared to the brightness at the peak of the dust\nemission. Second, it is necessary to use a high-pass spatial filter to remove\natmospheric noise on large angular scales, which has the unwelcome by-product\nof also removing the galaxy's large-scale structure. We have developed a\ntechnique for producing high-resolution submillimeter images of galaxies of\nlarge angular size by using the telescope on the ground to determine the\nsmall-scale structure (the large Fourier components) and a space telescope\n(Herschel or Planck) to determine the large-scale structure (the small Fourier\ncomponents). Using this technique, we are carrying out the HARP and SCUBA-2\nHigh Resolution Terahertz Andromeda Galaxy Survey (HASHTAG), an international\nLarge Program on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, with one aim being to\nproduce the first high-fidelity high-resolution submillimeter images of\nAndromeda.

In\nthis paper, we re-examine these correlations, investigating the origin of the\nobserved scatter, and the ability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to\nexplore such relations in the early Universe. We defined a sample of about 800\nnormal star-forming galaxies with photometries in the range of 0.15 < $\\lambda$\n< 500 microns and analysed them with different spectral energy distribution\n(SED) fitting methods. With the SEDs extracted, we investigated the detection\nrate at different redshifts with the MId-Infrared instruments (MIRI) onboard\nthe JWST.

Recent studies have shown that\nat first order, the thickness of the coating film for monodisperse particles\ncan be captured by an effective capillary number based on the viscosity of the\nsuspension, providing that the film is thicker than the particle diameter.\nHowever, suspensions involved in most practical applications are polydisperse,\ncharacterized by a wide range of particle sizes, introducing additional length\nscales.

To improve the\ngeneralizability of trustworthiness predictors, we propose a novel steep slope\nloss to separate the features w.r.t. correct predictions from the ones w.r.t.\nincorrect predictions by two slide-like curves that oppose each other. The\nproposed loss is evaluated with two representative deep learning models, i.e.,\nVision Transformer and ResNet, as trustworthiness predictors. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments and analyses on ImageNet, which show that the\nproposed loss effectively improves the generalizability of trustworthiness\npredictors.

Through extensive experiments on\nreal-world data sets related to COVID-19, we show that the proposed\narchitecture is able to effectively model heterogeneous temporal data and\noutperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in the prediction task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 12:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

In particular, these two\nalgorithms reduce, replicate and amplify the representation of minorities in\ntop ranks when majorities are homophilic, neutral and heterophilic,\nrespectively. Moreover, when this representation is reduced, minorities may\nimprove their visibility in the rank by connecting strategically in the\nnetwork.

The\ndifficulties lie in computational complexity and how to learn the high-level\nideas behind reward functions. We study the graph-based Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) where the dynamics of neighboring agents are coupled. We use a reward\nmachine (RM) to encode each agent's task and expose reward function internal\nstructures. RM has the capacity to describe high-level knowledge and encode\nnon-Markovian reward functions. We propose a decentralized learning algorithm\nto tackle computational complexity, called decentralized graph-based\nreinforcement learning using reward machines (DGRM), that equips each agent\nwith a localized policy, allowing agents to make decisions independently, based\non the information available to the agents. DGRM uses the actor-critic\nstructure, and we introduce the tabular Q-function for discrete state problems.\nWe show that the dependency of Q-function on other agents decreases\nexponentially as the distance between them increases. Furthermore, the\ncomplexity of DGRM is related to the local information size of the largest\n$\\kappa$-hop neighborhood, and DGRM can find an\n$O(\\rho^{\\kappa+1})$-approximation of a stationary point of the objective\nfunction. To further improve efficiency, we also propose the deep DGRM\nalgorithm, using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function and policy\nfunction to solve large-scale or continuous state problems. The effectiveness\nof the proposed DGRM algorithm is evaluated by two case studies, UAV package\ndelivery and COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.

DGRM improves the global accumulated reward by 119% compared to\nthe baseline in the case of COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 21:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Within the context of a systematic\nanalysis of photometric signatures of GRB-associated SNe, we found an anomalous\nbump in the late-time transient following GRB 140506A.

We find robust evidence for a late-time bump/plateau\nfollowing the afterglow which shows evidence for a strong colour change, with\nthe spectral slope becoming flatter in the blue region of the spectrum. This\nbump can be interpreted as a luminous SN bump which is spectrally dissimilar to\ntypical GRB-SNe.

However,\nbecause networks are congested, both treatment and control traffic compete\nagainst each other for resources in a way that biases the outcome of these\ntests.

The\nlatter symmetry is not a property of standard quantum inflation, but may be a\nsymmetry of holographic models with causal quantum coherence on null surfaces.\nSince the variation of great-circle variance is dominated by the largest\nangular scale modes, in the latter case the amplitude and direction of the\nunobserved intrinsic dipole (that is, the $\\ell=1$ harmonics) can be estimated\nfrom measured $\\ell = 2, 3$ harmonics by minimizing the variance of\ngreat-circle variances including only $\\ell =1, 2, 3$ modes.

From multi-step relaxation experiments\nof distinct anatomical locations of porcine urinary bladder, we identify an\nanomalous relaxation character, with two power-law-like behaviors for\nshort/long long times, and nonlinearity for strains greater than 25%. The first\ncomponent of our framework is an existence study, to determine admissible\nfractional viscoelastic models that qualitatively describe the linear\nrelaxation behavior. After the linear viscoelastic model is selected, the\nsecond stage adds large-strain effects to the framework through a fractional\nquasi-linear viscoelastic approach, given by a multiplicative kernel\ndecomposition of the selected relaxation function and a nonlinear elastic\nresponse for the bio-tissue of interest. From single-relaxation data of the\nurinary bladder, a fractional Maxwell model captures both short/long-term\nbehaviors with two fractional orders, being the most suitable model for small\nstrains at the first stage. For the second stage, multi-step relaxation data\nunder large strains were employed to calibrate a four-parameter fractional\nquasi-linear viscoelastic model, that combines a Scott-Blair relaxation\nfunction and an exponential instantaneous stress response, to describe the\nelastin/collagen phases of bladder rheology. Our obtained results demonstrate\nthat the employed fractional quasi-linear model, with a single fractional order\nin the range $\\alpha = 0.25 - 0.30$, is suitable for the porcine urinary\nbladder, producing errors below 2% without need for recalibration over\nsubsequent applied strains.

Unlike a normal-chaos, statistical properties such as the probability\ndensity functions (PDF) of an ultra-chaos are sensitive to tiny disturbances.\nWe illustrate that ultra-chaos is widely existed and thus has general\nscientific meanings. It is found that statistical non-reproducibility is an\ninherent property of an ultra-chaos so that an ultra-chaos is at a higher-level\nof disorder than a normal-chaos. Thus, it is impossible in practice to\nreplicate experimental/numerical results of an ultra-chaos even in statistical\nmeanings, since random environmental noises always exist and are out of\ncontrol.

However, when these\ndistributions are unknown, the Kalman filter is not necessarily optimal and\nother simpler state-estimators, such as fixed-gain ({\\alpha}, {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}\nor {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}-{\\gamma} etc.) filters may be sufficient. When such filters\nare used as low-complexity state-estimators in embedded tracking systems, the\nfixed gain parameters are usually set equal to the steady-state gains of the\ncorresponding Kalman filter. An alternative procedure, that does not rely prior\ndistributions, based on Luenberger observers, is presented here. It is\nsuggested that the arbitrary placement of closed-loop state-observer poles is a\nsimple and intuitive way of tuning the transient and steady-state response of a\nfixed-gain tracking filter when prior distributions are unknown. All poles are\nplaced inside the unit circle on the positive real axis of the complex z-plane\nat p for a well damped response and a configurable bandwidth. Transient bias\nerrors, e.g. due to target manoeuvres or process modelling errors, decrease as\np=0 is approached for a wider bandwidth.

We provide examples of the effects\nof different experimental factors such as polarization, aberrations, and\nmisalignments of key optical elements. Finally, we present calculations of\ntoroidal foci through an interface of different mediums, and, to our knowledge,\nthe first calculations of toroidal foci generated in total internal reflection\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 01:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work\nthey do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid\ninvisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly\nwages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or\nmanaging payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd\nworkers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them\neconomically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to\nbe certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In\nthis paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd\nwork. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon\nMechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If\nwe ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly\nwage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of\ntheir time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to\n$2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers\ndepending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor\ncategory that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved\naround workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming\ninvisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly\nwatched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched\nfor labor.

To address this problem, recent offline RL methods attempt to\nintroduce conservatism bias to encourage learning in high-confidence areas.\nModel-free approaches directly encode such bias into policy or value function\nlearning using conservative regularizations or special network structures, but\ntheir constrained policy search limits the generalization beyond the offline\ndataset. Model-based approaches learn forward dynamics models with conservatism\nquantifications and then generate imaginary trajectories to extend the offline\ndatasets. However, due to limited samples in offline datasets, conservatism\nquantifications often suffer from overgeneralization in out-of-support regions.\nThe unreliable conservative measures will mislead forward model-based\nimaginations to undesired areas, leading to overaggressive behaviors. To\nencourage more conservatism, we propose a novel model-based offline RL\nframework, called Reverse Offline Model-based Imagination (ROMI). We learn a\nreverse dynamics model in conjunction with a novel reverse policy, which can\ngenerate rollouts leading to the target goal states within the offline dataset.\nThese reverse imaginations provide informed data augmentation for model-free\npolicy learning and enable conservative generalization beyond the offline\ndataset.

This\nresult is compatible with a recent experimental observation in Sb-doped MoS$_2$\nnanosheets grown by CVD.

Guided by this, the main theme of wireless system design up until 5G\nwas the data rate maximization. In his theory, the semantic aspect and meaning\nof messages were treated as largely irrelevant to communication. The classic\ntheory started to reveal its limitations in the modern era of machine\nintelligence, consisting of the synergy between IoT and AI. By broadening the\nscope of the classic framework, in this article we present a view of semantic\ncommunication (SemCom) and conveying meaning through the communication systems.\nWe address three communication modalities, human-to-human (H2H),\nhuman-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. The latter\ntwo, the main theme of the article, represent the paradigm shift in\ncommunication and computing. H2M SemCom refers to semantic techniques for\nconveying meanings understandable by both humans and machines so that they can\ninteract. M2M SemCom refers to effectiveness techniques for efficiently\nconnecting machines such that they can effectively execute a specific\ncomputation task in a wireless network. The first part of the article\nintroduces SemCom principles including encoding, system architecture, and\nlayer-coupling and end-to-end design approaches. The second part focuses on\nspecific techniques for application areas of H2M (human and AI symbiosis,\nrecommendation, etc.) and M2M SemCom (distributed learning, split inference,\netc.) Finally, we discuss the knowledge graphs approach for designing SemCom\nsystems. We believe that this comprehensive introduction will provide a useful\nguide into the emerging area of SemCom that is expected to play an important\nrole in 6G featuring connected intelligence and integrated sensing, computing,\ncommunication, and control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 03:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

One of the\nmost established schemes for unsupervised hashing is to reduce the\ndimensionality of data and then find a rigid (neighbourhood-preserving)\ntransformation that reduces the quantization error. Although employing rigid\ntransformations is effective, we may not reduce quantization loss to the\nultimate limits. As well, reducing dimensionality and quantization loss in two\nseparate steps seems to be sub-optimal. Motivated by these shortcomings, we\npropose to employ both rigid and non-rigid transformations to reduce\nquantization error and dimensionality simultaneously. We relax the\northogonality constraint on the projection in a PCA-formulation and regularize\nthis by a quantization term.

It is a crucial concept for robots to operate\nautonomously in uncontrolled environments. Existing approaches learn object\npermanence from low-level perception, but perform poorly on more complex\nscenarios, like when objects are contained and carried by others. Knowledge\nabout manipulation actions performed on an object prior to its disappearance\nallows us to reason about its location, e.g., that the object has been placed\nin a carrier. In this paper we argue that object permanence can be improved\nwhen the robot uses knowledge about executed actions and describe an approach\nto infer hidden object states from agent actions. We show that considering\nagent actions not only improves rule-based reasoning models but also purely\nneural approaches, showing its general applicability. Then, we conduct\nquantitative experiments on a snitch localization task using a dataset of 1,371\nsynthesized videos, where we compare the performance of different object\npermanence models with and without action annotations. We demonstrate that\nmodels with action annotations can significantly increase performance of both\nneural and rule-based approaches. Finally, we evaluate the usability of our\napproach in real-world applications by conducting qualitative experiments with\ntwo Universal Robots (UR5 and UR16e) in both lab and industrial settings. The\nrobots complete benchmark tasks for a gearbox assembly and demonstrate the\nobject permanence capabilities with real sensor data in an industrial\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 07:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

We systematically calculate\nthe graphene tetralayer (4L-BGM) and trilayer (3L-BGM) as the typical examples\nof the even-layer and odd-layer BGMs, respectively. In 4L-BGM, we find an\ninteresting phenomenon of electric field induced inversion of the\nspin-polarized bands. Namely, in the half metallic phase, the spin polarization\nof the conducting channel and the net magnetic moment are inversed when the\napplied electric field exceeds a critical value. In 3L-BGM, a remarkable\nfeature is that the inequivalence of the the two sublattices will intrinsically\nbreak the degeneracy of the the spin-up and spin-down bands even in the zero\nelectric field case.

Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used for HAR, both in\ncentralized and federated settings.

A particularly important example is the helium-mass degeneracy,\nwhere the uncertainties regarding the internal physics can cause a poor\ndetermination of both the mass and surface helium content. Accordingly, an\nindependent helium estimate is needed to overcome this degeneracy. A promising\nway to obtain such an estimate is to exploit the so-called ionisation glitch,\ni.e. a deviation from the asymptotic oscillation frequency pattern caused by\nthe rapid structural variation in the He ionisation zones.\n  Although progressively becoming more sophisticated, the glitch-based approach\nfaces problems inherent to its current modelling such as the need for\ncalibration by realistic stellar models. This requires a physical model of the\nionisation region explicitly involving the parameters of interest such as the\nsurface helium abundance, $Y_s$.\n  Through a thermodynamic treatment of the ionisation region, an analytical\napproximation for the first adiabatic exponent $\\Gamma_1$ is presented.\n  The induced stellar structure is found to depend on only three parameters\nincluding the surface helium abundance $Y_s$ and the electron degeneracy\n$\\psi_\\textrm{CZ}$ in the convective region.

In general, the CWT equation of\nmotion for the particle is non-linear, where the non-linearity enters via the\nCWT gauge fields. For Gaussian wave packets the analytic solutions of the CWT\nequations are in exact agreement with those from the density matrix formalism.\nWe show that CWT gauge terms that determine the dynamics of the particle's\nmarginal wave function are related to a Taylor series expansion of the\nparticle's reduced density matrix. Approximate solutions to these equations\nlead to a linear-time approximation that reproduces the ensemble width in the\nlimits of both short and long times, in addition to reproducing the long-term\nbehaviour of the coherence length. With this approximation, the non-linear\nequation of motion for the particle's marginal wave function can be written in\nthe form of the logarithmic Schr\\\"odinger equation.

Most\ncurrent methods align domains by either using image or instance-level feature\nalignment in an adversarial fashion. This often suffers due to the presence of\nunwanted background and as such lacks class-specific alignment. A common remedy\nto promote class-level alignment is to use high confidence predictions on the\nunlabelled domain as pseudo labels. These high confidence predictions are often\nfallacious since the model is poorly calibrated under domain shift. In this\npaper, we propose to leverage model predictive uncertainty to strike the right\nbalance between adversarial feature alignment and class-level alignment.\nSpecifically, we measure predictive uncertainty on class assignments and the\nbounding box predictions. Model predictions with low uncertainty are used to\ngenerate pseudo-labels for self-supervision, whereas the ones with higher\nuncertainty are used to generate tiles for an adversarial feature alignment\nstage. This synergy between tiling around the uncertain object regions and\ngenerating pseudo-labels from highly certain object regions allows us to\ncapture both the image and instance level context during the model adaptation\nstage.

While most existing services take a straight-forward approach\nof cloud hosting, on-path transit networks (such as ISPs) are increasingly more\ninterested in offering outsourced security services to end users. Recent\nproposals (such as SafeBricks and mbTLS) have made it possible to outsource\nsensitive security applications to untrusted, arbitrary networks, rendering\non-path security function outsourcing more promising than ever. However, to\nprovide on-path security function outsourcing, there is one crucial component\nthat is still missing -- a practical end-to-end network protocol. Thus, the\ndiscovery and orchestration of multiple capable and willing transit networks\nfor user-requested security functions have only been assumed in many studies\nwithout any practical solutions. In this work, we propose Opsec, an end-to-end\nsecurity-outsourcing protocol that fills this gap and brings us closer to the\nvision of on-path security function outsourcing. Opsec automatically discovers\none or more transit ISPs between a client and a server, and requests\nuser-specified security functions efficiently.

However, other studies have used\ndifferent factors. To investigate this problem, we consider the relation\nbetween wave amplitudes and the non-thermal line widths within a variety of 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.\n  Methods. We consider the following 3D numerical models: Alfv\\'en waves in a\nuniform magnetic field, transverse waves in a complex braided magnetic field,\nand two simulations of coronal heating in an arcade.

While such methods perform well on\nimages with small corrupted regions, it is challenging for these methods to\ndeal with images with large corrupted area due to two potential limitations: 1)\nsuch methods tend to overfit each single training pair of images relying solely\non the intra-image prior knowledge learned from the limited known area; 2) the\ninter-image prior knowledge about the general distribution patterns of visual\nsemantics, which can be transferred across images sharing similar semantics, is\nnot exploited. In this paper, we propose the Generative Memory-Guided Semantic\nReasoning Model (GM-SRM), which not only learns the intra-image priors from the\nknown regions, but also distills the inter-image reasoning priors to infer the\ncontent of the corrupted regions. In particular, the proposed GM-SRM first\npre-learns a generative memory from the whole training data to capture the\nsemantic distribution patterns in a global view. Then the learned memory are\nleveraged to retrieve the matching inter-image priors for the current corrupted\nimage to perform semantic reasoning during image inpainting. While the\nintra-image priors are used for guaranteeing the pixel-level content\nconsistency, the inter-image priors are favorable for performing high-level\nsemantic reasoning, which is particularly effective for inferring semantic\ncontent for large corrupted area. Extensive experiments on Paris Street View,\nCelebA-HQ, and Places2 benchmarks demonstrate that our GM-SRM outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods for image inpainting in terms of both the visual\nquality and quantitative metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 08:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 05:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Unfortunately, there exists very little\nliterature and tools for the manipulation of FS coefficients from discrete\nsamples. This paper introduces a Python library called pyFFS for efficient FS\ncoefficient computation, convolution, and interpolation. While the libraries\nSciPy and NumPy provide efficient functionality for discrete Fourier transform\ncoefficients via the FFT algorithm, pyFFS addresses the computation of FS\ncoefficients through what we call the fast Fourier series (FFS). Moreover,\npyFFS includes an FS interpolation method based on the chirp Z-transform that\ncan make it more than an order of magnitude faster than the SciPy equivalent\nwhen one wishes to perform interpolation. GPU support through the CuPy library\nallows for further acceleration, e.g. an order of magnitude faster for\ncomputing the 2-D FS coefficients of 1000 x 1000 samples and nearly two orders\nof magnitude faster for 2-D interpolation.

Carralero et al., Nucl. Fusion, 2021]. In order to\nconfirm the role of ITG turbulence in this process, we set out to establish\nexperimentally the relation between core density fluctuations, turbulent heat\nflux and global confinement. With this aim, we consider the scenarios found in\nthe previous work and carry out power balance analysis for a number of\nrepresentative ones, including some featuring high ion temperature. As well, we\nevaluate the global energy confinement time and discuss it in the context of\nthe ISS04 inter-stellarator scaling. We find that, when turbulence is\nsuppressed as a result of a reduction of $\\eta_i$, there is a reduction of ion\nturbulent transport, and global performance is improved as a result. This is\nconsistent with ITG turbulence limiting the ion temperature at the core of\nW7-X. In contrast, when turbulence is reduced following a decrease in\ncollisionality, no changes are observed in transport or confinement. This could\nbe explained by ITG modes being combined with TEM turbulence when the later is\ndestabilized at low collisionalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 09:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Whereas much\nwork over the years has been dedicated to specialised pruning techniques,\nlittle attention has been paid to the inherent effect of gradient based\ntraining on model sparsity. In this work, we introduce Powerpropagation, a new\nweight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse\nmodels. Exploiting the behaviour of gradient descent, our method gives rise to\nweight updates exhibiting a \"rich get richer\" dynamic, leaving low-magnitude\nparameters largely unaffected by learning. Models trained in this manner\nexhibit similar performance, but have a distribution with markedly higher\ndensity at zero, allowing more parameters to be pruned safely. Powerpropagation\nis general, intuitive, cheap and straight-forward to implement and can readily\nbe combined with various other techniques. To highlight its versatility, we\nexplore it in two very different settings: Firstly, following a recent line of\nwork, we investigate its effect on sparse training for resource-constrained\nsettings. Here, we combine Powerpropagation with a traditional weight-pruning\ntechnique as well as recent state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse algorithms,\nshowing superior performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Secondly, we advocate\nthe use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed\nrepresentations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model\ncapacity. In all cases our reparameterisation considerably increases the\nefficacy of the off-the-shelf methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 10:03:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 13:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

We use relativistic mean field (RMF) models to\ndescribe the nuclear matter at low densities and zero temperature. The\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is used to describe the quark matter at high\ndensities and zero temperature. A Gibbs construct is used to describe the\nhadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) at large densities. Within the model, as\nthe density increases, a mixed phase (MP) appears at density about $2.5$ times\nthe nuclear matter saturation density $(\\rho_0)$ and ends at density about $5\n\\rho_0$ beyond which the pure quark matter phase appears. It turns out that a\nstable HS of maximum mass, $M=2.27 M_{\\odot}$ with radius $R=14$ km (for NL3\nparameterisation of nuclear RMF model), can exist with the quark matter in the\ncore in a MP only. HQPT in the core of maximum mass HS occurs at radial\ndistance, $r_c=0.27R$ where the equilibrium speed of sound shows a\ndiscontinuity. Existence of quark matter in the core enhances the non-radial\noscillation frequencies in HSs compared to NSs of the same mass. This\nenhancement is significantly large for the $g$ modes. Such an enhancement of\nthe $g$ modes is also seen for a density dependent Bayesian (DDB)\nparmeterisation of the nucleonic EOS. The non-radial oscillation frequencies\ndepend on the vector coupling in the NJL model.

In this paper, we propose a novel consensus-aware dynamic\nconvolution model to explicitly and effectively perform the \"summarize and\nsearch\" process. To summarize consensus image features, we first summarize\nrobust features for every single image using an effective pooling method and\nthen aggregate cross-image consensus cues via the self-attention mechanism.

Two kinds of kernels are generated in a supplementary way\nto summarize fine-grained image-specific consensus object cues and the coarse\ngroup-wise common knowledge, respectively. Then, we can effectively perform\nobject searching by employing dynamic convolution at multiple scales. Besides,\na novel and effective data synthesis method is also proposed to train our\nnetwork.

Unlike existing solutions that directly operate over\noriginal PDEs, BINet learns to solve, as a proxy, associated boundary integral\nequations using neural networks. The benefits are three-fold. Firstly, only the\nboundary conditions need to be fitted since the PDE can be automatically\nsatisfied with single or double layer representations according to the\npotential theory. Secondly, the dimension of the boundary integral equations is\ntypically smaller, and as such, the sample complexity can be reduced\nsignificantly. Lastly, in the proposed method, all differential operators of\nthe original PDEs have been removed, hence the numerical efficiency and\nstability are improved. Adopting neural tangent kernel (NTK) techniques, we\nprovide proof of the convergence of BINets in the limit that the width of the\nneural network goes to infinity. Extensive numerical experiments show that,\nwithout calculating high-order derivatives, BINet is much easier to train and\nusually gives more accurate solutions, especially in the cases that the\nboundary conditions are not smooth enough.

We further include an attention module such that the\ntemporal significance of the interaction can be learned, which enhances the\ntemporal alignment of the active-reactive motion pair. Second, as the reactive\nmotion of different types of interactions can be significantly different, we\nintroduce a discriminator that not only tells if the generated movement is\nrealistic or not, but also tells the class label of the interaction.

However, the UV transmission of\nthe natural waters in which origins-of-life chemistry (prebiotic chemistry) is\npostulated to have occurred is poorly constrained. In this work, we combine\nlaboratory and literature-derived absorption spectra of potential aqueous-phase\nprebiotic UV absorbers with literature estimates of their concentrations on\nearly Earth to constrain the prebiotic UV environment in marine and terrestrial\nnatural waters, and consider the implications for prebiotic chemistry. We find\nthat prebiotic freshwaters were largely transparent in the UV, contrary to\nassumptions by some models of prebiotic chemistry. Some waters, e.g.,\nhigh-salinity waters like carbonate lakes, may be deficient in shortwave\n($\\leq220$ nm) UV flux. More dramatically, ferrous waters can be strongly\nUV-shielded, particularly if the Fe$^{2+}$ forms highly UV-absorbent species\nlike Fe(CN)$_6^{4-}$. Such waters may be compelling venues for UV-averse\norigin-of-life scenarios, but are disfavorable for some UV-dependent prebiotic\nchemistries. UV light can trigger photochemistry even if attenuated through\nphotochemical transformations of the absorber (e.g., $e^{-}_{aq}$ production\nfrom halide irradiation), which may have both constructive and destructive\neffects for prebiotic syntheses. Prebiotic chemistries invoking waters\ncontaining such absorbers must self-consistently account for the chemical\neffects of these transformations. The speciation and abundance of Fe$^{2+}$ in\nnatural waters on early Earth is a major uncertainty, and should be prioritized\nfor further investigation as it plays a major role in UV transmission in\nprebiotic natural waters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 14:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Hydrogen permeation through\nruthenium is problematic as it leads to blisters on the mirrors. H has been\nshown to exhibit low solubility in bulk Ru, and rapidly diffuses in and out of\nRu. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of the blistering effect remains\nunknown. This work makes use of reactive molecular dynamics simulations to\nstudy the influence of imperfections in a Ru film on the behaviour of H. For\nthe Ru/H system, a ReaxFF force field was parametrised which reproduces\nstructures and energies obtained from quantum-mechanical calculations.\nMolecular dynamics simulations have been performed with the newly-developed\nforce field, to study the effect of tilt and twist grain boundaries on the\noverall diffusion behaviour of H in Ru. Our simulations show the tilt and twist\ngrain boundaries provide energetically favourable sites for hydrogen atoms and\nact as sinks and highways for H. They therefore block H transport across their\nplanes, and favour diffusion along their planes. This results in the\naccumulation of hydrogen at the grain boundaries. The strong effect of the\ngrain boundaries on the hydrogen diffusion suggests tailoring the morphology of\nruthenium thin films as a means to curb the rate of hydrogen permeation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 14:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

For the latter, we employ recent\ncalculations based on Hamiltonians constructed using Chiral Effective Field\ntheory. Fits to experimental nuclear masses are employed to constrain the CLDM\nfurther, and we find that they disfavor some of the Chiral Hamiltonians. The\nCLDM allows us to study the complex interplay between bulk, surface, curvature,\nand Coulomb contributions, and their impact on the NS crust. It also reveals\nhow the curvature energy alters the correlation between the surface energy and\nthe bulk symmetry energy. Our analysis quantifies how the uncertainties\nassociated with the EOS of homogeneous matter implies significant uncertainties\nfor the composition of the crust, its proton fraction, and the volume fraction\noccupied by nuclei.

The most significant\nuncertainties associated with matter properties in the densest regions of the\ncrust, the precise location of the crust-core transition, are found to be\nstrongly correlated with uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonians.

We generate stochastic stellar populations for\ngalaxy patches with star formation rates varying over a factor of $1000$,\ncompute the nebular emission that results when these stars ionise gas at a wide\nrange of densities, metallicities, and determine how much inferred\nmetallicities vary with fluctuations in the driving stellar spectrum.

The basic idea is to first map the\nmetric-space valued random object $Y$ to a real-valued random variable $f(Y)$\nusing a class of functions, and then perform classical SDR to the transformed\ndata. If the class of functions is sufficiently rich, then we are guaranteed to\nuncover the Fr\\'echet SDR space. We showed that such a class, which we call an\nensemble, can be generated by a universal kernel. We established the\nconsistency and asymptotic convergence rate of the proposed methods. The\nfinite-sample performance of the proposed methods is illustrated through\nsimulation studies for several commonly encountered metric spaces that include\nWasserstein space, the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, and the\nsphere. We illustrated the data visualization aspect of our method by exploring\nthe human mortality distribution data across countries and by studying the\ndistribution of hematoma density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 15:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 20:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

The present paper focuses on\nthe first step of DM, which consists in characterizing the state of the driver.\nSince DM will be increasingly linked to driving automation (DA), this paper\npresents a clear view of the role of DM at each of the six SAE levels of DA.\nThis paper surveys the state of the art of DM, and then synthesizes it,\nproviding a unique, structured, polychotomous view of the many characterization\ntechniques of DM.

Additionally, on natural image datasets, previous\nresults have suggested a trade-off between the likelihood of the data and\nclassification accuracy.

Robots diving down to great depths must bring light sources that\ncreate moving illumination patterns in the darkness, such that the same 3D\npoint appears with different color in each image. On top, scattering and\nattenuation of light in the water makes images appear foggy and typically\nblueish, the degradation depending on each pixel's distance to its observed\nseafloor patch, on the local composition of the water and the relative poses\nand cones of the light sources. Consequently, visual mapping, including image\nmatching and surface albedo estimation, severely suffers from the effects that\nco-moving light sources produce, and larger mosaic maps from photos are often\ndominated by lighting effects that obscure the actual seafloor structure. In\nthis contribution a practical approach to estimating and compensating these\nlighting effects on predominantly homogeneous, flat seafloor regions, as can be\nfound in the Abyssal plains of our oceans, is presented. The method is\nessentially parameter-free and intended as a preprocessing step to facilitate\nvisual mapping, but already produces convincing lighting artefact compensation\nup to a global white balance factor. It does not require to be trained\nbeforehand on huge sets of annotated images, which are not available for the\ndeep sea.

Accurate identification\nof anomalous samples is crucial for the success of downstream data analysis\ntasks. To automatically identify anomalies, we propose Probabilistic Robust\nAutoEncoder (PRAE). PRAE aims to simultaneously remove outliers and identify a\nlow-dimensional representation for the inlier samples. We first present the\nRobust AutoEncoder (RAE) objective as a minimization problem for splitting the\ndata into inliers and outliers. Our objective is designed to exclude outliers\nwhile including a subset of samples (inliers) that can be effectively\nreconstructed using an AutoEncoder (AE). RAE minimizes the autoencoder's\nreconstruction error while incorporating as many samples as possible. This\ncould be formulated via regularization by subtracting an $\\ell_0$ norm counting\nthe number of selected samples from the reconstruction term. Unfortunately,\nthis leads to an intractable combinatorial problem. Therefore, we propose two\nprobabilistic relaxations of RAE, which are differentiable and alleviate the\nneed for a combinatorial search. We prove that the solution to the PRAE problem\nis equivalent to the solution of RAE.

Numerical models were then developed to simulate\ntheir crush behavior, and the simulation dataset was used for data mining. The\nresults showed that (1) Filling the BBC-Z lattice structure into a thin-walled\ntube can significantly improve the energy absorption (EA) capacity of the\nstructure. (2) The decision trees generated in the data mining process\nindicated that the rod diameter d of lattice structure is the key design\nvariable that has most significant impact on EA, followed by m and n. (3) The\ndesign rules to build LFTs with high EA efficiency (SEA>=16 kJ/kg and\nCFE>=45%), high total EA (SEA>=16 kJ/kg and EA>=6 kJ), and lightweight (SEA>=16\nkJ/kg and Mass<=0.45 kg) were obtained from decision trees. The ideal\nconfigurations of LFT corresponding to these three objectives are: d>2 mm, n>2\nand m>3 for high EA efficiency; d>2 mm, n>2 and m>3 for high total EA; and d>2\nmm, n>2, m<=4 and t<=1.7 mm for lightweight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 13:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The analysis of the exact parametric solution of the\ndeterministic SIR model shows that the fixed points ($g^*$) depend on the SIR\nparameters, where, if $g^*\\langle\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta x_0}$ then $g^*$ is stable\nand the pandemic can be controlled, whereas, if $g^*\\rangle\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta\nx_0}$ then $g^*$ is unstable indicating active pandemic state, and $g^*=0$\ncorresponds to an endemic state.

This is an expected outcome as recent studies have demonstrated\nthat the learning performance of CNNs is limited due to their strictly\nhomogenous configuration with the sole linear neuron model. This has been\naddressed by Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) with their heterogenous network\nconfiguration encapsulating neurons with various non-linear operators. In this\nstudy, to further boost the peak detection performance along with an elegant\ncomputational efficiency, we propose 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural\nNetworks (Self-ONNs) with generative neurons. The most crucial advantage of 1D\nSelf-ONNs over the ONNs is their self-organization capability that voids the\nneed to search for the best operator set per neuron since each generative\nneuron has the ability to create the optimal operator during training. The\nexperimental results over the China Physiological Signal Challenge-2020 (CPSC)\ndataset with more than one million ECG beats show that the proposed 1D\nSelf-ONNs can significantly surpass the state-of-the-art deep CNN with less\ncomputational complexity. Results demonstrate that the proposed solution\nachieves 99.10% F1-score, 99.79% sensitivity, and 98.42% positive predictivity\nin the CPSC dataset which is the best R-peak detection performance ever\nachieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 19:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

As the maximal velocity of the shear flow (equivalently the maximal\namplitude of the wind forcing) exceeds a critical threshold, the zonal jet\ndestabilizes due to baroclinic instability and we numerically demonstrate that\na first transition occurs. We obtain reduced equations of the system using the\nformalism of dynamic transition theory and establish two scenarios which\ncompletely describe this first transition. The generic scenario is that two\nmodes become critical and a Hopf bifurcation occurs as a result. Under an\nappropriate set of parameters describing midlatitude oceanic flows, we show\nthat this first transition is continuous: a supercritical Hopf bifurcation\noccurs and a stable time periodic solution bifurcates. We also investigate the\ncase of double Hopf bifurcations which occur when four modes of the linear\nstability problem simultaneously destabilize the zonal jet. In this case we\nprove that, in the relevant parameter regime, the flow exhibits a continuous\ntransition accompanied by a bifurcated attractor homeomorphic to $S^3$.
