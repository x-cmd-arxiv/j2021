While there are\nmethods to detect closed eyes, it is a non-trivial task to detect the gradual\nprocess of a driver becoming drowsy. We consider a simple real-time detection\nsystem for drowsiness merely based on the eye blinking rate derived from the\neye aspect ratio. For the eye detection we use HOG and a linear SVM. If the\nspeed of the eye blinking drops below some empirically determined threshold,\nthe system triggers an alarm, hence preventing the driver from falling into\nmicrosleep. In this paper, we extensively evaluate the minimal requirements for\nthe proposed system. We find that this system works well if the face is\ndirected to the camera, but it becomes less reliable once the head is tilted\nsignificantly. The results of our evaluations provide the foundation for\nfurther developments of our drowsiness detection system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

One\ncomplication in this learning task is that some users are more likely to\npurchase products or review them, and some products are more likely to be\npurchased or reviewed by the users. This non-uniform pattern degrades the power\nof many existing recommendation algorithms, as they assume that the observed\ndata are sampled uniformly at random among user-product pairs.

The absolute rotational and translational entropy of the\nsystems, measured using two-phase thermodynamic model, also substantiate the\ngel transition. The slowing down of the dynamics upon approaching the\ntransition temperature from a high temperature, demonstrating the phase\ntransition to the gel phase. The detailed numerical simulation study of the\nmorphology, dynamics and thermodynamics of DNA gelation can provide guidance\nfor future experiments, easily extensible to other polymeric systems, and has\nremarkable implications in the DNA nanotechnology field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

In\nthis paper we illustrate the possible types of observations to give prospective\nusers a better understanding of the science capabilities of SPICE. The paper\ndiscusses the first observations of the Sun on different targets and presents\nan example of the full spectra from the quiet Sun, identifying over 40 spectral\nlines from neutral hydrogen and ions of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, neon,\nsulphur, magnesium, and iron. These lines cover the temperature range between\n20,000 K and 1 million K (10MK in flares), providing slices of the Sun's\natmosphere in narrow temperature intervals. We provide a list of count rates\nfor the 23 brightest spectral lines. We show examples of raster images of the\nquiet Sun in several strong transition region lines, where we have found\nunusually bright, compact structures in the quiet Sun network, with extreme\nintensities up to 25 times greater than the average intensity across the image.\nThe lifetimes of these structures can exceed 2.5 hours. We identify them as a\ntransition region signature of coronal bright points and compare their areas\nand intensity enhancements. We also show the first above-limb measurements with\nSPICE above the polar limb in C III, O VI, and Ne VIII lines, and far off limb\nmeasurements in the equatorial plane in Mg IX, Ne VIII, and O VI lines.

The quantitative analysis of the\nstellar atmosphere based on a hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\napproach and new optical spectra yields an effective temperature of\n22000$\\pm$500K, a logarithmic surface gravity of 4.20$\\pm$0.10, and a surface\nhelium fraction of 0.950$\\pm$0.002 by number. While the metal abundances are\nabout a factor of 10 sub-solar in absolute number, the metal-to-hydrogen ratios\nare typical of massive early-type stars, indicating that helium fallback in a\nweak, fractionated stellar wind in the presence of a magnetic field took place\n-- the canonical mechanism for the formation of the helium-strong phenomenon.\nBoth the spectroscopic and the Gaia EDR3 parallax imply HD144941 to be a\nluminous massive star. Kinematically, we argue that HD144941 has reached its\nhigh Galactic latitude as a runaway star. We conclude that instead of being a\ncomparatively high-gravity low-mass EHe star, HD144941 is by far the most\nextreme member of the magnetic massive helium-strong stars, with almost all\natmospheric hydrogen substituted by helium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

A commonly\nstudied statistic in these models is the so-called hitting probability for each\ntarget, which is the probability that a given single searcher finds that\nparticular target. However, the decisive event in many systems is not the\narrival of a given single searcher to a target, but rather the arrival of the\nfastest searcher to a target out of many searchers. In this paper, we study the\nprobability that the fastest diffusive searcher hits a given target in the many\nsearcher limit, which we call the extreme hitting probability. We first prove\nan upper bound for the decay of the probability that the searcher finds a\ntarget other than the closest target. This upper bound applies in very general\nsettings and depends only on the relative distances to the targets.\nFurthermore, we find the exact asymptotics of the extreme hitting probabilities\nin terms of the short-time distribution of when a single searcher hits a\ntarget. These results show that the fastest searcher always hits the closest\ntarget in the many searcher limit. While this fact is intuitive in light of\nrecent results on the time it takes the fastest searcher to find a target, our\nresults give rigorous, quantitative estimates for the extreme hitting\nprobabilities.

In MeNToS, after creating tracklets using\ninstance segmentation and optical flow, the proposed method relies on a\nspace-time memory network originally developed for one-shot video object\nsegmentation to improve the association of sequence of detections (tracklets)\nwith temporal gaps. We evaluate our tracker on KITTIMOTS and MOTSChallenge and\nwe show the benefit of our data association strategy with the HOTA metric.\nAdditional ablation studies demonstrate that our approach using a space-time\nmemory network gives better and more robust long-term association than those\nbased on a re-identification network.

However, the underlying hardware security\nvulnerabilities of embedded NN implementations remain unaddressed. In\nparticular, embedded DNN implementations are vulnerable to Side-Channel\nAnalysis (SCA) attacks, which are especially important in the IoT and edge\ncomputing contexts where an attacker can usually gain physical access to the\ntargeted device. A research field has therefore emerged and is rapidly growing\nin terms of the use of SCA including timing, electromagnetic attacks and power\nattacks to target NN embedded implementations.

To enable easy post-hoc editing at scale, we\npropose Model Editor Networks using Gradient Decomposition (MEND), a collection\nof small auxiliary editing networks that use a single desired input-output pair\nto make fast, local edits to a pre-trained model's behavior.

Our\napproach remembers old tasks by projecting the representations of new tasks\nclose to that of old tasks while keeping the decision boundaries unchanged. We\nemploy the center loss as a regularization penalty that enforces new tasks'\nfeatures to have the same class centers as old tasks and makes the features\nhighly discriminative. This, in turn, leads to the least forgetting of already\nlearned information. This method is easy to implement, requires minimal\ncomputational and memory overhead, and allows the neural network to maintain\nhigh performance across many sequentially encountered tasks.

In this paper, we quantify such simulation algorithms by a property\ncalled fully-coherent: the algorithm succeeds with arbitrarily high success\nprobability $1-\\delta$, while only requiring a single copy of the initial\nstate. We subsequently develop fully-coherent simulation algorithms based on\nquantum signal processing (QSP), including a novel algorithm that circumvents\nthe use of amplitude amplification while also achieving a query complexity\nadditive in time $t$, $\\ln(1/\\delta)$, and $\\ln(1/\\epsilon)$ for error\ntolerance $\\epsilon$: $\\Theta\\big( \\|\\mathcal{H}\\| |t| + \\ln(1/\\epsilon) +\n\\ln(1/\\delta)\\big)$.

In this\nsurvey, we first present a unified framework called generalized OOD detection,\nwhich encompasses the five aforementioned problems, i.e., AD, ND, OSR, OOD\ndetection, and OD. Under our framework, these five problems can be seen as\nspecial cases or sub-tasks, and are easier to distinguish. We then review each\nof these five areas by summarizing their recent technical developments, with a\nspecial focus on OOD detection methodologies. We conclude this survey with open\nchallenges and potential research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 10:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

In\nthis work, we use the Auriga simulations to probe the impact of AGN feedback on\nthe dynamical and structural properties of galaxies, focussing on the bar,\nbulge, and disc. We analyse three galaxies -- two strongly and one\nunbarred/weakly barred -- using three setups: (i) the fiducial Auriga model,\nwhich includes both radio and quasar mode feedback, (ii) a setup with no radio\nmode, and (iii) one with neither the radio nor the quasar mode. When removing\nthe radio mode, gas in the circumgalactic medium cools more efficiently and\nsubsequently settles in an extended disc, with little effect on the inner disc.\nContrary to previous studies, we find that although the removal of the quasar\nmode results in more massive central components, these are in the form of\ncompact discs, rather than spheroidal bulges. Therefore, galaxies without\nquasar mode feedback are more baryon-dominated and thus prone to forming\nstronger and shorter bars, which reveals an anti-correlation between the\nejective nature of AGN feedback and bar strength. Hence, we report that the\neffect of AGN feedback (i.e. ejective or preventive) can significantly alter\nthe dynamical properties of MW-like galaxies.

Here we analyze the luminous stars near the Vela\npulsar and SNR to find that its progenitor was probably (>90%) low mass\n(8.1-10.3Msun). The presence of the O star gamma2 Vel a little over 100 pc from\nVela is the primary ambiguity, as including it in the analysis volume\nsignificantly increases the probability (to 5%) of higher mass (>20Msun)\nprogenitors. However, to be a high mass star associated with gamma2 Vel's star\ncluster at birth, the progenitor would have to a runaway star from an unbound\nbinary with an unusually high velocity. The primary impediment to analyzing\nlarge numbers of Galactic SNRs in this manner is the lack of accurate\ndistances. This can likely be solved by searching for absorption lines from the\nSNR in stars as a function of distance, a method which yielded a distance to\nVela in agreement with the direct pulsar parallax. If Vela was a 10Msun\nsupernova in an external galaxy, the 50 pc search region used in extragalactic\nstudies would contain only ~10% of the stars formed in a 50~pc region around\nthe progenitor at birth and ~90% of the stars in the search region would have\nbeen elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The star, dubbed M51-DS1, was found as\npart of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) search for failed supernovae (SNe). The\nsupergiant, which is plausibly associated with a very young ($\\lesssim6$ Myr)\nstellar population, showed clear variability (amplitude $\\Delta\nF814W\\approx0.7$ mag) in numerous HST images obtained between 1995 and 2016,\nbefore suddenly dimming by $>$2 mag in $F814W$ sometime between late 2017 and\nmid-2019. In follow-up data from 2021, the star rebrightened, ruling out a\nfailed supernova.

This paradigm is limited when data from different sources cannot be\nshared due to privacy concerns. To resolve this problem, two recent works have\nintroduced decentralised (federated) Re-ID learning for constructing a globally\ngeneralised model (server)without any direct access to local training data nor\nshared data across different source domains (clients). However, these methods\nare poor on how to adapt the generalised model to maximise its performance on\nindividual client domain Re-ID tasks having different Re-ID label spaces, due\nto a lack of understanding of data heterogeneity across domains. We call this\npoor 'model personalisation'. In this work, we present a new Selective\nKnowledge Aggregation approach to decentralised person Re-ID to optimise the\ntrade-off between model personalisation and generalisation. Specifically, we\nincorporate attentive normalisation into the normalisation layers in a deep\nReID model and propose to learn local normalisation layers specific to each\ndomain, which are decoupled from the global model aggregation in federated\nRe-ID learning. This helps to preserve model personalisation knowledge on each\nlocal client domain and learn instance-specific information.

The classical\nmultidimensional scaling (cMDS) algorithm is a widespread method to do this.\nHowever, theoretical analysis of the robustness of the algorithm and an\nin-depth analysis of its performance on non-Euclidean metrics is lacking.\n  In this paper, we derive a formula, based on the eigenvalues of a matrix\nobtained from $D$, for the Frobenius norm of the difference between $D$ and the\nmetric $D_{\\text{cmds}}$ returned by cMDS. This error analysis leads us to the\nconclusion that when the derived matrix has a significant number of negative\neigenvalues, then $\\|D-D_{\\text{cmds}}\\|_F$, after initially decreasing, will\neventually increase as we increase the dimension. Hence, counterintuitively,\nthe quality of the embedding degrades as we increase the dimension.

In order to cope with such settings, we propose\na novel learning framework, Ensembled Transferred Embeddings (ETE), which\nrelies on two key ideas: 1) labeling a relatively small sample of the target\ndataset, in a semi-automatic process, and 2) leveraging other datasets from\nrelated domains or related tasks that are large-scale and labeled, to extract\n\"transferable embeddings\". Evaluation of ETE on a large-scale real-world\ndataset provided to us by PayPal, shows that it significantly outperforms\ntraditional as well as state-of-the-art item categorization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 18:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

High\nperformance computing systems are pushing the frontiers of performance with a\nrich diversity of hardware resources and massive scale-out capabilities. There\nis a critical need to understand fair and effective benchmarking of machine\nlearning applications that are representative of real-world scientific use\ncases. MLPerf is a community-driven standard to benchmark machine learning\nworkloads, focusing on end-to-end performance metrics. In this paper, we\nintroduce MLPerf HPC, a benchmark suite of large-scale scientific machine\nlearning training applications driven by the MLCommons Association. We present\nthe results from the first submission round, including a diverse set of some of\nthe world's largest HPC systems. We develop a systematic framework for their\njoint analysis and compare them in terms of data staging, algorithmic\nconvergence, and compute performance. As a result, we gain a quantitative\nunderstanding of optimizations on different subsystems such as staging and\non-node loading of data, compute-unit utilization, and communication\nscheduling, enabling overall $>10 \\times$ (end-to-end) performance improvements\nthrough system scaling. Notably, our analysis shows a scale-dependent interplay\nbetween the dataset size, a system's memory hierarchy, and training convergence\nthat underlines the importance of near-compute storage. To overcome the\ndata-parallel scalability challenge at large batch sizes, we discuss specific\nlearning techniques and hybrid data-and-model parallelism that are effective on\nlarge systems. We conclude by characterizing each benchmark with respect to\nlow-level memory, I/O, and network behavior to parameterize extended roofline\nperformance models in future rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 20:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

However, a challenge with measuring the effects of\nrecommender systems is how to compare user outcomes under these systems to\noutcomes under a credible counterfactual world without such systems. We take a\nmodel-based approach to this challenge, introducing a dichotomy of process\nmodels that we can compare: (1) a \"recommender\" model describing a generic\nitem-matching process under a personalized recommender system and (2) an\n\"organic\" model describing a baseline counterfactual where users search for\nitems without the mediation of any system. Our key finding is that the\nrecommender and organic models result in dramatically different outcomes at\nboth the individual and societal level, as supported by theorems and simulation\nexperiments with real data. The two process models also induce different\ntrade-offs during inference, where standard performance-improving techniques\nsuch as regularization/shrinkage have divergent effects. Shrinkage improves the\nmean squared error of matches in both settings, as expected, but at the cost of\nless diverse (less radical) items chosen in the recommender model but more\ndiverse (more radical) items chosen in the organic model. These findings\nprovide a formal language for how recommender systems may be fundamentally\naltering how we search for and interact with content, in a world increasingly\nmediated by such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 20:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

We present here a\nfirst attempt to measure $\\lambda$ starting from the dynamically distinct\nstellar components identified in high-resolution cosmological simulations with\nGalactic Structure Finder. In a subsample of NIHAO galaxies, we find tight\ncorrelations between the total angular momentum (AM) of the DM halos, $J_h$,\nand the azimuthal AM, $J_z$, of the stellar components of the form:\nlog($J_h$)=$\\alpha$+$\\beta\\cdot$log($J_z$). The stellar halos have the tightest\nrelation with $\\alpha=9.50\\pm0.42$ and $\\beta=0.46\\pm0.04$. The other tight\nrelation is with the disks: $\\alpha=6.15\\pm0.92$ and $\\beta=0.68\\pm0.07$. We\nused Gaia DR2 and APOGEE to generate a combined kinematics-abundance space,\nwhere the Galaxy's thin and thick stellar disks stars can be neatly separated\nand their rotational velocity profiles, $v_{\\phi}(R)$, can be computed.

Many state-of-the-art\nloop closure detection (LCD) algorithms use visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW), which\nis robust against partial occlusions in a scene but cannot perceive the\nsemantics or spatial relationships between feature points. CNN object\nextraction can address those issues, by providing semantic labels and spatial\nrelationships between objects in a scene. Previous work has mainly focused on\nreplacing vBoW with CNN-derived features.

When used in tandem, the added elements\nof object semantics and spatial-awareness create a more robust and symbiotic\nloop closure detection system. The proposed SymbioLCD uses scale-invariant\nspatial and semantic matching, Hausdorff distance with temporal constraints,\nand a Random Forest that utilizes combined information from both CNN-extracted\nobjects and vBoW features for predicting accurate loop closure candidates.\nEvaluation of the proposed method shows it outperforms other Machine Learning\n(ML) algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree and Neural Network, and\ndemonstrates that there is a strong symbiosis between CNN-extracted object\ninformation and vBoW features which assists accurate LCD candidate prediction.\nFurthermore, it is able to perceive loop closure candidates earlier than\nstate-of-the-art SLAM algorithms, utilizing added spatial and semantic\ninformation from CNN-extracted objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 21:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

A large body\nof research focuses on finding new materials optimized for brighter, faster,\nand more controlled scintillation. Here, we develop a fundamentally different\napproach based on integrating nanophotonic structures into scintillators to\nenhance their emission. To start, we develop a unified and ab initio theory of\nnanophotonic scintillators that accounts for the key aspects of scintillation:\nthe energy loss by high-energy particles, as well as the light emission by\nnon-equilibrium electrons in arbitrary nanostructured optical systems. This\ntheoretical framework allows us, for the first time, to experimentally\ndemonstrate nearly an order-of-magnitude enhancement of scintillation, in both\nelectron-induced, and X-ray-induced scintillation. Our theory also allows the\ndiscovery of structures that could eventually achieve several\norders-of-magnitude scintillation enhancement.

In\nthis paper, we first study the impact of inter-area oscillations on the system\nrate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF) security; then, the limitations on\nlocational RoCoFs accounting for G-1 contingency stability are derived. By\nenforcing these frequency related constraints, a location based RoCoF\nconstrained security constrained unit commitment (LRC-SCUC) model is proposed.\nFurthermore, an effective piecewise linearization (PWL) technique is employed\nto formulate a RoCoF linearization problem and linearize the nonlinear function\nrepresenting the location based RoCoF constraints in SCUC. Simulation results\nreveal that the inclusion of inertia-related constraints can substantially\nimprove the system stability at the cost of higher operation cost. The results\nalso show that deploying virtual inertia techniques not only reduces the total\ncost, but also improves the system market efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 22:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 21:45:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 02:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Hybrid\nX-ray imaging modalities like X-ray luminescence CT (XLCT) and X-ray\nfluorescence CT (XFCT) rely on the intensity of the X-ray tube to provide an\naccurate image reconstruction of the nanoprobe distribution in the imaging\nsample. A limiting factor of good image quality is the radiation dose that will\nbe delivered to the imaging object. To accurately estimate the absorbed dose in\nan imaging protocol, it is better to simulate the X-ray imaging with a Monte\nCarlo platform such as GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission).\nHowever, the input of GATE is a photon number of the simulated X-ray tube. So\nfar, there is no good way to setup the photon number for a desired X-ray tube\ncurrent. In this work, the accumulated radiation dose of a micro-CT X-ray tube\nat different current exposure times was recorded with a general-purpose ion\nchamber.

Recently, decoupled neural\ninterfaces (DNIs) were introduced as a solution to the forward and feedback\nlocking problems in deep networks. Here we propose that a specialised brain\nregion, the cerebellum, helps the cerebral cortex solve similar locking\nproblems akin to DNIs. To demonstrate the potential of this framework we\nintroduce a systems-level model in which a recurrent cortical network receives\nonline temporal feedback predictions from a cerebellar module. We test this\ncortico-cerebellar recurrent neural network (ccRNN) model on a number of\nsensorimotor (line and digit drawing) and cognitive tasks (pattern recognition\nand caption generation) that have been shown to be cerebellar-dependent. In all\ntasks, we observe that ccRNNs facilitates learning while reducing ataxia-like\nbehaviours, consistent with classical experimental observations. Moreover, our\nmodel also explains recent behavioural and neuronal observations while making\nseveral testable predictions across multiple levels.

In this\nsemi-discrete formulation, the total mass is preserved independently for every\nplasma species. Further, an energy invariant exists if central numerical fluxes\nare used in the DG approximation of Maxwell's equations, while a dissipative\nterm is present when upwind fluxes are employed. In general, traditional\ntemporal integrators might fail to preserve invariants associated with\nconservation laws during the time evolution. Hence, we analyze the capability\nof explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) temporal integrators to preserve such\ninvariants. Since explicit RK methods can only ensure preservation of linear\ninvariants but do not provide any control on the system energy, we consider\nmodified explicit RK methods in the family of relaxation Runge-Kutta methods\n(RRK). These methods can be tuned to preserve the energy invariant at the\ncontinuous or semi-discrete level, a distinction that is important when upwind\nfluxes are used in the discretization of Maxwell's equations since upwind\nprovides a numerical source of energy dissipation that is not present when\ncentral fluxes are used.

In order to accurately localize the active object, any method must reason\nusing information encoded by each image pixel, such as whether it belongs to\nthe hand, the object, or the background. To leverage each pixel as evidence to\ndetermine the bounding box of the active object, we propose a pixel-wise voting\nfunction. Our pixel-wise voting function takes an initial bounding box as input\nand produces an improved bounding box of the active object as output. The\nvoting function is designed so that each pixel inside of the input bounding box\nvotes for an improved bounding box, and the box with the majority vote is\nselected as the output. We call the collection of bounding boxes generated\ninside of the voting function, the Relational Box Field, as it characterizes a\nfield of bounding boxes defined in relationship to the current bounding box.\nWhile our voting function is able to improve the bounding box of the active\nobject, one round of voting is typically not enough to accurately localize the\nactive object. Therefore, we repeatedly apply the voting function to\nsequentially improve the location of the bounding box. However, since it is\nknown that repeatedly applying a one-step predictor (i.e., auto-regressive\nprocessing with our voting function) can cause a data distribution shift, we\nmitigate this issue using reinforcement learning (RL). We adopt standard RL to\nlearn the voting function parameters and show that it provides a meaningful\nimprovement over a standard supervised learning approach.

To leverage the IRS effectively, the acquisition of\nchannel state information (CSI) is crucial in IRS-assisted communication\nsystems, which, however, is challenging. In this paper, we propose the optimal\npilot power allocation strategy for the channel estimation of IRS-assisted\ncommunication systems, which is capable of further improving the achievable\nrate performance with imperfect CSI. More specifically, first of all, we\nintroduce a multi-IRS-assisted communication system in the face of practical\nchannel estimation errors. Furthermore, the ergodic capacity with imperfect CSI\nis derived in an explicit closed-form expression under the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) consideration. Secondly, we formulate the optimization\nproblem of maximizing the ergodic capacity with imperfect CSI, subject to the\nconstraint of the average uplink pilot power. Thirdly, the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers is invoked to solve the ergodic rate maximizing problem and thus to\nobtain the optimal pilot power allocation strategy. The resultant pilot power\nallocation solution suggests allocating more amount of power to the pilots for\nestimating the weak reflection channels. Besides, we also elaborate on the\nexpense of the proposed pilot power allocation strategy upon analyzing the\npeak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) increase quantitatively.

In real human dialogue, there are many\nappropriate responses for the same context, not only with different\nexpressions, but also with different topics. Therefore, due to the much bigger\ngap between various ground-truth responses and the generated synthetic\nresponse, exposure bias is more challenging in dialogue generation task.

Traditional statistical modeling is\nstill a dominant strategy for structured tabular data. Deep learning can be\nviewed through the lens of generalized linear models (GLMs) with composite link\nfunctions. Sufficient dimensionality reduction (SDR) and sparsity performs\nnonlinear feature engineering. We show that prediction, interpolation and\nuncertainty quantification can be achieved using probabilistic methods at the\noutput layer of the model. Thus a general framework for machine learning arises\nthat first generates nonlinear features (a.k.a factors) via sparse\nregularization and stochastic gradient optimisation and second uses a\nstochastic output layer for predictive uncertainty. Rather than using shallow\nadditive architectures as in many statistical models, deep learning uses layers\nof semi affine input transformations to provide a predictive rule. Applying\nthese layers of transformations leads to a set of attributes (a.k.a features)\nto which predictive statistical methods can be applied. Thus we achieve the\nbest of both worlds: scalability and fast predictive rule construction together\nwith uncertainty quantification. Sparse regularisation with un-supervised or\nsupervised learning finds the features. We clarify the duality between shallow\nand wide models such as PCA, PPR, RRR and deep but skinny architectures such as\nautoencoders, MLPs, CNN, and LSTM. The connection with data transformations is\nof practical importance for finding good network architectures. By\nincorporating probabilistic components at the output level we allow for\npredictive uncertainty. For interpolation we use deep Gaussian process and ReLU\ntrees for classification. We provide applications to regression, classification\nand interpolation.

Its full potential can only be\nunleashed when its problem-dependent hyperparameters are tuned well. The\nadaptation of one such hyperparameter, trajectory length ($\\tau$), has been\nclosely examined by many research programs with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)\ncoming out as the preferred method in 2011. A decade later, the evolving\nhardware profile has lead to the proliferation of personal and cloud based SIMD\nhardware in the form of Graphics and Tensor Processing Units (GPUs, TPUs) which\nare hostile to certain algorithmic details of NUTS. This has opened up a hole\nin the MCMC toolkit for an algorithm that can learn $\\tau$ while maintaining\ngood hardware utilization. In this work we build on recent advances along this\ndirection and introduce SNAPER-HMC, a SIMD-accelerator-friendly adaptive-MCMC\nscheme for learning $\\tau$. The algorithm maximizes an upper bound on\nper-gradient effective sample size along an estimated principal component. We\nempirically show that SNAPER-HMC is stable when combined with mass-matrix\nadaptation, and is tolerant of certain pathological target distribution\ncovariance spectra while providing excellent long and short run sampling\nefficiency.

An important\nquestion from the standpoint of evacuation safety is how evacuees make these\nchoices and what factors affect their choices. Understanding how humans weigh\nthese (often) competing factors is essential knowledge for evacuation planning\nand safe design. Here, we use immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experiments to\ninvestigate, in controlled settings, how these trade-offs are made using\nempirical data and econometric choice models. In each VR scenario, participants\nare confronted with trade-offs between choosing exits that are familiar to\nthem, exits that are less occupied, exits that are nearer to them and exits to\nwhich visibility is less affected by fire smoke. The marginal role of these\ncompeting factors on their decisions is quantified in a discrete choice model.\nPost-experiment questionnaires also determine factors such as their perceived\nrealism and emotion evoked by the VR evacuation experience. Results indicate\nthat none of the investigated factors dominated the others in terms of their\ninfluence on exit choices. The participants exhibited patterns of\nmulti-attribute conjoint decision-making, consistent with the recent findings\nin the literature. While lack of familiarity and the presence of smoke both\nnegatively affected the desirability of an exit to evacuees, neither solely\ndetermined exit choice. It was also observed that prioritisation of the said\nfactors by participants changed during the repeated scenarios when compared to\nthe first scenario that they experienced. Results have implications for both\nfire safety designs and future VR evacuation experiment designs. These\nempirical models can also be employed as input in computer simulations of\nbuilding evacuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 04:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

Popular\nenforcement is the runtime remote attestation which requires the end system\n(prover) to generate evidence for its runtime behavior and a remote trusted\nverifier to attest the evidence. Control-flow attestation is a kind of runtime\nattestation that provides diagnoses towards the remote control-flow hijacking\nat the prover. Most of these attestation approaches focus on small or embedded\nsoftware.

One of the important questions that arises in this context is the\nimpact of three-phase contact line between solid, liquid and gas on the\nperturbations of the heat fluxes at the nanoscale. Therefore, this paper is\ndevoted to the investigations of features of thermal transport across nanosized\nmeniscus constrained between two solid walls. Different wetting states of the\nmeniscus were considered with molecular dynamics approach by the variation of\nthe interactional potential between atoms of the substrate and the liquid. The\neffect of the size of the meniscus on the exchange of energy between two solid\nwalls was also investigated. It was shown that the presence of a three phase\ncontact line leads to a decrease of the interfacial boundary resistance between\nsolid and liquid. Further, investigations with the finite element method were\nused to link atomistic simulations with the continuum mechanics. We demonstrate\nthat the wetting angle and the interfacial boundary resistance are the required\nkey-parameters to perform multiscale simulations of such engineering problems\nwith an accurate microscale parametrization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 06:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

Here, we\ninvestigate whether we can compute on-the-fly, data-driven corrections to\nminimize numerical viscosity in the coarse-mesh evolution of an interface. The\nproposed system's starting point is the semi-Lagrangian formulation. And, to\nreduce numerical dissipation, we introduce an error-quantifying multilayer\nperceptron. The role of this neural network is to improve the numerically\nestimated surface trajectory. To do so, it processes localized level-set,\nvelocity, and positional data in a single time frame for select vertices near\nthe moving front. Our main contribution is thus a novel\nmachine-learning-augmented transport algorithm that operates alongside\nselective redistancing and alternates with conventional advection to keep the\nadjusted interface trajectory smooth. Consequently, our procedure is more\nefficient than full-scan convolutional-based applications because it\nconcentrates computational effort only around the free boundary. Also, we show\nthrough various tests that our strategy is effective at counteracting both\nnumerical diffusion and mass loss. In simple advection problems, for example,\nour method can achieve the same precision as the baseline scheme at twice the\nresolution but at a fraction of the cost. Similarly, our hybrid technique can\nproduce feasible solidification fronts for crystallization processes. On the\nother hand, tangential shear flows and highly deforming simulations can\nprecipitate bias artifacts and inference deterioration. Likewise, stringent\ndesign velocity constraints can limit our solver's application to problems\ninvolving rapid interface changes. In the latter cases, we have identified\nseveral opportunities to enhance robustness without forgoing our approach's\nbasic concept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 06:36:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 03:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 18:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 04:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Most other robust optimization approaches\nfocus on the quality robustness and only evaluate the relevance of their\nsolutions through the objective function value. However, it can be more\nimportant to optimize the solution robustness and, once the uncertainty is\nrevealed, find an alternative scenario solution $x^s$ which is as similar as\npossible to the nominal solution $x^{nom}$. This for example occurs when the\nrobust solution is implemented on a regular basis or when the uncertainty is\nrevealed late. We call this distance between $x^{nom}$ and $x^s$ the solution\ncost. We consider the proactive problem which minimizes the average solution\ncost over a discrete set of scenarios while ensuring the optimality of the\nnominal objective of $x^{nom}$. We show for two different solution distances\n$d_{val}$ and $d_{struct}$ that the proactive problem is NP-hard for both the\ninteger min-cost flow problem with uncertain arc demands and for the integer\nmax-flow problem with uncertain arc capacities. For these two problems, we\nprove that once the uncertainty is revealed, even identifying a reactive\nsolution $x^r$ with a minimal distance to a given solution $x^{nom}$ is NP-hard\nfor $d_{struct}$, and that it is polynomial for $d_{val}$.

Specifically, we consider the cross-domain few-shot\nsetting where training can use only few real-world annotated images and many\nannotated synthetic images. In this context, aligning the domains is made more\nchallenging by the pixel-wise class imbalance that is intrinsic in the\nsegmentation and that leads to ignoring the underrepresented classes and\noverfitting the well represented ones. We address this problem with a novel\nframework called Pixel-By-Pixel Cross-Domain Alignment (PixDA). We propose a\nnovel pixel-by-pixel domain adversarial loss following three criteria: (i)\nalign the source and the target domain for each pixel, (ii) avoid negative\ntransfer on the correctly represented pixels, and (iii) regularize the training\nof infrequent classes to avoid overfitting. The pixel-wise adversarial training\nis assisted by a novel sample selection procedure, that handles the imbalance\nbetween source and target data, and a knowledge distillation strategy, that\navoids overfitting towards the few target images.

Real-world applications, on the other hand, necessitate\nmodels with minimal memory demands, efficient inference speed, and executable\nwith low-resources embedded devices, such as self-driving vehicles. In this\npaper, we look at the challenge of real-time semantic segmentation across\ndomains, and we train a model to act appropriately on real-world data even\nthough it was trained on a synthetic realm. We employ a new lightweight and\nshallow discriminator that was specifically created for this purpose. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to present a real-time adversarial\napproach for assessing the domain adaption problem in semantic segmentation.

We investigate ternary OSC (D:A:A)\nmade of the donor polymer P3HT with stoichiometric mixtures of different\nfullerene derivatives, PC60BM:PC70BM and PC70BM:IC60BA, respectively. Using\nquantitative electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) we can distinguish between\npositive and negative polarons, localized on the specific molecules. We found\nthat after the initial charge transfer step, the electrons are re-distributed\nover two nearby acceptors in agreement with their stoichiometry and their\nrelative LUMO energy difference.

Adding to its importance, recent advancements in our\nunderstanding of algorithms for transshipment have led to breakthroughs for the\nfundamental problem of computing shortest paths. Specifically, the recent\nnear-optimal $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest path\nalgorithms in the parallel and distributed settings crucially solve\ntransshipment as a central step of their approach.\n  The key property that differentiates transshipment from other similar\nproblems like shortest path is the so-called \\emph{boosting}: one can boost a\n(bad) approximate solution to a near-optimal $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate\nsolution. This conceptually reduces the problem to finding an approximate\nsolution. However, not all approximations can be boosted -- there have been\nseveral proposed approaches that were shown to be susceptible to boosting, and\na few others where boosting was left as an open question.\n  The main takeaway of our paper is that any black-box $\\alpha$-approximate\ntransshipment solver that computes a \\emph{dual} solution can be boosted to an\n$(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate solver. Moreover, we significantly simplify and\ndecouple previous approaches to transshipment (in sequential, parallel, and\ndistributed settings) by showing all of them (implicitly) obtain approximate\ndual solutions.\n  Our analysis is very simple and relies only on the well-known multiplicative\nweights framework. Furthermore, to keep the paper completely self-contained, we\nprovide a new (and arguably much simpler) analysis of multiplicative weights\nthat leverages well-known optimization tools to bypass the ad-hoc calculations\nused in the standard analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 11:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

Studying Chess can productively provide valid knowledge\nabout complex systems. Although remarkable progress has been made on solving\nChess, the geometrical landscape of Chess in the strategy space is still\nmysterious. Judging on AI-generated strategies, researchers hypothesised that\nthe strategy space of Chess possesses a spinning top geometry, with the upright\naxis representing the \\emph{transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C,\nA beats C), and the radial axis representing the \\emph{non-transitive}\ndimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, C beats A). However, it is unclear\nwhether such a hypothesis holds for real-world strategies. In this paper, we\nquantify the non-transitivity in Chess through real-world data from human\nplayers. Specifically, we performed two ways of non-transitivity\nquantifications -- Nash Clustering and counting the number of\nRock-Paper-Scissor cycles -- on over one billion match data from Lichess and\nFICS. Our findings positively indicate that the strategy space occupied by\nreal-world Chess strategies demonstrates a spinning top geometry, and more\nimportantly, there exists a strong connection between the degree of\nnon-transitivity and the progression of a Chess player's rating. In particular,\nhigh degrees of non-transitivity tend to prevent human players from making\nprogress on their Elo rating, whereas progressions are easier to make at the\nlevel of ratings where the degree of non-transitivity is lower. Additionally,\nwe also investigate the implication of the degree of non-transitivity for\npopulation-based training methods. By considering \\emph{fixed-memory Fictitious\nPlay} as a proxy, we reach the conclusion that maintaining large-size and\ndiverse populations of strategies is imperative to training effective AI agents\nin solving Chess types of games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 12:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

In detail,\nconsidering that the heterogeneous gap between modalities always leads to the\nsupervision difficulty of using the global embedding directly, CPRC turns to\ntransform both the raw image and corresponding generated sentence into the\nshared semantic space, and measure the generated sentence from two aspects: 1)\nPrediction consistency. CPRC utilizes the prediction of raw image as soft label\nto distill useful supervision for the generated sentence, rather than employing\nthe traditional pseudo labeling; 2) Relation consistency. CPRC develops a novel\nrelation consistency between augmented images and corresponding generated\nsentences to retain the important relational knowledge. In result, CPRC\nsupervises the generated sentence from both the informativeness and\nrepresentativeness perspectives, and can reasonably use the undescribed images\nto learn a more effective generator under the semi-supervised scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 13:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 14:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Federated learning (FL), as a\nparadigm of collaborative learning techniques, has obtained increasing research\nattention with the benefits of communication efficiency and improved data\nprivacy. Due to the lossy communication channels and limited communication\nresources (e.g., bandwidth and power), it is of interest to investigate fast\nresponding and accurate FL schemes over wireless systems. Hence, we investigate\nthe problem of jointly optimized communication efficiency and resources for FL\nover wireless Internet of things (IoT) networks. To reduce complexity, we\ndivide the overall optimization problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the client\nscheduling problem and the resource allocation problem. To reduce the\ncommunication costs for FL in wireless IoT networks, a new client scheduling\npolicy is proposed by reusing stale local model parameters. To maximize\nsuccessful information exchange over networks, a Lagrange multiplier method is\nfirst leveraged by decoupling variables including power variables, bandwidth\nvariables and transmission indicators. Then a linear-search based power and\nbandwidth allocation method is developed. Given appropriate hyper-parameters,\nwe show that the proposed communication-efficient federated learning (CEFL)\nframework converges at a strong linear rate. Through extensive experiments, it\nis revealed that the proposed CEFL framework substantially boosts both the\ncommunication efficiency and learning performance of both training loss and\ntest accuracy for FL over wireless IoT networks compared to a basic FL approach\nwith uniform resource allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 13:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

The\nextinction of stellar light by circumstellar dust is vital for interpreting\nRSG/AGB observations and determining high-mass RSG progenitors of core-collapse\nsupernovae. Nevertheless, circumstellar dust properties are not well\nunderstood. Modern understanding of dust evolution suggests that intense\nstellar radiation can radically change the dust properties across the\ncircumstellar envelope through the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D)\nmechanism. In this paper, we study the impacts of RAT-D on the grain size\ndistribution (GSD) of circumstellar dust and model its effects on photometric\nobservations of $\\alpha$ Orionis (Betelgeuse). Due to the RAT-D effects, large\ngrains formed in the dust formation zone are disrupted into smaller species of\nsize $a < 0.5\\,\\rm\\mu m$.

This can be a\ncritical issue for crop monitoring, especially for applications relying on\nmachine learning techniques, which generally assume that the feature matrix\ndoes not have missing values. This paper proposes a Gaussian Mixture Model\n(GMM) for the reconstruction of parcel-level features extracted from\nmultispectral images. A robust version of the GMM is also investigated, since\ndatasets can be contaminated by inaccurate samples or features (e.g., wrong\ncrop type reported, inaccurate boundaries, undetected clouds, etc). Additional\nfeatures extracted from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Sentinel-1\ndata are also used to provide complementary information and improve the\nimputations. The robust GMM investigated in this work assigns reduced weights\nto the outliers during the estimation of the GMM parameters, which improves the\nfinal reconstruction. These weights are computed at each step of an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by using outlier scores provided by the\nisolation forest algorithm.

The parallel composition of BTs expresses a\nway to combine concurrent behaviors that has high potential, since composing\npre-existing BTs in parallel results easier than composing in parallel\nclassical control architectures, as finite state machines or teleo-reactive\nprograms. However, BT designers rarely use such composition due to the\nunderlying concurrency problems similar to the ones faced in concurrent\nprogramming. As a result, the parallel composition, despite its potential,\nfinds application only in the composition of simple behaviors or where the\ndesigner can guarantee the absence of conflicts by design.\n  In this paper, we define two new BT nodes to tackle the concurrency problems\nin BTs and we show how to exploit them to create predictable behaviors.

The numerical modeling of the generation and transfer of polarized\nradiation is a key task in solar and stellar physics research and has led to a\nrelevant class of discrete problems that can be reframed as linear systems. In\norder to solve such problems, it is common to rely on efficient stationary\niterative methods. However, the convergence properties of these methods are\nproblem-dependent, and a rigorous investigation of their convergence\nconditions, when applied to transfer problems of polarized radiation, is still\nlacking. Aims. After summarizing the most widely employed iterative methods\nused in the numerical transfer of polarized radiation, this article aims to\nclarify how the convergence of these methods depends on different design\nelements, such as the choice of the formal solver, the discretization of the\nproblem, or the use of damping factors. The main goal is to highlight\nadvantages and disadvantages of the different iterative methods in terms of\nstability and rate of convergence. Methods. We first introduce an algebraic\nformulation of the radiative transfer problem. This formulation allows us to\nexplicitly assemble the iteration matrices arising from different stationary\niterative methods, compute their spectral radii and derive their convergence\nrates, and test the impact of different discretization settings, problem\nparameters, and damping factors.

The general methodology used in\nthis article, based on a fully algebraic formulation of linear transfer\nproblems of polarized radiation, provides useful estimates of the convergence\nrates of various iterative schemes.

In this work, we propose a\nfamily of graph kernels that incorporate these existence intervals of features.\nWhile our approach can be applied to arbitrary graph features, we particularly\nhighlight Weisfeiler-Lehman vertex labels, leading to efficient kernels. We\nshow that using Weisfeiler-Lehman labels over certain filtrations strictly\nincreases the expressive power over the ordinary Weisfeiler-Lehman procedure in\nterms of deciding graph isomorphism. In fact, this result directly yields more\npowerful graph kernels based on such features and has implications to graph\nneural networks due to their close relationship to the Weisfeiler-Lehman\nmethod. We empirically validate the expressive power of our graph kernels and\nshow significant improvements over state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of\npredictive performance on various real-world benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

For larger graphs\nstored separately on different clients, distributed GCN training algorithms\nwere proposed to improve efficiency and scalability. However, existing methods\ndirectly exchange node features between different clients, which results in\ndata privacy leakage. Federated learning was incorporated in graph learning to\ntackle data privacy, while they suffer from severe performance drop due to\nnon-iid data distribution. Besides, these approaches generally involve heavy\ncommunication and memory overhead during the training process. In light of\nthese problems, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Subgraph sampling based\ndistributed GCN training method (PPSGCN), which preserves data privacy and\nsignificantly cuts back on communication and memory overhead. Specifically,\nPPSGCN employs a star-topology client-server system. We firstly sample a local\nnode subset in each client to form a global subgraph, which greatly reduces\ncommunication and memory costs. We then conduct local computation on each\nclient with features or gradients of the sampled nodes. Finally, all clients\nsecurely communicate with the central server with homomorphic encryption to\ncombine local results while preserving data privacy. Compared with federated\ngraph learning methods, our PPSGCN model is trained on a global graph to avoid\nthe negative impact of local data distribution. We prove that our PPSGCN\nalgorithm would converge to a local optimum with probability 1. Experiment\nresults on three prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm\nsignificantly reduces communication and memory overhead while maintaining\ndesirable performance. Further studies not only demonstrate the fast\nconvergence of PPSGCN, but discuss the trade-off between communication and\nlocal computation cost as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 08:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

More importantly,\nconstruction jobsites are classified among the most vulnerable environments to\nsevere wind events. During hurricanes, unsecured and incomplete elements of\nconstruction sites, such as scaffoldings, plywoods, and metal rods, will become\nthe potential wind-borne debris, causing cascading damages to the construction\nprojects and the neighboring communities. Thus, it is no wonder that\nconstruction firms implement jobsite emergency plans to enforce preparedness\nresponses before extreme weather events. However, relying on checklist-based\nemergency action plans to carry out a thorough hurricane preparedness is\nchallenging in large-scale and complex site environments. For enabling\nsystematic responses for hurricane preparedness, we have proposed a\nvision-based technique to identify and analyze the potential wind-borne debris\nin construction jobsites.
