Consequently, the notion\nof applying learning methods to a particular problem set has become an\nestablished and valuable modus operandi to advance a particular field. In this\narticle we argue that such an approach does not straightforwardly extended to\nrobotics -- or to embodied intelligence more generally: systems which engage in\na purposeful exchange of energy and information with a physical environment. In\nparticular, the purview of embodied intelligent agents extends significantly\nbeyond the typical considerations of main-stream machine learning approaches,\nwhich typically (i) do not consider operation under conditions significantly\ndifferent from those encountered during training; (ii) do not consider the\noften substantial, long-lasting and potentially safety-critical nature of\ninteractions during learning and deployment; (iii) do not require ready\nadaptation to novel tasks while at the same time (iv) effectively and\nefficiently curating and extending their models of the world through targeted\nand deliberate actions. In reality, therefore, these limitations result in\nlearning-based systems which suffer from many of the same operational\nshortcomings as more traditional, engineering-based approaches when deployed on\na robot outside a well defined, and often narrow operating envelope. Contrary\nto viewing embodied intelligence as another application domain for machine\nlearning, here we argue that it is in fact a key driver for the advancement of\nmachine learning technology. In this article our goal is to highlight\nchallenges and opportunities that are specific to embodied intelligence and to\npropose research directions which may significantly advance the\nstate-of-the-art in robot learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Static analysis enables\nthe automated extraction of code complexity and readability metrics which can\nbe leveraged to highlight potential improvements in code to both attain\nsoftware of high quality and reinforce good practices for developers as an\neducational tool. This assumes reliable readability metrics which are not\ntrivial to obtain since code readability is somewhat subjective. Recent\nresearch has resulted in increasingly sophisticated models for predicting\nreadability as perceived by humans primarily with a procedural and object\noriented focus, while functional and declarative languages and language\nextensions advance as they often are said to lead to more concise and readable\ncode. In this paper, we investigate whether the existing complexity and\nreadability metrics reflect that wisdom or whether the notion of readability\nand its constituents requires overhaul in the light of programming language\nchanges. We therefore compare traditional object oriented and reactive\nprogramming in terms of code complexity and readability in a case study.\nReactive programming is claimed to increase code quality but few studies have\nsubstantiated these claims empirically. We refactored an object oriented open\nsource project into a reactive candidate and compare readability with the\noriginal using cyclomatic complexity and two state-of-the-art readability\nmetrics. More elaborate investigations are required, but our findings suggest\nthat both cyclomatic complexity and readability decrease significantly at the\nsame time in the reactive candidate, which seems counter-intuitive. We\nexemplify and substantiate why readability metrics may require adjustment to\nbetter suit popular programming styles other than imperative and\nobject-oriented to better match human expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Alternatively, the soft matching-based\nmethods have been proposed to learn the matching probability rather than hard\nassignment. However, in this paper, we prove that these methods have an\ninherent ambiguity causing many deceptive correspondences. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose to learn a partial permutation matching matrix, which\ndoes not assign corresponding points to outliers, and implements hard\nassignment to prevent ambiguity. However, this proposal poses two new problems,\ni.e., existing hard assignment algorithms can only solve a full rank\npermutation matrix rather than a partial permutation matrix, and this desired\nmatrix is defined in the discrete space, which is non-differentiable. In\nresponse, we design a dedicated soft-to-hard (S2H) matching procedure within\nthe registration pipeline consisting of two steps: solving the soft matching\nmatrix (S-step) and projecting this soft matrix to the partial permutation\nmatrix (H-step). Specifically, we augment the profit matrix before the hard\nassignment to solve an augmented permutation matrix, which is cropped to\nachieve the final partial permutation matrix. Moreover, to guarantee end-to-end\nlearning, we supervise the learned partial permutation matrix but propagate the\ngradient to the soft matrix instead. Our S2H matching procedure can be easily\nintegrated with existing registration frameworks, which has been verified in\nrepresentative frameworks including DCP, RPMNet, and DGR.

Models trained\nusing FL may still leak private client information through model updates during\ntraining. Differential privacy (DP) may be employed on model updates to provide\nprivacy guarantees within FL, typically at the cost of degraded performance of\nthe final trained model. Both non-private FL and DP-FL can be solved using\nvariants of the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm. In this work, we\nconsider a heterogeneous DP setup where clients require varying degrees of\nprivacy guarantees. First, we analyze the optimal solution to the federated\nlinear regression problem with heterogeneous DP in a Bayesian setup. We find\nthat unlike the non-private setup, where the optimal solution for homogeneous\ndata amounts to a single global solution for all clients learned through\nFedAvg, the optimal solution for each client in this setup would be a\npersonalized one even for homogeneous data. We also analyze the privacy-utility\ntrade-off for this setup, where we characterize the gain obtained from\nheterogeneous privacy where some clients opt for less strict privacy\nguarantees. We propose a new algorithm for FL with heterogeneous DP, named\nFedHDP, which employs personalization and weighted averaging at the server\nusing the privacy choices of clients, to achieve better performance on clients'\nlocal models. Through numerical experiments, we show that FedHDP provides up to\n$9.27\\%$ performance gain compared to the baseline DP-FL for the considered\ndatasets where $5\\%$ of clients opt out of DP. Additionally, we show a gap in\nthe average performance of local models between non-private and private clients\nof up to $3.49\\%$, empirically illustrating that the baseline DP-FL might incur\na large utility cost when not all clients require the stricter privacy\nguarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Close binarity is\nwidely invoked to help eject an axisymmetric nebula, after a brief phase of\nengulfment of the secondary within the envelope of the Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) star, known as the common envelope (CE). The evolution of the AGB would\nthus be interrupted abruptly, its envelope being rapidly ejected to form the\nPN, which a priori would be more massive than a PN coming from the same star,\nwere it single. We aim at testing this hypothesis by investigating the mass of\na sample of 21 post-CE PNe, ~1/5th of the known total population, and comparing\nthem to a large sample of `regular' (i.e. not known to host close binaries)\nPNe. We have gathered data on the ionised and molecular content of our sample\nand carried out new molecular observations. We derive the ionised and molecular\nmasses of the sample by means of a systematic approach, using tabulated,\ndereddened H-beta fluxes for finding the ionised mass, and CO 2-1 and 3-2\nobservations for the molecular mass. There is a general lack of molecular\ncontent in post-CE PNe, with few exceptions. Once we derive the ionised and\nmolecular masses, we find that post-CE PNe arising from Single-Degenerate (SD)\nsystems are just as massive, on average, as `regular' PNe, whereas post-CE PNe\narising from Double-Degenerate (DD) systems are considerably more massive, and\nshow larger linear momenta and kinetic energy than SD systems and `regular'\nPNe. Reconstruction of the CE of four objects suggests that the mass of SD\nnebulae actually amounts to a very small fraction of the envelope of their\nprogenitor stars.

To address these limitations, we propose the OoD\nMinimum Anomaly Score GAN (OMASGAN).

We compile FRB and\nPRS properties to consider the population of FRB/PRS sources.

Specifically, we build a novel long-range memory graph\naggregation (LMGA) module to dynamically capture correlations along the channel\ndimensions of the feature maps and adaptively aggregate channel features to\nenhance the feature representations. We introduce a non-local residual block,\nwhich enables each channel-wise feature to attend global spatial hierarchical\nfeatures. In addition, we adopt a progressive fusion module to further enhance\nthe representation ability by extensively exploiting spatial-temporal\ncorrelations from multiple frames. Experiment results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves better results compared with the state-of-the-art methods\nquantitatively and visually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 02:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

While\nadaptive network coding schemes have the potential of balancing rate and delay\nin real-time, they often rely on prediction of the channel behavior. In\npractice, such prediction is based on delayed feedback, making it difficult to\nacquire causally, particularly when the underlying channel model is unknown. In\nthis work, we propose a deep learning-based noise prediction (DeepNP)\nalgorithm, which augments the recently proposed adaptive and causal random\nlinear network coding scheme with a dedicated deep neural network, that learns\nto carry out noise prediction from data. This neural augmentation is utilized\nto maximize the throughput while minimizing in-order delivery delay of the\nnetwork coding scheme, and operate in a channel-model-agnostic manner. We\nnumerically show that performance can dramatically increase by the learned\nprediction of the channel noise rate.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic\npatch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial\nregion of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory.

First, YOLOv4 network is fine-tuned to detect the targets from the\nrespective MF SAR target images. Second, a very deep CNN is trained from\nscratch on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR)\ndatabase by using small filters throughout the whole net to reduce the speckle\nnoise.

Under this scheme, PV\ninverters form into separate voltage regulation coalitions autonomously\naccording to local, neighbor as well as coalition voltage magnitude and\nregulation capacity information. To coordinate control within each coalition,\nwe develop a feedback-based leader-follower consensus algorithm which\neliminates the voltage violations caused by the fast fluctuations of load and\nPV generation. This algorithm allocates the required reactive power\ncontribution among the PV inverters according to their maximum available\ncapacity to promote an effective and fair use of the overall voltage regulation\ncapacity. Case studies based on realistic distribution networks and\nfield-recorded data validate the effectiveness of the proposed control\nstrategy.

In this\npaper, we study the effects of different MEFs modeling choices for myocardial\ndeformation and nonselective stretch-activated channels (SACs) in the\nmonodomain equation. We perform numerical simulations during ventricular\ntachycardia (VT) by employing a biophysically detailed and anatomically\naccurate 3D electromechanical model for the left ventricle (LV) coupled with a\n0D closed-loop model of the cardiocirculatory system. We model the\nelectromechanical substrate responsible for scar-related VT with a distribution\nof infarct and peri-infarct zones. Our mathematical framework takes into\naccount the hemodynamic effects of VT due to myocardial impairment and allows\nfor the classification of their hemodynamic nature, which can be either stable\nor unstable. By combining electrophysiological, mechanical and hemodynamic\nmodels, we observe that all MEFs may alter the propagation of the action\npotential and the morphology of the VT. In particular, we notice that the\npresence of myocardial deformation in the monodomain equation may change the VT\nbasis cycle length and the conduction velocity but do not affect the\nhemodynamic nature of the VT. Finally, nonselective SACs may affect wavefront\nstability, by possibly turning a hemodynamically stable VT into a\nhemodynamically unstable one and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 19:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

We prove that if a feature representation satisfies the sufficiency\ncriterion or is calibrated for mean and variance, than the proposed fairness\ncriteria is met.

The main idea, which is intuitive and easy to implement, is to keep the\nprojections of the response vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ on leading principle\ncomponents of a kernel matrix fixed and permute $\\boldsymbol{Y}$'s projections\non the remaining principle components. The proposed test allows for different\nchoices of kernels, corresponding to different classes of functions under the\nnull hypothesis. First, using linear or polynomial kernels, our partial\npermutation tests are exactly valid in finite samples for linear or polynomial\nregression models with Gaussian noise; similar results straightforwardly extend\nto kernels with finite feature spaces. Second, by allowing the kernel feature\nspace to diverge with the sample size, the test can be large-sample valid for a\nwider class of functions. Third, for general kernels with possibly\ninfinite-dimensional feature space, the partial permutation test is exactly\nvalid when the covariates are exactly balanced across all groups, or\nasymptotically valid when the underlying function follows certain regularized\nGaussian processes. We further suggest test statistics using likelihood ratio\nbetween two (nested) GPR models, and propose computationally efficient\nalgorithms utilizing the EM algorithm and Newton's method, where the latter\nalso involves Fisher scoring and quadratic programming and is particularly\nuseful when EM suffers from slow convergence. Extensions to correlated and\nnon-Gaussian noises have also been investigated theoretically or numerically.\nFurthermore, the test can be extended to use multiple kernels together and can\nthus enjoy properties from each kernel. Both simulation study and application\nillustrate the properties of the proposed test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 19:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Since then, it has been an intriguing open question\nwhether or not tractability can be extended to general disk graphs. We show\nthat the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk\ngraph nor of a unit (3-dimensional) ball graph. From that fact and existing\nresults, we derive a simple QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm running in\ntime $2^{\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})}$ for \\textsc{Maximum Clique} on disk and unit ball\ngraphs. We then obtain a randomized EPTAS for computing the independence number\non graphs having no disjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph,\nbounded VC-dimension, and linear independence number. This, in combination with\nour structural results, yields a randomized EPTAS for \\textsc{Max Clique} on\ndisk and unit ball graphs. \\textsc{Max Clique} on unit ball graphs is\nequivalent to finding, given a collection of points in $\\mathbb R^3$, a maximum\nsubset of points with diameter at most some fixed value. In stark contrast,\n\\textsc{Maximum Clique} on ball graphs and unit $4$-dimensional ball graphs, as\nwell as intersection graphs of filled ellipses (even close to unit disks) or\nfilled triangles is unlikely to have such algorithms. Indeed, we show that, for\nall those problems, there is a constant ratio of approximation which cannot be\nattained even in time $2^{n^{1-\\varepsilon}}$, unless the Exponential Time\nHypothesis fails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 20:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

The primary goal is to determine how the discharge evolves on the time\nscale of the flame passage, with the evolution driven by the changing gas state\nproduced by the moving flame front. This work complements the large body of\nwork investigating the effect of plasma to modify flame dynamics, by\nconsidering the other side of the interaction (how the discharge is modified by\nthe flame). The hot gas produced by the combustion had a strong effect on the\ndischarge, with the discharge preferentially forming in the region of hot\ncombustion products. The per-pulse energy deposited by the discharge was\nmeasured and found to increase with the size of the discharge region and\napplied voltage. The pulse repetition frequency did not have a direct impact on\nthe per-pulse energy, but did have an effect on the morphology and size of the\ndischarge region. Two distinct discharge regimes were observed: uniform and\nfilamentary (microdischarges). Higher pulse repetition frequencies and\nfaster-cooling combustion products were more likely to transition to the\nfilamentary regime, while lower frequencies and slower-cooling combustion\nproducts maintained a uniform regime for the entirety of the time the discharge\nwas active. This regime transition was influenced by the ratio of the time\nscale of fluid motion to the pulse repetition rate.

Inspired\nby this method, we propose and exemplify a methodology to enhance the\nsensitivity of magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectra. Our proposal\nuses the abundant 1H reservoir arising in organic solids as the magnetically\nabundant spin pool, and relies on proton spin diffusion in lieu of chemical\nexchange to mediate polarization transfer between a magnetically dilute spin\npool and this magnetically abundant spin reporter. As an initial test of this\nidea we target the spectroscopy of naturally-abundant 13C, and rely on a\nFourier-encoded version of the CEST experiment for achieving broadbandness in\ncoordination with both MAS and heteronuclear decoupling - features normally\nabsent in CEST. Arbitrary evolutions of multiple 13C sites can thus be\nimprinted on the entire 1H reservoir, which is subsequently detected.\nTheoretical predictions suggest that orders-of-magnitude signal enhancements\nshould be achievable in this manner - on the order of the ratio between the 13C\nand the 1H reservoirs' abundances.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop an effective methodology for coordinated group detection to combat the\nmisinformation on social media. However, existing works suffer from various\ndrawbacks, such as, either limited performance due to extreme reliance on\npredefined signatures of coordination, or instead an inability to address the\nnatural sparsity of account activities on social media with useful prior domain\nknowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a coordination detection\nframework incorporating neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such\nas temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. Specifically, when\nmodeling the observed data from social media with neural temporal point\nprocess, we jointly learn a Gibbs-like distribution of group assignment based\non how consistent an assignment is to (1) the account embedding space and (2)\nthe prior knowledge. To address the challenge that the distribution is hard to\nbe efficiently computed and sampled from, we design a theoretically guaranteed\nvariational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation for it.\nExperimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our\nproposed method compared to the SOTA model in both unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised settings. We further apply our model on a COVID-19 Vaccine\nTweets dataset.

Steady-state\nand unsteady analysis have been performed to probe the dependence of the\ncritical gas temperature required to trigger a thermal runaway (namely, the\nignition temperature $T_\\mathrm{ign}$) on particle size, initial thickness of\noxide layer, inert gas species, radiative heat loss, and the collective heating\neffect in a suspension of particles.

The problem is that logs are often unstructured, making\ntheir analysis a complex task. This is mainly due to the lack of guidelines and\nbest practices for logging, combined with a large number of logging libraries\nat the disposal of software developers. There exist studies that aim to parse\nautomatically large logs. The main objective is to extract templates from\nsamples of log data that are used to recognize future logs. In this paper, we\npropose AWSOM-LP, a powerful log parsing and abstraction tool, which is highly\naccurate, stable, and efficient. AWSOM-LP is built on the idea of applying\npattern recognition and frequency analysis. First, log events are organized\ninto patterns using a simple text processing method. Frequency analysis is then\napplied locally to instances of the same group to identify static and dynamic\ncontent of log events. When applied to 16 log datasets of the the LogPai\nproject, AWSOM-LP achieves an average grouping accuracy of 93.5%, which\noutperforms the accuracy of five leading log parsing tools namely, Logram,\nLenma, Drain, IPLoM and AEL. Additionally, AWSOM-LP can generate more than 80%\nof the final log templates from 10% to 50% of the entire log dataset and can\nparse up to a million log events in an average time of 5 minutes. AWSOM-LP is\navailable online as an open source. It can be used by practitioners and\nresearchers to parse effectively and efficiently large log files so as to\nsupport log analysis tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 00:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

To construct a target object, we provide\nincomplete knowledge about the desired target (i.e., 2D images) instead of\nexact and explicit volumetric information to the agent. This problem requires a\ncomprehensive understanding of partial information and long-term planning to\nappend a brick sequentially, which leads us to employ reinforcement learning.\nThe approach has to consider a variable-sized action space where a large number\nof invalid actions, which would cause overlap between bricks, exist. To resolve\nthese issues, our model, dubbed Brick-by-Brick, adopts an action validity\nprediction network that efficiently filters invalid actions for an actor-critic\nnetwork.

Extending the successes in supervised learning methods to the\nreinforcement learning (RL) setting, however, is difficult due to the data\ngenerating process - RL agents actively query their environment for data, and\nthe data are a function of the policy followed by the agent. An agent could\nthus neglect a shift in the environment if its policy did not lead it to\nexplore the aspect of the environment that shifted. Therefore, to achieve safe\nand robust generalization in RL, there exists an unmet need for OOD detection\nthrough active experimentation. Here, we attempt to bridge this lacuna by first\ndefining a causal framework for OOD scenarios or environments encountered by RL\nagents in the wild.

The model consists of the St\nVenant equations for flow in the channel, fed by an upstream lake reservoir,\ncoupled with an equation for the evolution of channel elevation due to\nadvection, uplift, and downward melting. After reduction to a `stream\npower'-type hyperbolic model, we show that lake drainage occurs above a\ncritical rate of water supply to the lake due to the backward migration of a\nshock that incises the lake seal. The critical water supply rate depends on\nadvection velocity and uplift (or more precisely, drawdown downstream of the\nlake) as well as model parameters such as channel wall roughness and the\nparameters defining the relationship between channel cross-section and wetted\nperimeter. Once lake drainage does occur, it can either continue until the lake\nis empty, or terminate early, leading to oscillatory cycles of lake filling and\ndraining, with the latter favoured by large lake volumes and relatively small\nwater supply rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Many existing studies\nhave proposed correction methods such as adding fairness constraints to a\nranking model's loss. However, the challenge of correcting the data bias for\nfair ranking remains, and the trade-off of the ranking models leaves room for\nimprovement. In this paper, we propose a fair ranking framework that evaluates\nthe order of training data in a pairwise manner as well as various fairness\nmeasurements in ranking. This study is the first proposal of a pre-processing\nmethod that solves fair ranking problems using the pairwise ordering method\nwith our best knowledge. The fair pairwise ordering method is prominent in\ntraining the fair ranking models because it ensures that the resulting ranking\nlikely becomes parity across groups. As far as the fairness measurements in\nranking are represented as a linear constraint of the ranking models, we proved\nthat the minimization of loss function subject to the constraints is reduced to\nthe closed solution of the minimization problem augmented by weights to\ntraining data. This closed solution inspires us to present a practical and\nstable algorithm that iterates the optimization of weights and model\nparameters.

Instead of\nleveraging multiple sequence alignment as is usually done, we propose a novel\nmethod to capture this information directly by pre-training via a dedicated\nlanguage model, i.e., Pairwise Masked Language Model (PMLM). In a conventional\nmasked language model, the masked tokens are modeled by conditioning on the\nunmasked tokens only, but processed independently to each other. However, our\nproposed PMLM takes the dependency among masked tokens into consideration,\ni.e., the probability of a token pair is not equal to the product of the\nprobability of the two tokens. By applying this model, the pre-trained encoder\nis able to generate a better representation for protein sequences. Our result\nshows that the proposed method can effectively capture the inter-residue\ncorrelations and improves the performance of contact prediction by up to 9%\ncompared to the MLM baseline under the same setting. The proposed model also\nsignificantly outperforms the MSA baseline by more than 7% on the TAPE contact\nprediction benchmark when pre-trained on a subset of the sequence database\nwhich the MSA is generated from, revealing the potential of the sequence\npre-training method to surpass MSA based methods in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 04:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel topological neural framework of\ntopological relational inference (TRI) which allows for integrating\nhigher-order graph information to GNNs and for systematically learning a local\ngraph structure. The key idea is to rewire the original graph by using the\npersistent homology of the small neighborhoods of nodes and then to incorporate\nthe extracted topological summaries as the side information into the local\nalgorithm. As a result, the new framework enables us to harness both the\nconventional information on the graph structure and information on the graph\nhigher order topological properties. We derive theoretical stability guarantees\nfor the new local topological representation and discuss their implications on\nthe graph algebraic connectivity.

As all the elements\nare activated in each transmission and the number of transmissions is smaller\nthan that of STA, this method can achieve higher SNR and higher frame rate. Its\nmain drawback is the time-consuming CS reconstruction. In this study, we\naccelerate the complete STA dataset reconstruction with minimal l2-norm least\nsquare method.

Modern biofidelic head model simulations\nare associated with very high computational cost, and high-dimensional inputs\nand outputs, which limits the applicability of traditional uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) methods on these systems. In this study, a two-stage,\ndata-driven manifold learning-based framework is proposed for UQ of\ncomputational head models.

In the first stage,\na data-driven method based on multi-dimensional Gaussian kernel-density\nestimation and diffusion maps is used to generate realizations of the input\nrandom vector directly from the available data. Computational simulations of a\nsmall number of realizations provide input-output pairs for training\ndata-driven surrogate models in the second stage. The surrogate models employ\nnonlinear dimensionality reduction using Grassmannian diffusion maps, Gaussian\nprocess regression to create a low-cost mapping between the input random vector\nand the reduced solution space, and geometric harmonics models for mapping\nbetween the reduced space and the Grassmann manifold. It is demonstrated that\nthe surrogate models provide highly accurate approximations of the\ncomputational model while significantly reducing the computational cost.

However, due to the limitation of\n$N$-body tool, previous theoretical modelling for globular clusters (GCs) by\nusing direct $N$-body simulations have not investigated how a large fraction of\nprimordial binaries affect their long-term evolution. In this work, by using\nthe high-performance $N$-body code, PeTar, we carry out star-by-star models for\nintermediate massive GCs ($N=100000$) with the primordial binary fraction\nvarying from 0 to 1. We find that when a stellar-mass black hole (BH) subsystem\nexists, the structural evolution of GCs (core and half-mass radii) only depends\non the properties of massive primordial binaries, because they affect the\nnumber of BH binaries (BBHs), which dominate the binary heating process.\nLow-mass binaries including double white dwarf binaries (BWDs) have almost no\ninfluence on the dynamics. Meanwhile, only gravitational wave (GW) mergers from\nBBHs are strongly affected by dynamical interactions, while low-mass mergers\nfrom BWDs show no difference in the isolated environment (field) and in GCs.\nLow-mass binaries become important only after most BHs escape and the core\ncollapse of light stars occurs. Our result suggests that for $N$-body modelling\nof GCs with a black hole subsystem dominating binary heating, it is not\nnecessary to include low-mass binaries. These binaries can be studied\nseparately by using standalone binary stellar evolution codes.

The government highly relies on active human efforts to detect\nillegal parking events. However, such an approach is extremely ineffective to\ncover a large city since the police have to patrol over the entire city roads.\n  The massive and high-quality sharing bike trajectories from Mobike offer us a\nunique opportunity to design a ubiquitous illegal parking detection approach,\nas most of the illegal parking events happen at curbsides and have significant\nimpact on the bike users.

Inspired by this idea, three main\ncomponents are employed in the proposed framework: 1)~{\\em trajectory\npre-processing}, which filters outlier GPS points, performs map-matching, and\nbuilds trajectory indexes; 2)~{\\em illegal parking detection}, which models the\nnormal trajectories, extracts features from the evaluation trajectories, and\nutilizes a distribution test-based method to discover the illegal parking\nevents; and 3)~{\\em patrol scheduling}, which leverages the detection result as\nreference context, and models the scheduling task as a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning problem to guide the patrol police. Finally, extensive\nexperiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of illegal parking\ndetection, as well as the improvement of patrol efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 05:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 06:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

In spite of an urgent need for Deepfake\nidentification, existing pixel-level detection methods are increasingly unable\nto resist the growing realism of fake videos and lack generalization. In this\npaper, we propose a scheme to expose Deepfake through faint signals hidden in\nface videos. This scheme extracts two types of minute information hidden\nbetween face pixels-photoplethysmography (PPG) features and auto-regressive\n(AR) features, which are used as the basis for forensics in the temporal and\nspatial domains, respectively. According to the principle of PPG, tracking the\nabsorption of light by blood cells allows remote estimation of the temporal\ndomains heart rate (HR) of face video, and irregular HR fluctuations can be\nseen as traces of tampering. On the other hand, AR coefficients are able to\nreflect the inter-pixel correlation, and can also reflect the traces of\nsmoothing caused by up-sampling in the process of generating fake faces.\nFurthermore, the scheme combines asymmetric convolution block (ACBlock)-based\nimproved densely connected networks (DenseNets) to achieve face video\nauthenticity forensics. Its asymmetric convolutional structure enhances the\nrobustness of network to the input feature image upside-down and left-right\nflipping, so that the sequence of feature stitching does not affect detection\nresults. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme provides more\naccurate authenticity detection results on multiple deep forgery datasets and\nhas better generalization compared to the benchmark strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 06:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

However, overfitting is a vital defect of\nthis framework.

In particular, unlike the true gradient setting, geometric\ninformation cannot be easily exploited in the stochastic case for accelerating\npolicy optimization without detrimental consequences or impractical\nassumptions. Second, to explain these findings we introduce the concept of\ncommittal rate for stochastic policy optimization, and show that this can serve\nas a criterion for determining almost sure convergence to global optimality.\nThird, we show that in the absence of external oracle information, which allows\nan algorithm to determine the difference between optimal and sub-optimal\nactions given only on-policy samples, there is an inherent trade-off between\nexploiting geometry to accelerate convergence versus achieving optimality\nalmost surely. That is, an uninformed algorithm either converges to a globally\noptimal policy with probability $1$ but at a rate no better than $O(1/t)$, or\nit achieves faster than $O(1/t)$ convergence but then must fail to converge to\nthe globally optimal policy with some positive probability.

This choice of the control is very particular\nand their choice of the formulation leads to the control with limited\nregularity. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the Stokes problem with\noutflow condition and the control acts on the Dirichlet boundary only hence our\ncontrol is more general and it has both the tangential and normal components.\nWe prove well-posedness and discuss on the regularity of the control problem.\nThe first-order optimality condition for the control leads to a Signorini\nproblem.

For two-layer neural\nnetworks, it has been understood via these asymptotics that the nature of the\ntrained model radically changes depending on the scale of the initial random\nweights, ranging from a kernel regime (for large initial variance) to a feature\nlearning regime (for small initial variance). For deeper networks more regimes\nare possible, and in this paper we study in detail a specific choice of\n''small'' initialization corresponding to \"mean-field\" limits of neural\nnetworks, which we call integrable parameterizations (IPs). First, we show that\nunder standard i.i.d. zero-mean initialization, integrable parameterizations of\nneural networks with more than four layers start at a stationary point in the\ninfinite-width limit and no learning occurs. We then propose various methods to\navoid this trivial behavior and analyze in detail the resulting dynamics. In\nparticular, one of these methods consists in using large initial learning\nrates, and we show that it is equivalent to a modification of the recently\nproposed maximal update parameterization $\\mu$P. We confirm our results with\nnumerical experiments on image classification tasks, which additionally show a\nstrong difference in behavior between various choices of activation functions\nthat is not yet captured by theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 07:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

One of the most\npractical methods for investigating the synchronization properties of such a\nrhythmic system is to statistically extract phase coupling functions between\nlimit-cycle oscillators directly from observed time-series data. In Particular,\nusing a method that combines phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference, the\nphase coupling functions can be extracted from the time-series data of even\njust one variable in each oscillatory dynamical system with many degrees of\nfreedom. However, it remains unclear how the choice of the observed variables\naffects the statistical inference for the phase coupling functions. In this\nstudy, we examine the influence of observed variable types on the extraction of\nphase coupling functions using some typical dynamical elements under various\nconditions. We demonstrate that our method can consistently extract the\nmacroscopic phase coupling functions between two phases representing collective\noscillations in a fully locked state, regardless of the observed variable\ntypes; for example, even using one variable of any element in one system and\nthe mean-field value over all the elements in another system. We also study the\ncase of globally coupled phase oscillators in a partially locked state. Our\nresults reveal directional asymmetry in the robustness of extracting the\nmacroscopic phase coupling function between two networks.

Studying the\nhigh-pressure chemistry of the Sr-H system at 56-180 GPa, we observed the\nformation of several previously unknown compounds: C2/m-Sr$_3$H$_{13}$,\npseudocubic SrH$_6$, SrH$_9$ with cubic F-43m Sr sublattice, and\npseudotetragonal P1-SrH$_{22}$, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen\ncontent discovered so far.

Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on\ngenerating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have\nbeen less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more\nchallenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal\ncues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper,\nthe bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models\nwith BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and\nthe agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each\nBSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the\nagent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high\nfooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of\nmeaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s\nunderstanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion.

Existing multi-modal\ngesture recognition systems take multi-modal data as input to improve accuracy,\nbut such methods require more modality sensors, which will greatly limit their\napplication scenarios. Therefore we propose an end-to-end multi-task learning\nframework in training 2D convolutional neural networks. The framework can use\nthe depth modality to improve accuracy during training and save costs by using\nonly RGB modality during inference. Our framework is trained to learn a\nrepresentation for multi-task learning: gesture segmentation and gesture\nrecognition. Depth modality contains the prior information for the location of\nthe gesture. Therefore it can be used as the supervision for gesture\nsegmentation. A plug-and-play module named Multi-Scale-Decoder is designed to\nrealize gesture segmentation, which contains two sub-decoder. It is used in the\nlower stage and higher stage respectively, and can help the network pay\nattention to key target areas, ignore irrelevant information, and extract more\ndiscriminant features. Additionally, the MSD module and depth modality are only\nused in the training stage to improve gesture recognition performance. Only RGB\nmodality and network without MSD are required during inference. Experimental\nresults on three public gesture recognition datasets show that our proposed\nmethod provides superior performance compared with existing gesture recognition\nframeworks. Moreover, using the proposed plug-and-play MSD in other 2D\nCNN-based frameworks also get an excellent accuracy improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 09:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

This is because X-ray photons\noriginally emitted from the `corona' close to the black hole irradiate the\naccretion disc and are re-emitted with a characteristic `reflection' spectrum\nthat includes a prominent $\\sim 6.4$ keV iron emission line. The shape of the\nreflection spectrum depends on the irradiating flux, and the light-crossing\ndelay between continuum photons observed directly from the corona and the\nreflected photons constrains the size of the disc. Simultaneously modelling the\nX-ray spectrum and the time delays between photons of different energies\ntherefore constrains the intrinsic reflected luminosity, and the distance\nfollows from the observed reflected flux. Alternatively, the distance can be\nmeasured from the X-ray spectrum alone if the black hole mass is known. We\ndevelop a new model of our RELTRANS X-ray reverberation mapping package, called\nRTDIST, that has distance as a model parameter.

By\nmaking use of an appropriate Breit-Wigner approximation, we derive the general\nform of its quantum kinetic equation for weak system-environment coupling. This\nencompasses the well-known Kramers equation of conventional Brownian motion as\na particular instance. The influence of the underlying chiral symmetry is\nessentially twofold: the anomalous diffusive tensor picks up antisymmtretic\ncomponents, and the drift term has an additional contribution which plays the\nrole of an environmental torque acting upon the system particles. These yield\nan unconventional fluid dynamics that is absent in the standard\n(two-dimensional) Brownian motion subject to an external magnetic field or an\nactive torque.

Moreover, the\nexisting continuous-scale upsampling modules do not make full use of\nmulti-scale features and face problems such as checkerboard artifacts in the SR\nresults and high computational complexity. To address the above problems, we\npropose a scale-aware dynamic network (SADN) for continuous-scale SR. First, we\npropose a scale-aware dynamic convolutional (SAD-Conv) layer for the feature\nlearning of multiple SR tasks with various scales. The SAD-Conv layer can\nadaptively adjust the attention weights of multiple convolution kernels based\non the scale factor, which enhances the expressive power of the model with a\nnegligible extra computational cost. Second, we devise a continuous-scale\nupsampling module (CSUM) with the multi-bilinear local implicit function\n(MBLIF) for any-scale upsampling. The CSUM constructs multiple feature spaces\nwith gradually increasing scales to approximate the continuous feature\nrepresentation of an image, and then the MBLIF makes full use of multi-scale\nfeatures to map arbitrary coordinates to RGB values in high-resolution space.\nWe evaluate our SADN using various benchmarks.

Due to position bias, items of similar relevance may receive\nsignificantly different exposure, raising fairness concerns for item providers\nand motivating recent research into fair ranking. While the area has progressed\ndramatically over recent years, no study to date has investigated the potential\nproblem posed by duplicated items. Duplicates and near-duplicates are common in\nseveral domains, including marketplaces and document collections available to\nsearch engines. In this work, we study the behaviour of different fair ranking\npolicies in the presence of duplicates, quantifying the extra-exposure gained\nby redundant items. We find that fairness-aware ranking policies may conflict\nwith diversity, due to their potential to incentivize duplication more than\npolicies solely focused on relevance. This fact poses a problem for system\nowners who, as a result of this incentive, may have to deal with increased\nredundancy, which is at odds with user satisfaction. Finally, we argue that\nthis aspect represents a blind spot in the normative reasoning underlying\ncommon fair ranking metrics, as rewarding providers who duplicate their items\nwith increased exposure seems unfair for the remaining providers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 11:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

The CSM represents a product of the active turbulence\nobtained at low Reynolds number which has a feedback impact to various\nprocesses such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer invasion. The cause\nof this phenomenon is related to the viscoelasticity of multicellular systems\nin the context of cell residual stress accumulation. Particular interest of\nthis work is to: (1) emphasize the roles of cell shear and normal residual\nstress accumulated during CCM in the appearance of CSM and (2) consider the\ndynamics of CSM from the standpoint of rheology. Inhomogeneous distribution of\nthe cell residual stress leads to a generation the viscoelastic force which\nacts to suppress CCM and can induces the system rapid stiffening. This force\ntogether with the surface tension force and traction force is responsible for\nthe appearance of the CSM.

Methods for improving\nanomaly detection performance have been widely studied. However, no studies\nutilizing test-time augmentation (TTA) for anomaly detection in tabular data\nhave been performed. TTA involves aggregating the predictions of several\nsynthetic versions of a given test sample; TTA produces different points of\nview for a specific test instance and might decrease its prediction bias.

However, these models often contain hundreds\nof millions or even billions of parameters, bringing challenges to online\ndeployment due to latency constraints. Recently, hardware manufacturers have\nintroduced dedicated hardware for NxM sparsity to provide the flexibility of\nunstructured pruning with the runtime efficiency of structured approaches. NxM\nsparsity permits arbitrarily selecting M parameters to retain from a contiguous\ngroup of N in the dense representation. However, due to the extremely high\ncomplexity of pre-trained models, the standard sparse fine-tuning techniques\noften fail to generalize well on downstream tasks, which have limited data\nresources. To address such an issue in a principled manner, we introduce a new\nlearning framework, called NxMTransformer, to induce NxM semi-structured\nsparsity on pretrained language models for natural language understanding to\nobtain better performance. In particular, we propose to formulate the NxM\nsparsity as a constrained optimization problem and use Alternating Direction\nMethod of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize the downstream tasks while taking the\nunderlying hardware constraints into consideration. ADMM decomposes the NxM\nsparsification problem into two sub-problems that can be solved sequentially,\ngenerating sparsified Transformer networks that achieve high accuracy while\nbeing able to effectively execute on newly released hardware. We apply our\napproach to a wide range of NLP tasks, and our proposed method is able to\nachieve 1.7 points higher accuracy in GLUE score than current practices.\nMoreover, we perform detailed analysis on our approach and shed light on how\nADMM affects fine-tuning accuracy for downstream tasks. Finally, we illustrate\nhow NxMTransformer achieves performance improvement with knowledge\ndistillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

While adversarial training can mitigate this issue in\npractice, state-of-the-art methods are increasingly application-dependent,\nheuristic in nature, and suffer from fundamental trade-offs between nominal\nperformance and robustness. Moreover, the problem of finding worst-case\nperturbations is non-convex and underparameterized, both of which engender a\nnon-favorable optimization landscape. Thus, there is a gap between the theory\nand practice of adversarial training, particularly with respect to when and why\nadversarial training works. In this paper, we take a constrained learning\napproach to address these questions and to provide a theoretical foundation for\nrobust learning. In particular, we leverage semi-infinite optimization and\nnon-convex duality theory to show that adversarial training is equivalent to a\nstatistical problem over perturbation distributions, which we characterize\ncompletely. Notably, we show that a myriad of previous robust training\ntechniques can be recovered for particular, sub-optimal choices of these\ndistributions. Using these insights, we then propose a hybrid Langevin Monte\nCarlo approach of which several common algorithms (e.g., PGD) are special\ncases.

Low occupancy surface regions on type I CO2 clathrate\nstructures together with the self-preserving ice layer lead to an effective\nbuoyancy for these structures which restricts the size range of particles that\nfloat in the ocean on Enceladus, Pluto and similar oceanic worlds. Our goal\nhere is to investigate the implications of Lifshitz forces and low occupancy\nsurface regions on clathrate structures for their self-preservation through ice\nlayer formation, presenting a plausible model based on multilayer interactions\nthrough dispersion forces. We predict that the growth of an ice layer between\n0.01 and 0.2 $\\mu$m thick on CO2 clathrate surfaces depends on the presence of\nsurface regions in the gas hydrates with low occupancy. The effective particle\ndensity is estimated delimiting a range of particles that would be buoyant in\ndifferent oceans. Over geological time, deposition of floating CO2 hydrates\ncould result in the accumulation of kilometre-thick hydrate layers above liquid\nwater reservoirs, and below the water ice crusts of their respective ocean\nworlds. On Enceladus, destabilisation of near-surface hydrate deposits could\nlead to increased gas pressures that both drive plumes and entrain stabilised\nhydrates to be redeposited on the surface of Enceladus or ejected into the\nE-ring of Saturn. On ocean worlds such as Enceladus and particularly Pluto, the\naccumulation of thick CO2 hydrate deposits could insulate its ocean against\nfreezing.

However, this analysis does not generalize to the\ncase where the true distributions of the hypothesis are not exact or partially\nknown via some nominal distributions. This problem has practical significance,\nbecause the nominal distributions may be quantized versions of the true\ndistributions in a hardware implementation, or they may be estimates of the\ntrue distributions obtained from labeled training sequences as in statistical\nclassification. In this paper, we develop a type-based analysis to investigate\nBayesian multiple hypothesis testing problem. Our analysis allows one to\nexplicitly calculate the error exponent of a given type and extends the\nclassical analysis. As a generalization of the proposed method, we derive a\nrobust test and obtain its error exponent for the case where the hypothesis\ndistributions are not known but there exist nominal distribution that are close\nto true distributions in variational distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 13:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Both valley polarization and\ncoherence exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on sample temperature, attaining a\nlocal maximum at T=40 K. This has been recently attributed to a motional\nnarrowing effect: an enhancement of the valley relaxation time occurs when the\nscattering rate increases. At a fixed temperature of T=6 K, a two-fold increase\nof the steady-state valley polarization is achieved by increasing the laser\nexcitation power, which we attribute to a local heating induced by the energy\nrelaxation of photoexcited excitons outside the light cone and to an increase\nin the exciton-exciton scattering rate. In contrast, in the same power range\nonly a moderate enhancement of valley coherence is observed. Further increasing\nthe excitation power leads to a small reduction of valley polarization but a\ndramatic loss of valley coherence.

In this work, we test the\nimpact of nuclear recoil timing information on the potential for DM signal\ndiscovery and model selection on a low-threshold experiment limited by the\npresence of an unidentified background resembling this population of low-energy\nevents. Among the different targets explored by the CRESST collaboration, here\nwe focus on Al2O3, as a sapphire detector was shown to reach an energy\nthreshold as low as 19.7 eV [1].

We perform our p-value calculations: 1) taking timing\ninformation into account; and 2) assuming that the latter is not available. By\ncomparing the two approaches, we find that under our assumptions timing\ninformation has a marginal impact on the potential for DM signal discovery,\nwhile provides more significant results for the selection between the two\nmodels considered.

The conclusion on the role of timing\ninformation remains qualitatively unchanged for exposures as large as 1 kg x\nyear.

The computation of differential operators\nrequired for PINNs loss evaluation at collocation points are conventionally\nobtained via AD. Although AD has the advantage of being able to compute the\nexact gradients at any point, such PINNs can only achieve high accuracies with\nlarge numbers of collocation points, otherwise they are prone to optimizing\ntowards unphysical solution. To make PINN training fast, the dual ideas of\nusing numerical differentiation (ND)-inspired method and coupling it with AD\nare employed to define the loss function. The ND-based formulation for training\nloss can strongly link neighboring collocation points to enable efficient\ntraining in sparse sample regimes, but its accuracy is restricted by the\ninterpolation scheme. The proposed coupled-automatic-numerical differentiation\nframework, labeled as can-PINN, unifies the advantages of AD and ND, providing\nmore robust and efficient training than AD-based PINNs, while further improving\naccuracy by up to 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to ND-based PINNs.

The CAFE model is\napplied to empirically measured distributions of dune sizes in two barchan\nswarms in the north circumpolar region of Mars, three swarms in Morocco, and\none in Mauritania, each containing more than 1000 bedforms. When the sizes of\nbedforms are rescaled by the mean size in each zone two attractor states\nappear, with the Tarfaya zones all displaying a common distribution and the\nMartian and Mauritanian zones sharing a different distribution. Comparison of\nthese attractor states with the outputs of the CAFE model reveals that the\nTarfaya-type distribution results from a preference for aggregation and\nfragmentation interactions whereas the Mars-Mauritania distribution is more\nlikely a result of exchange-dominated interactions. We observe that there\nappears to be a greater number of collisions happening in Tarfaya than in the\nother areas which is consistent with a greater rate of\naggregation-fragmentation processes as suggested by our model. Our comparison\nwith the CAFE model also predicts a universal rule for the outputs of the\ndifferent types of interactions with exchange interactions favouring the\nproduction of two dunes roughly equal in size. Fragmentation interactions often\nresult in three bedforms with volumes approximately in the ratio 1:1:2.\nFinally, we find that spontaneous calving of dunes does not play an important\nrole in shaping the size distributions in barchan swarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 15:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 11:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Challenges include a large number of model parameters,\nvacuous bounds on generalization performance of neural networks, risk of\noverfitting, sensitivity to noise, etc., which all detract from the ability to\ninterpret the models. Related work on either model-specific or model-agnostic\npost-hoc interpretation is limited due to a lack of consideration of physical\nconstraints (e.g., mass balance) and properties (e.g., second law of\ngeography). This work investigates physical interpretation of SVANNs using\nnovel comparative approaches based on geographically heterogeneous features.\nThe proposed approach on feature-based physical interpretation is evaluated\nusing a case-study on wetland mapping. The proposed physical interpretation\nimproves the transparency of SVANN models and the analytical results highlight\nthe trade-off between model transparency and model performance (e.g.,\nF1-score).

The frame for which a permutationally invariant set-set\ndistance, namely the Hausdorff distance, returns minimal value is chosen as the\nsolution of the matching problem. IRA is able to find rigid rotations,\nreflections, translations, and permutations between structures with different\nnumbers of atoms, for any atomic arrangement and pattern, periodic or not.

In most\nmetropolitan areas, traffic monitoring cameras have been installed to monitor\nthe traffic conditions on arterial roads and expressways, and the collected\nvideos or images are mainly used for visual inspection by traffic engineers.\nUnfortunately, the data collected from traffic monitoring cameras are affected\nby the 4L characteristics: Low frame rate, Low resolution, Lack of annotated\ndata, and Located in complex road environments. Therefore, despite the great\npotentials of the traffic monitoring cameras, the 4L characteristics hinder\nthem from providing useful traffic state information (e.g., speed, flow,\ndensity). This paper focuses on the traffic density estimation problem as it is\nwidely applicable to various traffic surveillance systems. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is a lack of the holistic framework for addressing the 4L\ncharacteristics and extracting the traffic density information from traffic\nmonitoring camera data. In view of this, this paper proposes a framework for\nestimating traffic density using uncalibrated traffic monitoring cameras with\n4L characteristics. The proposed framework consists of two major components:\ncamera calibration and vehicle detection. The camera calibration method\nestimates the actual length between pixels in the images and videos, and the\nvehicle counts are extracted from the deep-learning-based vehicle detection\nmethod. Combining the two components, high-granular traffic density can be\nestimated. To validate the proposed framework, two case studies were conducted\nin Hong Kong and Sacramento. The results show that the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) in camera calibration is less than 0.2 meters out of 6 meters, and the\naccuracy of vehicle detection under various conditions is approximately 90%.\nOverall, the MAE for the estimated density is 9.04 veh/km/lane in Hong Kong and\n1.30 veh/km/lane in Sacramento. The research outcomes can be used to calibrate\nthe speed-density fundamental diagrams, and the proposed framework can provide\naccurate and real-time traffic information without installing additional\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 15:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Though previous studies have\nmade substantial efforts for automated keyphrase extraction and generation,\nsurprisingly, few studies have been made for \\textit{keyphrase completion}\n(KPC). KPC aims to generate more keyphrases for document (e.g. scientific\npublication) taking advantage of document content along with a very limited\nnumber of known keyphrases, which can be applied to improve text indexing\nsystem, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel KPC method with an\nencoder-decoder framework. We name it \\textit{deep keyphrase completion} (DKPC)\nsince it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the document content\ntogether with known keyphrases via a deep learning framework. Specifically, the\nencoder and the decoder in DKPC play different roles to make full use of the\nknown keyphrases. The former considers the keyphrase-guiding factors, which\naggregates information of known keyphrases into context. On the contrary, the\nlatter considers the keyphrase-inhibited factor to inhibit semantically\nrepeated keyphrase generation.

Consider the gem5 simulator,\nwhich is possibly the leading platform for computer-system architecture\nresearch.

In consequence,\nresearchers have to develop their own simulation platform to test their ideas,\nwhich consume much research time. However, once the base simulator platform is\ndeveloped, another question is the following: Which applications should be\ntested to perform the experiments? The lack of Vectorized Benchmark Suites is\nanother limitation. To face these problems, this work presents a set of tools\nfor designing and evaluating vector architectures. First, the gem5 simulator\nwas extended to support the execution of RISC-V Vector instructions by adding a\nparameterizable Vector Architecture model for designers to evaluate different\napproaches according to the target they pursue. Second, a novel Vectorized\nBenchmark Suite is presented: a collection composed of seven data-parallel\napplications from different domains that can be classified according to the\nmodules that are stressed in the vector architecture. Finally, a study of the\nVectorized Benchmark Suite executing on the gem5-based Vector Architecture\nmodel is highlighted. This suite is the first in its category that covers the\ndifferent possible usage scenarios that may occur within different vector\narchitecture designs such as embedded systems, mainly focused on short vectors,\nor High-Performance-Computing (HPC), usually designed for large vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 15:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

However, device-free (or\ncontactless) sensing is often more sensitive to environment changes than\ndevice-based (or wearable) sensing. Also, RF datasets strictly require on-line\nlabeling during collection, starkly different from image and text data\ncollections where human interpretations can be leveraged to perform off-line\nlabeling. Therefore, existing solutions to RF-HAR entail a laborious data\ncollection process for adapting to new environments. To this end, we propose\nRF-Net as a meta-learning based approach to one-shot RF-HAR; it reduces the\nlabeling efforts for environment adaptation to the minimum level. In\nparticular, we first examine three representative RF sensing techniques and two\nmajor meta-learning approaches. The results motivate us to innovate in two\ndesigns: i) a dual-path base HAR network, where both time and frequency domains\nare dedicated to learning powerful RF features including spatial and\nattention-based temporal ones, and ii) a metric-based meta-learning framework\nto enhance the fast adaption capability of the base network, including an\nRF-specific metric module along with a residual classification module. We\nconduct extensive experiments based on all three RF sensing techniques in\nmultiple real-world indoor environments; all results strongly demonstrate the\nefficacy of RF-Net compared with state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 01:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}
