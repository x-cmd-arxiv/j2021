These learners must provide reliable uncertainty estimates\nfor their predictions in order to meet safety requirements and initiate a\nswitch to manual control in areas of high uncertainty. Yet end-to-end learners\ntypically only deliver point predictions, since distributional predictions are\nassociated with large increases in training time or additional computational\nresources during prediction. To address this shortcoming we investigate\nefficient and scalable approximate inference for the implicit copula neural\nlinear model of Klein, Nott and Smith (2021) in order to quantify uncertainty\nfor the predictions of end-to-end learners. The result are densities for the\nsteering angle that are marginally calibrated, i.e.~the average of the\nestimated densities equals the empirical distribution of steering angles. To\nensure the scalability to large $n$ regimes, we develop efficient estimation\nbased on variational inference as a fast alternative to computationally\nintensive, exact inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the\naccuracy and speed of the variational approach in comparison to Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo on two end-to-end learners trained for highway driving using the\ncomma2k19 data set.

Using an automated system to facilitate\ncompliance handling reduces substantially the time needed for such non-mission\nwork, thereby accelerating collaboration and improving productivity. We present\na framework, Dr.Aid, that helps individuals, organisations and federations\ncomply with data rules, using automation to track which rules are applicable as\ndata is passed between processes and as derived data is generated. It encodes\ndata-governance rules using a formal language and performs reasoning on\nmulti-input-multi-output data-flow graphs in decentralised contexts.

We query\nstandard provenance traces to detach Dr.Aid from details of the tools and\nsystems they are using, as these inevitably vary across members of a federation\nand through time. We evaluate the model in three aspects by encoding real-life\ndata-use policies from diverse fields, showing its capability for real-world\nusage and its advantages compared with traditional frameworks. We argue that\nthis approach will lead to more agile, more productive and more trustworthy\ncollaborations and show that the approach can be adopted incrementally.

Understanding the role of each and the interplay between them is\ncrucial for obtaining insights regarding argument interpretation and\ngeneration. It is particularly important for building effective argument\ngeneration systems that can take both the discourse and the audience\ncharacteristics into account. Having such personalized argument generation\nsystems would be helpful to expose individuals to different viewpoints and help\nthem make a more fair and informed decision on an issue. Even though studies in\nSocial Sciences and Psychology have shown that source and audience effects are\nessential components of the persuasion process, most research in computational\npersuasion has focused solely on understanding the characteristics of\npersuasive language. In this thesis, we make several contributions to\nunderstand the relative effect of the source, audience, and language in\ncomputational persuasion. We first introduce a large-scale dataset with\nextensive user information to study these factors' effects simultaneously.\nThen, we propose models to understand the role of the audience's prior beliefs\non their perception of arguments. We also investigate the role of social\ninteractions and engagement in understanding users' success in online debating\nover time.

In classical general relativity the most general\ncosmological solutions of the Einstein equation are that of the BKL-Misner\ninhomogeneous mixmaster types. How could WCH and BKL-M co-exist?

Motivated by those results, software engineering\nresearchers have proposed many methods for mitigating those discriminatory\neffects. While those methods are effective in mitigating bias, few of them can\nprovide explanations on what is the root cause of bias.\n  Objective: We aim at better detection and mitigation of algorithmic\ndiscrimination in machine learning software problems.\n  Method: Here we propose xFAIR, a model-based extrapolation method, that is\ncapable of both mitigating bias and explaining the cause. In our xFAIR\napproach, protected attributes are represented by models learned from the other\nindependent variables (and these models offer extrapolations over the space\nbetween existing examples). We then use the extrapolation models to relabel\nprotected attributes later seen in testing data or deployment time.

A safe control law ensures\nforward invariance of a safe set (a subset in the state space). It has been\nextensively studied regarding how to derive a safe control law with a\ncontrol-affine analytical dynamic model. However, in complex environments and\ntasks, it is challenging and time-consuming to obtain a principled analytical\nmodel of the system. In these situations, data-driven learning is extensively\nused and the learned models are encoded in neural networks. How to formally\nderive a safe control law with Neural Network Dynamic Models (NNDM) remains\nunclear due to the lack of computationally tractable methods to deal with these\nblack-box functions. In fact, even finding the control that minimizes an\nobjective for NNDM without any safety constraint is still challenging. In this\nwork, we propose MIND-SIS (Mixed Integer for Neural network Dynamic model with\nSafety Index Synthesis), the first method to derive safe control laws for NNDM.\nThe method includes two parts: 1) SIS: an algorithm for the offline synthesis\nof the safety index (also called as barrier function), which uses evolutionary\nmethods and 2) MIND: an algorithm for online computation of the optimal and\nsafe control signal, which solves a constrained optimization using a\ncomputationally efficient encoding of neural networks.

The inner problem's Nash\nequilibria is obtained using a variant of the deep backward stochastic\ndifferential equation (BSDE) method modified for McKean-Vlasov forward-backward\nSDEs that includes dependence on the distribution over both the forward and\nbackward processes. The outer problem's loss is further approximated by a\nneural net by sampling over the space of penalty functions. We apply our\napproach to a stylized PA problem arising in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)\nmarkets, where agents may rent clean energy production capacity, trade RECs,\nand expand their long-term capacity to navigate the market at maximum profit.\nOur numerical results illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm and lead to\ninteresting insights into the nature of optimal PA interactions in the\nmean-field limit of these markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 23:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

For each\nfraction, RTapp estimated the daily and cumulative doses received by targets\nand OARs from daily 3D imaging in real-time. RTapp also included a prediction\nalgorithm that analyzed dosimetric parameters (DP) trends against dosimetric\nendpoints (DE) to trigger adaptation up to 4 fractions ahead. Warning (V95<95%)\nand adaptation (V95<93%) DEs were set for PTVs. OAR adaptation DEs of +10%\n(DE10) were set for all Dmax and Dmean DPs. Any DE violation at end of\ntreatment (EOT) triggered a DP trends review to determine the DE-crossing\nfraction Fx and evaluate the prediction model accuracy (difference between\ncalculated and predicted DP values with 95% confidence intervals). Results:\nRTapp was able to address the needs of treatment adaptation. 15/22 studies\n(68%) violated PTV coverage or parotids Dmean at EOT. 9 PTVs had V95<95% (mean\ncoverage decrease of -7.7+/-3.3 %) including 4 flagged for adaptation at median\nFx=11.5 (range: 6-18). 15 parotids were flagged for exceeding Dmean constraints\nwith median increase of +3.18 Gy (range: 0.18-6.31 Gy) at EOT, including 8 with\nDP>DE10. The differences between predicted and calculated PTV V95 and parotids\nDmean was up to 7.6% (mean: -2.9+/-4.6 %) and 5 Gy (mean: 0.2+/-1.6 Gy),\nrespectively. The most accurate predictions were obtained closest to Fx. For\nparotids, Fx ranged between fractions 1 to 23, the lack of specific trend\ndemonstrated the need to verify treatment adaptation for every fraction.\nConclusion: Integrated in an ART clinical workflow, RTapp can predict whether\nspecific treatment would require adaptation up to 4 fractions ahead of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 03:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Better evaluation\nof the semantic distance between the overlapped sentences benefits the language\nsystem's understanding and guides the generation.

As conjectured many decades\nago, in the low-temperature and high-pressure part of the phase diagram, solid\nhydrogen is expected to become metallic with a high superconducting transition\ntemperature. The metallization may occur via band gap closure in the molecular\nsolid or via a transition to the atomic solid. Recently, a few experimental\nstudies pushed the achievable pressures into the 400 - 500 GPa range. There are\nstrong indications that at some pressure in this range metallization via either\nof these mechanisms occurs, although there are disagreements between\nexperimental reports. Furthermore, there are multiple good candidate crystal\nphases that have emerged from recent computational and experimental studies\nwhich may be realized in upcoming experiments. Therefore, it is crucial to\ndetermine the superconducting properties of these candidate phases. In a recent\nstudy, we reported the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24 phase, which\nwe believe to be a strong candidate for metallization via band gap closure [M.\nDogan et al., arXiv:2107.03889 (2021)].

While past work has yielded valuable results\non politicians' use of imagery in social media, that work has focused primarily\non photographic media, which may not be sufficient given the variety of visual\nmedia shared in such spaces (e.g., infographics, illustrations, or memes).\nLeveraging three popular deep learning models to characterize politicians'\nvisuals, this work uses clustering to identify eight types of visual media\nshared on Twitter, several of which are not photographic in nature. Results\nalso show individual politicians share a variety of these types, and the\ndistributions of their imagery across these clusters is correlated with their\noverall ideological position -- e.g., liberal politicians appear to share a\nlarger proportion of infographic-style images, and conservative politicians\nappear to share more patriotic imagery. At the same time, manual assessment\nreveals that these image characterization models group images with vastly\ndifferent semantic meaning into the same clusters, as confirmed in a post-hoc\nanalysis of hateful memetic imagery. These results suggest that, while\nimage-characterization techniques do identify general types of imagery that\ncorrelate with political ideology, these methods miss critical semantic -- and\ntherefore politically relevant -- differences among images. Consequently, care\nshould be taken when dealing with the varieties of imagery shared in online\nspaces, especially in political contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 04:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 19:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The research mainly focuses on atom-level\nhomogeneous molecular graphs, ignoring the rich information in subgraphs or\nmotifs. However, it has been widely accepted that substructures play a dominant\nrole in identifying and determining molecular properties. To address such\nissues, we formulate heterogeneous molecular graphs (HMGs), and introduce a\nnovel architecture to exploit both molecular motifs and 3D geometry. Precisely,\nwe extract functional groups as motifs for small molecules and employ\nreinforcement learning to adaptively select quaternary amino acids as motif\ncandidates for proteins. Then HMGs are constructed with both atom-level and\nmotif-level nodes. To better accommodate those HMGs, we introduce a variant of\nTransformer named Molformer, which adopts a heterogeneous self-attention layer\nto distinguish the interactions between multi-level nodes. Besides, it is also\ncoupled with a multi-scale mechanism to capture fine-grained local patterns\nwith increasing contextual scales. An attentive farthest point sampling\nalgorithm is also proposed to obtain the molecular representations.

First we show that the interplay between coupling and the Allee\neffect may change the nature of the dynamics, with regular periodic dynamics\nbecoming chaotic in a range of Allee parameters and coupling strengths.\nFurther, the growth in the vegetation population displays an explosive blow-up\nbeyond a critical value of coupling strength and Allee parameter. Most\ninterestingly, we observe that beyond a threshold of coupling strength and\nAllee parameter, the population densities of all three species exhibit non-zero\nprobability of yielding extreme events. The emergence of extreme events in the\npredator populations in the patches is the most prevalent, and the probability\nof obtaining large deviations in the predator populations is not affected\nsignificantly by either the coupling strength or the Allee effect. In the\nabsence of the Allee effect the prey population in the coupled system exhibits\nno extreme events for low coupling strengths, but yields a sharp increase in\nextreme events after a critical strength of coupling. The vegetation population\nin the patches display a small finite probability of extreme events for strong\nenough coupling, only in the presence of Allee effect. Lastly we consider the\ninfluence of additive noise on the continued prevalence of extreme events. Very\nsignificantly, we find that noise suppresses the unbounded vegetation growth\nthat was induced by a combination of Allee effect and coupling. Further, we\ndemonstrate that noise mitigates extreme events in all three populations, and\nbeyond a noise level we do not observe any extreme events in the system at all.\nThis finding has important bearing on the potential observability of extreme\nevents in natural and laboratory systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 05:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Here we examined the\ncollision of two self-trapped atomic matter wave packets in an optical ring\ncavity, and abundant colliding phenomena have been found in the system.\nDepending on the magnitude of colliding velocity, the collision dynamics\nexhibit very different features compared with the cavity-free case. When the\ninitial colliding velocities of the two wave packets are small, they\ncorrelatedly oscillate around their initial equilibrium positions with a small\namplitude. Increasing the collision velocity leads to severe scattering of the\nBEC atoms; after the collision, the two self-trapped wave packets usually break\ninto small pieces. Interestingly, we found that such a medium velocity\ncollision is of great phase sensitivity, which may make the system useful in\nprecision matter wave interferometry. When the colliding velocity is further\nincreased, in the bad cavity limit, the two wave packets collide phenomenally\nsimilar to two classical particles -- they firstly approach each other, then\nseparate with their shape virtually maintained. However, beyond the bad cavity\nlimit, they experience severe spatial spreading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 05:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Trusted\nexecution environments (TEEs) have emerged as a promising solution to achieve\nprivacy-preserving learning. Unfortunately, TEEs' limited computing power\nrenders them not comparable to GPUs in performance. To improve the trade-off\namong privacy, computing performance, and model accuracy, we propose an\n\\emph{asymmetric} model decomposition framework, \\AsymML{}, to (1) accelerate\ntraining using parallel hardware; and (2) achieve a strong privacy guarantee\nusing TEEs and differential privacy (DP) with much less accuracy compromised\ncompared to DP-only methods.

We focus on stars with masses between 0.1 and 1 Solar\nmass, which are the main target of current and future missions to find\npotentially habitable planets. We find a linear relationship between the\nmass-loss rates and the stellar masses when changing the X-ray luminosity\naccordingly with the stellar mass.

A popular model smoothing method is\nthe Temporal Moving Average (TMA), which continuously averages the teacher\nparameters with the up-to-date student parameters. In this paper, we propose\n\"Spatial Ensemble\", a novel model smoothing mechanism in parallel with TMA.\nSpatial Ensemble randomly picks up a small fragment of the student model to\ndirectly replace the corresponding fragment of the teacher model.\nConsequentially, it stitches different fragments of historical student models\ninto a unity, yielding the \"Spatial Ensemble\" effect. Spatial Ensemble obtains\ncomparable student-teacher learning performance by itself and demonstrates\nvaluable complementarity with temporal moving average. Their integration, named\nSpatial-Temporal Smoothing, brings general (sometimes significant) improvement\nto the student-teacher learning framework on a variety of state-of-the-art\nmethods.

In these case studies, we\ncompare two distinct methods that were used in previous works to investigate\nthe variations of some characteristic physical parameters during the pre-flare\nstates of flaring ARs. These methods consider: i) the magnetic flux evolution\nand the magnetic helicity accumulation, and ii) the fractal and multi-fractal\nproperties of flux concentrations in ARs.

For example, measurements may evolve over time or have\nunaligned time profiles. The PARAFAC2 model has been successfully used to\nanalyze such data by allowing the underlying factor matrices in one mode (i.e.,\nthe evolving mode) to change across slices. The traditional approach to fit a\nPARAFAC2 model is to use an alternating least squares-based algorithm, which\nhandles the constant cross-product constraint of the PARAFAC2 model by\nimplicitly estimating the evolving factor matrices. This approach makes\nimposing regularization on these factor matrices challenging. There is\ncurrently no algorithm to flexibly impose such regularization with general\npenalty functions and hard constraints. In order to address this challenge and\nto avoid the implicit estimation, in this paper, we propose an algorithm for\nfitting PARAFAC2 based on alternating optimization with the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (AO-ADMM). With numerical experiments on\nsimulated data, we show that the proposed PARAFAC2 AO-ADMM approach allows for\nflexible constraints, recovers the underlying patterns accurately, and is\ncomputationally efficient compared to the state-of-the-art.

Prominences are maintained by the Lorentz force against the\ngravity, therefore reduction of the prominence mass due to the coronal rain may\ncause the change of the force balance and hence destabilisation of the\nstructures. We aim to study the observational evidence of the influence of\ncoronal rain on the stability of prominence and subsequent eruption of CMEs. We\nused the simultaneous observations from AIA/SDO and SECCHI/STEREO spacecrafts\nfrom different angles to follow the dynamics of prominence/filaments and to\nstudy the role of coronal rain in their destabilisation. Three different\nprominences/filaments observed during years 2011-2012 were analysed using\nobservations acquired by SDO and STEREO. In all three cases massive coronal\nrain from the prominence body led to the destabilisation of prominence and\nsubsequently to the eruption of CMEs. The upward rising of prominences\nconsisted in the slow and the fast rise phases. The coronal rain triggered the\ninitial slow rise of prominences, which led to the final instability (the fast\nrise phase) after 18-28 hours in all cases. The estimated mass flux carried by\ncoronal rain blobs showed that the prominences became unstable after 40 \\% of\nmass loss. We suggest that the initial slow rise phase was triggered by the\nmass loss of prominence due to massive coronal rain, while the fast rise phase,\ni.e. the consequent instability of prominences, was caused by the torus\ninstability and/or magnetic reconnection with overlying coronal field.\nTherefore, the coronal rain triggered the instability of prominences and\nconsequent CMEs. If this is the case, then the coronal rain can be used to\npredict the CMEs and hence to improve the space weather predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 09:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

As RL becomes ubiquitous and used in\ncritical and general public applications, it is essential to develop methods\nthat make it better understood and more interpretable. This study proposes a\nnovel approach to explain cooperative strategies in multiagent RL using Shapley\nvalues, a game theory concept used in XAI that successfully explains the\nrationale behind decisions taken by Machine Learning algorithms. Through\ntesting common assumptions of this technique in two cooperation-centered\nsocially challenging multi-agent environments environments, this article argues\nthat Shapley values are a pertinent way to evaluate the contribution of players\nin a cooperative multi-agent RL context.

The present study is not\nfocusing on data acquisition where scanning is performed. The Adaptive Gradient\nDirections (AGD) approach is extended to refine the position and area of the\ngrid, resulting in an admissible reduction in angular error. We begin with the\ngradient directions distributed uniformly inside a grid of bigger size and with\nlarger spacing between the points. Both (size of the grid and spacing between\nthe points) reduce iteratively. The proposed algorithm ensures that the actual\nposition of fiber comes inside the grid at each iteration, unlike as in the AGD\napproach. As a result, the solution tends to actual orientation in each\niteration followed by better estimation of fibers. The proposed algorithm is\nvalidated by associating it with mixture of Gaussian diffusion and mixture of\nnon-central Wishart distribution models. The proposed approach significantly\nreduce the angular error for multiple computer-generated experiments on\nsynthetic simulations and real data. Moreover, we have also performed\nsimulations with fibers not residing in the XY-plane.

Autonomic anomaly detection (e.g., malfunctioning\nmachines and hazard situations) in a factory hall is on the list and expects to\nbe realized with massive IoT sensor deployments. In this paper, we consider\nacoustic data-based anomaly detection, which is widely used in factories\nbecause sound information reflects richer internal states while videos cannot;\nbesides, the capital investment of an audio system is more economically\nfriendly. However, a unique challenge of using audio data is that sounds are\nmixed when collecting thus source data separation is inevitable. A traditional\nway transfers audio data all to a centralized point for separation.\nNevertheless, such a centralized manner (i.e., data transferring and then\nanalyzing) may delay prompt reactions to critical anomalies. We demonstrate\nthat this job can be transformed into an in-network processing scheme and thus\nfurther accelerated. Specifically, we propose a progressive processing scheme\nwhere data separation jobs are distributed as microservices on intermediate\nnodes in parallel with data forwarding.

Due to the complex structure of data, mining\nstatistically significant temporal subgraphs, also known as temporal motifs, is\na challenging task. In this work, we present an efficient technique for\nextracting temporal motifs in temporal networks. Our method is based on the\nnovel notion of egocentric temporal neighborhoods, namely multi-layer\nstructures centered on an ego node. Each temporal layer of the structure\nconsists of the first-order neighborhood of the ego node, and corresponding\nnodes in sequential layers are connected by an edge. The strength of this\napproach lies in the possibility of encoding these structures into a unique bit\nvector, thus bypassing the problem of graph isomorphism in searching for\ntemporal motifs. This allows our algorithm to mine substantially larger motifs\nwith respect to alternative approaches. Furthermore, by bringing the focus on\nthe temporal dynamics of the interactions of a specific node, our model allows\nto mine temporal motifs which are visibly interpretable. Experiments on a\nnumber of complex networks of social interactions confirm the advantage of the\nproposed approach over alternative non-egocentric solutions.

Schamel, Plasma Phys. 14 (1972)\n905) and supported by recent Vlasov-Poisson simulations of realistic noisy\nplasmas, an extended framework is presented which not only covers the essential\nfeatures of coherent hole structures, but which also enables to make the\nnecessary corrections to the current wave theory. These corrections are long\noverdue and can be briefly summarized under the heading: loss of linear Vlasov\ndynamics when adequately addressing equilibrium states (i.e. failure of linear\nLandau theory and of continuous van Kampen spectra, respectively). A linear\nstability analysis for single harmonic waves that successfully incorporates\ntrapped particle effects (in contrast to previous analyses) shows an\nunconditional marginal stability independent of the drift between electrons and\nions, which irrevocably contradicts Landau's theory.

Thus, how to attain promising\nresults while largely reducing labeling works become an essential issue. In\nthis study, we propose a deep-learning based weakly supervised framework for\nsemantic segmentation of ALS point clouds, exploiting potential information\nfrom unlabeled data subject to incomplete and sparse labels. Entropy\nregularization is introduced to penalize the class overlap in predictive\nprobability.

This is the second paper of a series on Galactic OB groups that uses\nastrometric and photometric data from Gaia and spectral classifications from\nGOSSS and LiLiMaRlin.

The two aims of this paper are to revise the results for the sample\nfrom paper I using Gaia EDR3 data and to expand the sample of analyzed stellar\ngroups to 26, from Villafranca O-001 to Villafranca O-026.\n  METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O stars and an\nupdated version of the method in paper 0 of this series, combining Gaia EDR3\nG+GBP+GRP photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign\nmemberships and measure distances. We present 99 spectra from GOSSS and 32 from\nLiLiMaRlin for stars in the analyzed groups or in their foreground.\n  RESULTS. We derive distances to the 26 stellar groups with unprecedented\nprecision and accuracy, with total uncertainties <1% within 1 kpc and of ~3%\naround 3 kpc, values that are almost 4x better than for Gaia DR2.

The Lindegren zero point shows very small residuals as a function of\nmagnitude between individual and group parallaxes for G < 13 but significant\nones for brighter stars, especially blue ones.

Speech technology is\nconsidered a promising solution for the early diagnosis of AD and has been\nenthusiastically studied. Most recent works concentrate on the use of advanced\nBERT-like classifiers for AD detection. Input to these classifiers are speech\ntranscripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. The major\nchallenge is that the quality of transcription could degrade significantly\nunder complex acoustic conditions in the real world. The detection performance,\nin consequence, is largely limited. This paper tackles the problem via\ntailoring and adapting pre-trained neural-network based ASR model for the\ndownstream AD recognition task. Only bottom layers of the ASR model are\nretained.

Acoustic scene\nclassification (ASC) applications have so far remained unaffected by this\ndiscussion, but are now becoming increasingly used in real-world systems where\nfairness and reliability are critical aspects. In this work, we argue for the\nneed of a more holistic evaluation process for ASC models through disaggregated\nevaluations. This entails taking into account performance differences across\nseveral factors, such as city, location, and recording device. Although these\nfactors play a well-understood role in the performance of ASC models, most\nworks report single evaluation metrics taking into account all different strata\nof a particular dataset. We argue that metrics computed on specific\nsub-populations of the underlying data contain valuable information about the\nexpected real-world behaviour of proposed systems, and their reporting could\nimprove the transparency and trustability of such systems. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed evaluation process in uncovering\nunderspecification and fairness problems exhibited by several standard ML\narchitectures when trained on two widely-used ASC datasets. Our evaluation\nshows that all examined architectures exhibit large biases across all factors\ntaken into consideration, and in particular with respect to the recording\nlocation.

This is especially\ntrue for rare, heterogeneous and/or rapidly progressing diseases, which often\ninvolve small samples whose functional features may vary dramatically across\nsubjects and over time, making traditional group-difference analyses of limited\nutility. One such disease is ALS, which results in extreme motor function loss\nand eventual death. Here, we analyze a rich longitudinal dataset containing 190\nmotor task fMRI scans from 16 ALS patients and 22 age-matched HCs. We propose a\nnovel longitudinal extension to our cortical surface-based spatial Bayesian\nGLM, which has high power and precision to detect activations in individuals.\nUsing a series of longitudinal mixed-effects models to subsequently study the\nrelationship between activation and disease progression, we observe an inverted\nU-shaped trajectory: at relatively mild disability we observe enlarging\nactivations, while at higher disability we observe severely diminished\nactivation, reflecting progression toward complete motor function loss. We\nobserve distinct trajectories depending on clinical progression rate, with\nfaster progressors exhibiting more extreme hyper-activation and subsequent\nhypo-activation. These differential trajectories suggest that initial\nhyper-activation is likely attributable to loss of inhibitory neurons. By\ncontrast, earlier studies employing more limited sampling designs and using\ntraditional group-difference analysis approaches were only able to observe the\ninitial hyper-activation, which was assumed to be due to a compensatory\nprocess. This study provides a first example of how surface-based spatial\nBayesian modeling furthers scientific understanding of neurodegenerative\ndisease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 15:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

They are central to autonomous processes, such as locomotion,\nself-oscillations and rectification, in biological systems,designer materials\nand robotics. Yet, the feedback mechanism between elastic and active forces,\nand the possible emergence of collective behaviours in a mechanically stable\nelastic solid remains elusive. Here we introduce a minimal realization of an\nactive elastic solid, in which we characterize the emergence of selective and\ncollective actuation and fully map out the interplay between activity,\nelasticity and geometry. Polar active agents exert forces on the nodes of a two\ndimensional elastic lattice. The resulting displacement field nonlinearly\nreorients the active agents. For large enough coupling, a collective\noscillation of the lattice nodes around their equilibrium position emerges.\nOnly a few elastic modes are actuated and, crucially, they are not necessarily\nthe lowest energy ones. Combining experiments with the numerical and\ntheoretical analysis of an agents model, we unveil the bifurcation scenario and\nthe selection mechanism by which the collective actuation takes place. Our\nfindings may provide a new mechanism for oscillatory dynamics in biological\ntissues and specifically confluent cell monolayers.

The aim of\nthis thesis is to assess how well Computational Fluid Dynamics can capture it.\nA Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 2-dimensional domain was\nfirst used to simulate an offset jet on a flat plane. Whether it was for\n$k-\\omega$ SST or $k-\\epsilon$ turbulence model, a good prediction of the flow\nwas found. Since it is known that streamline curvature can have an important\nimpact on the numerical results, a jet blown tangentially to a cylinder was\nthen considered. Using the same approach as for the flat plane, with $k-\\omega$\nSST turbulence model, some of the flow features such as the separation location\nor velocity profiles near the jet exit were accurately predicted. However, the\njet development was overall poorly captured. A Curvature Correction was then\nintroduced in the turbulence model and if it did slightly improve the jet\ndevelopment, the negative impact on other quantities makes its benefits\nquestionable. Due to the known presence of longitudinal and spanwise vortices\nin the flow, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 3-dimensional\ndomain was attempted but was only able to reproduce the 2-dimensional results.\nAlthough if the longitudinal vortices are artificially generated at the inlet,\ntheir development is supported by the simulation. Finally, since the\nshortcomings of the numerical results obtained might be due to limitations of\nthe Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach, a Large Eddy Simulation was\nattempted. Unfortunately, due to time and computational restrictions a fully\ndeveloped flow could not be obtained, the methodology and preliminary results\nare however presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 13:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

This leads to a very closely curve fitting on the\ndistribution of the residuals, thereby reducing the effect of outliers.\nAdditionally, we formulate the robust optimisation problem using standard\nGaussian factors so that it can be solved by direct application of popular\nincremental estimation approaches such as iSAM.

This study\nis done by employing a semi-analytical mechanical model comprising an elastic\nsolution to a well-known Eshelby problem and a linear elastic fracture\nmechanics solution to a ring-shaped crack encircling a spheroidal inclusion.\nThe proposed method implies the availability of pre-existing micro-fissures\nwithin the aggregate.\n  The study reveals dependence of the crack growing potential on the spheroid's\nshape: the larger is the ASR pocket - the longer crack it can open. Two most\ncritical shapes, causing a highest stress intensity factor and developing the\nlongest crack, are a sphere and a spheroid with 1/4 aspect ratio respectively.\nThe size analysis of the problem suggests a critical spheroid's radius below\nwhich no crack growth is expected. For a chosen material properties and\nexpansion value, such radius lays in the range between 0.1 and 1 micrometer.\nIndependently of the expansion value and the shape of the pocket of ASR\nproduct, the maximum crack length has a power-law dependence on the size of a\nspheroid.\n  All the theoretical predictions are confirmed by a numerical model based on\nthe combination of the finite element method and cohesive element approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 14:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

A common goal in this context\nis to prevent accountability. This prevention of accountability can be\nproblematic, for example, if it leads to delinquents remaining undetected.\nHowever, imputability can also provide protection against discrimination. In\nmedical, religious or legal matters, this is of fundamental importance. Thus,\nwhen individuals actively establish anonymity, they do so mostly because they\nwant to prevent certain information about them, that is, sensitive and/or\ncompromising information, from being associated with their identities. By\nremaining inaccessible as individuals with respect to certain information about\nthem, they can engage in forms of exchange that would otherwise be impossible\nfor them. Examples include practices of exchange in (self-organized) therapy\ngroups, acting out stigmatized sexual preferences, the role of anonymity in the\nperforming arts, or political resistance movements. Given the variety of\nexamples in which personal anonymity is important, it is not surprising that it\nis primarily these personal dimensions that are the focus of current debates\nabout the increasing precariousness of anonymity in the face of new technical\npossibilities of data mining and processing. In this paper, we nevertheless -\nor precisely because of this - want to focus on another aspect of anonymity\nthat has received much less attention so far. Namely, we assume that\nresearching and working with and about anonymity can open up new perspectives\non and for contemporary forms of knowledge production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 20:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

In absence of sanctions, Iran's average\nannual growth could have been around 4-5 per cent, as compared to the 3 per\ncent realized.

Four\nrocks with different lithological characteristics namely, basalt, granite,\nsandstone and marble are selected. The Brazilian disc experiments are performed\nover a range of strain rates from 10-5 /s to 2.7x101 /s using a hydraulic\nloading frame and a split-Hopkinson bar. Over the range of strain rates, our\nmeasurements of dynamic strength increase are in good agreement with the\nuniversal theoretical scaling relationship of Kimberley et al. (2013). Dynamic\nfragmentation during a split tension mode receives very little attention and\nnot much information is available about the generated fragment size\ndistributions. The fragments fall into two distinct groups based on the nature\nof failure, coarser primary fragments and finer secondary fragments. The degree\nof fragmentation is assessed in terms of characteristic strain rate and is\ncompared with existing theoretical tensile fragmentation models. The primary\nfragment size are less sensitive to strain rate, particularly at lower strain\nrates. The size of secondary fragment has a strong strain rate dependency over\nthe entire testing range. Marble and sandstone are found to generate more\npulverized secondary debris when compared to basalt and granite. Further, it is\nshown that the mean fragment sizes of primary and secondary fragments are well\ndescribed by a power law function of strain rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 09:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

To bridge this gap, we used a database of\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) magnetopause crossings to analyze diamagnetic\ncurrent densities and their contributions across the dayside and flank\nmagnetopause. Our results indicate that the ion temperature gradient component\nmakes up to 37% of the ion diamagnetic current density along the magnetopause\nand typically opposes the classical Chapman-Ferraro current direction,\ninterfering destructively with the density gradient component, thus lowering\nthe total diamagnetic current density. This effect is most pronounced on the\nflank magnetopause. The electron diamagnetic current was found to be 5 to 14\ntimes weaker than the ion diamagnetic current on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 16:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 19:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}
