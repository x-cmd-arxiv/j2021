In the\nabsence of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. vaccines), the only way to\ncontrol a given disease is to move this threshold by non-pharmaceutical\ninterventions like social distancing, past the epidemic threshold corresponding\nto the disease, thereby tipping the system from epidemic into a non-epidemic\nregime. Modeling the disease as a spreading process on a social graph, social\ndistancing can be modeled by removing some of the graphs links. It has been\nconjectured that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the\nresulting graph corresponds to the systems epidemic threshold. Here we use a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to study those link removals that do\nwell at reducing the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The MCMC\nmethod generates samples from the relative canonical network ensemble with a\ndefined expectation value of $\\lambda_{max}$. We call this the\n\"well-controlling network ensemble\" (WCNE) and compare its structure to\nrandomly thinned networks with the same link density. We observe that networks\nin the WCNE tend to be more homogeneous in the degree distribution and use this\ninsight to define two ad-hoc removal strategies, which also substantially\nreduce the largest eigenvalue. A targeted removal of 80\\% of links can be as\neffective as a random removal of 90\\%, leaving individuals with twice as many\ncontacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 19:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Because of this\nintermediate position, the collapse process cannot be examined with the\nformalism of the quantum mechanics (QM), neither with that of classical\nmechanics. This fact makes some physicists to propose interpretations of QM,\nwhich avoid this postulate. However, the common procedure used in that, is\nmaking assumptions incompatible with the QM formalism. The present work\ndiscusses the most popular interpretations. It is shown that because of such\nassumptions those interpretations fail, i.e. predict for some experiments\nresults which differ from the QM predictions. Despite of that, special\nattention is called to a proposal of S. Gao, the only one which addresses and\ntries to solve an obvious and major contradiction. A couple of theorems are\nproved for showing that the collapse postulate is necessary in the QM. Although\nnonexplainable with the quantum formalism this postulate cannot be denied,\notherwise one comes to conclusions which disagree with the QM. It is also\nproved here that the idea of collapse at a distance is problematic especially\nin relativistic cases, and is a misunderstanding. Namely, in an entanglement of\ntwo quantum systems, assuming that the measurement of one of the systems\n(accompanied by collapse of that system on one of its states) collapses the\nother system too without the second system being measured, leads to a\ncontradiction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

The observed variations toward different\nregions in space are believed to be caused by contributions of different\nclasses of PAH molecules, i.e. with respect to their size, structure, and\ncharge state. Laboratory spectra of members of these classes are needed to\ncompare them to observations and to benchmark quantum-chemically computed\nspectra of these species. In this paper we present the experimental infrared\nspectra of three different PAH dications, naphthalene$^{2+}$,\nanthracene$^{2+}$, and phenanthrene$^{2+}$, in the vibrational fingerprint\nregion 500-1700~cm$^{-1}$. The dications were produced by electron impact\nionization of the vapors with 70 eV electrons, and they remained stable against\ndissociation and Coulomb explosion. The vibrational spectra were obtained by IR\npredissociation of the PAH$^{2+}$ complexed with neon in a 22-pole cryogenic\nion trap setup coupled to a free-electron infrared laser at the Free-Electron\nLasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) Laboratory. We performed anharmonic\ndensity-functional theory calculations for both singly and doubly charged\nstates of the three molecules. The experimental band positions showed excellent\nagreement with the calculated band positions of the singlet electronic ground\nstate for all three doubly charged species, indicating its higher stability\nover the triplet state. The presence of several strong combination bands and\nadditional weaker features in the recorded spectra, especially in the\n10-15~$\\mu$m region of the mid-IR spectrum, required anharmonic calculations to\nunderstand their effects on the total integrated intensity for the different\ncharge states. These measurements, in tandem with theoretical calculations,\nwill help in the identification of this specific class of doubly-charged PAHs\nas carriers of AIBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The estimation process is formulated as a p-norm regression\nproblem in hidden space. By utilizing the differentiation of the solution of\nthis regression problem, the parameters of the whole framework can be trained\nin an end-to-end manner. While most previous works are only applicable to the\nsupervised training and single-shot generation scenario, our method can be\neasily adapted to unsupervised training and multi-shot generation.

Once an exercise is performed, the information of pose and\nmovement per frame is stored in the GWR. For every frame, the current pose and\nmotion pair is compared against a predicted output of the GWR, allowing for\nfeedback not only on the pose but also on the velocity of the motion. In a\npractical scenario, a physical exercise is performed by an expert like a\nphysiotherapist and then used as a reference for a humanoid robot like Pepper\nto give feedback on a patient's execution of the same exercise. This approach,\nhowever, comes with two challenges. First, the distance from the humanoid robot\nand the position of the user in the camera's view of the humanoid robot have to\nbe considered by the GWR as well, requiring a robustness against the user's\npositioning in the field of view of the humanoid robot. Second, since both the\npose and motion are dependent on the body measurements of the original\nperformer, the expert's exercise cannot be easily used as a reference. This\npaper tackles the first challenge by designing an architecture that allows for\ntolerances in translation and rotations regarding the center of the field of\nview. For the second challenge, we allow the GWR to grow online on incremental\ndata. For evaluation, we created a novel exercise dataset with virtual avatars\ncalled the Virtual-Squat dataset. Overall, we claim that our novel architecture\nbased on the GWR can use a learned exercise reference for different body\nvariations through continual online learning, while preventing catastrophic\nforgetting, enabling for an engaging long-term human-robot interaction with a\nhumanoid robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 17:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

The recently proposed LightGCN and LR-GCN alleviate\nthis problem to some extent, however, we argue that they overlook an important\nfactor for the over-smoothing problem in recommendation, that is, high-order\nneighboring users with no common interests of a user can be also involved in\nthe user's embedding learning in the graph convolution operation.

Based on these properties, we propose a simple\nconvolutional architecture, rooted in tools from algebraic topology, for the\nproblem of trajectory prediction, and show that it obeys all three of these\nproperties when an odd, nonlinear activation function is used. We then\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in extrapolating\ntrajectories on synthetic and real datasets, with particular emphasis on the\ngains in generalizability to unseen trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 17:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 16:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

To filter out measurement errors and seasonality, a\nnovel unobserved components (UC) model is set up. It specifies the log contact\nrate as a latent, fractionally integrated process of unknown integration order.\nThe fractional specification reflects key characteristics of aggregate social\nbehavior such as strong persistence and gradual adjustments to new information.\nA computationally simple modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is\ntermed the fractional filter. It allows to estimate UC models with richer\nlong-run dynamics, and provides a closed-form expression for the prediction\nerror of UC models. Based on the latter, a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS)\nestimator for the model parameters is set up that is shown to be consistent and\nasymptotically normally distributed. The resulting contact rate estimates for\nseveral countries are well in line with the chronology of the pandemic, and\nallow to identify different contact regimes generated by policy interventions.\nAs the fractional filter is shown to provide precise contact rate estimates at\nthe end of the sample, it bears great potential for monitoring the pandemic in\nreal time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 17:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

Bansal and Umboh [BU17] gave an $O(\\alpha)$-approximation\nLP rounding algorithm, which also translates into a near-linear time algorithm\nusing general-purpose approximation results for explicit mixed packing and\ncovering or pure covering LPs [KY14, You14, AZO19, Qua10]. Moreover, [BU17]\nshowed that it is NP-hard to achieve an asymptotic improvement for the\napproximation factor. On the other hand, the previous two non-LP-based\nalgorithms, by Lenzen and Wattenhofer [LW10], and Jones et al.

We resolve both questions in\nthe affirmative, and en route achieve algorithms that are faster than the\nstate-of-the-art LP-based algorithms. More specifically, our contribution is\ntwo-fold: 1. In the centralized setting, we provide a surprisingly simple\ncombinatorial algorithm that is asymptotically optimal in terms of both\napproximation factor and running time: an $O(\\alpha)$-approximation in linear\ntime. 2. Based on our centralized algorithm, we design a distributed\ncombinatorial $O(\\alpha)$-approximation algorithm in the CONGEST model that\nruns in $O(\\alpha\\log n )$ rounds with high probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 18:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 15:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 03:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Otherwise, quasi-elastic scattering leads to\nstrong, down-to-few-meV kinetic energy scattering losses from the direct\nphotoelectron features, which manifest in severely distorted intrinsic\nphotoelectron peak shapes. The associated cross-over point from predominant\n(known) electronically inelastic to quasi-elastic scattering seems to arise at\nsurprisingly large electron kinetic energies, of approximately 10-14 eV.\nConcomitantly, we present evidence for the onset of indirect, autoionization\nphenomena (occurring via superexcited states) within a few eV of the primary\nand secondary ionization thresholds.

In this paper, we introduce Mine Your Own vieW (MYOW), a new approach\nfor self-supervised learning that looks within the dataset to define diverse\ntargets for prediction. The idea behind our approach is to actively mine views,\nfinding samples that are neighbors in the representation space of the network,\nand then predict, from one sample's latent representation, the representation\nof a nearby sample.

We explain how these root bundles are linked to inequivalent F-theory\ngauge potentials of a $G_4$-flux.\n  While this observation is interesting in its own right, it is particularly\nvaluable for F-theory Standard Model constructions. In aiming for MSSMs, it is\ndesired to argue for the absence of vector-like exotics.

While existence proofs guarantee that a\nsuitable witness can be constructed for every entangled state, such assurances\ndo not apply to fidelity witnesses. Recent results have found that entangled\nstates that cannot be detected by a fidelity witness, known as unfaithful\nstates, are exceedingly common among bipartite states. In this paper, we show\nthat even among two-qubit states, the simplest of all entangled states,\nunfaithful states can be created through a suitable application of decoherence\nand filtering to a Bell state. We also show that the faithfulness is not\nmonotonic to entanglement, as measured by the concurrence. Finally, we\nexperimentally verify our predictions using polarization-entangled photons and\nspecifically demonstrate a situation where an unfaithful state is brought to\nfaithfulness at the expense of further reducing the entanglement of the state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 19:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 11:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

It\nis possible for an adversary to reach the underlying Control Area Network (CAN)\nthrough a compromised node or external-facing network interface, and launch\nmasquerading attacks that can compromise road and passenger safety. Due to lack\nof native authentication in the CAN protocol, an approach to detect\nmasquerading attacks is to use ECU voltage fingerprinting schemes to verify\nthat the messages are sent by authentic ECUs.

We evaluate BPLight-CNN\nusing a photonic CAD framework (IPKISS) on deep learning benchmark models\nincluding LeNet and VGG-Net.

Most\nsuch algorithms have parameters, for example the regularization parameter in\nLASSO, which need to be chosen carefully for optimal performance. These\nparameters can be chosen based on assumptions on the noise level or signal\nsparsity, but this knowledge may often be unavailable. In such cases, cross\nvalidation (CV) can be used to choose these parameters in a purely data-driven\nfashion. Previous work analysing the use of CV in CS has been based on the\n$\\ell_2$ cross-validation error with Gaussian measurement noise.

State-of-the-art works have made considerable progress toward applying\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to standard (rectilinear) images. However,\nthe large FoV cameras used in autonomous vehicles produce fisheye images\ncharacterized by strong geometric distortion. This work demonstrates that a CNN\ntrained on standard images can be readily adapted to fisheye images, which is\ncrucial in real-world applications where time-consuming real-time data\ntransformation must be avoided. Our adaptation protocol mainly relies on\nmodifying the support of the convolutions by using their deformable equivalents\non top of pre-existing layers. We prove that tuning an optimal support only\nrequires a limited amount of labeled fisheye images, as a small number of\ntraining samples is sufficient to significantly improve an existing model's\nperformance on wide-angle images. Furthermore, we show that finetuning the\nweights of the network is not necessary to achieve high performance once the\ndeformable components are learned.

By extending on the idea of the Fritchman channel model,\na novel error category-based methodology in determining channel characteristics\nis described for memory channels which contain insertion, deletion, and\nsubstitution errors. The practicality of such a methodology is reinforced by\nmaking use of real communication data from a visible light communication\nsystem. Simulation results show that the error-free and error runs using this\nnew method of defining the channel clearly deviates from the Davey-Mackay\nsynchronisation model which is memoryless in nature. This further emphasises\nthe inherent memory in these synchronisation channels which we are now able to\ncharacterise. Additionally, a new method to determine the parameters of a\nsynchronisation memory channel using the Levenshtein distance metric is\ndetailed. This method of channel modelling allows for more realistic\ncommunication models to be simulated and can easily extend to other areas of\nresearch such as DNA barcoding in the medical domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 00:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Recently, it has been\nobserved that distant brain areas which are not directly connected by neural\nlinks also experience synchronization. Such synchronization between remote\nregions is sometimes due to the presence of a mediating region connecting them,\ne.g., \\textit{the thalamus}. The underlying network structure of this\nphenomenon is star-like and motivates us to study the \\textit{remote\nsynchronization} of Kuramoto oscillators, {modeling neural dynamics}, coupled\nby a directed star network, for which peripheral oscillators get phase\nsynchronized, remaining the accommodating central mediator at a different\nphase. We show that the symmetry of the coupling strengths of the outgoing\nlinks from the central oscillator plays a crucial role in enabling stable\nremote synchronization. We also consider the case when there is a phase shift\nin the model which results from synaptic and conduction delays. Sufficient\nconditions on the coupling strengths are obtained to ensure the stability of\nremotely synchronized states.

Therefore, beam\nalignment (BA) strategies are used to find the direction of these channel\nclusters and adjust the width of the beam used for data transmission. In this\nwork, a single-user uplink scenario where the channel has one dominant cluster\nis considered. It is assumed that the user transmits a set of BA packets over a\nfixed duration. Meanwhile, the base-station (BS) uses different probing beams\nto scan different angular regions. Since the BS measurements are noisy, it is\nnot possible to find a narrow beam that includes the angle of arrival (AoA) of\nthe user with probability one. Therefore, the BS allocates a narrow beam to the\nuser which includes the AoA of the user with a predetermined error probability\nwhile minimizing the expected beamwidth of the allocated beam. Due to\nintractability of this noisy BA problem, here this problem is posed as an\nend-to-end optimization of a deep neural network (DNN) and effects of different\nloss functions are discussed and investigated. It is observed that the proposed\nDNN based BA, at high SNRs, achieves a performance close to that of the optimal\nBA when there is no-noise and for all SNRs, outperforms state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 02:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

To bridge such a gap,\nwe propose a new framework named ENIGMA for estimating human evaluation scores\nbased on recent advances of off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning.\nENIGMA only requires a handful of pre-collected experience data, and therefore\ndoes not involve human interaction with the target policy during the\nevaluation, making automatic evaluations feasible.

As a result, as\nlong as the equilibrium point of interest of the closed loop system is\nasymptotically stable, the generated trajectories are guaranteed to be safe.\nConsequently, a conflict between control objectives and safety constraints is\nsubstantially avoided. To show the efficacy of the proposed technique, we\nemploy barrier states with the simple pole placement method to design safe\nlinear controls. Nonlinear optimal control is subsequently employed to fulfill\nsafety, stability and performance objectives by solving the associated\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) which minimizes a cost functional that can\ninvolve the BaS.

A framework is proposed to interpret the markedly\nlarge frequency and amplitude variation rates of the third mode, in which we\nemploy a new pulsation mode (resonating integration mode) generated by the\nresonance between a radial p-mode and a nonradial mixed mode. Moreover, a\nglobal analysis of the interactions between the three independent pulsation\nmodes and their harmonics/combinations is performed based on the interaction\ndiagrams of their amplitudes and phases, which would be a useful tool for the\nfuture asteroseismology research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 05:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 15:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

These heuristics are reminiscent of\ntechniques from robust statistics, commonly used for estimation in outlier-rich\n(``heavy-tailed'') regimes. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical\nstudy to characterize the heavy-tailed nature of the gradients of the PPO\nsurrogate reward function. We demonstrate that the gradients, especially for\nthe actor network, exhibit pronounced heavy-tailedness and that it increases as\nthe agent's policy diverges from the behavioral policy (i.e., as the agent goes\nfurther off policy). Further examination implicates the likelihood ratios and\nadvantages in the surrogate reward as the main sources of the observed\nheavy-tailedness. We then highlight issues arising due to the heavy-tailed\nnature of the gradients. In this light, we study the effects of the standard\nPPO clipping heuristics, demonstrating that these tricks primarily serve to\noffset heavy-tailedness in gradients. Thus motivated, we propose incorporating\nGMOM, a high-dimensional robust estimator, into PPO as a substitute for three\nclipping tricks. Despite requiring less hyperparameter tuning, our method\nmatches the performance of PPO (with all heuristics enabled) on a battery of\nMuJoCo continuous control tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 05:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 03:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Different studies have shown that increasing temperature can\nplay a crucial role in the spread of the virus. Most of these studies were\nlimited to winter or moderate temperature levels and were conducted using\nconventional models. However, traditional models are too simplistic to\ninvestigate complex, non-linear relationships and suffer from some\nrestrictions. Therefore, we employed copula models to examine the impact of\nhigh temperatures on virus transmission. The findings from the copula models\nshowed that there was a weak to moderate effect of temperature on the number of\ninfections and the effect almost vanished under a lockdown policy. Therefore,\nthis study provides new insight into the relationship between COVID-19 and\ntemperature, both with and without social isolation practices. Such results can\nlead to improvements in our understanding of this new virus. In particular, the\nresults derived from the copula models examined here, unlike existing\ntraditional models, provide evidence that there is no substantial influence of\nhigh temperatures on the active COVID-19 outbreak situation. In addition, the\nresults indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 is strongly influenced by\nsocial isolation practices.

Existing deep architectures are either\nmanually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search\n(NAS) methods. However, even a well-designed/searched architecture may still\ncontain many nonsignificant or redundant modules/operations. Thus, it is\nnecessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the\nperformance without introducing extra computational cost. To this end, we have\nproposed a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) method which casts the\noptimization problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and seeks to replace\nthe redundant operations with more efficient operations, such as skip or null\nconnection. Note that NAT only considers a small number of possible transitions\nand thus comes with a limited search/transition space. As a result, such a\nsmall search space may hamper the performance of architecture optimization. To\naddress this issue, we propose a Neural Architecture Transformer++ (NAT++)\nmethod which further enlarges the set of candidate transitions to improve the\nperformance of architecture optimization. Specifically, we present a two-level\ntransition rule to obtain valid transitions, i.e., allowing operations to have\nmore efficient types (e.g., convolution->separable convolution) or smaller\nkernel sizes (e.g., 5x5->3x3). Note that different operations may have\ndifferent valid transitions. We further propose a Binary-Masked Softmax\n(BMSoftmax) layer to omit the possible invalid transitions.

Our results contribute to recent theoretical studies on\nthe interplay between infinitely wide deep neural networks and Gaussian\nprocesses by establishing weak convergence in function-space with respect to a\nstronger metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 10:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

During the conversion from\nchemical energy to electrical energy, the species diffusion is generally linked\nto the rate of exchange, and hence to the performance of the conversion device.\nAlternatively, the transmission of the electric field diffuses the species when\nit passes through any medium. The consequences of this effect can be regulated\nto attune surface nano-patterns. Otherwise, uncontrolled morphologies may lead\nto permanent degradation of the metallic conductors. Therefore, the\nunderstanding of the material behavior, in the presence of the driving forces\nof the diffusional species, is of scientific interest. The presented\ndissertation proposes to investigate one example of species diffusion in each\ncase, during energy conversion and transmission. Specifically, the objective of\nthe study is to explore the lithium insertion into the cathode electrode of\nlithium-ion batteries and the morphological evolution of inclusions, while\npropagating under the electromigration in the metallic conductors.

To\nsolve this problem, many different approaches have been proposed and among the\nvarious methods, variational ones are extremely popular. These approaches are\ncharacterized by substituting the original problem with a minimization one\nwhere the functional is composed of two terms, a data fidelity term and a\nregularization term. In this paper we propose, in the classical $\\ell^2-\\ell^1$\nminimization with the non-negativity constraint of the solution, the use of the\ngraph Laplacian as regularization operator. Firstly, we describe how to\nconstruct the graph Laplacian from the observed noisy and blurred image. Once\nthe graph Laplacian has been built, we solve efficiently the proposed\nminimization problem splitting the convolution operator and the graph Laplacian\nby the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Some selected\nnumerical examples show the good performances of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 12:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Although a DNN has potential power\nto construct DNN-based TTS with emotional expressions and some DNN-based TTS\nsystems have demonstrated satisfactory performances in the expression of the\ndiversity of human speech, it is necessary and troublesome to collect emotional\nspeech uttered by target speakers. To solve this issue, we propose\narchitectures to separately train the speaker feature and the emotional feature\nand to synthesize speech with any combined quality of speakers and emotions.\nThe architectures are parallel model (PM), serial model (SM), auxiliary input\nmodel (AIM), and hybrid models (PM&AIM and SM&AIM).

Such heavy tails potentially result in iterates with\ndiverging variance, which hinders the use of conventional convergence analysis\ntechniques that rely on the existence of the second-order moments. In this\npaper, we provide convergence guarantees for SGD under a state-dependent and\nheavy-tailed noise with a potentially infinite variance, for a class of\nstrongly convex objectives. In the case where the $p$-th moment of the noise\nexists for some $p\\in [1,2)$, we first identify a condition on the Hessian,\ncoined '$p$-positive (semi-)definiteness', that leads to an interesting\ninterpolation between positive semi-definite matrices ($p=2$) and diagonally\ndominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries ($p=1$). Under this\ncondition, we then provide a convergence rate for the distance to the global\noptimum in $L^p$. Furthermore, we provide a generalized central limit theorem,\nwhich shows that the properly scaled Polyak-Ruppert averaging converges weakly\nto a multivariate $\\alpha$-stable random vector. Our results indicate that even\nunder heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, SGD can converge to the global\noptimum without necessitating any modification neither to the loss function or\nto the algorithm itself, as typically required in robust statistics.

New space-borne observatories, large\norbital outposts, and even futuristic on-orbit manufacturing will be enabled by\nrobotic assembly of space structures using techniques like on-orbit additive\nmanufacturing which can provide flexibility in constructing and even repairing\ncomplex hardware. However, the dynamics underlying the robotic assembler during\nmanipulation may operate under inertial uncertainties. Thus, inertial\nestimation of the robot and the manipulated component system must be considered\nduring structural assembly. The contribution of this work is to address both\nthe motion planning and control for robotic assembly with consideration of the\ninertial estimation of the combined free-flying robotic assembler and\nadditively manufactured component system. Specifically, the Linear Quadratic\nRegulator Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees (LQR-RRT*) and dynamically\nfeasible path smoothing are used to obtain obstacle-free trajectories for the\nsystem. Further, model learning is incorporated explicitly into the planning\nstages via approximation of the continuous system and accompanying reward of\nperforming safe, objective-oriented motion. Remaining uncertainty can then be\ndealt with using robust tube model predictive control. By obtaining controlled\ntrajectories that consider both obstacle avoidance and learning of the inertial\nproperties of the free-flyer and manipulated component system, the free-flyer\nrapidly considers and plans the construction of space structures with enhanced\nsystem knowledge. The approach naturally generalizes to repairing, refueling,\nand re-provisioning space structure components while providing optimal\ncollision-free trajectories under e.g., inertial uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 13:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

We describe two scenarios, in which\noptical nonlinearities arise either from direct photon coupling to excitons in\nexcited Rydberg states or from resonant two-photon excitation of Rydberg\nexcitons with finite-range interactions. The latter case yields conditions of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency and thereby provides an efficient\nmechanism for single-photon switching between high transmission and reflectance\nof the monolayer, with a tunable dynamical timescale of the emerging\nphoton-photon interactions. Remarkably, it turns out that the resulting high\ndegree of photon correlations remains virtually unaffected by Rydberg-state\ndecoherence, in excess of non-radiative decoherence observed for ground-state\nexcitons in two-dimensional semiconductors.

The product inequality\nfor mean dimension is well known: $\\mathrm{mdim}(X\\times\nY,G)\\le\\mathrm{mdim}(X,G)+\\mathrm{mdim}(Y,G)$, while it was unknown for a long\ntime if the product inequality could be an equality. In 2019, Masaki Tsukamoto\nconstructed the first example of two different continuous actions of $G$ on\ncompact metrizable spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively, such that the product\ninequality becomes strict. However, there is still one longstanding problem\nwhich remains open in this direction, asking if there exists a continuous\naction of $G$ on some compact metrizable space $X$ such that\n$\\mathrm{mdim}(X\\times X,G)<2\\cdot\\mathrm{mdim}(X,G)$. We solve this problem.\nSomewhat surprisingly, we prove, in contrast to (topological) dimension theory,\na rather satisfactory theorem: If an infinite (countable discrete) amenable\ngroup $G$ acts continuously on a compact metrizable space $X$, then we have\n$\\mathrm{mdim}(X^n,G)=n\\cdot\\mathrm{mdim}(X,G)$, for any positive integer $n$.\nOur product formula for mean dimension, together with the example and\ninequality (stated previously), eventually allows mean dimension of product\nactions to be fully understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 14:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 17:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 14:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

This leads to high\nexpressive power, on the level of existential second-order logic. As an\nalternative, Baltag and van Benthem have proposed a local variant of dependence\nlogic, called logic of functional dependence (LFD). While its semantics is also\nbased on a team, the formulae are evaluated locally on just one of its\nassignments, and the team just serves as the supply of the possible assignments\nthat are taken into account in the evaluation process. This logic thus relies\non the modal perspective of generalized assignments semantics, and can be seen\nas a fragment of first-order logic. For the variant of LFD without equality,\nthe satisfiability problem is decidable.\n  We extend the idea of localising logics of dependence and independence in a\nsystematic way, taking into account local variants of standard atomic\ndependency properties: besides dependence and independence, also inclusion,\nexclusion, and anonymity. We study model-theoretic and algorithmic questions of\nthe localised logics, and also resolve some of the questions that had been left\nopen by Baltag and van Benthem. In particular, we study decidability issues of\nthe local logics, and prove that satisfiability of LFD with equality is\nundecidable.

Although this has enabled many benefits,\nit also infringes on personal privacy. A promising direction in research on\nobfuscation of facial images has been the work in the k-same family of methods\nwhich employ the concept of k-anonymity from database privacy. However, there\nare a number of deficiencies of k-anonymity that carry over to the k-same\nmethods, detracting from their usefulness in practice. In this paper, we first\noutline several of these deficiencies and discuss their implications in the\ncontext of facial obfuscation. We then develop a framework through which we\nobtain a formal differentially private guarantee for the obfuscation of facial\nimages in generative machine learning models. Our approach provides a provable\nprivacy guarantee that is not susceptible to the outlined deficiencies of\nk-same obfuscation and produces photo-realistic obfuscated output. In addition,\nwe demonstrate through experimental comparisons that our approach can achieve\ncomparable utility to k-same obfuscation in terms of preservation of useful\nfeatures in the images. Furthermore, we propose a method to achieve\ndifferential privacy for any image (i.e., without restriction to facial images)\nthrough the direct modification of pixel intensities. Although the addition of\nnoise to pixel intensities does not provide the high visual quality obtained\nvia generative machine learning models, it offers greater versatility by\neliminating the need for a trained model. We demonstrate that our proposed use\nof the exponential mechanism in this context is able to provide superior visual\nquality to pixel-space obfuscation using the Laplace mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

In this regard, an assumption is\nmade about a possible mechanism for the formation of dark matter condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 11:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

A major challenge is to efficiently learn a representation\nthat approximates the true joint distribution of contextual, social, and\ntemporal information to enable planning. We propose Latent Variable Sequential\nSet Transformers which are encoder-decoder architectures that generate\nscene-consistent multi-agent trajectories. We refer to these architectures as\n\"AutoBots\". The encoder is a stack of interleaved temporal and social\nmulti-head self-attention (MHSA) modules which alternately perform equivariant\nprocessing across the temporal and social dimensions. The decoder employs\nlearnable seed parameters in combination with temporal and social MHSA modules\nallowing it to perform inference over the entire future scene in a single\nforward pass efficiently. AutoBots can produce either the trajectory of one\nego-agent or a distribution over the future trajectories for all agents in the\nscene. For the single-agent prediction case, our model achieves top results on\nthe global nuScenes vehicle motion prediction leaderboard, and produces strong\nresults on the Argoverse vehicle prediction challenge. In the multi-agent\nsetting, we evaluate on the synthetic partition of TrajNet++ dataset to\nshowcase the model's socially-consistent predictions. We also demonstrate our\nmodel on general sequences of sets and provide illustrative experiments\nmodelling the sequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols\nin the Omniglot data. A distinguishing feature of AutoBots is that all models\nare trainable on a single desktop GPU (1080 Ti) in under 48h.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 18:53:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 19:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 04:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

In particular, a Bayesian\nmulti-node bandit (MNB) model with adversarial costs is constructed and a new\nregret function is defined for this model. An algorithm called Thompson-Hedge\nalgorithm is presented to solve the problem and the superior performance of the\nproposed algorithm is proven in terms of the convergence rate of the regret\nfunction. The applicability of the algorithm to real smart grid scenarios is\nverified and the performance of the algorithm is also demonstrated by numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 10:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

In this study, we bring the\noperational perspective to the synchronization stability analysis by counting\nnot only full but also partial synchronization between nodes. To do so, we\nintroduce two distinct measures that estimate the operational resilience of\npower-grid nodes: functional stability and functional resistance. We\ndemonstrate the practical applicability of the measures in a model network\nmotif and an IEEE test power grid. As a case study of German power grid, we\nreveal that the modular structure of a power grid and particular unidirectional\ncurrent flow determine the distribution of the operational resilience of\npower-grid nodes.
