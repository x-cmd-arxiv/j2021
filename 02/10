Most\nexisting methods for news recommendation rely on implicit feedbacks like click\nfor inferring user interests and model training. However, click behaviors\nusually contain heavy noise, and cannot help infer complicated user interest\nsuch as dislike. Besides, the feed recommendation models trained solely on\nclick behaviors cannot optimize other objectives such as user engagement. In\nthis paper, we present a news feed recommendation method that can exploit\nvarious kinds of user feedbacks to enhance both user interest modeling and\nmodel training. We propose a unified user modeling framework to incorporate\nvarious explicit and implicit user feedbacks to infer both positive and\nnegative user interests. In addition, we propose a strong-to-weak attention\nnetwork that uses the representations of stronger feedbacks to distill positive\nand negative user interests from implicit weak feedbacks for accurate user\ninterest modeling. Besides, we propose a multi-feedback model training\nframework to learn an engagement-aware feed recommendation model. Extensive\nexperiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach can effectively\nimprove the model performance in terms of both news clicks and user engagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 16:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 16:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

VRI potential energy\nsurfaces have four critical points: a high energy saddle and a lower energy\nsaddle separating two wells. In between the two saddle points is a valley ridge\ninflection point that is the point where the potential energy surface geometry\nchanges from a valley to a ridge. The region between the two saddles forms a\nreaction channel and the dynamical issue of interest is how trajectories cross\nthe high energy saddle, evolve towards the lower energy saddle, and select a\nparticular well to enter.

Specifically, we\nconsider slow-fast systems with unknown diffusion coefficient and study the\nconvergence of the slow process in the limit of infinite scale separation. The\naim of our work is two-fold: Firstly, we want to propose a general framework\nfor averaging and homogenisation of multiscale systems with parametric\nuncertainties in the drift or in the diffusion coefficient. Secondly, we want\nto use this framework to quantify the uncertainty in the reduced system by\nderiving a limit equation that represents a worst-case scenario for any given\n(possibly path-dependent) quantity of interest. We do so by reformulating the\nslow-fast system as an optimal control problem in which the unknown parameter\nplays the role of a control variable that can take values in a closed bounded\nset. For systems with unknown diffusion coefficient, the underlying stochastic\ncontrol problem admits an interpretation in terms of a stochastic differential\nequation driven by a G-Brownian motion. We prove convergence of the slow\nprocess with respect to the nonlinear expectation on the probability space\ninduced by the G-Brownian motion. The idea here is to formulate the nonlinear\ndynamic programming equation of the underlying control problem as a\nforward-backward stochastic differential equation in the G-Brownian motion\nframework (in brief: G-FBSDE), for which convergence can be proved by standard\nmeans. We illustrate the theoretical findings with two simple numerical\nexamples, exploiting the connection between fully nonlinear dynamic programming\nequations and second-order BSDE (2BSDE): a linear quadratic Gaussian regulator\nproblem and a bilinear multiplicative triad that is a standard benchmark system\nin turbulence and climate modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 16:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) fairness\nmechanisms aim to give all agents both an ex-ante guarantee (such as getting\nthe proportional share in expectation) and an ex-post guarantee. Prior BoBW\nresults have focused on ex-post guarantees that are based on the \"up to one\nitem\" paradigm, such as envy-free up to one item (EF1). In this work we attempt\nto give every agent a high value ex-post, and specifically, a constant fraction\nof his maximin share (MMS). The up to one item paradigm fails to give such a\nguarantee, and it is not difficult to present examples in which previous BoBW\nmechanisms give agents only a $\\frac{1}{n}$ fraction of their MMS.\n  Our main result is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that computes a\ndistribution over allocations that is ex-ante proportional, and ex-post, every\nallocation gives every agent at least his proportional share up to one item,\nand more importantly, at least half of his MMS. Moreover, this last ex-post\nguarantee holds even with respect to a more demanding notion of a share,\nintroduced in this paper, that we refer to as the truncated proportional share\n(TPS).

We\nconstruct chemical evolution models that incorporate recent calculations of\nproto-NS yields in addition to contributions from AGB stars, Type Ia\nsupernovae, and two alternative sets of yields for massive star winds and\ncore-collapse supernovae. For non-rotating massive star yields from either set,\nmodels without proto-NS winds underpredict the observed s-process peak\nabundances by $0.3$-$1\\,\\text{dex}$ at low metallicity, and they severely\nunderpredict Mo and Ru at all metallicities.

After an evaporation time the corrections are large: the angular\ndistribution of the emitted radiation is no longer dominated by low multipoles,\nwith an exponential fall off at high multipoles. Instead, the radiation is\nredistributed as a power law spectrum over a broad range of angular scales, all\nthe way down to the scale $\\Delta \\theta \\sim 1/M_i$, beyond which there is\nexponential falloff. This effect is is a quantum gravitational effect, whose\norigin is the spreading of the wavefunction of the black hole's center of mass\nlocation caused by the kicks of the individual outgoing quanta, discovered by\nPage in 1980. The modified angular distribution of the Hawking radiation has an\nimportant consequence: the number of soft hair modes that can effectively\ninteract with outgoing Hawking quanta increases from the handful of modes at\nlow multipoles $l$, to a large number of modes, of order $\\sim M_i^2$.

Such metric mechanics is seen in growing\nbiological sheets, and may be engineered in actuating soft matter sheets such\nas phase-changing liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), swelling gels and inflating\nbaromorphs. Here, we show how to combine multiple patterns in a sheet by\nstitching regions of different shape changes together piecewise along\ninterfaces. This approach allows simple patterns to be used as building blocks,\nand enables the design of multi-material or active/passive sheets. We give a\ngeneral condition for an interface to be geometrically compatible, and explore\nits consequences for LCE/LCE, gel/gel, and active/passive interfaces. In\ncontraction/elongation systems such as LCEs, we find an infinite set of\ncompatible interfaces between any pair of patterns along which the metric is\ndiscontinuous, and a finite number across which the metric is continuous. As an\nexample, we find all possible interfaces between pairs of LCE logarithmic\nspiral patterns. In contrast, in isotropic systems such as swelling gels, only\na finite number of continuous interfaces are available, greatly limiting the\npotential of stitching. In both continuous and discontinuous cases, we find the\nstitched interfaces generically carry singular Gaussian curvature, leading to\nintrinsically curved folds in the actuated surface. We give a general\nexpression for the distribution of this curvature, and a more specialized form\nfor interfaces in LCE patterns. The interfaces thus also have rich geometric\nand mechanical properties in their own right.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 17:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 17:09:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 11:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

To investigate the source of a type III radio burst storm during\nencounter 2 of NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission.\n  Aims. It was observed that in encounter 2 of NASA's Parker Solar Probe\nmission there was a large amount of radio activity, and in particular a noise\nstorm of frequent, small type III bursts from 31st March to 6th April 2019. Our\naim is to investigate the source of these small and frequent bursts.\n  Methods. In order to do this, we analysed data from the Hinode EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS), PSP FIELDS, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). We studied the behaviour of active region\n12737, whose emergence and evolution coincides with the timing of the radio\nnoise storm and determined the possible origins of the electron beams within\nthe active region. To do this, we probe the dynamics, Doppler velocity,\nnon-thermal velocity, FIP bias, densities, and carry out magnetic modelling.\n  Results. We demonstrate that although the active region on the disk produces\nno significant flares, its evolution indicates it is a source of the electron\nbeams causing the radio storm. They most likely originate from the area at the\nedge of the active region that shows strong blue-shifted plasma. We demonstrate\nthat as the active region grows and expands, the area of the blue-shifted\nregion at the edge increases, which is also consistent with the increasing area\nwhere large-scale or expanding magnetic field lines from our modelling are\nanchored. This expansion is most significant between 1 and 4 April 2019,\ncoinciding with the onset of the type III storm and the decrease of the\nindividual burst's peak frequency, indicating the height at which the peak\nradiation is emitted increases as the active region evolves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 17:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

In such systems, a\nuser request for an object $o$, which is not in the cache, can be (partially)\nsatisfied by a similar stored object $o$', at the cost of a loss of user\nutility. In this paper we make a first step into the novel area of similarity\ncaching networks, where requests can be forwarded along a path of caches to get\nthe best efficiency-accuracy tradeoff. The offline problem of content placement\ncan be easily shown to be NP-hard, while different polynomial algorithms can be\ndevised to approach the optimal solution in discrete cases. As the content\nspace grows large, we propose a continuous problem formulation whose solution\nexhibits a simple structure in a class of tree topologies.

The action of a\nnon-boolean oracle $U_\\varphi$ on an eigenstate $|x\\rangle$ is to apply a\nstate-dependent phase-shift $\\varphi(x)$. Unlike boolean oracles, the\neigenvalues $\\exp(i\\varphi(x))$ of a non-boolean oracle are not restricted to\nbe $\\pm 1$. Two new oracular algorithms based on such non-boolean oracles are\nintroduced. The first is the non-boolean amplitude amplification algorithm,\nwhich preferentially amplifies the amplitudes of the eigenstates based on the\nvalue of $\\varphi(x)$. Starting from a given initial superposition state\n$|\\psi_0\\rangle$, the basis states with lower values of $\\cos(\\varphi)$ are\namplified at the expense of the basis states with higher values of\n$\\cos(\\varphi)$. The second algorithm is the quantum mean estimation algorithm,\nwhich uses quantum phase estimation to estimate the expectation\n$\\langle\\psi_0|U_\\varphi|\\psi_0\\rangle$, i.e., the expected value of\n$\\exp(i\\varphi(x))$ for a random $x$ sampled by making a measurement on\n$|\\psi_0\\rangle$.

In this work, Molecular Dynamics simulations of DPPC\n(Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, saturated lipid) and DLiPC\n(Dilineoylphosphatidylcholine, unsaturated lipid) mixtures with cholesterol are\nused to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the cholesterol ordering effect.\nTo this end, all enthalpic contributions, experienced by the PL molecules, are\nrecorded as a function of the PL's acyl chain order. This involves, the PL-PL,\nthe PL-cholesterol interaction, the interaction of the PLs with water, and the\ninterleaflet interaction. This systematic analysis allows one to unravel\ndifferences of saturated and unsaturated lipids in terms of the different\ninteraction factors. It turns out that cholesterol's impact on chain ordering\nstems not only from direct interactions with the PLs but is also indirectly\npresent in the other energy contributions. Furthermore, the analysis sheds\nlight on the relevance of the entropic contributions, related to the degrees of\nfreedom of the acyl chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 18:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 13:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 17:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

This paper\npresents a framework for normally-behaving agents in a multi-agent system with\nheterogeneous control-affine, sampled-data dynamics to render a safe set\nforward invariant in the presence of adversarial agents. The proposed approach\nconsiders several aspects of practical control systems including input\nconstraints, clock asynchrony and disturbances, and distributed calculation of\ncontrol inputs. Our approach also considers functions describing safe sets\nhaving high relative degree with respect to system dynamics. The efficacy of\nthese results are demonstrated through simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 18:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

The value of $H_0$ inferred from the CMB and\ngalaxy surveys is related to the sound horizon at CMB decoupling (or at\nradiation drag), but it is also related to the matter density and to $t_{\\rm\nU}$. Given this observation, we show how model-independent measurements may\nsupport or disfavor proposed new-physics solutions to the Hubble tension.\nFinally, we argue that cosmological measurements today provide constraints\nthat, within a given cosmological model, represent an over-constrained system,\noffering a powerful diagnostic tool of consistency. We propose the use of\nternary plots to simultaneously visualize independent constraints on key\nquantities related to $H_0$ like $t_{\\rm U}$, the sound horizon at radiation\ndrag, and the matter density parameter. We envision that this representation\nwill help find a solution to the trouble of and beyond $H_0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 19:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Different types of boundary conditions (open, periodic, Dirichlet)\nare imposed in directions, orthogonal to rotation axis.

This paper argues for more caution with the use of counterfactuals\nwhen the facts to be considered are social categories such as race or gender.\nWe review a broad body of papers from philosophy and social sciences on social\nontology and the semantics of counterfactuals, and we conclude that the\ncounterfactual approach in machine learning fairness and social explainability\ncan require an incoherent theory of what social categories are. Our findings\nsuggest that most often the social categories may not admit counterfactual\nmanipulation, and hence may not appropriately satisfy the demands for\nevaluating the truth or falsity of counterfactuals. This is important because\nthe widespread use of counterfactuals in machine learning can lead to\nmisleading results when applied in high-stakes domains. Accordingly, we argue\nthat even though counterfactuals play an essential part in some causal\ninferences, their use for questions of algorithmic fairness and social\nexplanations can create more problems than they resolve.

In particular, the two\ngravitational potentials -- that describe the spatial and temporal fluctuations\nin the geometry -- are equal. Whereas large classes of dark energy models\npreserve this equality, theories of modified gravity generally create a\ndifference between the potentials, known as anisotropic stress. Even though\nmeasuring this anisotropic stress is one of the key goals of large-scale\nstructure surveys, there are currently no methods able to measure it directly.\nCurrent methods all rely on measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities (through\nredshift-space distortions), from which the time component of the metric is\ninferred, assuming that dark matter follows geodesics. If this is not the case,\nall the proposed tests fail to measure the anisotropic stress. In this letter,\nwe propose a novel test which directly measures anisotropic stress, without\nrelying on any assumption about the unknown dark matter. Our method uses\nrelativistic effects in the galaxy number counts to provide a direct\nmeasurement of the time component of the metric. By comparing this with lensing\nobservations our test provides a direct measurement of the anisotropic stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 19:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 11:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Previous work\nhas shown that complementing spectral energy distributions with interferometric\nand imaging data can probe the circumstellar environments of massive young\nstellar objects (MYSOs) well. However, complex studies of single objects often\nuse different approaches in their analysis. Therefore the results of these\nstudies cannot be directly compared. This work aims to obtain the physical\ncharacteristics of a sample of MYSOs at ~0.01\" scales, at 0.1\" scales, and as a\nwhole, which enables us to compare the characteristics of the sources. We apply\nthe same multi-scale method and analysis to a sample of MYSOs. High-resolution\ninterferometric data, near-diffraction-limited imaging data, and a\nmulti-wavelength spectral energy distribution are combined. By fitting\nsimulated observables derived from 2.5D radiative transfer models of\ndisk-outflow-envelope systems to our observations, the properties of the MYSOs\nare constrained. We find that the observables of all the MYSOs can be\nreproduced by models with disk-outflow-envelope geometries, analogous to the\nClass I geometry associated with low-mass protostars. The characteristics of\nthe envelopes and the cavities within them are very similar across our sample.\nOn the other hand, the disks seem to differ between the objects, in particular\nwith regards to what we interpret as evidence of complex structures and inner\nholes. This is comparable to the morphologies observed for low-mass young\nstellar objects. A strong correlation is found between the luminosity of the\ncentral MYSO and the size of the transition disk-like inner hole for the MYSOs,\nimplying that photoevaporation or the presence of binary companions may be the\ncause.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 19:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

As commercial IM-DD systems typically do not employ\noptical amplification to save the cost and power consumption, they are no\nlonger subject to an average power constraint (APC) but a peak power constraint\n(PPC), which poses unique challenges to take full advantages of PCS.

Each set of observations provides a unique opportunity to test\nand constrain global models of the solar corona and inner heliosphere and, in\nturn, use the model results to provide a global context for interpreting such\nobservations. In this study, we develop a set of global magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) model solutions of varying degrees of sophistication for PSP's first four\nencounters and compare the results with in situ measurements from PSP,\nStereo-A, and Earth-based spacecraft, with the objective of assessing which\nmodels perform better or worse. All models were primarily driven by the\nobserved photospheric magnetic field using data from Solar Dynamics\nObservatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. Overall, we\nfind that there are substantial differences between the model results, both in\nterms of the large-scale structure of the inner heliosphere during these time\nperiods, as well as in the inferred time-series at various spacecraft. The\n\"thermodynamic\" model, which represents the \"middle ground\", in terms of model\ncomplexity, appears to reproduce the observations most closely for all four\nencounters. Our results also contradict an earlier study that had hinted that\nthe open flux problem may disappear nearer the Sun.

Recent years have\nseen the emergence of very successful ultrafast imaging techniques of single\nnon-reproducible events with extremely high frame rate, based on wavelength or\nspatial frequency encoding. However, further progress in ultrafast imaging\ntowards high spatial resolution is hampered by the lack of characterization of\nweak probe beams. Because of the difference in group velocities between pump\nand probe in the bulk of the material, the determination of the absolute\npump-probe delay depends on the sample position. In addition, pulse-front tilt\nis a widespread issue, unacceptable for ultrafast imaging, but which is\nconventionally very difficult to evaluate for the low-intensity probe pulses.\nHere we show that a pump-induced micro-grating generated from the electronic\nKerr effect provides a detailed in-situ characterization of a weak probe pulse.\nIt allows solving the two issues.

We also propose that the spatial distribution of\nsupercurrents near a domain wall is a characteristic signature measurable via a\nscanning superconducting quantum interference device that can distinguish\nbetween chiral Majorana edge modes and trivial in-gap states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 20:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The outcome is, that shape\ncoexistence may occur in certain islands on the nuclear map.

In the light nuclei the nucleons\nflip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that\nparticle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of\nshape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass\nand heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape\ncoexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO\nshell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3)\nirreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with\nthe SO-like shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 21:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

Instead of considering to fuse the\nunreliable information from all available sensors, perception from pure radar\ndata becomes a valuable alternative that is worth exploring.

This paper\ninvestigates the use of training objectives that explicitly impose this\nconsistency constraint and how it can impact downstream audio classification\ntasks. In the context of deep convolutional neural networks in the supervised\nsetting, we show empirically that certain measures of consistency are not\nimplicitly captured by the cross-entropy loss and that incorporating such\nmeasures into the loss function can improve the performance of audio\nclassification systems. Put another way, we demonstrate how existing\naugmentation methods can further improve learning by enforcing consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 22:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 15:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Given a trained\nGNN model and an input graph, our SubgraphX explains its predictions by\nefficiently exploring different subgraphs with Monte Carlo tree search. To make\nthe tree search more effective, we propose to use Shapley values as a measure\nof subgraph importance, which can also capture the interactions among different\nsubgraphs. To expedite computations, we propose efficient approximation schemes\nto compute Shapley values for graph data.

Randomized DP mechanisms are then equivalent to randomized colorings\nof the graph. A key notion we use is that of the boundary of the graph. Any two\nneighboring datasets assigned a different true color belong to the boundary.\n  Under this framework, we show that fixing the mechanism behavior at the\nboundary induces a unique optimal mechanism. Moreover, if the mechanism is to\nhave a homogeneous behavior at the boundary, we present a closed expression for\nthe optimal mechanism, which is obtained by means of a \\emph{pullback}\noperation on the optimal mechanism of a line graph.

One common issue among these\napplications is that they are generally based on project-specific solutions and\ndeveloped from scratch. Such application development fashion results in large\namounts of repetitive effort, for example, in building study specific websites\nand mobile frontends, deploying customised infrastructures, and collecting data\nthat may have already been collected in other studies and projects. What is\nworse, the data collected, and functions built cannot be easily reused by other\napplications. In this paper, we present an event-driven microservice platform,\nnamely DHLink, to address this issue. DHLink securely links existing digital\nhealth applications of different projects, facilitates real-time data sharing,\nand supports rapid application development by reusing data and functions of\nexisting digital health applications. In addition, comes with DHLink, a set of\nhighly generic and reusable microservices is provided, which allows developers\nto rapidly create a typical above-mentioned digital health application by only\ndeveloping the core algorithms.

Despite\nsolid experience in this field, comprehensive knowledge and interpretation of\nocean/sea and vessel wave signatures on radar images are still very\nchallenging. Many technical parameters and scanning conditions vary for\ndifferent SAR platforms, which also imposes some restrictions on the\ncross-analysis of their respective images. Numerical simulation of SAR images\nallows the analysis of many radar imaging parameters including environmental,\nship, or platform related. In this paper, we present a universal simulation\nframework for SAR imagery of the sea surface, which includes the superposition\nof sea-ship waves. This paper is the first attempt to cover exhaustively all\nSAR imaging effects for the sea waves and ship wakes scene. The study is based\non well proven concepts: the linear theory of sea surface modeling, Michell\nthin-ship theory for Kelvin wake modeling, and ocean SAR imaging theory. We\ndemonstrate the role of two main factors that affect imaging of both types of\nwaves: (i) SAR parameters and (ii) Hydrodynamic related parameters such as wind\nstate and Froude number. The SAR parameters include frequency, signal\npolarization, mean incidence angle, image resolution, variation by scanning\nplatform (airborne or spaceborne) of the range-to-velocity (R/V) ratio, and\nvelocity bunching with associated shifting, smearing and azimuthal cutoff\neffects. We perform modeling for five wave frequency spectra and four ship\nmodels. We also compare spectra in two aspects: with Cox and Munk's probability\ndensity function (PDF), and with a novel proposed evaluation of ship wake\ndetectability. The simulation results agree well with SAR imaging theory.

However,\nthe presence of the GP precludes the commonly used mini-batch approach to the\ntraining of the attention network. Therefore, we develop a block-wise training\nalgorithm to allow mini-batch training of the network while the GP is trained\nusing full-batch, resulting in a scalable training method. The algorithm has\nbeen proved to converge and shows comparable, if not better, quality of the\nfound solution. As the algorithm does not assume any specific network\narchitecture, it can be used with a wide range of hybrid models such as neural\nnetworks with kernel machine layers in the scarcity of resources for\ncomputation and memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 01:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Nevertheless,\ndesigning a membrane cascade is challenging since, there are often multiple\nfeasible configurations that differ in their energy consumption and cost. In\nthis work, we develop a Mixed Integer Non-linear Program (MINLP) that, for a\ngiven binary separation, which may be either liquid or gaseous, finds the\ncascade and its operating conditions that minimize energy consumption. To model\nthe separation at each membrane in the cascade, we utilize the analytical\nsolution of a system of differential and algebraic equations derived from the\ncrossflow model and the solution-diffusion theory. We provide numerical\nevidence which shows that our single-stage membrane model accurately predicts\nexperimental data. Unfortunately, the resulting membrane model is non-convex\nand, even state-of-the-art solvers struggle to prove global optimality of the\ncascades and the operating conditions identified. In this paper, we derive\nvarious cuts that help with relaxation quality and, consequently, accelerate\nconvergence of branch-and-bound based solvers. More specifically, we\ndemonstrate, on various examples, that our cuts help branch-and-bound solvers\nconverge within 5\\% optimality gap in a reasonable amount of time and such a\ntolerance level was not achieved by a simple formulation of the membrane model.\nThe proposed optimization model is an easy-to-use tool for practitioners and\nresearchers to design energy efficient membrane cascades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 02:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

We introduce the stellar formalism to\ncharacterize these states. We then study the transition from classically\nsimulable models to models which are universal for quantum computing. We show\nthat quantum computational supremacy, the dramatic speedup of quantum computers\nover their classical counterparts, may be realised with non-Gaussian states and\nGaussian measurements.\n  Quantum certification denotes the methods seeking to verify the correct\nfunctioning of a quantum machine. We consider certification of quantum states\nin continuous variable, introducing several protocols according to the\nassumptions made on the tested state. We develop efficient methods for the\nverification of a large class of multimode quantum states, including the output\nstates of the Boson Sampling model, enabling the experimental verification of\nquantum supremacy with photonic quantum computing.\n  We give several new examples of practical applications of quantum information\nin linear quantum optics.

Particularly, several class activation mapping (CAM) based methods,\nwhich generate visual explanation maps by a linear combination of activation\nmaps from CNNs, have been proposed. However, the majority of the methods lack a\nclear theoretical basis on how they assign the coefficients of the linear\ncombination. In this paper, we revisit the intrinsic linearity of CAM with\nrespect to the activation maps; we construct an explanation model of CNN as a\nlinear function of binary variables that denote the existence of the\ncorresponding activation maps. With this approach, the explanation model can be\ndetermined by additive feature attribution methods in an analytic manner. We\nthen demonstrate the adequacy of SHAP values, which is a unique solution for\nthe explanation model with a set of desirable properties, as the coefficients\nof CAM. Since the exact SHAP values are unattainable, we introduce an efficient\napproximation method, LIFT-CAM, based on DeepLIFT. Our proposed LIFT-CAM can\nestimate the SHAP values of the activation maps with high speed and accuracy.\nFurthermore, it greatly outperforms other previous CAM-based methods in both\nqualitative and quantitative aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 02:43:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 03:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Our computational results with the streamwise-minimal domain\nsuggest that the interplays between streamwise-elongated streaks and vortices\nsmaller than the streamwise minimal length are the essential scale interactions\nfor both the inner and outer structures.

However, human thought is rich and varied, that it is often\ninfluenced by more of a combination of object features than a specific type of\ncategory. For this reason, we propose an end-to-end brain decoding framework\nwhich translates brain activity into an image by latent space alignment. To\nfind the correspondence from brain signal features to image features, we\nembedded them into two latent spaces with modality-specific encoders and then\naligned the two spaces by minimising the distance between paired latent\nrepresentations.

We also measured widespread star-forming bursts, indicating that\nphotoionisation by stars is the primary ionization source of the galaxy. The\nkinematic map revealed a rotating pattern in the gas in the northern tail of\nthe system, suggesting that the galaxy may be in the process of rebuilding a\ndisc. The gas located in the central region has larger velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma\\approx 50$ km s$^{-1}$) than the remaining regions, indicating\nkinematic heating, possibly owing to the ongoing interaction. Similar trends\nwere, however, not observed in the stellar velocity-dispersion map, indicating\nthat the galaxy has not yet achieved equilibrium, and the nebular and stellar\ncomponents are still kinematically decoupled. Based on all our measurements and\nfindings, and specially on the mass estimates, metallicity gradients and\nvelocity fields of the system, we propose that NGC 1487 is the result of an\nongoing merger event involving smallish dwarf galaxies within a group, in a\npre-merger phase, resulting in a relic with mass and physical parameters\nsimilar to a dwarf galaxy.

While\nthe THz communication is conventionally envisioned for short-range wireless\napplications due to the high atmospheric absorption at THz frequencies,\nmulti-hop directional transmissions can be enabled to extend the communication\nrange. However, to realize multi-hop THz communications, conventional beam\ntraining schemes, such as exhaustive search or hierarchical methods with a\nfixed number of training levels, can lead to a very large time overhead.

First, the algorithm yields $\\tilde{\\cal\nO}\\left(\\left(\\frac{K^{0.75}}{\\delta}+d\\right)\\sqrt{\\tau}\\right)$ (pseudo)\nregret in round $\\tau\\leq T,$ where $K$ is the number of constraints, $d$ is\nthe dimension of the reward feature space, and $\\delta$ is a Slater's constant;\nand zero constraint violation in any round $\\tau>\\tau',$ where $\\tau'$ is\nindependent of horizon $T.$ Second, the algorithm is computationally efficient.\nOur algorithm is based on the primal-dual approach in optimization and includes\ntwo components. The primal component is similar to unconstrained stochastic\nlinear bandits (our algorithm uses the linear upper confidence bound algorithm\n(LinUCB)). The computational complexity of the dual component depends on the\nnumber of constraints, but is independent of the sizes of the contextual space,\nthe action space, and the feature space. Thus, the overall computational\ncomplexity of our algorithm is similar to that of the linear UCB for\nunconstrained stochastic linear bandits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 07:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 13:50:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 02:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

However, despite decades of efforts to\noptimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only\nreaches 20~30% of the theoretical limits.

Hydrogen lowers the local magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain\nboundaries.

Typical AC methods require the availability of an\nattenuation map obtained using a transmission scan, such as a CT scan. This has\nseveral disadvantages such as increased radiation dose, higher costs, and\npossible misalignment between SPECT and CT scans. Also, often a CT scan is\nunavailable. In this context, we and others are showing that scattered photons\nin SPECT contain information to estimate the attenuation distribution. To\nexploit this observation, we propose a physics and learning-based method that\nuses the SPECT emission data in the photopeak and scatter windows to perform\ntransmission-less AC in SPECT. The proposed method uses data acquired in the\nscatter window to reconstruct an initial estimate of the attenuation map using\na physics-based approach. A convolutional neural network is then trained to\nsegment this initial estimate into different regions. Pre-defined attenuation\ncoefficients are assigned to these regions, yielding the reconstructed\nattenuation map, which is then used to reconstruct the activity map using an\nordered subsets expectation maximization-based reconstruction approach.

For the\ndetection of enzyme, collagenase has been labelled with fluorescein\nIsothiocyanate (FITC), whereas the nanocapsule surface was labelled with\nrhodamine Isothiocyanate (RITC). Thus, it has been possible to monitor the\nhydrolysis of nanocapsules and their diffusion throughout a thick 3D Collagen\ngel during the time, obtaining a detailed temporal evaluation of the\npH-sensitive collagenase nanocapsule behaviour. These collagenase nanocapsules\ndisplayed a high enzymatic activity in low concentrations at acidic pH, and\ntheir efficiency to penetrate into tissue models pave the way to a wide range\nof possible nanomedical applications, especially in cancer therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

However, the performance of gesture recognition is always influenced by\nsome gesture-irrelevant factors like the background and the clothes of\nperformers. Therefore, focusing on the regions of hand/arm is important to the\ngesture recognition. Meanwhile, a more adaptive architecture-searched network\nstructure can also perform better than the block-fixed ones like Resnet since\nit increases the diversity of features in different stages of the network\nbetter. In this paper, we propose a regional attention with\narchitecture-rebuilt 3D network (RAAR3DNet) for gesture recognition. We replace\nthe fixed Inception modules with the automatically rebuilt structure through\nthe network via Neural Architecture Search (NAS), owing to the different shape\nand representation ability of features in the early, middle, and late stage of\nthe network. It enables the network to capture different levels of feature\nrepresentations at different layers more adaptively. Meanwhile, we also design\na stackable regional attention module called dynamic-static Attention (DSA),\nwhich derives a Gaussian guidance heatmap and dynamic motion map to highlight\nthe hand/arm regions and the motion information in the spatial and temporal\ndomains, respectively. Extensive experiments on two recent large-scale RGB-D\ngesture datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show it\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

The digital object model in terms of a printable\nrepresentation of the geometry as well as reflectance characteristics are\nstored in a compact and streamable representation on a central server, which\nstreams the data to remotely connected users/clients. The latter can jointly\nperform an interactive inspection of the object in VR with additional haptic\nfeedback through the 3D printed replica. Evaluations regarding system\nperformance, visual quality of the considered models as well as insights from a\nuser study indicate an improved interaction, assessment and experience of the\nconsidered objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 10:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

This variety is needed, on the one hand,\nsince different algorithms are most suitable for different types of\noptimization problems. But the variety also poses a meta-problem: which\nalgorithm to choose for a given problem at hand? Past research has shown that\nper-instance algorithm selection based on exploratory landscape analysis (ELA)\ncan be an efficient mean to tackle this meta-problem. Existing approaches,\nhowever, require the approximation of problem features based on a significant\nnumber of samples, which are typically selected through uniform sampling or\nLatin Hypercube Designs. The evaluation of these points is costly, and the\nbenefit of an ELA-based algorithm selection over a default algorithm must\ntherefore be significant in order to pay off. One could hope to by-pass the\nevaluations for the feature approximations by using the samples that a default\nalgorithm would anyway perform, i.e., by using the points of the default\nalgorithm's trajectory.\n  We analyze in this paper how well such an approach can work. Concretely, we\ntest how accurately trajectory-based ELA approaches can predict the final\nsolution quality of the CMA-ES after a fixed budget of function evaluations. We\nobserve that the loss of trajectory-based predictions can be surprisingly small\ncompared to the classical global sampling approach, if the remaining budget for\nwhich solution quality shall be predicted is not too large. Feature selection,\nin contrast, did not show any advantage in our experiments and rather led to\nworsened prediction accuracy. The inclusion of state variables of CMA-ES only\nhas a moderate effect on the prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 10:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Emerging technologies of automated driving and V2X\ncommunication have the potential to enable the accurate control of vehicles and\nthe efficient organization of traffic to enhance both the schedule adherence of\nbuses and the overall network mobility. This study proposes an innovative\nnetwork-level control scheme for heterogeneous automated traffic composed of\nbuses and private cars under a full connected and automated environment.\nInheriting the idea of network-level rhythmic control proposed by Lin et al.\n(2020), an augmented rhythmic control scheme for heterogeneous traffic, i.e.,\nRC-H, is established to organize the mixed traffic in a rhythmic manner.\nRealized virtual platoons are designed for accommodating vehicles to pass\nthrough the network, including dedicated virtual platoons for buses to provide\nexclusive right-of-ways (ROWs) on their trips and regular virtual platoons for\nprivate cars along with an optimal assignment plan to minimize the total travel\ncost. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is formulated to optimize the RC-H\nscheme and a bilevel heuristic solution method is designed to relieve the\ncomputational burden of MILP. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are\nconducted to evaluate the performance of the RC-H scheme under different\nscenarios. The results show that the bus operation can be guaranteed and the\ntravel delay can be minimized under various demand levels with transit\npriority. Moreover, compared with traffic signal control strategies, the RC-H\nscheme has significant advantages in handling massive traffic demand, in terms\nof both vehicle delay and network throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 11:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Our analysis results prove that the achievable\nmaximum average fidelity ensures zero fidelity deviation, that is, perfect\nuniversality. This structural trait of teleportation is distinct from those of\nother limited-fidelity probabilistic quantum operations, for instance,\nuniversal-NOT or quantum cloning. This feature is confirmed again based on a\ntighter relationship between F and D in the qubit case.

To better understand the mechanisms\nfor such sharp compartmentalization, we study the effect of an imposed\nheterotypic tension at the interface between two distinct cell types in a fully\n3D model for confluent tissues. We find that cells rapidly sort and\nself-organize to generate a tissue-scale interface between cell types, and\ncells adjacent to this interface exhibit signature geometric features including\nnematic-like ordering, bimodal facet areas, and registration, or alignment, of\ncell centers on either side of the two-tissue interface. The magnitude of these\nfeatures scales directly with the magnitude of imposed tension, suggesting that\nbiologists can estimate the magnitude of tissue surface tension between two\ntissue types simply by segmenting a 3D tissue. To uncover the underlying\nphysical mechanisms driving these geometric features, we develop two minimal,\nordered models using two different underlying lattices that identify an\nenergetic competition between bulk cell shapes and tissue interface area. When\nthe interface area dominates, changes to neighbor topology are costly and occur\nless frequently, which generates the observed geometric features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 12:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk\nMeter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior\nembedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil,\nRussia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the\nfinancial linkages between these economies.

The research community has\nunsuccessfully tried several approaches to tackle this problem. In this paper\nwe propose a different perspective: We accept the presence of adversarial\nexamples against ASR systems, but we require them to be perceivable by human\nlisteners. By applying the principles of psychoacoustics, we can remove\nsemantically irrelevant information from the ASR input and train a model that\nresembles human perception more closely. We implement our idea in a tool named\nDOMPTEUR and demonstrate that our augmented system, in contrast to an\nunmodified baseline, successfully focuses on perceptible ranges of the input\nsignal. This change forces adversarial examples into the audible range, while\nusing minimal computational overhead and preserving benign performance. To\nevaluate our approach, we construct an adaptive attacker that actively tries to\navoid our augmentations and demonstrate that adversarial examples from this\nattacker remain clearly perceivable. Finally, we substantiate our claims by\nperforming a hearing test with crowd-sourced human listeners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 13:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 12:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

IS-algebras have been studied algebraically and\ntopologically since the 1980's, but a corresponding logic (here denoted\nIS$\\leq$) has been introduced only very recently. The logic IS$\\leq$ is the\ndeparting point for the present study, which we then extend to a wide family of\npreviously unknown logics defined from IS-algebras. We show that IS$\\leq$ is a\nconservative expansion of the Belnap-Dunn four-valued logic (i.e. the\norder-preserving logic of the variety of De Morgan algebras), and we give a\nfinite Hilbert-style axiomatization for it. More generally, we introduce a\nmethod for expanding conservatively every super-Belnap logic so as to obtain an\nextension of IS$\\leq$. We show that every logic thus defined can be axiomatized\nby adding a fixed finite set of rule schemata to the corresponding super-Belnap\nbase logic. We also consider a few sample extensions of IS$\\leq$ that cannot be\nobtained in the above-described way, but can nevertheless be axiomatized\nfinitely by other methods. Most of our axiomatization results are obtained in\ntwo steps: through a multiple-conclusion calculus first, which we then reduce\nto a traditional one.

The large number of optical phonons emitted during the carrier\nrelaxation processes generate a non-equilibrium population of acoustic phonons\nthat propagates less efficiently in thin NWs. This makes the possible\nacoustic-to-optical phonon up-conversion process easier, which prolongs the LO\nphonon lifetime resulting in the slowdown of the carrier cooling. The important\nobservation that the carrier temperature in thin NWs is higher than in thick\nNWs already at the beginning of the hot carrier regime suggests that the\nphonon-mediated scattering processes in the non-thermal regime play a major\nrole at least for the carrier densities investigated here (8x1018-4x1019 cm-3).\nOur results also suggest that the boundary scattering of phonons at crystal\ndefects is negligible compared to the surface scattering at the NW sidewalls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 14:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 10:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The same is true for the\npolynomial semirings that are universal for the classes of absorptive,\nidempotent, and fully idempotent semirings, respectively. On the other side, we\nprove that for other, practically relevant, semirings such as the Viterby\nsemiring, the tropical semiring, the natural semiring and the universal\npolynomial semiring N[X], all finite semiring interpretations are first-order\naxiomatisable (and thus elementary equivalence implies isomorphism), although\nsome of the axiomatisations that we exhibit use an infinite set of axioms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

The major challenges involve noisy history contexts and especial\nprerequisites of commonsense knowledge that is unseen in the given material.\nExisting works mainly focus on context and response matching approaches. This\nwork thus makes the first attempt to tackle the above two challenges by\nextracting substantially important turns as pivot utterances and utilizing\nexternal knowledge to enhance the representation of context. We propose a\npivot-oriented deep selection model (PoDS) on top of the Transformer-based\nlanguage models for dialogue comprehension. In detail, our model first picks\nout the pivot utterances from the conversation history according to the\nsemantic matching with the candidate response or question, if any. Besides,\nknowledge items related to the dialogue context are extracted from a knowledge\ngraph as external knowledge. Then, the pivot utterances and the external\nknowledge are combined with a well-designed mechanism for refining predictions.\nExperimental results on four dialogue comprehension benchmark tasks show that\nour proposed model achieves great improvements on baselines. A series of\nempirical comparisons are conducted to show how our selection strategies and\nthe extra knowledge injection influence the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

One of the most recently reported is the diversity\nof shapes in the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies in the local Universe which\nis in contrast to the apparent homogeneity of rotation curves in cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations. Previous studies on similar problems have shown that\nsometimes can be alleviated by accounting for the impact of observational\neffects in the comparison. For this reason, in this work we present a set of\ncontrolled experiments to measure the impact that some systematic effects,\nassociated with modeling the observation process in a realistic way, have on\nthe diversity of synthetic rotation curves. Our results demonstrate that\nfactors such as spectral power, spatial resolution and inclination angle, can\nnaturally induce noticeable fluctuations on the shape of the rotation curves,\nreproducing up to $47\\%$ of the diversity reported in the observations. This is\nremarkable, especially considering that we limited the sample to\nhighly-symmetric disks simulated in isolation.

However,\nguaranteeing the safety and reliability of CPSs with this kind of controllers\nis currently very challenging, which is of vital importance in many real-life\nsafety-critical applications. To cope with this difficulty, we propose in this\nwork a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing unverified controllers in CPSs\noperating in noisy environments (a.k.a. stochastic CPSs). The proposed\narchitecture contains a history-based supervisor, which checks inputs from the\nunverified controller and makes a compromise between functionality and safety\nof the system, and a safety advisor that provides fallback when the unverified\ncontroller endangers the safety of the system.

We use Q-Learning and deep Q-learning, to\nlearn control policies of four constraint satisfaction games (15-Puzzle,\nMinesweeper, 2048, and Sudoku). 15-Puzzle is a sliding permutation puzzle and\nprovides a challenge in addressing its large state space.

This\nis the first time to design a systematic RF framework for simultaneously\nquantifying battery production feature importance and correlations by three\nvarious quantitative indicators including the unbiased feature importance (FI),\ngain improvement FI and PMOA, paving a promising solution to reduce model\ndimension and conduct efficient sensitivity analysis of battery manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 11:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

However, current methods pay little attention to\nthe interaction between agents, which is essential to teamwork in games or real\nlife. This limits the efficiency of value-based MARL algorithms in the two\naspects: collaborative exploration and value function estimation. In this\npaper, we propose a novel cooperative MARL algorithm named as interactive\nactor-critic~(IAC), which models the interaction of agents from the\nperspectives of policy and value function. On the policy side, a multi-agent\njoint stochastic policy is introduced by adopting a collaborative exploration\nmodule, which is trained by maximizing the entropy-regularized expected return.\nOn the value side, we use the shared attention mechanism to estimate the value\nfunction of each agent, which takes the impact of the teammates into\nconsideration. At the implementation level, we extend the value decomposition\nmethods to continuous control tasks and evaluate IAC on benchmark tasks\nincluding classic control and multi-agent particle environments.

Echo State Networks (ESNs), which are a\nclass of Reservoir Computing, can accurately predict the chaotic dynamics well\nbeyond the predictability time. Existing studies, however, also showed that\nsmall changes in the hyperparameters may markedly affect the network's\nperformance. The aim of this paper is to assess and improve the robustness of\nEcho State Networks for the time-accurate prediction of chaotic solutions. The\ngoal is three-fold. First, we investigate the robustness of routinely used\nvalidation strategies. Second, we propose the Recycle Validation, and the\nchaotic versions of existing validation strategies, to specifically tackle the\nforecasting of chaotic systems. Third, we compare Bayesian optimization with\nthe traditional Grid Search for optimal hyperparameter selection. Numerical\ntests are performed on two prototypical nonlinear systems that have both\nchaotic and quasiperiodic solutions. Both model-free and model-informed Echo\nState Networks are analysed. By comparing the network's robustness in learning\nchaotic versus quasiperiodic solutions, we highlight fundamental challenges in\nlearning chaotic solutions. The proposed validation strategies, which are based\non the dynamical systems properties of chaotic time series, are shown to\noutperform the state-of-the-art validation strategies. Because the strategies\nare principled-they are based on chaos theory such as the Lyapunov time-they\ncan be applied to other Recurrent Neural Networks architectures with little\nmodification. This work opens up new possibilities for the robust design and\napplication of Echo State Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks, to the\ntime-accurate prediction of chaotic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 22:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 10:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Lagrangian Coherent Structures\n(LCSs) provide useful tools to approach the problem of the transport of\npollutants and have only recently been applied to coastal waters. While the\nfundamentals of the LCS approach using idealised analytical flow fields are\nwell established in the literature, there are limited studies on their\npractical implementations in coastal waters where effects of boundaries and\nbathymetry frequently become significant. Due to their complex bathymetry and\nboundaries, unstructured grid systems are commonly used in modelling of coastal\nwaters. For convenient derivation of LCS diagnostics, structured grids are\ncommonly used. Here we examine the effect of mesh resolution, interpolation\nschemes and additive random noise on the LCS diagnostics in relation to coastal\nwaters. Two kinematic model flows, the double gyre and the meandering jet, as\nwell as validated outputs of a hydrodynamic model of Moreton Bay, Australia, on\nunstructured grids are used. The results show that LCSs are quite robust to the\nerrors from interpolation schemes used in the data conversion from unstructured\nto structured grid. Attributed to the divergence in the underlying flow field,\nthe results show that random errors in the order of 1-10 % cause a break down\nin the continuity of ridges of maximum finite time Lyapunov exponents and\nclosed orbit elliptic LCSs. The result has significant implications on the\nsuitability of applying LCS formulations based on a deterministic flow field to\ndiffusive coastal waters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 01:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

Because of the absence of the unanimously accepted\ncriterion, most of the previous studies utilized rather ad hoc heuristics to\ndecide the community resolution. In this work, we harness the concept of\nconsistency in community structures of networks to provide the overall\ncommunity resolution landscape of networks, which we eventually take to\nquantify the reliability of detected communities for a given resolution\nparameter. More precisely, we exploit the ambiguity in the results of\nstochastic detection algorithms and suggest a method that denotes the relative\nvalidity of community structures in regard to their stability of global and\nlocal inconsistency measures using multiple detection processes. Applying our\nframework to synthetic and real networks, we confirm that it effectively\ndisplays insightful fundamental aspects of community structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 01:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 03:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}
