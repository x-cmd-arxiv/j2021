Like all industrial sectors,\nthe aviation sector must implement measures to reduce its climate impact. This\npaper focuses on the simulation and the evaluation of climatic scenarios for\nthe aviation industry. For this purpose, a specific tool (CAST for \"Climate and\nAviation - Sustainable Trajectories\") has been developed. This tool follows a\nmethodology adapted to aviation using the concept of carbon budget and models\nof the main levers of action such as the level of air traffic, reduction of\naircraft energy consumption or energy decarbonisation. These models are based\non trend projections from historical data or assumptions from the literature.\nSeveral scenario analyses are performed in this paper using CAST and allow\nseveral conclusions to be drawn. For instance, the modelling of the scenarios\nbased on the ATAG (Air Transport Action Group) commitments shows that aviation\nwould consume between 2.9% and 3.5% of the world carbon budget to limit global\nwarming to 2{\\deg}C and between 6.5% and 8.1% for 1.5{\\deg}C. Also, some\nillustrative scenarios are proposed. By allocating 2.6% of the carbon budget to\naviation, it is shown that air transport is compatible with a +2{\\deg}C\ntrajectory when the annual growth rate of air traffic varies between -1.8% and\n+2.6%, depending on the considered technological improvements. However, in the\ncase of a +1.5{\\deg}C trajectory, the growth rate would have to be reduced\ndrastically. Finally, analyses including non-CO2 effects compel to emphasize\nthe implementation of specific strategies for mitigating contrails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 16:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 15:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 13:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

We introduce a stochastic dynamical system in which the\nparameter-to-data map is embedded, with the goal of employing techniques from\nnonlinear Kalman filtering to estimate the parameter given the data. The\nextended Kalman filter (which we refer to as ExKI in the context of inverse\nproblems) can be effective for some inverse problems approached this way, but\nis impractical when the forward map is not readily differentiable and is given\nas a black box, and also for high dimensional parameter spaces because of the\nneed to propagate large covariance matrices. Application of ensemble Kalman\nfilters, for example use of the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithm, has\nemerged as a useful tool which overcomes both of these issues: it is derivative\nfree and works with a low-rank covariance approximation formed from the\nensemble. In this paper, we work with the ExKI, EKI, and a variant on EKI which\nwe term unscented Kalman inversion (UKI).\n  The paper contains two main contributions. Firstly, we identify a novel\nstochastic dynamical system in which the parameter-to-data map is embedded. We\npresent theory in the linear case to show exponential convergence of the mean\nof the filtering distribution to the solution of a regularized least squares\nproblem. This is in contrast to previous work in which the EKI has been\nemployed where the dynamical system used leads to algebraic convergence to an\nunregularized problem.

First, clients\nlocally train a machine learning model based on local data. Next, clients\ntransfer local updates of model weights and biases (training data) to a server.\nThen, the server aggregates updates (received from clients) to create a global\nlearning model. However, the continuous transfer between clients and the server\nincreases communication costs and is inefficient from a resource utilization\nperspective due to the large number of parameters (weights and biases) used by\ndeep learning models. The cost of communication becomes a greater concern when\nthe number of contributing clients and communication rounds increases.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel hybrid relaying strategy by combining\nwireless-powered communication and ambient backscattering functions to improve\napplicability and performance of data transfer. In particular, the hybrid relay\ncan harvest energy from radio frequency (RF) signals and use the energy for\nactive transmission. Alternatively, the hybrid relay can choose to perform\nambient backscattering of incident RF signals for passive transmission. To\nefficiently utilize the ambient RF resource, we design mode selection protocols\nto coordinate between the active and passive relaying in circumstances with and\nwithout instantaneous channel gain. With different mode selection protocols, we\ncharacterize the success probability and ergodic capacity of a dual-hop\nrelaying system with the hybrid relay in the field of randomly located ambient\ntransmitters.

As the scale of\nverified software projects reaches new heights, the problem of efficiently\nverifying large amounts of software becomes more and more salient. Nowhere is\nthis issue more evident than in the context of verified cryptographic\nlibraries. To achieve feature-parity and be competitive with unverified\ncryptographic libraries, a very large number of algorithms and APIs need to be\nverified. However, the task is oftentimes repetitive, and factoring out\ncommonality between algorithms is fraught with difficulties, requiring until\nnow a significant amount of manual effort.\n  This paper shows how a judicious combination of known functional programming\ntechniques leads to an order-of-magnitude improvement in the amount of verified\ncode produced by the popular HACL* cryptographic library, without compromising\nperformance. We review three techniques that build upon each other, in order of\nincreasing sophistication. First, we use dependent types to crisply capture the\nspecification and state machine of a block algorithm, a cryptographic notion\nthat was until now only informally and imprecisely specified.

While\nthere are simple and natural cases where improper learning is necessary, it is\nnatural to ask how complex must the improper predictors be in such cases. Can\none always achieve nearly optimal mistake/regret bounds using \"simple\"\npredictors?\n  In this work, we give a complete characterization of when this is possible,\nthus settling an open problem which has been studied since the pioneering works\nof Angluin (1987) and Littlestone (1988). More precisely, given any concept\nclass C and any hypothesis class H, we provide nearly tight bounds (up to a log\nfactor) on the optimal mistake bounds for online learning C using predictors\nfrom H. Our bound yields an exponential improvement over the previously best\nknown bound by Chase and Freitag (2020).\n  As applications, we give constructive proofs showing that (i) in the\nrealizable setting, a near-optimal mistake bound (up to a constant factor) can\nbe attained by a sparse majority-vote of proper predictors, and (ii) in the\nagnostic setting, a near-optimal regret bound (up to a log factor) can be\nattained by a randomized proper algorithm.\n  A technical ingredient of our proof which may be of independent interest is a\ngeneralization of the celebrated Minimax Theorem (von Neumann, 1928) for binary\nzero-sum games. A simple game which fails to satisfy Minimax is \"Guess the\nLarger Number\", where each player picks a number and the larger number wins.\nThe payoff matrix is infinite triangular. We show this is the only obstruction:\nif a game does not contain triangular submatrices of unbounded sizes then the\nMinimax Theorem holds. This generalizes von Neumann's Minimax Theorem by\nremoving requirements of finiteness (or compactness), and captures precisely\nthe games of interest in online learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 18:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Our study\ninvestigates the effect of flow unsteadiness on the ventilation requirements to\nform (CQf) and collapse (CQc) a supercavity. Imposing flow unsteadiness on the\nincoming flow has shown an increment in higher CQf at low free stream velocity\nand lower CQf at high free stream velocity. High-speed imaging reveals\ndistinctly different behaviors in the recirculation region for low and high\nfreestream velocity under unsteady flows. At low free stream velocities, the\nrecirculation region formed downstream of a cavitator shifted vertically with\nflow unsteadiness, resulting in lower bubble collision and coalescence\nprobability, which is critical for the supercavity formation process. The\nrecirculation region negligibly changed with flow unsteadiness at high free\nstream velocity and less ventilation is required to form a supercavity compared\nto that of the steady incoming flow. Such a difference is attributed to the\nincreased transverse Reynolds stress that aids bubble collision in a confined\nspace of the recirculation region. CQc is found to heavily rely on the vertical\ncomponent of the flow unsteadiness and the free stream velocity. Interfacial\ninstability located upper rear of the supercavity develops noticeably with flow\nunsteadiness and additional bubbles formed by the distorted interface shed from\nthe supercavity, resulting in an increased CQc. Further analysis on the\nquantification of such additional bubble leakage rate indicates that the\ndevelopment and amplitude of the interfacial instability accounts for the\nvariation of CQc under a wide range of flow unsteadiness.

Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime.

In this paper, we focus on subcodes of RM codes\nwith flexible rates that can take any code dimension from 1 to n, where n is\nthe blocklength. We first extend the recursive projection-aggregation (RPA)\nalgorithm proposed recently by Ye and Abbe for decoding RM codes. To lower the\ncomplexity of our decoding algorithm, referred to as subRPA in this paper, we\ninvestigate different ways for pruning the projections.

Furthermore, it enables training a\nmachine learning (ML) model to search for \\textit{good} sets of projections in\nthe sense of minimizing the decoding error rate. Training our ML model enables\nachieving very close to the performance of full-projection decoding with a\nsignificantly reduced number of projections. For instance, our simulation\nresults on a (64,14) RM subcode show almost identical performance for\nfull-projection decoding and pruned-projection decoding with 15 projections\npicked via training our ML model.

The cosmological density fields traced by late-time\ngalaxy formation are initially nearly Gaussian, and hence all the cosmological\ninformation can be extracted from their 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) or\nits Fourier-space analog the power spectrum. Subsequent nonlinear evolution\nunder gravity, as well as halo and then galaxy formation, generate higher-order\ncorrelation functions. Since the mapping of the initial to the final density\nfield is, on large scales, invertible, it is often claimed that the information\ncontent of the initial field's power spectrum is equal to that of all the\nhigher-order functions of the final, nonlinear field. This claim implies that\nreconstruction of the initial density field from the nonlinear field renders\nanalysis of higher-order correlation functions of the latter superfluous. We\nhere show that this claim is false when the N-point functions are used as\nstandard rulers. Constraints available from joint analysis of the galaxy power\nspectrum and bispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 3-Point Correlation\nFunction) can, in some cases, exceed those offered by the initial power\nspectrum even when the reconstruction is perfect. We provide a mathematical\njustification for this claim and also demonstrate it using a large suite of\nN-body simulations. In particular, we show that for the z = 0 real-space matter\nfield in the limit of vanishing shot noise, taking modes up to k_max = 0.2\nh/Mpc, using the bispectrum alone offers a factor of two reduction in the\nvariance on the cosmic distance scale relative to that available from the power\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, these\neffective models are less useful in cases where the starspot signal is of\nprimary interest since it is not obvious how the parameters of the GP model are\nrelated to the physical properties of interest, such as the size, contrast, and\nlatitudinal distribution of the spots.

The BH shadow is linked to the existence of\nlight rings (LRs). For free bosonic fields, yielding mini-BSs, it is known that\nthese stars can become ultra-compact - i.e., possess LRs - but only for\nperturbatively unstable solutions. We show this remains the case even when\ndifferent self-interactions are considered. However, an effective shadow can\narise in a different way: if BSs reproduce the existence of an innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) for timelike geodesics (located at $r_{\\rm ISCO}=6M$ for\na Schwarzschild BH of mass M), the accretion flow morphology around BHs is\nmimicked and an effective shadow arises in an astrophysical environment. Even\nthough spherical BSs may accommodate stable timelike circular orbits all the\nway down to their centre, we show the angular velocity along such orbits may\nhave a maximum away from the origin, at $R_{\\Omega}$; this scale was recently\nobserved to mimic the BH's ISCO in some scenarios of accretion flow. Then: (i)\nfor free scalar fields or with quartic self-interactions, $R_{\\Omega}\\neq 0$\nonly for perturbatively unstable BSs; (ii) for higher scalar self-interactions,\ne.g. axionic, $R_{\\Omega}\\neq 0$ is possible for perturbatively stable BSs, but\nno solution with $R_{\\Omega}=6M$ was found in the parameter space explored;\n(iii) but for free vector fields, yielding Proca stars (PSs), perturbatively\nstable solutions with $R_{\\Omega}\\neq 0$ exist, and indeed $R_{\\Omega}=6M$ for\na particular solution. Thus, dynamically robust spherical PSs can mimic the\nshadow of a (near-)equilibrium Schwarzschild BH with the same M, in an\nastrophysical environment, despite the absence of a LR, at least under some\nobservation conditions, as we confirm by comparing the lensing of such PSs and\nSchwarzschild BHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 16:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

In this study, we aim at\ncharacterising the relation between Lya absorbers and nearby overdense\ncosmological structures (galaxy filaments) at recession velocities Delta v \\leq\n6700 km/s by using archival observational data from various instruments. We\nanalyse 587 intervening Lya absorbers in the spectra of 302 extragalactic\nbackground sources obtained with the COS installed on the HST. We combine the\nabsorption-line information with galaxy data of five local galaxy filaments\noriginally mapped by Courtois et al. (2013). Along the 91 sightlines that pass\nclose to a filament, we identify 215 (227) Lya absorption systems (components).\nAmong these, 74 Lya systems are aligned in position and velocity with the\ngalaxy filaments, indicating that these absorbers and the galaxies trace the\nsame large-scale structure. The filament-aligned Lya absorbers have a ~90\npercent higher rate of incidence (dN/dz=189 for log N HI \\geq 13.2) and a\nmildly shallower slope (-beta = -1.47) of the column density distribution\nfunction than the general Lya population at z=0, reflecting the filaments'\nmatter overdensity. The strongest Lya absorbers are preferentially found near\ngalaxies or close to the axis of a filament, although there is substantial\nscatter in this relation.

However, the\nlimited sensitivity of this technique makes it impossible to directly assess\nthe extent of the glioma cell invasion, leading to sub-optimal treatment\nplaning. Reaction-diffusion growth models have been proposed for decades to\nextrapolate glioma cell infiltration beyond margins visible on MRI and predict\nits spatial-temporal evolution. These models nevertheless require an initial\ncondition, that is the tumor cell density values at every location of the brain\nat diagnosis time. Several works have proposed to relate the tumor cell density\nfunction to abnormality outlines visible on MRI but the underlying assumptions\nhave never been verified so far.

While\nfalse-positive indications are necessary and well understood, most existing\nworks assume no false-negative indications. Our work illustrates practical\nscenarios where false-negatives are unavoidable and ignoring them has a\nsignificant impact on system performance. Specifically, we focus on\nfalse-negatives induced by indicator staleness, which arises whenever the\nsystem advertises the indicator only periodically, rather than immediately\nreporting every change in the cache. Such scenarios naturally occur, e.g., in\nbandwidth-constraint environments or when latency impedes the ability of each\nclient to obtain an updated indicator. Our work introduces novel false-negative\naware access policies that continuously estimate the false-negative ratio and\nsometimes access caches despite negative indications.

Quantum supremacy\nexperiments have been a major step forward, but gaps remain between the theory\nbehind these experiments and their actual implementations. In this work we\ninitiate the study of the complexity of quantum random circuit sampling\nexperiments with realistic amounts of noise.\n  Actual quantum supremacy experiments have high levels of uncorrected noise\nand exponentially decaying fidelities. It is natural to ask if there is any\nsignal of exponential complexity in these highly noisy devices. Surprisingly,\nwe show that it remains hard to compute the output probabilities of noisy\nrandom quantum circuits without error correction. More formally, so long as the\nnoise rate of the device is below the error detection threshold, we show it is\n#P-hard to compute the output probabilities of random circuits with a constant\nrate of noise per gate. This hardness persists even though these probabilities\nare exponentially close to uniform.\n  Interestingly these hardness results also have implications for the\ncomplexity of experiments in a low-noise setting. The issue here is that prior\nhardness results for computing output probabilities of random circuits are not\nrobust enough to imprecision to connect with the Stockmeyer argument for\nhardness of sampling from circuits with constant fidelity. We exponentially\nimprove the robustness of prior results to imprecision, both in the cases of\nRandom Circuit Sampling and BosonSampling. In the latter case we bring the\nproven hardness within a constant factor in the exponent of the robustness\nrequired for hardness of sampling for the first time.

We also\nintroduce novel criteria in order to reconstruct the underlying signals\ngrouping some of the extracted components. The output of cissa() is the input\nof the function group() to reconstruct the desired signals by further grouping\nthe extracted components. group() allows a novel user to create standard\nsignals by automated grouping options while an expert user can decide on the\nnumber of groups and their composition. To illustrate its versatility and\nperformance in several fields we include 3 examples: an AM-FM synthetic signal,\nan example of the physical world given by a voiced speech signal and an\neconomic time series. Possible applications include de-noising,\nde-seasonalizing, de-trending and extracting business cycles, among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 20:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

We propose NAECF, a conceptually simple but effective\nidea to address this bias.

Our\nexperimental results confirm these expectations, significantly improving the\nrecommendations for non-mainstream users while maintaining the recommendation\nquality for mainstream users.

People\nwith normal hearing perform remarkably well in such situations. Analysis of the\ncortical signals using electroencephalography (EEG) has revealed that the EEG\nsignals track the envelope of the attended speech stronger than that of the\ninterfering speech. This has enabled the development of algorithms that can\ndecode the selective attention of a listener in controlled experimental\nsettings. However, often these algorithms require longer trial duration and\ncomputationally expensive calibration to obtain a reliable inference of\nattention. In this paper, we present a novel framework to decode the attention\nof a listener within trial durations of the order of two seconds.

We propose to modify\nthe standard backend, introducing an adaptive calibrator that uses duration and\nother automatically extracted side-information to adapt to the conditions of\nthe inputs. The backend is trained discriminatively to optimize binary\ncross-entropy. When trained on a number of diverse datasets that are labeled\nonly with respect to speaker, the proposed backend consistently and, in some\ncases, dramatically improves calibration, compared to the standard PLDA\napproach, on a number of held-out datasets, some of which are markedly\ndifferent from the training data. Discrimination performance is also\nconsistently improved. We show that joint training of the PLDA and the adaptive\ncalibrator is essential -- the same benefits cannot be achieved when freezing\nPLDA and fine-tuning the calibrator. To our knowledge, the results in this\npaper are the first evidence in the literature that it is possible to develop a\nspeaker verification system with robust out-of-the-box performance on a large\nvariety of conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 21:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 17:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

In this paper, we\npropose a deep learning approach to predict the actual electromagnetic (EM)\nresponses of each target meta-atom placed in a large array with near-field\ncoupling effects taken into account. The predicting neural network takes the\nphysical specifications of the target meta-atom and its neighbors as input, and\ncalculates its phase and amplitude in milliseconds. This approach can be\napplied to explain metasurfaces' performance deterioration caused by mutual\ncoupling and further used to optimize their efficiencies once combined with\noptimization algorithms.

This observation has motivated many researchers to come up with more\nadvanced instruction prefetchers. In 2011, Proactive Instruction Fetch (PIF)\nshowed that a hardware prefetcher could effectively eliminate all of the\ninstruction-cache misses. However, its enormous storage cost makes it an\nimpractical solution. Consequently, reducing the storage cost was the main\nresearch focus in the instruction prefetching in the past decade. Several\ninstruction prefetchers, including RDIP and Shotgun, were proposed to offer\nPIF-level performance with significantly lower storage overhead. However, our\nfindings show that there is a considerable performance gap between these\nproposals and PIF. While these proposals use different mechanisms for\ninstruction prefetching, the performance gap is largely not because of the\nmechanism, and instead, is due to not having sufficient storage. Prior\nproposals suffer from one or both of the following shortcomings: (1) a large\nnumber of metadata records to cover the potential, and (2) a high storage cost\nof each record.

This\nallows a greater planning flexibility and a more efficient use of the fleet,\nbut in counterpart, a high synchronisation is demanded. In this work, we\npresent a VRCSP where pickup-and-delivery requests with time windows have to be\nfulfilled over a given planning horizon by using trucks and drivers. Crews can\nbe composed of 1 or 2 drivers and any of them can be relieved in a given set of\nlocations. Moreover, they are allowed to travel among locations with\nnon-company shuttles, at an additional cost that is minimised. As our problem\nconsiders distinct routes for trucks and drivers, we have an additional\nflexibility not contemplated in other previous VRCSP given in the literature\nwhere a crew is handled as an indivisible unit. We tackle this problem with a\ntwo-stage sequential approach: a set of truck routes is computed in the first\nstage and a set of driver routes consistent with the truck routes is obtained\nin the second one. We design and evaluate the performance of a metaheuristic\nbased algorithm for the latter stage. Our algorithm is mainly a GRASP with a\nperturbation procedure that allows reusing solutions already found in case the\nsearch for new solutions becomes difficult. This procedure together with other\nto repair infeasible solutions allow us to find high-quality solutions on\ninstances of 100 requests spread across 15 cities with a fleet of 12-32 trucks\n(depending on the planning horizon) in less than an hour. We also conclude that\nthe possibility of carrying an additional driver leads to a decrease of the\ncost of external shuttles by about 60% on average with respect to individual\ncrews and, in some cases, to remove this cost completely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 22:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

This rich Dirac-like electronic dispersion offers\nthe possibility to observe Dirac type-III nodes and study their role in the\nphysical properties of Rh3In3.4Ge3.6 and related Ir3Ge7-type materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 23:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

The power generation system is based on\ndistributed energy resources (DERs) interfaced with either grid-forming (GFM)\nor grid-following (GFL) inverters. The secondary controller is based on online\nfeedback optimization leveraging the learned sensitivities of the changes in\nthe system frequency, voltage magnitudes at critical buses, and active power\nflows through critical lines to the changes in inverter active and reactive\npower setpoints. To learn the sensitivities accurately from data, the feedback\noptimization has a built-in mechanism for keeping the secondary control inputs\npersistently exciting without degrading its performance. The feedback\noptimization also utilizes the learned power-voltage characteristics of\nphotovoltaic (PV) arrays to compute DC-link voltage setpoints so as to allow\nthe PV arrays to track the power setpoints. To learn the power-voltage\ncharacteristics, we separately execute a data-driven approach that fits a\nconcave polynomial to the collected power-voltage measurements by solving a\nsum-of-squares (SoS) optimization.

The canonical model of\nnormal grain growth, developed by Hillert, predicts a grain-size distribution\nthat bears a systematic discrepancy with observed distributions. To address\nthis, we propose a change to the Hillert model that accounts for the influence\nof heterogeneity in the local environment of grains. In our model, each grain\nevolves in response to its own local environment of neighbouring grains, rather\nthan to the global population of grains. The local environment of each grain\nevolves according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process. Our results are\nconsistent with accepted grain-growth kinetics. Crucially, our model indicates\nthat the size of relatively large grains evolves as a random walk due to the\ninherent variability in their local environments. This leads to a broader\ngrain-size distribution than the Hillert model and indicates that heterogeneity\nhas a critical influence on the evolution of microstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 23:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

In more detail, some common atmosphere molecules, such as oxygen and\nwater, can absorb and re-radiate energy in their natural resonance frequencies,\nsuch as 60 GHz, 180 GHz and 320 GHz. Hence, when hit by electromagnetic waves,\nmolecules will get excited and absorb energy, which leads to an extra path loss\nand is known as molecular attenuation. Meanwhile, the absorbed energy will be\nre-radiated towards a random direction with a random phase. These re-radiated\nwaves also interfere with the signal transmission. Although, the molecular\nre-radiation was mostly considered as noise in literature, recent works show\nthat it is correlated to the main signal and can be viewed as a composition of\nmultiple delayed or scattered signals. Such a phenomenon can provide\nnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths in an environment that lacks scatterers, which\nincreases spatial multiplexing and thus greatly enhances the performance of\nMIMO systems. Therefore in this paper, we explore the scattering model and\nnoise models of molecular re-radiation to characterize the channel transfer\nfunction of the NLoS channels created by atmosphere molecules. Our simulation\nresults show that the re-radiation can increase MIMO capacity up to 3 folds in\nmmWave and 6 folds in terahertz for a set of realistic transmit power,\ndistance, and antenna numbers. We also show that in the high SNR, the\nre-radiation makes the open-loop precoding viable, which is an alternative to\nbeamforming to avoid beam alignment sensitivity in high mobility applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 00:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

However,\ncognitive psychological research has highlighted the cognitive limitations of\nhumans with respect to 1. Probabilistic assessment of the patient state and of\npotential outcomes of various decisions, 2. Elicitation of the patient utility\nfunction, and 3. Integration of the probabilistic knowledge and of patient\npreferences to determine the optimal strategy. Therefore, without adequate\ncomputational support, current shared decision models have severe ethical\ndeficiencies. An informed consent model unfairly transfers the responsibility\nto a patient who does not have the necessary knowledge, nor the integration\ncapability. A paternalistic model endows with exaggerated power a physician who\nmight not be aware of the patient preferences, is prone to multiple cognitive\nbiases, and whose computational integration capability is bounded. Recent\nprogress in Artificial Intelligence suggests adding a third agent: a computer,\nin all deliberative medical decisions: Non emergency medical decisions in which\nmore than one alternative exists, the patient preferences can be elicited, the\ntherapeutic alternatives might be influenced by these preferences, medical\nknowledge exists regarding the likelihood of the decision outcomes, and there\nis sufficient decision time. Ethical physicians should exploit computational\ndecision support technologies, neither making the decisions solely on their\nown, nor shirking their duty and shifting the responsibility to patients in the\nname of informed consent. The resulting three way (patient, care provider,\ncomputer) human machine model that we suggest emphasizes the patient\npreferences, the physician knowledge, and the computational integration of both\naspects, does not diminish the physician role, but rather brings out the best\nin human and machine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 00:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Prior works showed that an adversary could exploit\nphysical interaction vulnerabilities among apps and put the users and\nenvironment at risk, e.g., to break into a house, an adversary turns on the\nheater to trigger an app that opens windows when the temperature exceeds a\nthreshold. Currently, the safe behavior of physical interactions relies on\neither app code analysis or dynamic analysis of device states with manually\nderived policies by developers. However, existing works fail to achieve\nsufficient breadth and fidelity to translate the app code into their physical\nbehavior or provide incomplete security policies, causing poor accuracy and\nfalse alarms. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, IoTSeer, which\nefficiently combines app code analysis and dynamic analysis with new security\npolicies to discover physical interaction vulnerabilities. IoTSeer works by\nfirst translating sensor events and actuator commands of each app into a\nphysical execution model (PeM) and unifying PeMs to express composite physical\nexecution of apps (CPeM). CPeM allows us to deploy IoTSeer in different smart\nhomes by defining its execution parameters with minimal data collection.\nIoTSeer supports new security policies with intended/unintended physical\nchannel labels. It then efficiently checks them on the CPeM via falsification,\nwhich addresses the undecidability of verification due to the continuous and\ndiscrete behavior of IoT devices. We evaluate IoTSeer in an actual house with\n14 actuators, six sensors, and 39 apps. IoTSeer discovers 16 unique policy\nviolations, whereas prior works identify only 2 out of 16 with 18 falsely\nflagged violations. IoTSeer only requires 30 mins of data collection for each\nactuator to set the CPeM parameters and is adaptive to newly added, removed,\nand relocated devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 00:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 03:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

The transport\nproperties of phonons, the major microscopic heat carriers in semiconductors\nand insulators, particularly their scattering mechanisms, have been a central\ntheme in microscale heat conduction research. In the past two decades,\nsignificant advancements have been made in computational and experimental\nefforts to probe phonon-phonon, phonon-impurity, and phonon-boundary scattering\nchannels in detail. In contrast, electron-phonon scatterings were long thought\nto have negligible effects on thermal transport in most materials under ambient\nconditions. This article reviews the recent progress in first-principles\ncomputations and experimental methods that show clear evidence for a strong\nimpact of electron-phonon interaction on phonon transport in a wide variety of\ntechnologically relevant solid-state materials. Under thermal equilibrium\nconditions, electron-phonon interactions can modify the total phonon scattering\nrates and renormalize the phonon frequency, as determined by the imaginary part\nand the real part of the phonon self-energy, respectively. Under nonequilibrium\ntransport conditions, electron-phonon interactions can affect the coupled\ntransport of electrons and phonons in the bulk through the \"phonon or electron\ndrag\" mechanism as well as the interfacial thermal transport. Based on these\nrecent results, we evaluate the potential use of electron-phonon interactions\nto control thermal transport in solids.

These subhaloes would host \"orphan\ngalaxies\" in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution (SAMs).\nPredicting the evolution of the phase-space components of USHs is crucial for\nthe adequate modelling of environmental processes, interactions and mergers\nimplemented in SAMs that affect the baryonic properties of orphan satellites.\nOur model takes into account dynamical friction drag, mass loss by tidal\nstripping and merger with the host halo, involving three free parameters. To\ncalibrate this model, we consider two DM-only simulations of different mass\nresolution (MultiDark simulations). The simulation with higher-mass resolution\n({\\sc smdpl}; $ m_{\\rm DM} = 9.6 \\times 10^7 ~ h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$)\nprovides information about subhaloes that are not resolved in the lower-mass\nresolution one ({\\sc mdpl2}; $ m_{\\rm DM} = 1.5 \\times 10^9 ~\nh^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$); the orbit of those USHs is tracked by our model.\nWe use as constraining functions the subhalo mass function (SHMF) and the\ntwo-point correlation function (2PCF) obtained from {\\sc smdpl}, being the\nlatter a novel aspect of our approach.

Latent common factors in\nfactor models are defined as time-related mortality indices (such as $\\kappa_t$\nin the Lee-Carter model). Factor loadings, which capture the linear\nrelationship between age variables and latent common factors (such as $\\beta_x$\nin the Lee-Carter model), are assumed to be time-invariant in the classical\nframework. This assumption is usually too restrictive in reality as mortality\ndatasets typically span a long period of time. Driving forces such as medical\nimprovement of certain diseases, environmental changes and technological\nprogress may significantly influence the relationship of different variables.\nIn this paper, we first develop a factor model with time-varying factor\nloadings (time-varying factor model) as an extension of the classical factor\nmodel for mortality modelling. Two forecasting methods to extrapolate the\nfactor loadings, the local regression method and the naive method, are proposed\nfor the time-varying factor model. From the empirical data analysis, we find\nthat the new model can capture the empirical feature of time-varying factor\nloadings and improve mortality forecasting over different horizons and\ncountries.

During\neach slip event, when the stored energy is released, particles experience large\nrearrangements and the granular network can significantly change. Here, we use\nnumerical simulations of 3D, sheared frictional packings to show that the mean\nbetweenness centrality -- a property of network of interparticle connections --\nfollows consistent patterns during the stick-slip dynamics, showing sharp\nspikes at each slip event. We identify the source of this behavior as arising\nfrom the connectivity and contact arrangements of granular network during\ndilation-compaction cycles, and find that a lower potential for connection\nbetween particles leads to an increase of mean betweenness centrality in the\nsystem.

Such communication will\nneed to be two way: effective not only in the satellite-to-ground (downlink)\nchannel but also in the ground-to-satellite channel (uplink). Given that losses\non this latter channel are significantly larger relative to the former,\ntechniques that can exploit the superior downlink to enhance quantum\ncommunication in the uplink should be explored. In this work we do just that -\nexploring how continuous variable entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezed\nvacuum (TMSV) states can be used to significantly enhance the fidelity of\nground-to-satellite quantum-state transfer relative to direct uplink-transfer.\nMore specifically, through detailed phase-screen simulations of beam evolution\nthrough turbulent atmospheres in both the downlink and uplink channels, we\ndemonstrate how a TMSV teleportation channel created by the satellite can be\nused to dramatically improve the fidelity of uplink coherent-state transfer\nrelative to direct transfer. We then show how this, in turn, leads to the\nuplink-transmission of a higher alphabet of coherent states. Additionally, we\nshow how non-Gaussian operations acting on the received component of the TMSV\nstate at the ground station can lead to even further enhancement. Since TMSV\nstates can be readily produced in situ on a satellite platform and form a\nreliable teleportation channel for most quantum states, our work suggests\nfuture satellites forming part of the emerging Quantum Internet should be\ndesigned with uplink-communication via TMSV teleportation in mind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 03:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

State redistribution\nrelaxes the overly restrictive CFL condition that results from arbitrarily\nsmall cut cells and explicit time stepping. Thus, the scheme can take time\nsteps that are proportional to the size of cells in the background grid. The\ndiscontinuous Galerkin scheme is stabilized by postprocessing the numerical\nsolution after each stage or step of an explicit time stepping method. This is\ndone by temporarily merging the small cells into larger, possibly overlapping\nneighborhoods using a special weighted inner product. Then, the numerical\nsolution on the neighborhoods is returned to the base grid in a conservative\nfashion. The advantage of this approach is that it uses only basic mesh\ninformation that is already available in many cut cell codes and does not\nrequire complex geometric manipulations.

Consequently, the machine learning model in such software systems may\nexhibit unintended demographic bias based on specific characteristics (e.g.,\ngender, occupation, country-of-origin, etc.). Such biases manifest in an SA\nsystem when it predicts a different sentiment for similar texts that differ\nonly in the characteristic of individuals described. Existing studies on\nrevealing bias in SA systems rely on the production of sentences from a small\nset of short, predefined templates.\n  To address this limitation, we present BisaFinder, an approach to discover\nbiased predictions in SA systems via metamorphic testing. A key feature of\nBisaFinder is the automatic curation of suitable templates based on the pieces\nof text from a large corpus, using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques to identify words that describe demographic characteristics. Next,\nBisaFinder instantiates new text from these templates by filling in\nplaceholders with words associated with a class of a characteristic (e.g.,\ngender-specific words such as female names, \"she\", \"her\"). These texts are used\nto tease out bias in an SA system. BisaFinder identifies a bias-uncovering test\ncase when it detects that the SA system exhibits demographic bias for a pair of\ntexts, i.e., it predicts a different sentiment for texts that differ only in\nwords associated with a different class (e.g., male vs. female) of a target\ncharacteristic (e.g., gender).

It is based on\nthe foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance and anisotropic conformal\ninvariance. The anisotropy is embodied by introducing a factor $z$ which\ndiscriminates the scaling degree of the extra $D$ dimensions against the\n$d$-dimensional base spacetime and Weyl scalar field which mediates the\nanisotropic scaling symmetry. There is no intrinsic scale but a physical scale\n$M_*$ emerges as a consequence of spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking. Some\nvacuum solutions are obtained and we discuss an issue of `size separation'\nbetween the base spacetime and the extra dimensions. The size separation means\nlarge hierarchy between the scales appearing in the base spacetime and the\nextra dimensions respectively. We also discuss interesting theories obtained\nfrom our model.

Stroop test was applied between the measurements\nbefore and after the Ironmen competition to induce cognitive stress.\nSynchrogram and empirical mode decomposition analysis were used for the first\ntime to investigate the effects of physical stress, induced by the Ironmen\ncompetition, on the phase synchronization of the cardiac and respiratory\nsystems of Ironmen athletes before and after the competition. A cognitive\nstress task (Stroop test) was performed both pre- and post-Ironman event in\norder to prevent the athletes from cognitively controlling their breathing\nrates. Our analysis showed that cardiorespiratory synchronization increased\npost-Ironman race compared to pre-Ironman. The results suggest that the amount\nof stress the athletes are recovering from post-competition is greater than the\neffects of the Stroop test. This indicates that the recovery phase after the\ncompetition is more important for restoring and maintaining homeostasis, which\ncould be another reason for stronger synchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 05:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

These applications rely\non video pipelines, represented as DAGs of operations, to transform videos,\nprocess extracted metadata, and answer questions like, \"Is this intersection\ncongested?\" The latency and resource efficiency of pipelines can be optimized\nusing configurable knobs for each operation (e.g., sampling rate, batch size,\nor type of hardware used). However, determining efficient configurations is\nchallenging because (a) the configuration search space is exponentially large,\nand (b) the optimal configuration depends on users' desired latency and cost\ntargets, (c) input video contents may exercise different paths in the DAG and\nproduce a variable amount intermediate results. Existing video analytics and\nprocessing systems leave it to the users to manually configure operations and\nselect hardware resources.\n  We present Llama: a heterogeneous and serverless framework for auto-tuning\nvideo pipelines. Given an end-to-end latency target, Llama optimizes for cost\nefficiency by (a) calculating a latency target for each operation invocation,\nand (b) dynamically running a cost-based optimizer to assign configurations\nacross heterogeneous hardware that best meet the calculated per-invocation\nlatency target. This makes the problem of auto-tuning large video pipelines\ntractable and allows us to handle input-dependent behavior, conditional\nbranches in the DAG, and execution variability. We describe the algorithms in\nLlama and evaluate it on a cloud platform using serverless CPU and GPU\nresources.

For example,\nbiometrics was traditionally statistics for agriculture in all its forms but\nnow, in Data Science, it means the study of characteristics that can be used to\nidentify an individual. Examples of non-intrusive measurements include height,\nweight, fingerprints, retina scan, voice, photograph/video (facial landmarks\nand facial expressions), and gait. A multivariate analysis of such data would\nbe a complex project for a statistician, but a software engineer might appear\nto have no trouble with it at all. In any applied-statistics project, the\nstatistician worries about uncertainty and quantifies it by modelling data as\nrealisations generated from a probability space. Another approach to\nuncertainty quantification is to find similar data sets, and then use the\nvariability of results between these data sets to capture the uncertainty. Both\napproaches allow 'error bars' to be put on estimates obtained from the original\ndata set, although the interpretations are different. A third approach, that\nconcentrates on giving a single answer and gives up on uncertainty\nquantification, could be considered as Data Engineering, although it has staked\na claim in the Data Science terrain.

The incorporation of 1 at% Al with 1.5 wt% RGO\ninto ZnO (AGZO) has been found to show significant enhancement in zT (=0.52 at\n1100 K) which is an order of magnitude larger compared to that of bare undoped\nZnO.

However, recent studies have\npointed out that the highlighted image regions from the visual attention are\noften irrelevant to the given question and answer, leading to model confusion\nfor correct visual reasoning. To tackle this problem, existing methods mostly\nresort to aligning the visual attention weights with human attentions.\nNevertheless, gathering such human data is laborious and expensive, making it\nburdensome to adapt well-developed models across datasets. To address this\nissue, in this paper, we devise a novel visual attention regularization\napproach, namely AttReg, for better visual grounding in VQA. Specifically,\nAttReg firstly identifies the image regions which are essential for question\nanswering yet unexpectedly ignored (i.e., assigned with low attention weights)\nby the backbone model. And then a mask-guided learning scheme is leveraged to\nregularize the visual attention to focus more on these ignored key regions. The\nproposed method is very flexible and model-agnostic, which can be integrated\ninto most visual attention-based VQA models and require no human attention\nsupervision. Extensive experiments over three benchmark datasets, i.e., VQA-CP\nv2, VQA-CP v1, and VQA v2, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of\nAttReg. As a by-product, when incorporating AttReg into the strong baseline\nLMH, our approach can achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.00% with an\nabsolute performance gain of 7.01% on the VQA-CP v2 benchmark dataset...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 07:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 08:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

In this article, we propose a sensitivity\nanalysis strategy that is informed by the stability of the exposure effect over\ndifferent, well-chosen subsets of the measured confounders. The proposal\nentails first approximating the process for recording confounders to learn\nabout how the effect is potentially affected by varying amounts of unmeasured\nconfounding, then extrapolating to the effect had hypothetical unmeasured\nconfounders been additionally adjusted for. A large set of measured confounders\ncan thus be exploited to provide insight into the likely presence of unmeasured\nconfounding bias, albeit under an assumption about how data on the confounders\nare recorded. The proposal's ability to reveal the true effect and ensure valid\ninference after extrapolation is empirically compared with existing methods\nusing simulation studies. We demonstrate the procedure using two different\npublicly available datasets commonly used for causal inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 08:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Therefore, the ability to have a predefined playbook (as in the NFL)\nwhich would allow a team to predict how best to set their fielders given the\ncontext of the game, the batsman they are bowling to and bowlers at their\ndisposal would give them a significant strategic advantage.\n  To this end, we present a personalized deep neural network approach which can\npredict the probabilities of where a specific batsman will hit a specific\nbowler and bowl type, in a specific game-scenario.

One difference from human vision is that\nthey do not appear to perceive illusory contours (e.g. Kanizsa squares) in the\nsame way humans do. Physiological evidence from visual cortex suggests that the\nperception of illusory contours could involve feedback connections. Would\nrecurrent feedback neural networks perceive illusory contours like humans? In\nthis work we equip a deep feedforward convolutional network with brain-inspired\nrecurrent dynamics. The network was first pretrained with an unsupervised\nreconstruction objective on a natural image dataset, to expose it to natural\nobject contour statistics. Then, a classification decision layer was added and\nthe model was finetuned on a form discrimination task: squares vs. randomly\noriented inducer shapes (no illusory contour). Finally, the model was tested\nwith the unfamiliar ''illusory contour'' configuration: inducer shapes oriented\nto form an illusory square. Compared with feedforward baselines, the iterative\n''predictive coding'' feedback resulted in more illusory contours being\nclassified as physical squares. The perception of the illusory contour was\nmeasurable in the luminance profile of the image reconstructions produced by\nthe model, demonstrating that the model really ''sees'' the illusion. Ablation\nstudies revealed that natural image pretraining and feedback error correction\nare both critical to the perception of the illusion. Finally we validated our\nconclusions in a deeper network (VGG): adding the same predictive coding\nfeedback dynamics again leads to the perception of illusory contours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 09:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 14:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

We use the parametrisation of thousands of HR\nstellar spectra provided by the AMBRE Project, and combine it with the\nautomated abundance determination GAUGUIN to derive LTE sulfur abundances for\n1855 slow-rotating FGK-type stars. This is the largest and most precise\ncatalogue of S-abundances published to date. It covers a metallicity domain as\nhigh as ~2.5dex starting at [M/H]~-2.0dex. We find that the [S/M] abundances\nratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime,\nand then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex. This decrease\ncontinues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently\nreported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models.\nMoreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very\ndifferent kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich\nand sulfur-poor ones. Two disc components, associated with the thin and thick\ndiscs, are thus seen independently in kinematics and sulfur abundances. The\nsulfur radial gradients in the Galactic discs have also been estimated.\nFinally, the enrichment in sulfur with respect to iron is nicely correlated\nwith stellar ages: older metal-poor stars have higher [S/M] ratios than younger\nmetal-rich ones.

To overcome the theoretical bounds of\nByzantine fault tolerance, many protocols attempt to use Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) to prevent equivocation and improve performance and\nscalability. However, due to the broken quorum intersection assumption caused\nby the reduction of the replica number, the improvement is mostly at the cost\nof increased communication complexity which prevents existing TEE-based\nprotocols to be applied to large-scale blockchain systems. In this paper, we\npropose TBFT, an efficient Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol in the partial\nsynchrony setting, which has O(n) message complexity in both normal-case and\nview-change. Compared to previous protocols, TBFT uses TEE-assisted primitives\nto limit more types of malicious behaviors of replicas rather than preventing\nequivocation only, thereby reducing the latency and communication complexity of\nclients and replicas. Besides, we also introduce lightweight cryptographic\nprimitives including a novel leader election mechanism and an efficient voting\nmessage aggregation mechanism for better security and performance. We evaluate\nTBFT via systematic analysis and experiments, and the results show that TBFT\nhas better performance and scalability compared to other protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 09:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 08:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

As a solution, we propose a novel graph\nformulation called Compositional Graph Embedding (CGE) that learns image\nfeatures, compositional classifiers, and latent representations of visual\nprimitives in an end-to-end manner.

The cubic\nphase Pu$_{3}$Ga, one of the plutonium-gallium intermetallic compounds, plays a\nkey role in understanding the phase stability and phase transformation of the\nplutonium-gallium system.

A popular strategy is to learn a mapping between the semantic space of\nclass attributes and the visual space of images based on the seen classes and\ntheir data. Thus, an unseen class image can be ideally mapped to its\ncorresponding class attributes. The key challenge is how to align the\nrepresentations in the two spaces. For most ZSL settings, the attributes for\neach seen/unseen class are only represented by a vector while the seen-class\ndata provide much more information. Thus, the imbalanced supervision from the\nsemantic and the visual space can make the learned mapping easily overfitting\nto the seen classes. To resolve this problem, we propose Isometric Propagation\nNetwork (IPN), which learns to strengthen the relation between classes within\neach space and align the class dependency in the two spaces. Specifically, IPN\nlearns to propagate the class representations on an auto-generated graph within\neach space. In contrast to only aligning the resulted static representation, we\nregularize the two dynamic propagation procedures to be isometric in terms of\nthe two graphs' edge weights per step by minimizing a consistency loss between\nthem. IPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular ZSL\nbenchmarks. To evaluate the generalization capability of IPN, we further build\ntwo larger benchmarks with more diverse unseen classes and demonstrate the\nadvantages of IPN on them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 12:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

In quantum Hall ferromagnet, it has been predicted in the early 90s\nthat spin and charges are entangled, meaning that any change of the spin\ntexture modifies the charge distribution.

By\npropagating towards the interferometer through an insulating bulk, the magnon\nelectric dipole moment modifies the Aharonov-Bohm flux through the\ninterferometer, changing both its phase and its visibility. In particular, we\nrelate the phase shift to the sign of this electric dipole moment, and the\nexponential loss of visibility to the flux of emitted magnons. Finally, we\nprobe the emission energy threshold of the magnons close to filling factor v=1.\nApproaching v=0, we observe that the emission energy threshold diminishes\ntowards zero, which might be linked to the existence of gapless mode in the\ncanted-antiferromagnetic (CAF) phase at v=0.

Although cryo-EM is widely used for 3D\nreconstruction, due to its single-particle nature, it has the potential to\nprovide information about the biomolecule's conformational variability and\nunderlying free energy landscape. However, treating cryo-EM as a\nsingle-molecule technique is challenging because of the low signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) in the individual particles. In this work, we developed the\ncryo-BIFE method, cryo-EM Bayesian Inference of Free Energy profiles, that uses\na path collective variable to extract free energy profiles and their\nuncertainties from cryo-EM images. We tested the framework over several\nsynthetic systems, where we controlled the imaging parameters and conditions.\nWe found that for realistic cryo-EM environments and relevant biomolecular\nsystems, it is possible to recover the underlying free energy, with the pose\naccuracy and SNR as crucial determinants. Then, we used the method to study the\nconformational transitions of a calcium-activated channel with real cryo-EM\nparticles. Interestingly, we recover the most probable conformation (used to\ngenerate a high resolution reconstruction of the calcium-bound state), and we\nfind two additional meta-stable states, one which corresponds to the\ncalcium-unbound conformation. As expected for turnover transitions within the\nsame sample, the activation barriers are of the order of a couple $k_BT$.\nExtracting free energy profiles from cryo-EM will enable a more complete\ncharacterization of the thermodynamic ensemble of biomolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 14:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

To develop\neffective machine learning services, there is a must to exploit data from such\ndistributed databases without exchanging the raw data. Recently, federated\nlearning (FL) has been a solution with growing interests, which enables\nmultiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without\nexchanging their local data. A key and common challenge on distributed\ndatabases is the heterogeneity of the data distribution among the parties. The\ndata of different parties are usually non-independently and identically\ndistributed (i.e., non-IID). There have been many FL algorithms to address the\nlearning effectiveness under non-IID data settings. However, there lacks an\nexperimental study on systematically understanding their advantages and\ndisadvantages, as previous studies have very rigid data partitioning strategies\namong parties, which are hardly representative and thorough. In this paper, to\nhelp researchers better understand and study the non-IID data setting in\nfederated learning, we propose comprehensive data partitioning strategies to\ncover the typical non-IID data cases.

Using a sample of 199,307\ngiant stars with precise APOGEE abundances and APOGEE-astroNN ages, selected in\na +/-2 kpc layer around the galactic plane, we assess the dependency with\nguiding radius of: (i) the median metallicity, (ii) the ridge lines of the\n[Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] and age-[Mg/Fe] distributions and (iii) the Age Distribution\nFunction (ADF). The giant star sample allows us to probe the radial behaviour\nof the Galactic disc from Rg = 0 to 14-16 kpc. The thick disc [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe]\nridge lines follow closely grouped parallel paths, supporting the idea that the\nthick disc did form from a well-mixed medium. However, the ridge lines present\na small drift in [Mg/Fe], which decreases with increasing guiding radius. At\nsub-solar metallicity, the intermediate and outer thin disc [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe]\nridge lines follow parallel sequences shifted to lower metallicity as the\nguiding radius increases. We interpret this pattern, as the signature of a\ndilution of the inter-stellar medium from Rg~6 kpc to the outskirt of the disc,\nwhich occured before the onset of the thin disc formation. The APOGEE-AstroNN\nVAC provides stellar ages for statistically significant samples of thin disc\nstars from the Galactic centre up to Rg~14 kpc. An important result provided by\nthis dataset, is that the thin disc presents evidence of an inside-out\nformation up to R_g~10-12 kpc.(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 14:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

In this study, pure and blended thin films of copper\nphthalocyanine (CuPc) and the Buckminster fullerene (C60) were grown by vacuum\ndeposition onto a native silicon oxide substrate at two different substrate\ntemperatures, 310 K and 400 K.

Crystal orientation, island densities and\nmorphology were examined after the growth by X-ray diffraction experiments and\nmicroscopy techniques. The formation of a smooth wetting layer followed by\nrapid roughening was found in pure CuPc thin films, whereas C60 shows a fast\nformation of distinct islands at a very early stage of growth. The growth of\nneedle-like CuPc crystals loosing their alignment with the substrate was\nidentified in co-deposited thin films. Furthermore, the data demonstrates that\nstructural features become larger and more pronounced and that the island\ndensity decreases by a factor of four when going from 310 K to 400 K.

Three plumes are\nassociated with coronal bright points, jets and macrospicules at their base\n(active plumes) and the other two plumes are not (quiet plumes).

The phase speed (v_r), frequency (omega), and wavenumber (k) of the\nPIDs in the plumes are obtained by applying a Fourier transformation to the\nspace-time (r-t plane) plots in images taken with the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) in three different wavelength channels (171 A, 193 A, and 211\nA). We found that the PIDs in the higher temperature AIA channels, 193 and 211\nA, are faster than that of the cooler AIA 171 A channel. This tendency is more\nsignificant for the active plumes than the quiet ones. The observed speed ratio\n(~1.3) between the AIA 171 and 193 A channels is similar to the theoretical\nvalue (1.25) of a slow magnetoacoustic wave.

The effective use of pushing actions often requires an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the manipulated objects and adaptation to the\ndiscrepancies between prediction and reality. For this reason, effect\nprediction and parameter estimation with pushing actions have been heavily\ninvestigated in the literature. However, current approaches are limited because\nthey either model systems with a fixed number of objects or use image-based\nrepresentations whose outputs are not very interpretable and quickly accumulate\nerrors. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network based framework for\neffect prediction and parameter estimation of pushing actions by modeling\nobject relations based on contacts or articulations. Our framework is validated\nboth in real and simulated environments containing different shaped multi-part\nobjects connected via different types of joints and objects with different\nmasses, and it outperforms image-based representations on physics prediction.\nOur approach enables the robot to predict and adapt the effect of a pushing\naction as it observes the scene.

Our work is based on a new abstract variational derivation of\nparticle schemes which builds on a de Rham complex where Low's Lagrangian is\ndiscretized using a particle approximation of the distribution function. In\nthis framework, which extends the recent Finite Element based Geometric\nElectromagnetic PIC (GEMPIC) method to a variety of field solvers, the\ndiscretization of the electromagnetic potentials and fields is represented by a\nde Rham sequence of compatible spaces, and the particle-field coupling\nprocedure is described by approximation operators that commute with the\ndifferential operators in the sequence. In particular, for spectral Maxwell\nsolvers the choice of truncated $L^2$ projections using continuous Fourier\ntransform coefficients for the commuting approximation operators yields the\ngridless Particle-in-Fourier method, whereas spectral Particle-in-Cell methods\nare obtained by using discrete Fourier transform coefficients computed from a\ngrid. By introducing a new sequence of spectral pseudo-differential\napproximation operators, we then obtain a novel variational spectral PIC method\nwith discrete Hamiltonian structure that we call Fourier-GEMPIC. Fully discrete\nschemes are then derived using a Hamiltonian splitting procedure, leading to\nexplicit time steps that preserve the Gauss laws and the discrete Poisson\nbracket associated with the Hamiltonian structure. These explicit steps share\nmany similarities with standard spectral PIC methods.

Our findings indicate that published estimates all\nunderestimate the carbon footprint of ICT, possibly by as much as 25%, by\nfailing to account for all of ICT's supply chains and full lifecycle (i.e.\nemissions scopes 1, 2 and fully inclusive 3). Adjusting for truncation of\nsupply chain pathways, we estimate that ICT's share of emissions could actually\nbe as high as 2.1-3.9%.\n  There are pronounced differences between available projections of ICT's\nfuture emissions. These projections are dependent on underlying assumptions\nthat are sometimes, but not always, made explicit - and we explore these in the\nreport.

This\npaper builds a collaborative deep inference system between a\nresource-constrained mobile device and a powerful edge server, aiming at\njoining the power of both on-device processing and computation offloading. The\nbasic idea of this system is to partition a deep neural network (DNN) into a\nfront-end part running on the mobile device and a back-end part running on the\nedge server, with the key challenge being how to locate the optimal partition\npoint to minimize the end-to-end inference delay.

Therefore, ANS is able to closely\nfollow the changes of the system environment by generating new knowledge for\nadaptive decision making. The core of ANS is a novel contextual bandit learning\nalgorithm, called $\\mu$LinUCB, which not only has provable theoretical learning\nperformance guarantee but also is ultra-lightweight for easy real-world\nimplementation. We implement our system on a video stream object detection\ntestbed to validate the design of ANS and evaluate its performance.

Most existing methods aim\nto pull all the similar samples closer while push the dissimilar ones as far as\npossible. However, when some classes of the dataset exhibit multimodal\ndistribution, these goals conflict and thus can hardly be concurrently\nsatisfied. Additionally, to ensure a valid metric, many methods require a\nrepeated eigenvalue decomposition process, which is expensive and numerically\nunstable. Therefore, how to learn an appropriate distance metric from weakly\nsupervised data remains an open but challenging problem. To address this issue,\nin this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised metric learning algorithm,\nnamed MultimoDal Aware weakly supervised Metric Learning (MDaML). MDaML\npartitions the data space into several clusters and allocates the local cluster\ncenters and weight for each sample. Then, combining it with the weighted\ntriplet loss can further enhance the local separability, which encourages the\nlocal dissimilar samples to keep a large distance from the local similar\nsamples. Meanwhile, MDaML casts the metric learning problem into an\nunconstrained optimization on the SPD manifold, which can be efficiently solved\nby Riemannian Conjugate Gradient Descent (RCGD). Extensive experiments\nconducted on 13 datasets validate the superiority of the proposed MDaML.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 07:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

Directive\nexplanations list which specific actions an individual needs to take to achieve\ntheir desired outcome. If a machine learning model makes a decision that is\ndetrimental to an individual (e.g. denying a loan application), then it needs\nto both explain why it made that decision and also explain how the individual\ncould obtain their desired outcome (if possible). At present, this is often\ndone using counterfactual explanations, but such explanations generally do not\ntell individuals how to act.

In the prevailing evaluation paradigm, models do not\nactually decide whether a new fact should be accepted or not but are solely\njudged on the position of true facts in a likelihood ranking with other\ncandidates. We argue that consideration of binary predictions is essential to\nreflect the actual KBC quality, and propose a novel evaluation paradigm,\ndesigned to provide more transparent model selection criteria for a realistic\nscenario. We construct the data set FB14k-QAQ where instead of single facts, we\nuse KB queries, i.e., facts where one entity is replaced with a variable, and\nconstruct corresponding sets of entities that are correct answers. We randomly\nremove some of these correct answers from the data set, simulating the\nrealistic scenario of real-world entities missing from a KB. This way, we can\nexplicitly measure a model's ability to handle queries that have more correct\nanswers in the real world than in the KB, including the special case of queries\nwithout any valid answer. The latter especially contrasts the ranking setting.\nWe evaluate a number of state-of-the-art KB embeddings models on our new\nbenchmark. The differences in relative performance between ranking-based and\nclassification-based evaluation that we observe in our experiments confirm our\nhypothesis that good performance on the ranking task does not necessarily\ntranslate to good performance on the actual completion task. Our results\nmotivate future work on KB embedding models with better prediction separability\nand, as a first step in that direction, we propose a simple variant of TransE\nthat encourages thresholding and achieves a significant improvement in\nclassification F1 score relative to the original TransE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 17:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

In SIoT, objects can establish social relationships in an\nautonomous manner and interact with the other objects in the network based on\ntheir social behaviour. A fundamental problem that needs attention is\nestablishing of these relationships in a reliable and trusted way, i.e.,\nestablishing trustworthy relationships and building trust amongst objects. In\naddition, it is also indispensable to ascertain and predict an object's\nbehaviour in the SIoT network over a period of time.
