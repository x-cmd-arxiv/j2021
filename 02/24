The liberty to express\nyour thoughts without passing through any credibility check is leading to\ndissemination of fake content in the ecosystem. It can have disastrous effects\non both individuals and society as a whole. The amplification of fake news is\nbecoming rampant in India too. Debunked information often gets republished with\na replacement description, claiming it to depict some different incidence. To\ncurb such fabricated stories, it is necessary to investigate such deduplicates\nand false claims made in public. The majority of studies on automatic\nfact-checking and fake news detection is restricted to English only. But for a\ncountry like India where only 10% of the literate population speak English,\nrole of regional languages in spreading falsity cannot be undermined. In this\npaper, we introduce FactDRIL: the first large scale multilingual Fact-checking\nDataset for Regional Indian Languages. We collect an exhaustive dataset across\n7 months covering 11 low-resource languages. Our propose dataset consists of\n9,058 samples belonging to English, 5,155 samples to Hindi and remaining 8,222\nsamples are distributed across various regional languages, i.e. Bangla,\nMarathi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, Oriya, Assamese, Punjabi, Urdu, Sinhala and\nBurmese. We also present the detailed characterization of three M's\n(multi-lingual, multi-media, multi-domain) in the FactDRIL accompanied with the\ncomplete list of other varied attributes making it a unique dataset to study.\nLastly, we present some potential use cases of the dataset. We expect this\ndataset will be a valuable resource and serve as a starting point to fight\nproliferation of fake news in low resource languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

By means of large-scale two-dimensional\nradiative particle-in-cell simulations, we show that orphan gamma-ray flares\nmay be a self-consistent by-product of particle energization in turbulent\nmagnetically-dominated pair plasmas. The energized particles produce the\ngamma-ray flare by inverse Compton scattering an external radiation field,\nwhile the synchrotron luminosity is heavily suppressed since the particles are\naccelerated nearly along the direction of the local magnetic field. The ratio\nof inverse Compton to synchrotron luminosity is sensitive to the initial\nstrength of turbulent fluctuations (a larger degree of turbulent fluctuations\nweakens the anisotropy of the energized particles, thus increasing the\nsynchrotron luminosity).

The emergence of\nhierarchy in growing complex networks may stem from one particular property of\nthese ignored subgraphs: their graph conductance. Being a quantification of the\nmain bottleneck of flow on the subgraph, all such subgraphs will then have a\nspecific structural limitation associated with this scalar value.

In many of these scenarios, the main challenge\nis maintaining high throughput and ensuring proper quality of service (QoS) in\nirregular topologies. In multiple input multiple output systems, this challenge\ntranslates to designing linear transmit and receive beamformers that maximize\nthe system throughput and manage QoS constraints. In this paper, we argue that\nthis basic design task in 5G and beyond systems must be extended such that\nbeamforming design and user scheduling are managed jointly. Specifically, we\npropose a fully decentralized joint beamforming design and user scheduling\nalgorithm that manages QoS. A novel feature of this scheme is its ability to\nreduce the initial rate requirements in case of infeasibility. By means of\nsimulations that model contemporary 5G scenarios, we show that the proposed\ndecentralized scheme outperforms benchmarking algorithms that do not support\nminimum rate requirements and previously proposed algorithms that support QoS\nrequirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Our study is focused on\nthe regime where the dispersive optomechanical coupling in the system vanishes.\nSuch a regime is found to be possible if the membrane is less reflecting than\nthe adjacent mirror, yielding a potentially very strong dissipative\noptomechanical coupling. Specifically, if the absolute values of amplitude\ntransmission coefficients of the membrane and the mirror, $t$ and $t_m$\nrespectively, obey the condition $ t_m^2< t\\ll t_m\\ll 1$, the dissipative\ncoupling constant of the setup exceeds the dispersive coupling constant for an\noptomechanical cavity of the same length.

Currently, several machine learning and deep\nlearning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault detection and\ndiagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of\nsuch technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations\nand insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the\nunavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised\nmodels unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis\nin rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three\nparts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first\npart, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted.\nSecondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an\nunsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of\nthe methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in\nfault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret\nblack-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by\nthe model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for\ndiagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause\nanalysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets\ncontaining different mechanical faults in rotating machinery.

Since\ntheir formal introduction by Austrin, Guruswami, and H\\aa stad, there has been\na flurry of works on PCSPs [BBKO19,KO19,WZ20]. The key tool in studying PCSPs\nis the algebraic framework developed in the context of CSPs where the closure\nproperties of the satisfying solutions known as the polymorphisms are analyzed.\n  The polymorphisms of PCSPs are much richer than CSPs. In the Boolean case, we\nstill do not know if dichotomy for PCSPs exists analogous to Schaefer's\ndichotomy result for CSPs. In this paper, we study a special case of Boolean\nPCSPs, namely Boolean Ordered PCSPs where the Boolean PCSPs have the predicate\n$x \\leq y$. In the algebraic framework, this is the special case of Boolean\nPCSPs when the polymorphisms are monotone functions.

While conventional deep learning methods\noften yield deterministic results, advances in deep Bayesian learning allow for\naccurate predictions with a probabilistic interpretation in numerous image\nclassification and segmentation tasks. It is however nontrivial to extend such\nBayesian methods to cell detection, which requires specialized learning\nframeworks.

The question of how to perform\nclustering to improve the performance of classifiers trained on the clusters\nhas received scant attention in previous literature, despite its importance in\nseveral real-world applications. In this paper, first, we theoretically analyze\nthe generalization performance of classifiers trained on clustered data and\nfind conditions under which clustering can potentially aid classification.

For these models to work efficiently, it is best to\navoid Biot-Savart interactions. This work presents a grid-based treatment of\npotential flows in two dimensions and its use in a vortex model for simulating\nunsteady aerodynamic flows. For flows consisting of vortex elements, the\ntreatment follows the vortex-in-cell approach and solves the\nstreamfunction-vorticity Poisson equation on a Cartesian grid after\ntransferring the circulation from the vortices onto the grid. For sources and\nsinks, an analogous approach can be followed using the scalar potential. The\ncombined velocity field due to vortices, sinks, and sources can then be\nobtained using the Helmholtz decomposition. In this work, we use several key\ntools that ensure the approach works on arbitrary geometries, with and without\nsharp edges. Firstly, the immersed boundary projection method is used to\naccount for bodies in the flow and the resulting body-forcing Lagrange\nmultiplier is identified as the bound vortex sheet strength. Secondly, sharp\nedges are treated by decomposing the vortex sheet strength into a singular and\nsmooth part. To enforce the Kutta condition, the smooth part can then be\nconstrained to remove the singularity introduced by the sharp edge. These\nconstraints and the Poisson equation are formulated as a saddle-point system\nand solved using the Schur complement method. The lattice Green's function is\nused to efficiently solve the discrete Poisson equation with unbounded boundary\nconditions.

Since computational intractability often results from\npathological instances, we look for methods to benchmark the performance of\nalgorithms against optimal solutions on real-world instances. The main\nchallenge is that an optimal solution cannot be efficiently computed for\nintractable problems, and we therefore often do not know how far a solution is\nfrom being optimal. A major question is therefore how to measure the\nperformance of an algorithm in comparison to an optimal solution on instances\nwe encounter in practice.\n  In this paper, we address this question in the context of submodular\noptimization problems. For the canonical problem of submodular maximization\nunder a cardinality constraint, it is intractable to compute a solution that is\nbetter than a $1-1/e \\approx 0.63$ fraction of the optimum. Algorithms like the\ncelebrated greedy algorithm are guaranteed to achieve this $1-1/e$ bound on any\ninstance and are used in practice.\n  Our main contribution is not a new algorithm for submodular maximization but\nan analytical method that measures how close an algorithm for submodular\nmaximization is to optimal on a given problem instance. We use this method to\nshow that on a wide variety of real-world datasets and objectives, the\napproximation of the solution found by greedy goes well beyond $1-1/e$ and is\noften at least 0.95. We develop this method using a novel technique that lower\nbounds the objective of a dual minimization problem to obtain an upper bound on\nthe value of an optimal solution to the primal maximization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 19:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

For this, any extra background rejection handle, beyond\nexcellent energy resolution and the use of extremely radiopure materials, is of\nutmost importance. The NEXT experiment exploits differences in the spatial\nionization patterns of double beta decay and single-electron events to\ndiscriminate signal from background. While the former display two Bragg peak\ndense ionization regions at the opposite ends of the track, the latter\ntypically have only one such feature. Thus, comparing the energies at the track\nextremes provides an additional rejection tool. The unique combination of the\ntopology-based background discrimination and excellent energy resolution (1%\nFWHM at the Q-value of the decay) is the distinguishing feature of NEXT.\nPrevious studies demonstrated a topological background rejection factor of ~5\nwhen reconstructing electron-positron pairs in the $^{208}$Tl 1.6 MeV double\nescape peak (with Compton events as background), recorded in the NEXT-White\ndemonstrator at the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc, with 72% signal\nefficiency. This was recently improved through the use of a deep convolutional\nneural network to yield a background rejection factor of ~10 with 65% signal\nefficiency. Here, we present a new reconstruction method, based on the\nRichardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm, which allows reversing the blurring\ninduced by electron diffusion and electroluminescence light production in the\nNEXT TPC. The new method yields highly refined 3D images of reconstructed\nevents, and, as a result, significantly improves the topological background\ndiscrimination.

We find that at all redshifts (at least up to z~2.5), the high\nluminosity tails of the two LFs converge, indicating that the most\ninfrared-luminous galaxies are AGN-powered. Our results shed light to the\ndecades-old conundrum regarding the flatter high-luminosity slope seen in the\nIR galaxy LF compared to that in the UV and optical. We attribute this\ndifference to the increasing fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies with increasing\ntotal infrared luminosity (L_IR).

Traditionally, work has concentrated on noise-free percolation with\na monotonic process of network growth, but real-world networks are more\ncomplex. We develop a class of random graph hidden Markov models (RG-HMMs) for\ncharacterizing percolation regimes in noisy, dynamically evolving networks in\nthe presence of edge birth and edge death, as well as noise. This class is used\nto understand the type of phase transitions undergone in a seizure, and in\nparticular, distinguishing between different percolation regimes in epileptic\nseizures.

To circumvent this issue, we introduce\nmeasurement uncertainty into the generation process, which allows the model to\nlearn a disentangled representation of the underlying shape and the dropout\nnoises from a collection of real LiDAR data. To simulate the lossy measurement,\nwe adopt a differentiable sampling framework to drop points based on the\nlearned uncertainty.

The measurement results\nshow that the average RCS of the UAVs depends on shape, size, material\ncomposition of the target UAV as well as the azimuth angle, frequency, and\npolarization of the illuminating radar.

Phys. 125,\n054504 (2019)]. The results of our experiment demonstrate unambiguously that\nthis `$\\Phi$ memristor' is not a memristor: it is simply an inductor with\nmemory. This demonstration casts further doubts that ideal memristors do\nactually exist in nature or may be easily created in the lab.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 22:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

We find that in many cases the emitted harmonics do not\noriginate in electron-hole pairs created at the minimum band gap, where the\ntunneling probability is maximized, but rather in pairs created across an\nextended region of the Brillouin zone (BZ). In these situations, the analogy to\ngas-phase HHG in terms of the short- and long-trajectory categorizations is\ninadequate. Our analysis methodology comprises three complementary levels of\ntheory: the numerical solutions to the semiconductor Bloch equations, an\nextended semiclassical recollision model, and a quantum wave packet approach.\nWe apply this methodology to two general material types with representative\nband structures: a bulk system and a hexagonal monolayer system. In the bulk,\nthe interband harmonics generated using elliptically-polarized drivers are\nfound to originate not from tunneling at the minimum band gap $\\Gamma$, but\nfrom regions away from it. In the monolayer system driven by linearly-polarized\npulses, tunneling regions near different symmetry points in the BZ lead to\ndistinct harmonic energies and emission profiles. We show that the imperfect\nrecollisions, where an electron-hole pair recollide while being spatially\nseparated, are important in both bulk and monolayer materials. The excellent\nagreement between our three levels of theory highlights and characterizes the\ncomplexity behind the HHG emission dynamics in solids, and expands on the\nnotion of interband HHG as always originating in trajectories tunnelled at the\nminimum band gap. Our work furthers the fundamental understanding of HHG in\nperiodic systems and will benefit the future design of experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 22:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 02:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

The ground state exhibits a fixed-node error\nof only $1.3(2)\\%$ of the correlation energy, suggesting an unusually high\naccuracy of the corresponding single-reference trial wave function. We obtain a\nvery good agreement between optical and quasiparticle gaps that affirms the\nmarginal impact of excitonic effects. Our most accurate results for band gaps\ndiffer from the experiments by about 0.2 eV. This difference is assigned to a\ncombination of residual finite-size and fixed-node errors. We have estimated\nthe crystal Fermi level referenced to vacuum that enabled us to calculate the\nedges of valence and conduction bands in agreement with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 21:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

We have\npreviously developed a means of constraining, and hence speeding up, the search\nprocess through the use of motion primitives; motion primitives are sequences\nof pre-specified actions taken across a state series. As a byproduct of this\nwork, we have found that if the motion primitives' motions and actions are\nlabeled, then the search can be sped up further. Since motion primitives may\ninitially lack such details, we propose a theoretically viewpoint-insensitive\nand speed-insensitive means of automatically annotating the underlying motions\nand actions. We do this through a differential-geometric, spatio-temporal\nkinematics descriptor, which analyzes how the poses of entities in two motion\nsequences change over time. We use this descriptor in conjunction with a\nweighted-nearest-neighbor classifier to label the primitives using a limited\nset of training examples.\n  In our experiments, we achieve high motion and action annotation rates for\nhuman-action-derived primitives with as few as one training sample. We also\ndemonstrate that reinforcement learning using accurately labeled trajectories\nleads to high-performing policies more quickly than standard reinforcement\nlearning techniques. This is partly because motion primitives encode prior\ndomain knowledge and preempt the need to re-discover that knowledge during\ntraining. It is also because agents can leverage the labels to systematically\nignore action classes that do not facilitate task objectives, thereby reducing\nthe action space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 01:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 22:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 05:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 21:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

We find that\nefficient wave transmission can be achieved by `resonant propagation' or\n`resonant tunneling', even when stable layers are strongly stratified, and we\ncall this phenomenon `enhanced wave transmission'. Enhanced wave transmission\nonly occurs when the total number of layers is odd (embedding stable layers are\nalternatingly embedded within clamping convective layers, or vise versa). For\nwave propagation, the occurrence of enhanced wave transmission requires that\nclamping layers have similar properties, the thickness of each clamping layer\nis close to a multiple of the half wavelength of the corresponding propagative\nwave, and the total thickness of embedded layers is close to a multiple of the\nhalf wavelength of the corresponding propagating wave (resonant propagation).\nFor wave tunneling, we have considered two cases: tunneling of gravity waves\nand tunneling of inertial waves.

Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method improves GAN performance on various\ndatasets, and it is especially effective in improving the quality and diversity\nof sample generation for minor groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 02:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Here we\nconsider estimating the entire counterfactual density and generic functionals\nthereof. We focus on two kinds of target parameters. The first is a density\napproximation, defined by a projection onto a finite-dimensional model using a\ngeneralized distance metric, which includes f-divergences as well as $L_p$\nnorms. The second is the distance between counterfactual densities, which can\nbe used as a more nuanced effect measure than the mean difference, and as a\ntool for model selection. We study nonparametric efficiency bounds for these\ntargets, giving results for smooth but otherwise generic models and distances.\nImportantly, we show how these bounds connect to means of particular\nnon-trivial functions of counterfactuals, linking the problems of density and\nmean estimation. We go on to propose doubly robust-style estimators for the\ndensity approximations and distances, and study their rates of convergence,\nshowing they can be optimally efficient in large nonparametric models. We also\ngive analogous methods for model selection and aggregation, when many models\nmay be available and of interest. Our results all hold for generic models and\ndistances, but throughout we highlight what happens for particular choices,\nsuch as $L_2$ projections on linear models, and KL projections on exponential\nfamilies. Finally we illustrate by estimating the density of CD4 count among\npatients with HIV, had all been treated with combination therapy versus\nzidovudine alone, as well as a density effect. Our results suggest combination\ntherapy may have increased CD4 count most for high-risk patients. Our methods\nare implemented in the freely available R package npcausal on GitHub.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 02:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

There are rate-limited noiseless communication links between\neach encoder and the decoder, and there is independent pairwise shared\nrandomness between all the three possible pairs of nodes. The decoder has to\noutput approximately i.i.d. copies of another random variable jointly\ndistributed with the two sources and the side information.

For sake of\nreliability, it is necessary for credit scoring models to be both accurate and\nglobally interpretable. Simple classifiers, e.g., Logistic Regression (LR), are\nwhite-box models, but not powerful enough to model complex nonlinear\ninteractions among features. Fortunately, automatic feature crossing is a\npromising way to find cross features to make simple classifiers to be more\naccurate without heavy handcrafted feature engineering. However, credit scoring\nis usually based on different aspects of users, and the data usually contains\nhundreds of feature fields. This makes existing automatic feature crossing\nmethods not efficient for credit scoring. In this work, we find local\npiece-wise interpretations in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) of a specific feature\nare usually inconsistent in different samples, which is caused by feature\ninteractions in the hidden layers. Accordingly, we can design an automatic\nfeature crossing method to find feature interactions in DNN, and use them as\ncross features in LR. We give definition of the interpretation inconsistency in\nDNN, based on which a novel feature crossing method for credit scoring\nprediction called DNN2LR is proposed. Apparently, the final model, i.e., a LR\nmodel empowered with cross features, generated by DNN2LR is a white-box model.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on both public and business datasets\nfrom real-world credit scoring applications. Experimental shows that, DNN2LR\ncan outperform the DNN model, as well as several feature crossing methods.\nMoreover, comparing with the state-of-the-art feature crossing methods, i.e.,\nAutoCross, DNN2LR can accelerate the speed for feature crossing by about 10 to\n40 times on datasets with large numbers of feature fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 02:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

However, the systematic structural recognition and recovery of\nmacromolecules captured by cryo-ET are difficult due to high structural\ncomplexity and imaging limits. Deep learning based subtomogram classification\nhave played critical roles for such tasks. As supervised approaches, however,\ntheir performance relies on sufficient and laborious annotation on a large\ntraining dataset.\n  Results: To alleviate this major labeling burden, we proposed a Hybrid Active\nLearning (HAL) framework for querying subtomograms for labelling from a large\nunlabeled subtomogram pool. Firstly, HAL adopts uncertainty sampling to select\nthe subtomograms that have the most uncertain predictions. Moreover, to\nmitigate the sampling bias caused by such strategy, a discriminator is\nintroduced to judge if a certain subtomogram is labeled or unlabeled and\nsubsequently the model queries the subtomogram that have higher probabilities\nto be unlabeled. Additionally, HAL introduces a subset sampling strategy to\nimprove the diversity of the query set, so that the information overlap is\ndecreased between the queried batches and the algorithmic efficiency is\nimproved. Our experiments on subtomogram classification tasks using both\nsimulated and real data demonstrate that we can achieve comparable testing\nperformance (on average only 3% accuracy drop) by using less than 30% of the\nlabeled subtomograms, which shows a very promising result for subtomogram\nclassification task with limited labeling resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 03:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 17:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The cellular forces are obtained using the traction\nforce microscopy (TFM), at the same time that cell-generated contractile forces\nwrinkle their underlying substrate.

The priors considered put the improper invariant prior on the scale while\nthe prior on the mean has a hierarchical normal structure conditional on the\nscale. This conditional hierarchical prior is essentially that of Maruyama and\nStrawderman (2021, Biometrika) (MS21) which is indexed by a hyperparameter $a$.\nIn that paper $a$ is chosen so this conditional prior is proper which\ncorresponds to $a>-1$. This paper extends MS21 by considering improper\nconditional priors with $a$ in the closed interval $[-2, -1]$, and establishing\nadmissibility for such $a$. The authors, in Maruyama and Strawderman (2017,\nJMVA), have earlier shown that such conditional priors with $a < -2$ lead to\ninadmissible estimators. This paper therefore completes the determination of\nadmissibility/inadmissibility for this class of priors. It establishes the the\nboundary as $a = -2$, with admissibility holding for $a\\geq -2$ and\ninadmissibility for $a < -2$. This boundary corresponds exactly to that in the\nknown scale case for these conditional priors, and which follows from Brown\n(1971, AOMS). As a notable benefit of this enlargement of the class of\nadmissible generalized Bayes estimators, we give admissible and minimax\nestimators in all dimensions greater than $2$ as opposed to MS21 which required\nthe dimension to be greater than $4$. In one particularly interesting special\ncase, we establish that the joint Stein prior for the unknown scale case leads\nto a minimax admissible estimator in all dimensions greater than $2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 05:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

EIT governs the formation of a viscous thread\nin flow-focusing of two miscible fluids. To further investigate its\nsignificance, we have studied thread formation of a colloidal dispersion\nfocused by its own solvent. Experiments are combined with three-dimensional\nnumerical models to systematically expand previous knowledge utilising\ndifferent flow-focusing channel setups. In the reference setup, the sheath\nflows impinge the core flow orthogonally while in four other channel setups,\nthe sheath flows impinge the core flow at an oblique angle that is both\npositive and negative with respect to the reference sheath direction. As an\ninitial estimate of the EIT, we fit the experimentally determined thread shape\nin the reference setup to a master curve that depends on EIT through an\neffective capillary number. By numerically reproducing these experimental\nresults, it is concluded that the estimated EIT is within 25% of the optimal\nEIT value that can be deduced by iteratively fitting the numerical results to\nthe experimental measurements. Regardless of channel setups, further numerical\ncalculations performed using the optimal EIT evaluated from the reference setup\nshow good agreement with the experimental findings in terms of thread shapes,\nwetted region morphologies, and velocity flow fields.

Large Fe-displacements, among some of the octahedral sites,\nlower the symmetry of the system producing anisotropic paths for the Fe-O\nbondings giving rise to a large orbital-lattice interaction akin to a\npreferential crystallographic direction for the magnetic orbital moment. The\nlatter may lead to a partial re-orientation of the magnetic orbital moment\nunder an external magnetic field that, combined to the ferrimagnetic nature of\nthe GFO, can qualitatively explain the observed sign-reversal of the XMCD\nintegral. The results suggest that a control over the local symmetry of the\noxygen octahedra in transition metal oxides can offer a suitable leverage over\nthe manipulation of the effective orbital and spin moments in magnetoelectric\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 10:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Namely, they first choose the most likely candidate\nanswer span and then generate the answer-specific question. This pipeline\napproach, however, is undesired in mining the most appropriate QA pairs from\ndocuments since it ignores the connection between question generation and\nanswer extraction, which may lead to incompatible QA pair generation, i.e., the\nselected answer span is inappropriate for question generation.

However, most existing approaches only make predictions\nbased on the linear correlation between a finite number of optimal solutions in\ntwo or three previous environments.

ISVM is then used to filter random solutions and generate an initial\npopulation for the next moment. To overcome the obstacle of insufficient\ntraining samples, a synthetic minority oversampling strategy is implemented\nbefore the training of ISVM. The advantage of this approach is that the\nnonlinear correlation between solutions can be explored online by ISVM, and the\ninformation contained in all historical optimal solutions can be exploited to a\ngreater extent.

In this paper, we pay attention to the feature extraction\nand utilization of the input image itself. To achieve this, we propose a\nMulti-scale Topological Network (MSTN) to fully explore the features at\ndifferent scales. Meanwhile, we design a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module\n(MFFM) and an Adaptive Feature Selection Module (AFSM) to achieve the selection\nand fusion of features at different scales, so as to achieve progressive image\ndehazing. This topological network provides a large number of search paths that\nenable the network to extract abundant image features as well as strong fault\ntolerance and robustness. In addition, ASFM and MFFM can adaptively select\nimportant features and ignore interference information when fusing different\nscale representations. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

This CME is\na multispacecraft event also seen near Earth the next day. Methods. We\nhighlight the capabilities of HET for observing small short-term variations of\nthe galactic cosmic ray count rate using its single detector counters. The\nanalytical ForbMod model is applied to the FD measurements to reproduce the\nForbush decrease at both locations. Input parameters for the model are derived\nfrom both in situ and remote-sensing observations of the CME. Results. The very\nslow (~350 km/s) stealth CME caused a FD with an amplitude of 3 % in the\nlow-energy cosmic ray measurements at HET and 2 % in a comparable channel of\nthe Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter, as well as a 1 % decrease in neutron monitor\nmeasurements. Significant differences are observed in the expansion behavior of\nthe CME at different locations, which may be related to influence of the\nfollowing high speed solar wind stream. Under certain assumptions, ForbMod is\nable to reproduce the observed FDs in low-energy cosmic ray measurements from\nHET as well as CRaTER, but with the same input parameters, the results do not\nagree with the FD amplitudes at higher energies measured by neutron monitors on\nEarth.

For this, we employ the recently\ndeveloped unitary renormalisation group (URG) method on a generalised model of\n2D electrons attractive interactions. The effective Hamiltonian obtained at the\nstable low-energy fixed point of the RG flow corresponds to a gapped,\ninsulating state of quantum matter we call the Cooper pair insulator (CPI). We\nshow that the CPI ground state manifold displays several signatures of\ntopological order, including a four-fold degeneracy when placed on the torus.\nSpectral flow arguments reveal the emergent gauge-theoretic structure of the\neffective Hamiltonian, as it can be written entirely in terms of non-local\nWilson loops. It also contains a topological $\\theta$-term whose coefficient is\nquantised, in keeping with the requirement of invariance of the ground state\nunder large gauge transformations. We find that the long-ranged many-particle\nentanglement content of the CPI ground state is driven by inter-helicity\ntwo-particle scattering processes. Analysis of the passage from CPI to BCS\nsuperconducting ground state shows the RG flow promotes fluctuations in the\nnumber of condensed Cooper pairs and lowers those in the conjugate global\nphase. Consequently, the distinct signatures of long-ranged entanglement in the\nCPI are replaced by the well-known short-ranged entanglement of the BCS state.\nFinally, we study the renormalisation of the entanglement in $k$-space for both\nthe CPI and BCS ground states. The topologically ordered CPI state is shown to\npossess an emergent hierarchy of scales of entanglement, and that this\nhierarchy collapses in the BCS state.

Recently, MuZero demonstrated that it is possible to master\nboth Atari games and board games by directly learning a model of the\nenvironment, which is then used with MCTS to decide what move to play in each\nposition.

Starting from a random initial node at time $t=1$, at each\ntime step $t \\ge 2$ an RW hops randomly into one of the $c$ neighbors of its\nprevious node. In some of the time steps the RW may hop into a yet-unvisited\nnode while in other time steps it may revisit a node that has already been\nvisited before. The first time at which the RW enters a node that has already\nbeen visited before is called the first hitting time or the first intersection\nlength. The first hitting event may take place either by backtracking (BT) to\nthe previous node or by retracing (RET), namely stepping into a node which has\nbeen visited two or more time steps earlier. We calculate the tail distribution\n$P( T_{\\rm FH} > t )$ of first hitting (FH) times as well as its mean $\\langle\nT_{\\rm FH} \\rangle$ and variance ${\\rm Var}(T_{\\rm FH})$. We also calculate the\nprobabilities $P_{\\rm BT}$ and $P_{\\rm RET}$ that the first hitting event will\noccur via the backtracking scenario or via the retracing scenario,\nrespectively. We show that in dilute networks the dominant first hitting\nscenario is backtracking while in dense networks the dominant scenario is\nretracing and calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{\\rm FH}=t| {\\rm\nBT})$ and $P(T_{\\rm FH}=t| {\\rm RET})$, for the two scenarios. The analytical\nresults are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from computer\nsimulations.

We run a galaxy group finder and mimic\nthe HI stacking procedure adopted by different surveys and find we can\nreproduce their observationally derived HIHM relation. However, none of the\nadopted techniques recover the underlying HIHM relation predicted by the\nsimulation. We find that systematic effects in halo mass estimates of galaxy\ngroups modify the inferred shape of the HIHM relation from the intrinsic one in\nthe simulation, while contamination by interloping galaxies, not associated\nwith the groups, contribute to the inferred HI mass of a halo mass bin, when\nusing large velocity windows for stacking. The effect of contamination is\nmaximal at Mvir~10^(12-12.5)Msol. Stacking methods based on summing the HI\nemission spectra to infer the mean HI mass of galaxies of different properties\nbelonging to a group suffer minimal contamination but are strongly limited by\nthe use of optical counterparts, which miss the contribution of dwarf galaxies.\nDeep spectroscopic surveys will provide significant improvements by going\ndeeper while maintaining high spectroscopic completeness; for example, the\nWAVES survey will recover ~52% of the total HI mass of the groups with\nMvir~10^(14)Msol compared to ~21% in GAMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 10:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

These complex\napplications can be represented as workflows where task dependencies are\nexplicitly specified. To achieve better Quality of Service (QoS), for instance,\nfaster response time and lower energy consumption, computation offloading is\nwidely used in the MEC environment. However, many existing computation\noffloading strategies only focus on independent computation tasks but overlook\nthe task dependencies. Meanwhile, most of these strategies are based on search\nalgorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA)\nwhich are often time-consuming and hence not suitable for many delay-sensitive\ncomplex applications in MEC. Therefore, a highly efficient graph-based strategy\nwas proposed in our recent work but it can only deal with simple workflow\napplications with linear (namely sequential) structure. For solving these\nproblems, a novel graph-based strategy is proposed for workflow applications in\nMEC. Specifically, this strategy can deal with complex workflow applications\nwith nonlinear (viz. parallel, selective and iterative) structures. Meanwhile,\nthe offloading decision plan with the lowest energy consumption of the\nend-device under the deadline constraint can be found by using the graph-based\npartition technique. We have comprehensively evaluated our strategy using both\na real-world case study on a MEC based UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) delivery\nsystem and extensive simulation experiments on the FogWorkflowSim platform for\nMEC based workflow applications.

Here, instead we evaluate\nmodels based on how well they predict each fixation in a scanpath given the\nprevious scanpath history. This makes model evaluation closely aligned with the\nbiological processes thought to underly scanpath generation and allows to apply\nestablished saliency metrics like AUC and NSS in an intuitive and interpretable\nway. We evaluate many existing models of scanpath prediction on the datasets\nMIT1003, MIT300, CAT2000 train and CAT200 test, for the first time giving a\ndetailed picture of the current state of the art of human scanpath prediction.\nWe also show that the discussed method of model benchmarking allows for more\ndetailed analyses leading to interesting insights about where and when models\nfail to predict human behaviour.

In this paper, by\nreformulating the knowledge distillation process on localization, we present a\nnovel localization distillation (LD) method which can efficiently transfer the\nlocalization knowledge from the teacher to the student. Moreover, we also\nheuristically introduce the concept of valuable localization region that can\naid to selectively distill the semantic and localization knowledge for a\ncertain region.

The goal of this work is to build a general purpose classification\nalgorithm, which is able to abstain from prediction, while avoiding disparate\nimpact. We formalize this problem as risk minimization under fairness and\nabstention constraints for which we derive the form of the optimal classifier.\nBuilding on this result, we propose a post-processing classification algorithm,\nwhich is able to modify any off-the-shelf score-based classifier using only\nunlabeled sample.

This includes the variational Bayesian LASSO as an\ninexpensive and scalable alternative to the Bayesian LASSO introduced in [65].\nIt also includes a family of priors which more strongly promote sparsity. For\nlinear models the method requires only the iterative solution of deterministic\nleast squares problems. Furthermore, for p unknown covariates the method can be\nimplemented exactly online with a cost of $O(p^3)$ in computation and $O(p^2)$\nin memory per iteration -- in other words, the cost per iteration is\nindependent of n, and in principle infinite data can be considered. For large\n$p$ an approximation is able to achieve promising results for a cost of $O(p)$\nper iteration, in both computation and memory. Strategies for hyper-parameter\ntuning are also considered. The method is implemented for real and simulated\ndata. It is shown that the performance in terms of variable selection and\nuncertainty quantification of the variational Bayesian LASSO can be comparable\nto the Bayesian LASSO for problems which are tractable with that method, and\nfor a fraction of the cost.

This thesis starts by presenting the design and implementation of\nChainspace, a distributed ledger that supports user defined smart contracts and\nexecute user-supplied transactions on their objects. The correct execution of\nsmart contract transactions is publicly verifiable. Chainspace is scalable by\nsharding state; it is secure against subsets of nodes trying to compromise its\nintegrity or availability properties through Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).\nThis thesis also introduces a family of replay attacks against sharded\ndistributed ledgers targeting cross-shard consensus protocols; they allow an\nattacker, with network access only, to double-spend resources with minimal\nefforts. We then build Byzcuit, a new cross-shard consensus protocol that is\nimmune to those attacks and that is tailored to run at the heart of Chainspace.\nNext, we propose FastPay, a high-integrity settlement system for pre-funded\npayments that can be used as a financial side-infrastructure for Chainspace to\nsupport low-latency retail payments. This settlement system is based on\nByzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of\nfull atomic commit channels (consensus).

Most of the current approaches estimate the time-varying spectral\nproperties only retrospectively - that is, after the entire data has been\nobserved. Retrospective estimation is a major limitation in many adaptive\ncontrol applications where it is important to estimate these properties and\ndetect changes in the system as they happen in real-time. One major obstacle in\nonline estimation is the computational cost due to the high-dimensionality of\nthe parameters. Existing methods such as the Kalman filter or local least\nsquares are feasible. However, they are not always suitable because they\nprovide noisy estimates and can become prohibitively costly as the dimension of\nthe time series increases. In our brain signal application, it is critical to\ndevelop a robust method that can estimate, in real-time, the properties of the\nunderlying stochastic process, in particular, the spectral brain connectivity\nmeasures. For these reasons we propose a new smooth online parameter estimation\napproach (SOPE) that has the ability to control for the smoothness of the\nestimates with a reasonable computational complexity. Consequently, the models\nare fit in real-time even for high dimensional time series. We demonstrate that\nour proposed SOPE approach is as good as the Kalman filter in terms of\nmean-squared error for small dimensions. However, unlike the Kalman filter, the\nSOPE has lower computational cost and hence scalable for higher dimensions.\nFinally, we apply the SOPE method to a rat's local field potential data during\na hippocampus-dependent sequence-memory task. As demonstrated in the video, the\nproposed SOPE method is able to capture the dynamics of the connectivity as the\nrat performs the sequence of non-spatial working memory tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 13:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 16:52:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 06:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Unlike\ncooperative environments where agents strive towards a common goal, mixed\nenvironments are notorious for the conflicts of selfish and social interests.\nAs a consequence, purely rational agents often struggle to achieve and maintain\ncooperation. A prevalent approach to induce cooperative behaviour is to assign\nadditional rewards based on other agents' well-being. However, this approach\nsuffers from the issue of multi-agent credit assignment, which can hinder\nperformance. This issue is efficiently alleviated in cooperative setting with\nsuch state-of-the-art algorithms as QMIX and COMA. Still, when applied to mixed\nenvironments, these algorithms may result in unfair allocation of rewards. We\npropose BAROCCO, an extension of these algorithms capable to balance individual\nand social incentives. The mechanism behind BAROCCO is to train two distinct\nbut interwoven components that jointly affect each agent's decisions. Our\nmeta-algorithm is compatible with both Q-learning and Actor-Critic frameworks.\nWe experimentally confirm the advantages over the existing methods and explore\nthe behavioural aspects of BAROCCO in two mixed multi-agent setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

In recent\nyears, data-driven neural network priors have shown promising performance for\nRGB natural image denoising. Compared to classic handcrafted priors (e.g.,\nsparsity and total variation), the \"deep priors\" are learned using a large\nnumber of training samples -- which can accurately model the complex image\ngenerating process. However, data-driven priors are hard to acquire for\nhyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the lack of training data. A remedy is to\nuse the so-called unsupervised deep image prior (DIP). Under the unsupervised\nDIP framework, it is hypothesized and empirically demonstrated that proper\nneural network structures are reasonable priors of certain types of images, and\nthe network weights can be learned without training data. Nonetheless, the most\neffective unsupervised DIP structures were proposed for natural images instead\nof HSIs. The performance of unsupervised DIP-based HSI denoising is limited by\na couple of serious challenges, namely, network structure design and network\ncomplexity. This work puts forth an unsupervised DIP framework that is based on\nthe classic spatio-spectral decomposition of HSIs. Utilizing the so-called\nlinear mixture model of HSIs, two types of unsupervised DIPs, i.e., U-Net-like\nnetwork and fully-connected networks, are employed to model the abundance maps\nand endmembers contained in the HSIs, respectively. This way, empirically\nvalidated unsupervised DIP structures for natural images can be easily\nincorporated for HSI denoising. Besides, the decomposition also substantially\nreduces network complexity. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm is\nproposed to handle the formulated denoising problem.

Our error analysis suggests that the IGL and\nGamma-ray measurements are now fully consistent to within ~10%, suggesting\nlittle need for any additional source of diffuse light beyond the known galaxy\npopulation. We use our revised IGL measurements to constrain the cosmic\nstar-formation history, and place amplitude constraints on a number of recent\nestimates. As a consistency check, we can now demonstrate convincingly, that\nthe CSFH, stellar mass growth, and the optical-EBL provide a fully consistent\npicture of galaxy evolution. We conclude that the peak of star-formation rate\nlies in the range 0.066-0.076 Msol/yr/Mpc^3 at a lookback time of 9.1 to 10.9\nGyrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

In this\ncontext, it has been recently proposed that stellar clustering might be the key\nin shaping the orbital architecture of exoplanets. The main goal of this work\nis to explore the factors that shape the orbits of planets. We used a\nhomogeneous sample of relatively young FGK dwarf stars with RV detected planets\nand tested the hypothesis that their association to phase space\n(position-velocity) over-densities ('cluster' stars) and under-densities\n('field' stars) impacts the orbital periods of planets. When controlling for\nthe host star properties, on a sample of 52 planets orbiting around 'cluster'\nstars and 15 planets orbiting around 'field' star, we found no significant\ndifference in the period distribution of planets orbiting these two populations\nof stars. By considering an extended sample of 73 planets orbiting around\n'cluster' stars and 25 planets orbiting 'field' stars, a significant different\nin the planetary period distributions emerged. However, the hosts associated to\nstellar under-densities appeared to be significantly older than their 'cluster'\ncounterparts. This did not allow us to conclude whether the planetary\narchitecture is related to age, environment, or both. We further studied a\nsample of planets orbiting 'cluster' stars to study the mechanism responsible\nfor the shaping of orbits of planets in similar environments. We could not\nidentify a parameter that can unambiguously be responsible for the orbital\narchitecture of massive planets, perhaps, indicating the complexity of the\nissue. Conclusions. Increased number of planets in clusters and in over-density\nenvironments will help to build large and unbiased samples which will then\nallow to better understand the dominant processes shaping the orbits of\nplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments\nto reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor.\nHowever, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data\nrepresentation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose\ninvariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e.,\nnonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers).

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline\nmethods.

To derive guidelines on\ndeploying the resultant wirelessly powered FEEL (WP-FEEL) system, this work\naims at the derivation of the tradeoff between the model convergence and the\nsettings of power sources in two scenarios: 1) the transmission power and\ndensity of power-beacons (dedicated charging stations) if they are deployed, or\notherwise 2) the transmission power of a server (access-point). The development\nof the proposed analytical framework relates the accuracy of distributed\nstochastic gradient estimation to the WPT settings, the randomness in both\ncommunication and WPT links, and devices' computation capacities. Furthermore,\nthe local-computation at devices (i.e., mini-batch size and processor clock\nfrequency) is optimized to efficiently use the harvested energy for gradient\nestimation. The resultant learning-WPT tradeoffs reveal the simple scaling laws\nof the model-convergence rate with respect to the transferred energy as well as\nthe devices' computational energy efficiencies. The results provide useful\nguidelines on WPT provisioning to provide a guaranteer on learning performance.\nThey are corroborated by experimental results using a real dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

This remarkable progress motivated the present study to\ndetermine the possible influence of the bulk viscosity in the early Universe\nand to understand how this would vary from epoch to epoch.

For Eckart theory, the only possible solution is\nthe functionality, $H(a(t))$, where $H(t)$ is the Hubble parameter and $a(t)$\nis the scale factor, but none of them so far could to be directly expressed in\nterms of either proper or cosmic time $t$.

Today's compilers use hard-coded heuristics to\ndecide when, whether, and which of a limited set of optimizations to apply.\nOften, this leads to highly unstable behavior, making the success of compiler\noptimizations dependent on the precise way a loop has been written. This paper\npresents LoopLearner, which addresses the problem of compiler instability by\npredicting which way of writing a loop will lead to efficient compiled code. To\nthis end, we train a neural network to find semantically invariant source-level\ntransformations for loops that help the compiler generate more efficient code.\nOur model learns to extract useful features from the raw source code and\npredicts the speedup that a given transformation is likely to yield.

A single block is also characterized by these fixed\nambient parameters to represent members that do not belong anywhere else.

The mm-Wave band also suffers from high penetration losses from drywall,\nwood, glass, concrete, etc., and also the human body. Hence, as a mobile user\nmoves, the Line of Sight (LoS) path between the mobile and the Base Station\n(BS) can be blocked by objects interposed in the path, causing loss of the\nlink. A mobile with a lost link will need to be re-acquired as a new user by\ninitial access, a process that can take up to a second, causing disruptions to\napplications. UNBLOCK is a protocol that allows a mobile to recover from\ntransient blockages, such as those caused by a human hand or another human\nwalking into the line of path or other temporary occlusions by objects, which\ntypically disappear within the order of $100$ ms, without having to go through\nre-acquisition. UNBLOCK is based on extensive experimentation in office type\nenvironments which has shown that while a LoS path is blocked, there typically\nexists a Non-LoS path, i.e., a reflected path through scatterers, with a loss\nwithin about $10$ dB of the LoS path. UNBLOCK proactively keeps such a NLoS\npath in reserve, to be used when blockage happens, typically without any\nwarning. UNBLOCK uses this NLoS path to maintain time-synchronization with the\nBS until the blockage disappears, as well as to search for a better NLoS path\nif available. When the transient blockage disappears, it reestablishes LoS\ncommunication at the epochs that have been scheduled by the BS for\ncommunication with the mobile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}
