It involves partitioning the software components into finer\nmodules such that the development can happen independently. It also provides\nnatural benefits when deployed on the cloud since resources can be allocated\ndynamically to necessary components based on demand. Therefore, enterprises as\npart of their journey to cloud, are increasingly looking to refactor their\nmonolith application into one or more candidate microservices; wherein each\nservice contains a group of software entities (e.g., classes) that are\nresponsible for a common functionality. Graphs are a natural choice to\nrepresent a software system. Each software entity can be represented as nodes\nand its dependencies with other entities as links. Therefore, this problem of\nrefactoring can be viewed as a graph based clustering task. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to adapt the recent advancements in graph neural\nnetworks in the context of code to better understand the software and apply\nthem in the clustering task. In that process, we also identify the outliers in\nthe graph which can be directly mapped to top refactor candidates in the\nsoftware. Our solution is able to improve state-of-the-art performance compared\nto works from both software engineering and existing graph representation based\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 16:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

However, the\nlimitation of existing works is that the scale of neural networks increases\nrapidly with the codelength, thus they can only support short to moderate\ncodelengths. From the point view of practicality, we propose a high-performance\nneural min-sum (MS) decoding method that makes full use of the lifting\nstructure of protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. By this means,\nthe size of the parameter array of each layer in the neural decoder only equals\nthe number of edge-types for arbitrary codelengths. In particular, for\nprotograph LDPC codes, the proposed neural MS decoder is constructed in a\nspecial way such that identical parameters are shared by a bundle of edges\nderived from the same edge-type. To reduce the complexity and overcome the\nvanishing gradient problem in training the proposed neural MS decoder, an\niteration-by-iteration (i.e., layer-by-layer in neural networks) greedy\ntraining method is proposed. With this, the proposed neural MS decoder tends to\nbe optimized with faster convergence, which is aligned with the early\ntermination mechanism widely used in practice. To further enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the proposed neural MS decoder, a codelength/rate\ncompatible training method is proposed, which randomly selects samples from a\nset of codes lifted from the same base code. As a theoretical performance\nevaluation tool, a trajectory-based extrinsic information transfer (T-EXIT)\nchart is developed for various decoders. Both T-EXIT and simulation results\nshow that the optimized MS decoding can provide faster convergence and up to\n1dB gain compared with the plain MS decoding and its variants with only\nslightly increased complexity. In addition, it can even outperform the\nsum-product algorithm for some short codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 16:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 10:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

In the\nlast decades, DMPs have inspired researchers in different robotic fields\nincluding imitation and reinforcement learning, optimal control,physical\ninteraction, and human-robot co-working, resulting a considerable amount of\npublished papers. The goal of this tutorial survey is two-fold. On one side, we\npresent the existing DMPs formulations in rigorous mathematical terms,and\ndiscuss advantages and limitations of each approach as well as practical\nimplementation details. In the tutorial vein, we also search for existing\nimplementations of presented approaches and release several others. On the\nother side, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of existing\nliterature and categorize state of the art work on DMP. The paper concludes\nwith a discussion on the limitations of DMPs and an outline of possible\nresearch directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 17:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

The robustness of a speaker recognition system mainly\ndepends on the extraction process of speech embeddings, which are primarily\npre-trained on a large-scale dataset. As the embedding systems are pre-trained,\nthe performance of speaker recognition models greatly depends on domain\nadaptation policy, which may reduce if trained using inadequate data. This\npaper introduces a speaker recognition strategy dealing with unlabeled data,\nwhich generates clusterable embedding vectors from small fixed-size speech\nframes. The unsupervised training strategy involves an assumption that a small\nspeech segment should include a single speaker. Depending on such a belief, a\npairwise constraint is constructed with noise augmentation policies, used to\ntrain AutoEmbedder architecture that generates speaker embeddings.

The stochastic processes considered possess an equilibrium\ndistribution, when reaching their equilibrium distribution, there exists an\nincrease in their informational entropy, and their log-rank distributions can\nbe modeled as discrete beta generalized distributions (DGBD).

The\nequilibrium distributions of both process can be regarded as states in which\nthe cell is well-differentiated, ergo there exists an induction of a novel\nHIV-dependent differentiated state in the T-cell; these processes due to their\nDGBD distribution can be considered complex processes; due to the increasing\nentropy, the equilibrium states are stable ones.

The main purpose of this work is to provide a method to derive\ntabulated observational constraints on the halo mass function (HMF) by studying\nthe magnification bias effect on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies. Under\nthe assumption of universality, we parametrize the HMF according to two\ntraditional models, namely the Sheth and Tormen (ST) and Tinker fits and assess\ntheir performance in explaining the measured data within the {\\Lambda} cold\ndark matter ({\\Lambda}CDM) model. We also study the potential influence of the\nhalo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in this analysis and discuss two\nimportant aspects regarding the HMF parametrization. Methods. We measure the\ncross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies with\nredshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$ and a background sample of H-ATLAS galaxies\nwith redshifts in the range $1.2<z<4.0$ and carry out an MCMC algorithm to\ncheck this observable against its mathematical prediction within the halo model\nformalism. Results. If all HMF parameters are assumed to be positive, the ST\nfit only seems to fully explain the measurements by forcing the mean number of\nsatellite galaxies in a halo to increase substantially from its prior mean\nvalue. The Tinker fit, on the other hand, provides a robust description of the\ndata without relevant changes in the HOD parameters, but with some dependence\non the prior range of two of its parameters. When the normalization condition\nfor the HMF is dropped and we allow negative values of the $p_1$ parameter in\nthe ST fit, all the involved parameters are better determined, unlike the\nprevious models, thus deriving the most general HMF constraints. While all\ncases are in agreement with the traditional fits within the uncertainties, the\nlast one hints at a slightly higher number of halos at intermediate and high\nmasses, raising the important point of the allowed parameter range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 19:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

In this work, we overcome this\nchallenge by leveraging both task-agnostic and task-specific unlabeled data\nbased on two novel strategies: i) a self-supervised pretext task that harnesses\nthe underlying multi-resolution contextual cues in histology whole-slide images\nto learn a powerful supervisory signal for unsupervised representation\nlearning; ii) a new teacher-student semi-supervised consistency paradigm that\nlearns to effectively transfer the pretrained representations to downstream\ntasks based on prediction consistency with the task-specific un-labeled data.\nWe carry out extensive validation experiments on three histopathology benchmark\ndatasets across two classification and one regression-based tasks, i.e., tumor\nmetastasis detection, tissue type classification, and tumor cellularity\nquantification. Under limited-label data, the proposed method yields tangible\nimprovements, which is close or even outperforming other state-of-the-art\nself-supervised and supervised baselines. Furthermore, we empirically show that\nthe idea of bootstrapping the self-supervised pretrained features is an\neffective way to improve the task-specific semi-supervised learning on standard\nbenchmarks.

The use of isothermal equation of state or rapid cooling,\ncommon in protoplanetary disk simulations, is therefore not justified. Using\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the collision-limited\nslow thermal relaxation provides favorable conditions for buoyancy resonances\nto develop.

The median value of\nthe dust temperature in (U)LIRGs is 32 K, which is higher compared to both the\nETGs (28 K) and the LTGs (22 K). Small differences, in the derived parameters,\nare seen for the seven merging classes of our sample of (U)LIRGs with the most\nevident one being on the star-formation rate, where in systems in late merging\nstages the median SFR reaches up to 99 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ compared to 26\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the isolated ones. In contrast to the local normal\ngalaxies where old stars dominate the stellar emission, the young stars in\n(U)LIRGs contribute with 64% of their luminosity to the total stellar\nluminosity. The fraction of the dust-absorbed stellar luminosity is extremely\nhigh in (U)LIRGs (78%) compared to 7% and 25% in ETGs and ETGs, respectively.\nThe fraction of the stellar luminosity used to heat up the dust grains is very\nhigh in (U)LIRGs, while 74% of the dust emission comes from the young stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 21:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Due to the coupling between the source signatures and the\nsubsurface model, small errors in the former can translate into large errors in\nthe latter. When direct methods are used to solve the forward problem,\nclassical frequency-domain FWI efficiently processes multiple sources for\nsource signature and wavefield estimations once a single Lower-Upper (LU)\ndecomposition of the wave-equation operator has been performed. However, this\nefficient FWI formulation is based on the exact solution of the wave equation\nand hence is highly sensitive to the inaccuracy of the velocity model due to\nthe cycle skipping pathology. Recent extended-space FWI variants tackle this\nsensitivity issue through a relaxation of the wave equation combined with data\nassimilation, allowing the wavefields to closely match the data from the first\ninversion iteration. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated by minimizing\nthe wave-equation violations. When the wavefields and the source signatures are\njointly estimated with this approach, the extended wave equation operator\nbecomes source dependent, hence making direct methods ineffective. In this\npaper, we propose a simple method to bypass this issue and estimate source\nsignatures efficiently during extended FWI. The proposed method replaces each\nsource with a blended source during each data-assimilated wavefield\nreconstruction to make the extended wave equation operator source independent.\nBesides computational efficiency, the additional degrees of freedom introduced\nby spatially distributing the sources allows for a better signature estimation\nat the physical location when the velocity model is rough.

Methods: The proposed\nCADe method, based on a modified 3D RetinaNet model, operates on ultrafast T1\nweighted sequences, which are preprocessed for motion compensation, temporal\nnormalization, and are cropped before passing into the model. The model is\noptimized to enable the detection of relatively small breast lesions in a\nscreening setting, focusing on detection of lesions that are harder to\ndifferentiate from confounding structures inside the breast. Results: The\nmethod was developed based on a dataset consisting of 489 ultrafast MRI studies\nobtained from 462 patients containing a total of 572 lesions (365 malignant,\n207 benign) and achieved a detection rate, sensitivity, and detection rate of\nbenign lesions of 0.90 (0.876-0.934), 0.95 (0.934-0.980), and 0.81\n(0.751-0.871) at 4 false positives per normal breast with 10-fold\ncross-testing, respectively.

The core idea behind\nLMGPs is to learn a continuous, low-dimensional latent space or manifold which\nencodes all qualitative inputs. To learn this manifold, we first assign a\nunique prior vector representation to each combination of qualitative inputs.\nWe then use a low-rank linear map to project these priors on a manifold that\ncharacterizes the posterior representations. As the posteriors are\nquantitative, they can be directly used in any standard correlation function\nsuch as the Gaussian or Matern. Hence, the optimal map and the corresponding\nmanifold, along with other hyperparameters of the correlation function, can be\nsystematically learned via maximum likelihood estimation. Through a wide range\nof analytic and real-world examples, we demonstrate the advantages of LMGPs\nover state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and versatility.

When such a signal passes through an\nintervening lensing galaxy or galaxy cluster, the embedded stellar-mass\nmicrolenses lead to interference patterns in the signal that may leave\nobservable signatures. In this work, we present an extensive study of these\nwave effects in the LIGO/Virgo frequency band ($10$-$10^4$ Hz) due to the\npresence of the microlens population in galaxy-scale lenses for the first time.\nWe consider a wide range of strong lensing (macro) magnifications and the\ncorresponding surface microlens densities found in lensing galaxies and use\nthem to generate realisations of the amplification factor. The methodologies\nfor simulating amplification curves for both types of images (minima and saddle\npoints) are also discussed. We then study how microlensing is broadly affected\nby the parameters like macro-magnifications, stellar densities, the initial\nmass function (IMF), types of images, and microlens distribution around the\nsource. In general, with increasing macro-magnification values, the effects of\nmicrolensing become increasingly significant regardless of other parameters.\nMismatch analysis between the lensed and the unlensed GW waveforms from\nchirping binaries suggests that, while inferring the source parameters,\nmicrolensing can not be neglected for macro-magnification $\\gtrsim 15$.\nFurthermore, for extremely high macro-magnifications $\\gtrsim 100$, the\nmismatch can even exceed $5\\%$, which can result in both a missed detection\nand, consequently, a missed lensed signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 23:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 12:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The relation between DPP and kernel-based methods\nmakes DPPs suitable to describe and quantify similarity between objects. DPPs\nfavor diversity of the center points within subsets.

In comparison, we propose a simple and efficient\nframework that does not require high computational training resources, and can\nbe trained on datasets without semantic categorical labels. Furthermore, at\ntraining and inference stages our method only uses a single CNN. In this work,\na pre-trained ImageNet CNN (e.g., ResNet50) is fine-tuned with three proposed\nlearning objects: domain-aware quadruplet loss, semantic classification loss,\nand semantic knowledge preservation loss. The domain-aware quadruplet and\nsemantic classification losses are introduced to learn discriminative, semantic\nand domain invariant features through considering ZS-SBIR as object detection\nand verification problem. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 06:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

In this paper, we propose\nComplementary Attention and Adaptive Integration Network (CAAI-Net), a novel\nRGB-D saliency detection model that integrates complementary attention based\nfeature concentration and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion into a unified\nframework for accurate saliency detection. Specifically, we propose a\ncontext-aware complementary attention (CCA) module, which consists of a feature\ninteraction component, a complementary attention component, and a\nglobal-context component. The CCA module first utilizes the feature interaction\ncomponent to extract rich local context features. The resulting features are\nthen fed into the complementary attention component, which employs the\ncomplementary attention generated from adjacent levels to guide the attention\nat the current layer so that the mutual background disturbances are suppressed\nand the network focuses more on the areas with salient objects. Finally, we\nutilize a specially-designed adaptive feature integration (AFI) module, which\nsufficiently considers the low-quality issue of depth maps, to aggregate the\nRGB and depth features in an adaptive manner. Extensive experiments on six\nchallenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAAI-Net is an effective\nsaliency detection model and outperforms nine state-of-the-art models in terms\nof four widely-used metrics. In addition, extensive ablation studies confirm\nthe effectiveness of the proposed CCA and AFI modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 08:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

To assist search and rescue\nteams and improve response times, teams of camera-equipped aerial robots can\nengage in tasks such as mapping buildings and locating victims.\n  These sensing tasks encapsulate difficult (NP-Hard) problems. One way to\nsimplify planning for these tasks is to focus on maximizing sensing performance\nover a short time horizon. Specifically, consider the problem of how to select\nmotions for a team of robots to maximize a notion of sensing quality (the\nsensing objective) over the near future, say by maximizing the amount of\nunknown space in a map that robots will observe over the next several seconds.\nBy repeating this process regularly, the team can react quickly to new\nobservations as they work to complete the sensing task. In technical terms,\nthis planning and control process forms an example of receding-horizon control.\nFortunately, common sensing objectives benefit from well-known monotonicity\nproperties (e.g. submodularity), and greedy algorithms can exploit these\nmonotonicity properties to solve the receding-horizon optimization problems\nthat we study near-optimally.\n  However, greedy algorithms typically force robots to make decisions\nsequentially so that planning time grows with the number of robots. Further,\nrecent works that investigate sequential greedy planning, have demonstrated\nthat reducing the number of sequential steps while retaining suboptimality\nguarantees can be hard or impossible.\n  We demonstrate that halting growth in planning time is sometimes possible. To\ndo so, we introduce novel greedy algorithms involving fixed numbers of\nsequential steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 08:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

The amount of data used for training contributes to model accuracy.\nHerein, we collected larger quantities of data to further improve model\nperformance. Moreover, the issues of noisy labels and sound overlapping were\nexplored. Methods: HF_Lung_V1 was expanded to HF_Lung_V2 with a 1.45x increase\nin the number of audio files. Convolutional neural network-bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit network models were trained separately using the HF_Lung_V1\n(V1_Train) and HF_Lung_V2 (V2_Train) training sets and then tested using the\nHF_Lung_V1 (V1_Test) and HF_Lung_V2 (V2_Test) test sets, respectively.

We propose a hardware-efficient\nconcatenated BSM (CBSM) scheme with modified parity encoding using coherent\nstates with reasonably small amplitudes ($|\\alpha| \\lessapprox 2$), which\nsimultaneously suppresses both failures and dephasing in the BSM procedure. We\nnumerically show that the CBSM scheme achieves a success probability\narbitrarily close to unity for appropriate values of $\\alpha$ and sufficiently\nlow photon loss rates (e.g., $\\lessapprox 5\\%$). Furthermore, we verify that\nthe quantum repeater scheme exploiting the CBSM scheme for quantum error\ncorrection enables one to carry out efficient long-range quantum communication\nover 1000 km. We show that the performance is comparable to those of other\nup-to-date methods or even outperforms them for some cases. Finally, we present\nmethods to prepare logical qubits under modified parity encoding and implement\nelementary logical operations, which consist of several physical-level\ningredients such as generation of Schr\\\"odinger's cat state and elementary\ngates under coherent-state basis. Our work demonstrates that the encoded\ncoherent-state qubits in free-propagating fields provide an alternative route\nto fault-tolerant information processing, especially long-range quantum\ncommunication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 09:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 07:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 01:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

We observed the 2018 superoutburst with 2.3\nmag brightening and found the orbital period ($P_{\\rm orb}$) to be 0.149454(3)\nd, or 3.59 hr. This is longward of the period gap, establishing ASASSN-18aan as\none of a small number of long-$P_{\\rm orb}$ SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The\nestimated mass ratio, ($q=M_2/M_1 = 0.278(1)$), is almost identical to the\nupper limit of tidal instability by the 3:1 resonance. From eclipses, we found\nthat the accretion disk at the onset of the superoutburst may reach the 3:1\nresonance radius, suggesting that the superoutburst of ASASSN-18aan results\nfrom the tidal instability. Considering the case of long-$P_{\\rm orb}$ WZ\nSge-type dwarf novae, we suggest that the tidal dissipation at the tidal\ntruncation radius is enough to induce SU UMa-like behavior in relatively\nhigh-$q$ systems such as SU UMa-type dwarf novae, but that this is no longer\neffective in low-$q$ systems such as WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The unusual\nnature of the system extends to the secondary star, for which we find a\nspectral type of G9, much earlier than typical for the orbital period, and a\nsecondary mass $M_2$ of around 0.18 M$_{\\odot}$, smaller than expected for the\norbital period and the secondary's spectral type. We also see indications of\nenhanced sodium abundance in the secondary's spectrum. Anomalously hot\nsecondaries are seen in a modest number of other CVs and related objects.

In order to tackle this problem, recently the imaging-based\nmethods have grabbed the attention of many researchers. These methods either\nextract the features (e.g. using SIFT, or SOSNet) and map the descriptive ones\nto the camera position and rotation information, or deploy an end-to-end system\nthat directly estimates this information out of RGB images, similar to PoseNet.\nWhile the former methods suffer from heavy computational burden during the test\nprocess, the latter suffers from lack of accuracy and robustness against\nenvironmental changes and object movements.

However, high-quality data, in particular labeled data,\nis often hard and expensive to collect. To leverage large-scale unlabeled data,\nself-supervised learning, represented by contrastive learning, is introduced.\nThe objective of contrastive learning is to map different views derived from a\ntraining sample (e.g., through data augmentation) closer in their\nrepresentation space, while different views derived from different samples more\ndistant. In this way, a contrastive model learns to generate informative\nrepresentations for data samples, which are then used to perform downstream ML\ntasks. Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to\nvarious privacy attacks. However, most of the current efforts concentrate on\nmodels trained with supervised learning. Meanwhile, data samples' informative\nrepresentations learned with contrastive learning may cause severe privacy\nrisks as well.\n  In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of contrastive learning\nthrough the lens of membership inference and attribute inference. Our\nexperimental results show that contrastive models trained on image datasets are\nless vulnerable to membership inference attacks but more vulnerable to\nattribute inference attacks compared to supervised models. The former is due to\nthe fact that contrastive models are less prone to overfitting, while the\nlatter is caused by contrastive models' capability of representing data samples\nexpressively. To remedy this situation, we propose the first privacy-preserving\ncontrastive learning mechanism, Talos, relying on adversarial training.\nEmpirical results show that Talos can successfully mitigate attribute inference\nrisks for contrastive models while maintaining their membership privacy and\nmodel utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 11:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Considering the huge success of ResNet in deep\nlearning, it would be natural to train deep SNNs with residual learning.\nPrevious Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply\nreplaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the\ndegradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper,\nwe propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in\ndeep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping\nand overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We\nevaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet, DVS Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, and\nshow that SEW ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in\nboth accuracy and time-steps.

It\nis well known that helicopters on Earth become highly-charged due, in part, to\ntriboelectric effects when flying in sandy conditions. We consider the\npossibility that the Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS), called Ingenuity, flying at\nMars as part of the Mars2020 Perseverance mission, will also become charged due\nto grain-rotor triboelectric interactions. Given the low Martian atmospheric\npressure of ~ 5 Torr, the tribocharge on the blade could become intense enough\nto stimulate gas breakdown near the surface of the rotorcraft. We modeled the\ngrain-blade interaction as a line of current that forms along the blade edge in\nthe region where grain-blade contacts are the greatest. This current then\nspreads throughout the entire connected quasi-conductive regions of the\nrotorcraft. Charge builds up on the craft and the dissipative pathway to remove\ncharge is back into the atmosphere. We find that for blade tribocharging\ncurrents that form in an ambient atmospheric dust load, system current balance\nand charge dissipation can be accomplished via the nominal atmospheric\nconductive currents. However, at takeoff and landing, the rotorcraft could be\nin a rotor-created particulate cloud, leading to local atmospheric electrical\nbreakdown near the rotorcraft. We especially note that the atmospheric currents\nin the breakdown are not large enough to create any hazard to Ingenuity itself,\nbut Ingenuity operations can be considered a unique experiment that provides a\ntest of the electrical properties of the Martian near-surface atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 13:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

As an application, lower bounds on\nguessing entropy and guessing moments are derived in terms of entropy or\nR\\'enyi entropy (without side information) and conditional entropy or Arimoto\nconditional entropy (when side information is available).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 13:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 21:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 08:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 16:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

Specifically, this paper\naddresses the problem of sequentially optimizing for the best diagnosis,\nleveraging past interactions with the system and their contextual information\n(i.e. the evidence provided by the users). The problem of learning an online\nmodel while optimizing for its outcome is commonly addressed in the literature\nthrough a stochastic active learning paradigm - i.e. Contextual Multi-Armed\nBandit (CMAB). This methodology interactively updates the decision model\nconsidering the success of each past interaction with respect to the context\nprovided in each round. However, this information is very often partial and\ninadequate to handle such complex decision making problems. On the other hand,\nhuman decisions implicitly include unobserved factors (referred in the\nliterature as unobserved confounders) that significantly contribute to the\nhuman's final decision. In this paper, we take advantage of the information\nembedded in the observed human decisions to marginalize confounding factors and\nimprove the capability of the CMAB model to identify the correct diagnosis.\nSpecifically, we propose a Counterfactual Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit, a\nmodel based on the causal concept of counterfactual. The proposed model is\nvalidated with offline experiments based on data collected through a large user\nstudy on the application. The results prove that our model is able to\noutperform both traditional CMAB algorithms and observed user decisions, in\nreal-world tasks of predicting the correct apple disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 14:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

The cosmic ray flux\ndecreases very fast with energy in such a way that for energies $\\gtrsim\n10^{15}$ eV, the study of these very energetic particles is performed by using\nground based detectors. These detectors are able to detect the atmospheric air\nshowers generated by the cosmic rays as a consequence of their interactions\nwith the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere. One of the most important\nobservables that can help to understand the origin of the cosmic rays is the\ncomposition profile as a function of primary energy. Since the primary particle\ncannot be observed directly, its chemical composition has to be inferred from\nparameters of the showers that are very sensitive to the primary mass. The two\nparameters more sensitive to the composition of the primary are the atmospheric\ndepth of the shower maximum and the muon content of the showers. Past and\ncurrent cosmic-rays observatories have been using muon counters with the main\npurpose of measuring the muon content of the showers.

Here, we analyse a GOES\nM3.7 class flare exhibiting pronounced QPPs across a broad band of wavelengths\nusing imaging and time-series analysis. We identify QPPs in the timeseries of\nX-ray, low frequency radio and EUV wavelengths using wavelet analysis, and\nlocalise the region of the flare site from which the QPPs originate via X-ray\nand EUV imaging. It was found that the pulsations within the 171 \\.A, 1600 \\.A,\nsoft X-ray (SXR), and hard X-ray (HXR) light curves yielded similar periods of\n$\\sim$122 s, $\\sim$131s, $\\sim$123 s, and $\\sim$137 s, respectively, indicating\na common progenitor.

Imaging analysis indicates that the location of\nthe X-ray and EUV pulsations originates from a HXR footpoint linked to a system\nof nearby open magnetic field lines. Our results suggest that intermittent\nparticle acceleration, likely due to 'bursty' magnetic reconnection, is\nresponsible for the QPPs. The precipitating electrons accelerated towards the\nchromosphere produce the X-ray and EUV pulsations, while the escaping electrons\nresult in low frequency radio pulses in the form of type III radio bursts. The\nmodulation of the reconnection process, resulting in episodic particle\nacceleration, explains the presence of these QPPs across the entire spatial\nrange of flaring emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 14:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Binary neural networks are known to be\npromising candidates for on-device inference due to their extreme compute and\nmemory savings over higher-precision alternatives. However, their existing\ntraining methods require the concurrent storage of high-precision activations\nfor all layers, generally making learning on memory-constrained devices\ninfeasible. In this article, we demonstrate that the backward propagation\noperations needed for binary neural network training are strongly robust to\nquantization, thereby making on-the-edge learning with modern models a\npractical proposition. We introduce a low-cost binary neural network training\nstrategy exhibiting sizable memory footprint reductions while inducing little\nto no accuracy loss vs Courbariaux & Bengio's standard approach. These\ndecreases are primarily enabled through the retention of activations\nexclusively in binary format.

However, while testing to estimate accuracy, it is\ndesirable to also learn as much as possible from the failing tests in the\noperational dataset, since they inform about possible bugs of the DNN. A smart\nsampling strategy may allow to intentionally include in the test suite many\nexamples causing misprediction, thus providing this way more valuable inputs\nfor DNN improvement while preserving the ability to get trustworthy unbiased\nestimates. This paper presents a test selection technique (DeepEST) that\nactively looks for failing test cases in the operational dataset of a DNN, with\nthe goal of assessing the DNN expected accuracy by a small and ''informative''\ntest suite (namely with a high number of mispredictions) for subsequent DNN\nimprovement.

Current AMMW imaging systems have a high spatial resolution\nand can realize three-dimensional (3D) imaging. However, conventional AMMW\nimaging systems based on the synthetic aperture require either time-consume\nacquisition or reconstruction. The AMMW imaging systems based on real-aperture\nare able to real-time imaging but they need a large aperture and a complex\ntwo-dimensional (2D) scan structure to get 3D images. Besides, most AMMW\nimaging systems need the targets keep still and hold a special posture while\nscreening, limiting the throughput. Here, by using beam control techniques and\nfast post-processing algorithms, we demonstrate the AMMW 3D scan real-time\nimaging mechanism with a line antenna array, which can realize 3D real-time\nimaging by a simple one-dimensional (1D) linear moving, simultaneously, with a\nsatisfactory throughput (over 2000 people per-hour, 10 times than the\ncommercial AMMW imaging systems) and a low system cost. First, the original\nspherical beam lines generated by the linear antenna array are modulated to fan\nbeam lines via a bi-convex cylindrical lens. Then the holographic imaging\nalgorithm is used to primarily focus the echo data of the imaged object.\nFinally, the defocus blur is corrected rapidly to get high resolution images by\ndeconvolution. Since our method does not need targets to keep still, has a low\nsystem cost, can achieve 3D real-time imaging with a satisfactory throughput\nsimultaneously, this work has the potential to serve as a foundation for future\nshort-range AMMW imaging systems, which can be used in a variety of fields such\nas security inspection, medical diagnosis, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 15:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

After combining the data sets, the features\nwere obtained from the cough sounds using the mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefficients (MFCCs) method, and then they were classified with seven different\nmachine learning classifiers. To determine the optimum values of\nhyperparameters for MFCCs and classifiers, the leave-one-out cross-validation\n(LOO-CV) strategy was implemented. Based on the results, the k-nearest\nneighbors classifier based on the Euclidean distance (k-NN Euclidean) with the\naccuracy rate, sensitivity of COVID-19, sensitivity of non-COVID-19, F-measure,\nand area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9833, 1.0000, 0.9720, 0.9799, and\n0.9860, respectively, is more successful than other classifiers. Finally, the\nbest and most effective features were determined for each classifier using the\nsequential forward selection (SFS) method. According to the results, the\nproposed system is excellent compared with similar studies in the literature\nand can be easily used in smartphones and facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19\npatients. In addition, since the used data set includes reflex and unconscious\ncoughs, the results showed that conscious or unconscious coughing has no effect\non the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on the cough sound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 12:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Such confusion may have contributed to organizations such as the WHO and\nCDC initially not recommending that the general public wear masks. Here we show\nthat when the adherence to mask-usage guidelines is taken into account, the\nempirical evidence indicates that masks prevent disease transmission: all\nstudies we analyzed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were\nunder-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the\nstudies in question would still have been unlikely to find a statistically\nsignificant effect. We also provide a framework for understanding the effect of\nmasks on the probability of infection for single and repeated exposures. The\nframework demonstrates that more frequently wearing a mask provides\nsuper-linearly compounding protection, as does both the susceptible and\ninfected individual wearing a mask. This work shows (1) that both theoretical\nand empirical evidence is consistent with masks protecting against respiratory\ninfections and (2) that nonlinear effects and statistical considerations\nregarding the percentage of exposures for which masks are worn must be taken\ninto account when designing empirical studies and interpreting their results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 08:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 18:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

An extensively used\nmethod in SBVS is molecular docking. However, the docking process can hardly be\ncomputationally efficient and accurate simultaneously because classic mechanics\nscoring function is used to approximate, but hardly reach, the quantum\nmechanics precision in this method. In order to reduce the computational cost\nof the protein-ligand scoring process and use data driven approach to boost the\nscoring function accuracy, we introduce a docking-based SBVS method and,\nfurthermore, a deep learning non-docking-based method that is able to avoid the\ncomputational cost of the docking process. Then, we try to integrate these two\nmethods into an easy-to-use framework, ParaVS, that provides both choices for\nresearchers. Graph neural network (GNN) is employed in ParaVS, and we explained\nhow our in-house GNN works and how to model ligands and molecular targets. To\nverify our approaches, cross validation experiments are done on two datasets,\nan open dataset Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD.E) and an in-house\nproprietary dataset without computational generated artificial decoys\n(NoDecoy).
