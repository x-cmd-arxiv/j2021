Unfortunately, software\nmany times lacks such specifications, or only provides them for\nscenario-specific behaviors, as assertions accompanying tests. This issue\nseriously diminishes the analyzability of software with respect to its\nreliability.\n  In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a technique that, given a\nJava method, automatically produces a specification of the method's current\nbehavior, in the form of postcondition assertions. This mechanism is based on\ngenerating executions of the method under analysis to obtain valid pre/post\nstate pairs, mutating these pairs to obtain (allegedly) invalid ones, and then\nusing a genetic algorithm to produce an assertion that is satisfied by the\nvalid pre/post pairs, while leaving out the invalid ones.

Recently, this technique has been revisited\nfor the reconstruction of extensive air showers [1]. This radio-interferometric\ntechnique exploits the coherence in the radio emission emitted by billions of\nsecondary shower particles to reconstruct the shower parameters, in particular\nthe shower axis and depth of the shower maximum $X_\\mathrm{max}$. The accuracy\npreviously demonstrated on simulations with an idealized detector is very\npromising. In this article we evaluate the potential of interferometric\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ measurements using (simulated) inclined air showers with\nsparse antenna arrays under realistic conditions. To determine prerequisites\nfor the application of the radio-interferometric technique with various antenna\narrays, the influence of inaccuracies in the time synchronisation between\nantennas and its inter-dependency with the antenna density is investigated in\ndetail. We find a strong correlation between the antenna multiplicity (per\nevent) and the maximum acceptable time jitter, i.e., inaccuracy in the time\nsynchronisation. For data recorded with a time synchronisation accurate to\nwithin 1 ns in the commonly used frequency band of 30 to 80 MHz, an antenna\nmultiplicity of $> 50$ is needed to achieve an $X_\\mathrm{max}$ resolution of\n$\\sigma_{X_\\mathrm{max}} \\lesssim 20$ g cm$^{-2}$. For data recorded with 2 ns\naccuracy, already $\\gtrsim 200$ antennas are needed to achieve this\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ resolution. Furthermore, we find no advantage reconstructing\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ from data simulated at higher observation frequencies, i.e.,\nup to several hundred MHz. Finally, we provide a generalisation of our results\nfrom very inclined air showers to vertical geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Skyrme forces SkM*, SVbas and SG2 are\nimplemented to explore SSR and OSR in $^{160,162,164}$Dy and $^{232}$Th.\nAccuracy of the method is justified by a good description of M1 spin-flip giant\nresonance. The calculations show that isotopes $^{160,162,164}$Dy indeed have\nat 1.5-2.4 MeV (below OSR) $I^{\\pi}K=1^+1$ states with a large $M1$ spin\nstrength ($K$ is the projection of the total nuclear moment to the symmetry\nz-axis).

Two groups of\n$I^{\\pi}=1^+$ states observed experimentally at 2.4-4 MeV in $^{160,162,164}$Dy\nand at 2-4 MeV in $^{232}$Th are mainly explained by fragmentation of the\norbital strength.

By firstly reviewing and highlighting\nrelevant technologies and related projects, this report synthesizes the state\nof the art in offshore energy system integration, by focusing on three key\ntechnologies in electrification/floating wind, electrolysis/hydrogen production\nand Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With a timeframe out to 2050 and model\nscope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores a\ntotal of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main\nresults include an immediate electrification of all operational DUC platforms\nby linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish energy island. These\nmeasures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario of\n72% and 85% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is\nfollowed by the repurposing of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up\nto 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development of up to 5.8 GW of floating\nwind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector,\nand is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The\ncontribution of the O&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19\nTWh, which represents about 2% of total European hydrogen demand for transport\nin 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen in 2050 are\naround 4 euro2012/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar\nstudies.

A diverse collection of small-amplitude solitary wave solutions for\nthis system have been constructed by several authors in the case of strong\nsurface tension (as measured by the Bond number) and slightly subcritical\nFroude number. We prove that all of these waves are (conditionally) orbitally\nstable in the natural energy space.

Eliciting equality in populations of\nself-regarding agents requires judicious interventions. Here we use knowledge\nabout agents' social networks to implement fairness mechanisms, in the context\nof Multiplayer Ultimatum Games.

However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading\nSARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits\nin Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine,\nfor instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution\nto preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy,\nthe potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity,\nreduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A\nquantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard\nvaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide\na quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic\nepidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a\nrisk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation\nand conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the\nsecond vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit\nrange, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public\nhealth benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial\nprotection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the\nfirst dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine\ncompliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on\nvaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey.

As such, how to design the maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimator in the presence of residual channel-gain mismatch and\nasynchronies is an open problem. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the\nproblem of misaligned OAC for federated edge learning and puts forth a whitened\nmatched filtering and sampling scheme to obtain oversampled, but independent,\nsamples from the misaligned and overlapped signals.

PASSAT is an\napplication transparent to the cloud servers that allows users to securely and\nefficiently store and access their files stored on public cloud storage based\non a single master password. Using a fast and light-weight XOR secret sharing\nscheme, PASSAT secret-shares users' files and distributes them among n publicly\navailable cloud platforms. To access the files, PASSAT communicates with any k\nout of n cloud platforms to receive the shares and runs a secret-sharing\nreconstruction algorithm to recover the files. An attacker (insider or\noutsider) who compromises or colludes with less than k platforms cannot learn\nthe user's files or modify the files stealthily. To authenticate the user to\nmultiple cloud platforms, PASSAT crucially stores the authentication\ncredentials, specific to each platform on a password manager, protected under\nthe user's master password. Upon requesting access to files, the user enters\nthe password to unlock the vault and fetches the authentication tokens using\nwhich PASSAT can interact with cloud storage.

For strong local attraction\nthis standard approach, however, fails to balance the local attraction with the\nweak repulsion between the BEC particles and predicts an instability where an\ninfinite number of bosons is attracted toward the impurity. Here we present a\nsolution of the Bose polaron problem beyond the Bogoliubov approximation which\nincludes the local repulsion between bosons and thereby stabilizes the Bose\npolaron even near and beyond the scattering resonance. We show that the Bose\npolaron energy remains bounded from below across the resonance and the size of\nthe polaron dressing cloud stays finite. Our results demonstrate how the\ndressing cloud replaces the attractive impurity potential with an effective\nmany-body potential that excludes binding.

We introduce five important\ndesiderata regarding model uncertainty that any method should satisfy. However,\nwe find that established benchmarks often fail to reliably capture some of\nthese desiderata, even those that are required by Bayesian theory. To address\nthis, we introduce a new approach for capturing model uncertainty for NNs,\nwhich we call Neural Optimization-based Model Uncertainty (NOMU). The main idea\nof NOMU is to design a network architecture consisting of two connected\nsub-NNs, one for model prediction and one for model uncertainty, and to train\nit using a carefully-designed loss function. Importantly, our design enforces\nthat NOMU satisfies our five desiderata.

These EPs can possess a number of intriguing properties related to,\ne.g., chiral transport and enhanced sensitivity. Previous proposals to realize\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) with high-order EPs have been mainly based on\neither direct construction of spatial networks of coupled modes or utilization\nof synthetic dimensions, e.g., of mapping spatial lattices to time or\nphoton-number space. Both methods rely on the construction of effective NHHs\ndescribing classical or postselected quantum fields, which neglect the effects\nof quantum jumps, and which, thus, suffer from a scalability problem in the\n{\\it quantum regime}, when the probability of quantum jumps increases with the\nnumber of excitations and dissipation rate. Here, by considering the full\nquantum dynamics of a quadratic Liouvillian superoperator, we introduce a\nsimple and effective method for engineering NHHs with high-order quantum EPs,\nderived from evolution matrices of system operators moments. That is, by\nquantizing higher-order moments of system operators, e.g., of a quadratic\ntwo-mode system, the resulting evolution matrices can be interpreted as\nalternative NHHs describing, e.g., a spatial lattice of coupled resonators,\nwhere spatial sites are represented by high-order field moments in the\nsynthetic space of field moments. As an example, we consider a $U(1)$-symmetric\nquadratic Liouvillian describing a {\\it bimodal} cavity with incoherent mode\ncoupling, which can also possess anti-$\\cal PT$-symmetry, whose field moment\ndynamics can be mapped to an NHH governing a spatial {\\it network} of coupled\nresonators with high-order EPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 18:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 07:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

In\nChain EDE, the Universe undergoes a series of first order phase transitions,\nstarting at a high energy vacuum in a potential, and tunneling down through a\nchain of every lower energy metastable minima.

Recently, it has been proposed\nthat the essential features of a large class of HOTIs are captured by\ntopological multipolar response theories. In this work, we show that these\nmultipolar responses can be realized in interacting lattice models, which\nconserve both charge and dipole. In this work we study several models in both\nthe strongly interacting and mean-field limits. In $2$D we consider a\nring-exchange model which exhibits a quadrupole response, and can be tuned to a\n$C_4$ symmetric higher order topological phase with half-integer quadrupole\nmoment, as well as half-integer corner charges. We then extend this model to\ndevelop an analytic description of adiabatic dipole pumping in an interacting\nlattice model. The quadrupole moment changes during this pumping process, and\nif the process is periodic, we show the total change in the quadrupole moment\nis quantized as an integer. We also consider two interacting $3$D lattice\nmodels with chiral hinge modes. We show that the chiral hinge modes are heralds\nof a recently proposed \"dipolar Chern-Simons\" response, which is related to the\nquadrupole response by dimensional reduction. Interestingly, we find that in\nthe mean field limit, both the $2$D and $3$D interacting models we consider\nhere are equivalent to known models of non-interacting HOTIs (or boundary\nobstructed versions). The self-consistent mean-field theory treatment provides\ninsight into the connection between free-fermion (mean-field) theories having\nvanishing polarization and interacting models where dipole moments are\nmicroscopically conserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

We first use hierarchical modelling to quantify variability in repeated\nobservations by reanalyzing a suite of ten Spitzer secondary eclipse\nobservations of the hot Jupiter XO-3b. We compare three models: one where we\nfit ten separate eclipse depths, one where we use a single eclipse depth for\nall ten observations, and a hierarchical model. By comparing the Widely\nApplicable Information Criterion of each model, we show that the hierarchical\nmodel is preferred over the others. The hierarchical model yields less scatter\nacross the suite of eclipse depths -- and higher precision on the individual\neclipse depths -- than does fitting the observations separately. We find that\nthe hierarchical eclipse depth uncertainty is larger than the uncertainties on\nthe individual eclipse depths, which suggests either slight astrophysical\nvariability or that single eclipse observations underestimate the true eclipse\ndepth uncertainty. Finally, we fit a suite of published dayside brightness\nmeasurements for 37 planets using a hierarchical model of brightness\ntemperature vs irradiation temperature. The hierarchical model gives tighter\nconstraints on the individual brightness temperatures than the non-hierarchical\nmodel.

We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting\nwhich caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn\nSOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image,\ntext) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language\nis used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling\nzero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance\nof this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision\ndatasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos,\ngeo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The\nmodel transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a\nfully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training.\nFor instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet\nzero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it\nwas trained on.

Record & replay aids debugging by\ndeterministically reproducing recorded bugs, but is typically designed for a\nsingle concurrency model only. This paper proposes a practical\nconcurrency-model-agnostic record & replay approach for multi-paradigm\nconcurrent programs, i.e. applications that combine concurrency models.

In addition, it allows\nlanguage implementors to add new concurrency models and reuse the\nmodel-agnostic record & replay support.

Intrinsic complexity in electronic, magnetic, and\nphononic subsystems is difficult to understand microscopically. So far it is\nnot possible to explain demagnetization using a single mechanism, which\nsuggests a crucial piece of information still missing. In this paper, we return\nto a fundamental aspect of physics: spin and its change within each band in the\nentire Brillouin zone. We employ fcc Ni as an example and use an extremely\ndense {\\bf k} mesh to map out spin changes for every band close to the Fermi\nlevel along all the high symmetry lines. To our surprise, spin angular momentum\nat some special {\\bf k} points abruptly changes from $\\pm \\hbar/2$ to $\\mp\n\\hbar/2$ simply by moving from one crystal momentum point to the next. This\nexplains why intraband transitions, which the spin superdiffusion model is\nbased upon, can induce a sharp spin moment reduction, and why electric current\ncan change spin orientation in spintronics. These special {\\bf k} points, which\nare called spin Berry points, are not random and appear when several bands are\nclose to each other, so the Berry potential of spin majority states is\ndifferent from that of spin minority states. Although within a single band,\nspin Berry points jump, when we group several neighboring bands together, they\nform distinctive smooth spin Berry lines. It is the band structure that\ndisrupts those lines. Spin Berry points are crucial to laser-induced ultrafast\ndemagnetization and spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 20:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Towards this goal, we develop a categorical formalism\nto model attacker actions. Equipping the categorical formalism with algebras\nproduces two interesting results for security modeling. First, using the Yoneda\nlemma, we can model attacker reconnaissance missions. In this context, the\nYoneda lemma shows us that if two system representations, one being complete\nand the other being the attacker's incomplete view, agree at every possible\ntest, they behave the same. The implication is that attackers can still\nsuccessfully exploit the system even with incomplete information. Second, we\nmodel the potential changes to the system via an exploit. An exploit either\nmanipulates the interactions between system components, such as providing the\nwrong values to a sensor, or changes the components themselves, such as\ncontrolling a global positioning system (GPS). One additional benefit of using\ncategory theory is that mathematical operations can be represented as formal\ndiagrams, helpful in applying this analysis in a model-based design setting.

In this paper, we scale up\nexisting approaches and develop new multiagent driving policies for AVs in\nscenarios with greater complexity. We start by showing that a congestion metric\nused by past research is manipulable in open road network scenarios where\nvehicles dynamically join and leave the road. We then propose using a different\nmetric that is robust to manipulation and reflects open network traffic\nefficiency. Next, we propose a modular transfer reinforcement learning\napproach, and use it to scale up a multiagent driving policy to outperform\nhuman-like traffic and existing approaches in a simulated realistic scenario,\nwhich is an order of magnitude larger than past scenarios (hundreds instead of\ntens of vehicles). Additionally, our modular transfer learning approach saves\nup to 80% of the training time in our experiments, by focusing its data\ncollection on key locations in the network. Finally, we show for the first time\na distributed multiagent policy that improves congestion over human-driven\ntraffic.

It is well known that the success of a given tensor network ansatz\ndepends in part on how well it can reproduce the underlying entanglement\nstructure of the target state, with different network designs favoring\ndifferent scaling patterns. We demonstrate here how a related correlation\nanalysis can be applied to tensor network machine learning, and explore whether\nclassical data possess correlation scaling patterns similar to those found in\nquantum states which might indicate the best network to use for a given\ndataset. We utilize mutual information as measure of correlations in classical\ndata, and show that it can serve as a lower-bound on the entanglement needed\nfor a probabilistic tensor network classifier. We then develop a logistic\nregression algorithm to estimate the mutual information between bipartitions of\ndata features, and verify its accuracy on a set of Gaussian distributions\ndesigned to mimic different correlation patterns. Using this algorithm, we\ncharacterize the scaling patterns in the MNIST and Tiny Images datasets, and\nfind clear evidence of boundary-law scaling in the latter. This\nquantum-inspired classical analysis offers insight into the design of tensor\nnetworks which are best suited for specific learning tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 02:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 22:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Basically, the visual\ntransformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then\ncalculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are\nof high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity\nof the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in\ndifferent scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention\ninside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers\nwith high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN\nTransformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g.,\n16$\\times$16) as \"visual sentences\" and present to further divide them into\nsmaller patches (e.g., 4$\\times$4) as \"visual words\". The attention of each\nword will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with\nnegligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be\naggregated to enhance the representation ability.

Recently, the deep learning-based anomaly detection\nmethods have shown promising results over shallow approaches, especially on\nnetworks with high-dimensional attributes and complex structures. However,\nexisting approaches, which employ graph autoencoder as their backbone, do not\nfully exploit the rich information of the network, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. Furthermore, these methods do not directly target anomaly\ndetection in their learning objective and fail to scale to large networks due\nto the full graph training mechanism. To overcome these limitations, in this\npaper, we present a novel contrastive self-supervised learning framework for\nanomaly detection on attributed networks. Our framework fully exploits the\nlocal information from network data by sampling a novel type of contrastive\ninstance pair, which can capture the relationship between each node and its\nneighboring substructure in an unsupervised way. Meanwhile, a well-designed\ngraph neural network-based contrastive learning model is proposed to learn\ninformative embedding from high-dimensional attributes and local structure and\nmeasure the agreement of each instance pairs with its outputted scores. The\nmulti-round predicted scores by the contrastive learning model are further used\nto evaluate the abnormality of each node with statistical estimation. In this\nway, the learning model is trained by a specific anomaly detection-aware\ntarget. Furthermore, since the input of the graph neural network module is\nbatches of instance pairs instead of the full network, our framework can adapt\nto large networks flexibly. Experimental results show that our proposed\nframework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on all seven\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 03:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 03:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

We find that the\nfolded structures are nematic droplets with a broad distribution of $P_{2}$. We\nargue that non-zero values of $P_{2}$, leads to an arrangement of the SSEs that\ncan resist mechanical forces, which is a requirement for allosteric proteins.\nSuch proteins, which resist mechanical forces in some regions while being\nflexible in others, transmit signals from one region of the protein to another\n(action at a distance) in response to binding of ligands (oxygen, ATP or other\nsmall molecules).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 04:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

We capture\nmap-centric features that correspond to intersection structures under a\nspatial-temporal graph representation, and use two MAAMs (mutually auxiliary\nattention module) that cover respectively lane-level and exitlevel intentions\nto predict a target that best matches intersection elements in map-centric\nfeature space. Under our model, attention scores estimate the probability\ndistribution of the openset intentions that are contextually defined by the\nstructure of the current intersection. The proposed model is trained and\nevaluated on simulated dataset. Furthermore, the model, trained on simulated\ndataset and without any fine tuning, is directly validated on in-house\nreal-world dataset collected at 98 realworld intersections and exhibits\nsatisfactory performance,demonstrating the practical viability of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 06:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 01:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Given a\ndynamic graph, it is fundamental and essential to learn a graph representation\nthat is expected not only to preserve structural proximity but also jointly\ncapture the time-evolving patterns. Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)\nhas been widely explored and used in non-Euclidean application domains. The\nmain success of GCN, especially in handling dependencies and passing messages\nwithin nodes, lies in its approximation to Laplacian smoothing. As a matter of\nfact, this smoothing technique can not only encourage must-link node pairs to\nget closer but also push cannot-link pairs to shrink together, which\npotentially cause serious feature shrink or oversmoothing problem, especially\nwhen stacking graph convolution in multiple layers or steps. For learning\ntime-evolving patterns, a natural solution is to preserve historical state and\ncombine it with the current interactions to obtain the most recent\nrepresentation. Then the serious feature shrink or oversmoothing problem could\nhappen when stacking graph convolution explicitly or implicitly according to\ncurrent prevalent methods, which would make nodes too similar to distinguish\neach other. To solve this problem in dynamic graph embedding, we analyze the\nshrinking properties in the node embedding space at first, and then design a\nsimple yet versatile method, which exploits L2 feature normalization constraint\nto rescale all nodes to hypersphere of a unit ball so that nodes would not\nshrink together, and yet similar nodes can still get closer. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world dynamic graph datasets compared with competitive\nbaseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 09:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 08:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

This is\nparticularly important for distributed systems with shared resources, e.g., one\ncase can block another case competing for the same machine, leading to\ninter-case dependencies in performance. However, due to a variety of reasons,\nreal-life systems often record only a subset of all events taking place. To\nunderstand and analyze the behavior and performance of processes with shared\nresources, we aim to reconstruct bounds for timestamps of events in a case that\nmust have happened but were not recorded by inference over events in other\ncases in the system. We formulate and solve the problem by systematically\nintroducing multi-entity concepts in event logs and process models. We\nintroduce a partial-order based model of a multi-entity event log and a\ncorresponding compositional model for multi-entity processes. We define\nPQR-systems as a special class of multi-entity processes with shared resources\nand queues. We then study the problem of inferring from an incomplete event log\nunobserved events and their timestamps that are globally consistent with a\nPQR-system. We solve the problem by reconstructing unobserved traces of\nresources and queues according to the PQR-model and derive bounds for their\ntimestamps using a linear program.

We\nperform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of coagulating particles in isotropic\nturbulent flow in the regime of small Stokes number ($St=0.001-0.54$) and find\nthat, due to collision-coagulation, the radial distribution functions (RDFs)\nfall-off dramatically at scales $r \\sim d\\,\\,$ (where $d$ is the particle\ndiameter) to small but finite values, while the mean radial-component of\nparticle relative velocities (MRV) increase sharply in magnitudes. Based on a\npreviously proposed Fokker-Planck (drift-diffusion) framework, we derive a\ntheoretical account of the relationship among particle collision-coagulation\nrate, RDF and MRV. The theory includes contributions from\nturbulent-fluctuations absent in earlier mean-field theories. We show\nnumerically that the theory accurately accounts for the DNS results (i.e.,\ngiven an accurate RDF, the theory could produce an accurate MRV). Separately,\nwe also propose a phenomenological model that could directly predict MRV and\nfind that it is accurate when calibrated using fourth moments of the fluid\nvelocities. We use the model to derive a general solution of RDF. We uncover a\nparadox: the past empirical success of the differential version of the theory\nis theoretically unjustified. We see a further shape-preserving reduction of\nthe RDF (and MRV) when the gravitational settling parameter ($S_g$) is of order\n$O(1)$.

Since high resolution (HR) images cannot be typically acquired\ncontinuously over time, bi-temporal images with different resolutions are often\nadopted for change detection in practical applications. Traditional\nsubpixel-based methods for change detection using images with different\nresolutions may lead to substantial error accumulation when HR images are\nemployed; this is because of intraclass heterogeneity and interclass\nsimilarity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel method for change\ndetection using images with different resolutions, that is more suitable for HR\nimages. To this end, we propose a super-resolution-based change detection\nnetwork (SRCDNet) with a stacked attention module. The SRCDNet employs a super\nresolution (SR) module containing a generator and a discriminator to directly\nlearn SR images through adversarial learning and overcome the resolution\ndifference between bi-temporal images. To enhance the useful information in\nmulti-scale features, a stacked attention module consisting of five\nconvolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) is integrated to the feature\nextractor. The final change map is obtained through a metric learning-based\nchange decision module, wherein a distance map between bi-temporal features is\ncalculated. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method, which not only outperforms all baselines -with the highest F1\nscores of 87.40% on the building change detection dataset and 92.94% on the\nchange detection dataset -but also obtains the best accuracies on experiments\nperformed with images having a 4x and 8x resolution difference.

HIR combines high level language\nfeatures, such as loops and multi-dimensional tensors, with programmer defined\nexplicit scheduling, to provide a high-level IR suitable for DSL compiler\npipelines without compromising control over the micro-architecture of the\naccelerator. HIR's explicit schedules allow it to express fine-grained,\nsynchronization-free parallelism and optimizations such as retiming and\npipelining. Built as a dialect in MLIR, it draws from best IR practices learnt\nfrom communities like those of LLVM. While offering rich optimization\nopportunities and a high level abstraction, HIR enables sharing of\noptimizations, utilities and passes with software compiler infrastructure.\n  Our implementation shows that the code generation time of the HIR code\ngenerator is on average 1112x lower than that of Xilinx Vivado HLS on a range\nof kernels without a compromise on the quality of the generated hardware.

However, high-resolution remote\nsensing CD remains challenging due to the complexity of objects in the scene.\nObjects with the same semantic concept may show distinct spectral\ncharacteristics at different times and spatial locations. Most recent CD\npipelines using pure convolutions are still struggling to relate long-range\nconcepts in space-time. Non-local self-attention approaches show promising\nperformance via modeling dense relations among pixels, yet are computationally\ninefficient. Here, we propose a bitemporal image transformer (BIT) to\nefficiently and effectively model contexts within the spatial-temporal domain.\nOur intuition is that the high-level concepts of the change of interest can be\nrepresented by a few visual words, i.e., semantic tokens. To achieve this, we\nexpress the bitemporal image into a few tokens, and use a transformer encoder\nto model contexts in the compact token-based space-time. The learned\ncontext-rich tokens are then feedback to the pixel-space for refining the\noriginal features via a transformer decoder. We incorporate BIT in a deep\nfeature differencing-based CD framework. Extensive experiments on three CD\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\nNotably, our BIT-based model significantly outperforms the purely convolutional\nbaseline using only 3 times lower computational costs and model parameters.\nBased on a naive backbone (ResNet18) without sophisticated structures (e.g.,\nFPN, UNet), our model surpasses several state-of-the-art CD methods, including\nbetter than four recent attention-based methods in terms of efficiency and\naccuracy.

A\ngeneral form of integrity cyber-attacks that cannot be detected using the\nwell-established observer-based technique is first introduced as kernel\nattacks. The well-known replay, zero dynamics and covert attacks are special\nforms of the kernel attacks. Existence conditions for the kernel attacks are\npresented. It is demonstrated, in the unified framework of control and\ndetection, that all kernel attacks can be structurally detected when not only\nthe observer-based residual, but also the control signal based residual signals\nare generated and used for the detection purpose. Based on the analytical\nresults, two schemes for detecting the kernel attacks are then proposed, which\nallow reliable attack detection without loss of control performance. While the\nfirst scheme is similar to the well-established moving target method and\nauxiliary system aided detection scheme, the second detector is realised with\nencrypted transmissions of control and monitoring signals in the feedback\ncontrol system that prevents adversary to gain system knowledge by means of\neavesdropping attacks.

GCNs provide a powerful tool for analyzing the patients' features\nrelative to each other. This can be achieved by modeling the problem as a graph\nnode classification task, where each node is a patient. Due to the nature of\nsuch medical datasets, class imbalance is a prevalent issue in the field of\ndisease prediction, where the distribution of classes is skewed. When the class\nimbalance is present in the data, the existing graph-based classifiers tend to\nbe biased towards the major class(es) and neglect the samples in the minor\nclass(es). On the other hand, the correct diagnosis of the rare positive cases\namong all the patients is vital in a healthcare system. In conventional\nmethods, such imbalance is tackled by assigning appropriate weights to classes\nin the loss function which is still dependent on the relative values of\nweights, sensitive to outliers, and in some cases biased towards the minor\nclass(es). In this paper, we propose a Re-weighted Adversarial Graph\nConvolutional Network (RA-GCN) to prevent the graph-based classifier from\nemphasizing the samples of any particular class. This is accomplished by\nassociating a graph-based neural network to each class, which is responsible\nfor weighting the class samples and changing the importance of each sample for\nthe classifier. Therefore, the classifier adjusts itself and determines the\nboundary between classes with more attention to the important samples. The\nparameters of the classifier and weighting networks are trained by an\nadversarial approach. We show experiments on synthetic and three publicly\navailable medical datasets.

Multi-sense embeddings (M-SE) can be exploited for this important\nrequirement. M-SE seeks to represent each word by their distinct senses in\norder to resolve the conflation of meanings of words as used in different\ncontexts. Previous works usually approach this task by training a model on a\nlarge corpus and often ignore the effect and usefulness of the semantic\nrelations offered by lexical resources. However, even with large training data,\ncoverage of all possible word senses is still an issue. In addition, a\nconsiderable percentage of contextual semantic knowledge are never learned\nbecause a huge amount of possible distributional semantic structures are never\nexplored. In this paper, we leverage the rich semantic structures in WordNet\nusing a graph-theoretic walk technique over word senses to enhance the quality\nof multi-sense embeddings.

To address this issue, we design an\nuncertainty-aware domain adaptation network (UaDAN) that introduces conditional\nadversarial learning to align well-aligned and poorly-aligned samples\nseparately in different manners.

Developable\nPQ-strip meshes are useful in many areas of shape modeling, thanks to the\nsimplicity of fabrication from flat sheet material. Unfortunately, they are\ndifficult to model due to their restrictive combinatorics and locking issues.\nOther representations of developable surfaces, such as arbitrary triangle or\nquad meshes, are more suitable for interactive freeform modeling, but generally\nhave non-planar faces or are not aligned to principal curvatures.

While our results are\nsomewhat limited due to photon statistics, we demonstrate the utility of the\ndispersed HETG spectral analysis that can be performed with our regular Chandra\nmonitoring observations of SNR 1987A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 15:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

However, its numerical solution encounters severe\nchallenges arising from its strong singularity and nonlinearity. In [1,2], the\neffect of strong singularities was eliminated by applying the range-separated\n(RS) canonical tensor format [3,4] to construct a solution decomposition scheme\nfor the PBE. The RS tensor format allows to derive a smooth approximation to\nthe Dirac delta distribution in order to obtain a regularized PBE (RPBE) model.\nHowever, solving the RPBE is still computationally demanding due to its high\ndimension $\\mathcal{N}$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ is always in the millions. In this\nstudy, we propose to apply the reduced basis method (RBM) and the (discrete)\nempirical interpolation method ((D)EIM) to the RPBE in order to construct a\nreduced order model (ROM) of low dimension $N \\ll \\mathcal{N}$, whose solution\naccurately approximates the nonlinear RPBE. The long-range potential can be\nobtained by lifting the ROM solution back to the $\\mathcal{N}$-space while the\nshort-range potential is directly precomputed analytically, thanks to the RS\ntensor format. The sum of both provides the total electrostatic potential. The\nmain computational benefit is the avoidance of computing the numerical\napproximation of the singular electrostatic potential. We demonstrate in the\nnumerical experiments, the accuracy and efficacy of the reduced basis (RB)\napproximation to the nonlinear RPBE (NRPBE) solution and the corresponding\ncomputational savings over the classical nonlinear PBE (NPBE) as well as over\nthe RBM being applied to the classical NPBE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 15:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

To overcome the large\nvariance in RSSI measurements, we propose a data-driven approach that uses a\ndeep recurrent network, DeepBLE, to localize the smartphone using RSSI measured\nfrom multiple beacons in an environment. In particular, we focus on the ability\nof our approach to generalize across many smartphone brands (e.g., Apple,\nSamsung) and models (e.g., iPhone 8, S10). Towards this end, we collect a\nlarge-scale dataset of 15 hours of smartphone data, which consists of over\n50,000 BLE beacon RSSI measurements collected from 47 beacons in a single\nbuilding using 15 different popular smartphone models, along with precise 2D\nlocation annotations.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nstatistic similarity loss (SSL) which enables our model to generalize to unseen\nphones using a semi-supervised learning approach.

This paper investigates various DLEC designs to support\nYUV 4:2:0 format by comparing their performance against the main profiles of\nHEVC and VVC standards under a common evaluation framework. Moreover, a new\ntransform network architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of coding\nYUV 4:2:0 data. The experimental results on YUV 4:2:0 datasets show that the\nproposed architecture significantly outperforms naive extensions of existing\narchitectures designed for RGB format and achieves about 10% average BD-rate\nimprovement over the intra-frame coding in HEVC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 06:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 07:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Modern phase retrieval approaches usually rely\non gradient descent methods in a nonlinear minimization framework. Calculating\nclosed-form gradients for use in these methods is tedious work, and formulating\nsecond order derivatives is even more laborious. Additionally, second order\ntechniques often require the storage and inversion of large matrices of partial\nderivatives, with memory requirements that can be prohibitive for data-rich\nimaging modalities. We use a reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD)\nframework to implement an efficient matrix-free version of the\nLevenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, a longstanding method that finds popular\nuse in nonlinear least-square minimization problems but which has seen little\nuse in phase retrieval. Furthermore, we extend the basic LM algorithm so that\nit can be applied for general constrained optimization problems beyond just the\nleast-square applications. Since we use AD, we only need to specify the\nphysics-based forward model for a specific imaging application; the derivative\nterms are calculated automatically through matrix-vector products, without\nexplicitly forming any large Jacobian or Gauss-Newton matrices. We demonstrate\nthat this algorithm can be used to solve both the unconstrained ptychographic\nobject retrieval problem and the constrained \"blind\" ptychographic object and\nprobe retrieval problems, under both the Gaussian and Poisson noise models, and\nthat this method outperforms best-in-class first-order ptychographic\nreconstruction methods: it provides excellent convergence guarantees with (in\nmany cases) a superlinear rate of convergence, all with a computational cost\ncomparable to, or lower than, the tested first-order algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

A particularly challenging variety of heterogeneity may occur by the\ncombination of a time-consuming laboratory-based objective with other\nobjectives that are evaluated using faster computer-based calculations.
