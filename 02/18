Moreover,\nwe observe that, with concentrations in between the two bounds, the filaments\nretract at velocities larger than the corresponding Taylor-Culick velocity for\nthe Newtonian case. We show that this enhanced retraction velocity can be\nattributed to the elastic tension due to polymer stretching, which builds up\nduring the initial jetting phase.

Also, implementation and experimentation on real serverless platforms is\nboth costly and time-consuming. However, at the moment, there is no\ncomprehensive simulation tool or framework to be used instead of the real\nplatform. As a result, in this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a\nsimulation platform, called SimFaaS, which assists serverless application\ndevelopers to develop optimized Function-as-a-Service applications in terms of\ncost and performance. On the other hand, SimFaaS can be leveraged by FaaS\nproviders to tailor their platforms to be workload-aware so that they can\nincrease profit and quality of service at the same time. Also, serverless\nplatform providers can evaluate new designs, implementations, and deployments\non SimFaaS in a timely and cost-efficient manner.\n  SimFaaS is open-source, well-documented, and publicly available, making it\neasily usable and extendable to incorporate more use case scenarios in the\nfuture. Besides, it provides performance engineers with a set of tools that can\ncalculate several characteristics of serverless platform internal states, which\nis otherwise hard (mostly impossible) to extract from real platforms. We show\nhow SimFaaS facilitates the prediction of essential performance metrics such as\naverage response time, probability of cold start, and the average number of\ninstances reflecting the infrastructure cost incurred by the serverless\ncomputing provider. We evaluate the accuracy and applicability of SimFaaS by\ncomparing the prediction results with real-world traces from Amazon AWS Lambda.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 17:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Most existing metrics, which\nwere tailored solely to the image synthesis setup, exhibit a limited capacity\nfor diagnosing the different modes of failure of generative models across\nbroader application domains. In this paper, we introduce a 3-dimensional\nevaluation metric, ($\\alpha$-Precision, $\\beta$-Recall, Authenticity), that\ncharacterizes the fidelity, diversity and generalization performance of any\ngenerative model in a domain-agnostic fashion. Our metric unifies statistical\ndivergence measures with precision-recall analysis, enabling sample- and\ndistribution-level diagnoses of model fidelity and diversity. We introduce\ngeneralization as an additional, independent dimension (to the\nfidelity-diversity trade-off) that quantifies the extent to which a model\ncopies training data -- a crucial performance indicator when modeling sensitive\ndata with requirements on privacy. The three metric components correspond to\n(interpretable) probabilistic quantities, and are estimated via sample-level\nbinary classification. The sample-level nature of our metric inspires a novel\nuse case which we call model auditing, wherein we judge the quality of\nindividual samples generated by a (black-box) model, discarding low-quality\nsamples and hence improving the overall model performance in a post-hoc manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 14:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

The\nsources with an efficient engine are optically classified as High Excitation\nRadio Galaxies (HERGs) and those with an inefficient motor as Low Excitation\nRadio Galaxies (LERGs). Recently, the study of Radio Galaxies down to mJy\nfluxes has cast serious doubts on the LERG-FRI and HERG-FRII correspondence,\nrevealing that many LERGs show FRII radio morphologies. The FR catalogs\nrecently compiled by Capetti et al. (2017a,b) and Baldi et al. (2018) have\nallowed us to explore this issue in the local ($z\\le 0.15$) mJy Universe. Our\nstatistical study shows that the majority of nearby mJy objects are in a late\nstage of their life. FRII-LERGs appear more similar to the old FRI-LERGs than\nto the young FRII-HERGs. FRII-LERGs may be aged HERGs that, exhausted the cold\nfuel, have changed their accretion regime or a separate LERG class particularly\nefficient in launching jets. Exploiting the empirical relations which convert\nL$_{\\rm [OIII]}$ and L$_{\\rm 1.4~GHz}$ into accretion power and jet kinetic\npower, respectively, we observed that LERGs with similar masses and accretion\nrates seem to expel jets of different power. We speculate that intrinsic\ndifferences related to the black hole properties (spin and magnetic field at\nits horizon) can determine the observed spread in jet luminosity. In this view,\nFRII-LERGs should have the fastest spinning black holes and/or the most intense\nmagnetic fluxes. On the contrary, compact LERGs (i.e. FR0s) should host\nextremely slow black holes and/or weak magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Theoretical predictions for\nthis quantity usually assume that, when expressed in a certain form, it depends\nonly on the mass variance of the linear density field. However, cosmological\nsimulations have revealed that this assumption breaks, leading to 10-20%\nsystematic effects. In this paper we employ a specially-designed suite of\nsimulations to further investigate this problem. Specifically, we carry out\ncosmological N-body simulations where we systematically vary growth history at\na fixed linear density field, or vary the power spectrum shape at a fixed\ngrowth history. We show that the halo mass function generically depends on\nthese quantities, thus showing a clear signal of non-universality. Most of this\neffect can be traced back to the way in which the same linear fluctuation grows\ndifferently into the nonlinear regime depending on details of its assembly\nhistory. With these results, we propose a parameterization with explicit\ndependence on the linear growth rate and power spectrum shape. Using an\nindependent suite of simulations, we show that this fitting function accurately\ncaptures the mass function of haloes over cosmologies spanning a vast parameter\nspace, including massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. Finally, we\nemploy this tool to improve the accuracy of so-called cosmology-rescaling\nmethods and show they can deliver 2% accurate predictions for the halo mass\nfunction over the whole range of currently viable cosmologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Methods: We generate mock samples of axisymmetric lenses.\nWe assume that, for each lens, we have measurements of two image positions of a\nstrongly lensed background source, as well as magnification information from\nfull surface brightness modelling, and a stellar population synthesis-based\nestimate of the lens stellar mass.

In adaptive experiments, the probability of\nchoosing an action (logging policy) is allowed to be sequentially updated based\non past observations. Due to this logging policy depending on the past\nobservations, the samples are often not independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.), making developing an asymptotically normal estimator difficult. A\ntypical approach for this problem is to assume that the logging policy\nconverges in a time-invariant function.

In this paper,\nwe address the RFI mitigation problem for one-bit UWB radar systems. A one-bit\nUWB system obtains its signed measurements via a low-cost and high rate\nsampling scheme, referred to as the Continuous Time Binary Value (CTBV)\ntechnology. This sampling strategy compares the signal to a known threshold\nvarying with slow-time and therefore can be used to achieve a rather high\nsampling rate and quantization resolution with rather simple and affordable\nhardware. This paper establishes a proper data model for the RFI sources and\nproposes a novel RFI mitigation method for the one-bit UWB radar system that\nuses the CTBV sampling technique. Specifically, we first model the RFI sources\nas a sum of sinusoids with frequencies fixed during the coherent processing\ninterval (CPI) and we exploit the sparsity of the RFI spectrum. We extend a\nmajorization-minimization based 1bRELAX algorithm, referred to as 1bMMRELAX, to\nestimate the RFI source parameters from the signed measurements obtained by\nusing the CTBV sampling strategy.

The\nexperimental realization of this effect has had wide ranging impact in diverse\nfields of physics and facilitated the development of new technologies. In\nsemiconductor physics, quantum confinement of optically excited quasiparticles,\nsuch as excitons or trions, is typically achieved by modulation of material\nproperties - an approach crucially limited by the lack of insitu tunability and\nscalability of confining potentials. Achieving fully tunable quantum\nconfinement of optical excitations has therefore been an outstanding goal in\nquantum photonics. Here, we demonstrate electrically controlled quantum\nconfinement of neutral excitons in a gate-defined monolayer p-i-n diode. A\ncombination of dc Stark shift induced by large in-plane fields and a previously\nunknown confining mechanism based on repulsive interaction between excitons and\nfree charges ensures tight exciton confinement in the narrow neutral region.\nQuantization of exciton motion manifests in multiple discrete, spectrally\nnarrow, voltage-dependent optical resonances that emerge below the free exciton\nresonance. Our measurements reveal several unique physical features of these\nquantum confined excitons, including an in-plane dipolar character,\none-dimensional center-of-mass confinement, and strikingly enhanced exciton\nsize in the presence of magnetic fields.

The null detection to date suggests that any such\nfeatures should be fairly weak, and next-generation galaxy surveys, with their\nunprecedented sizes and precisions, are in a position to place stronger\nconstraints than before. However, even if such primordial features once existed\nin the early Universe, they would have been significantly damped in the\nnonlinear regime at low redshift due to structure formation, which makes them\ndifficult to be directly detected in real observations. A potential way to\ntackle this challenge for probing the features is to undo the cosmological\nevolution, i.e., using reconstruction to obtain an approximate linear density\nfield. By employing a set of N-body simulations, here we show that a\nrecently-proposed nonlinear reconstruction algorithm can effectively retrieve\ndamped oscillatory features from halo catalogues and improve the accuracy of\nthe measurement of feature parameters (assuming that such primordial features\ndo exist). We do a Fisher analysis to forecast how nonlinear reconstruction\naffects the constraining power, and find that it can lead to significantly more\nrobust constraints on the feature amplitude for a DESI-like survey. Comparing\nnonlinear reconstruction with other ways of improving constraints, such as\nincreasing the survey volume and range of scales, this shows that it is\npossible to achieve what the latter do, but at a lower cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 13:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 19:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

We first\ndevelop a parametric physics-based model to replace the black-box deep neural\nnetworks in the conventional graphical neural network (GNN). Then we derive the\ngradient of the loss function with respect to the network parameters and use\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) to estimate the physical parameters. Prior\nknowledge of network parameters is also considered to further improve the\naccuracy of estimation. Comprehensive numerical study results show that our\nproposed algorithm yields high accuracy and outperforms existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 20:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

Finding calibration\nweights that account for important interactions remains challenging with\ntraditional survey methods: raking typically balances the margins alone, while\npost-stratification, which exactly balances all interactions, is only feasible\nfor a small number of variables. In this paper, we propose multilevel\ncalibration weighting, which enforces tight balance constraints for marginal\nbalance and looser constraints for higher-order interactions. This incorporates\nsome of the benefits of post-stratification while retaining the guarantees of\nraking. We then correct for the bias due to the relaxed constraints via a\nflexible outcome model; we call this approach Double Regression with\nPost-stratification (DRP).

The ultimate goal of Smart City projects is to deliver a positive\nimpact for the citizens and the socio-economic and ecological environment. This\ninvolves the challenge to derive concrete requirements for (technical) projects\nfrom overarching concepts like Quality of Life (QoL) and Subjective Well-Being\n(SWB). Linking long-term, impact oriented goals with project outputs and\noutcomes is a complex problem. Decision making on requirements and resulting\nfeatures of single Smart City projects (or systems) is even more complex since\ncities are not like monolithic, hierarchical and well structured systems.\nNevertheless, systems engineering provides concepts which support decision\nmaking in such situations. Complex socio-technical systems such as smart cities\ncan be characterized as systems of systems (SoS). A SoS is composed of\nindependently developed systems that nevertheless provide a higher-level\nintegrated functionality. To add new functionality to a SoS, either existing\nsystems must be extended or new systems must be developed and integrated. In\nboth cases, the extension of functionality is usually done in small increments\nand structured via software releases. However, the decision which features to\ninclude in the next release is complex and difficult to manage when done\nmanually.

In machine vision, object recognition\ngiven a sequence of sensory samples of an image, such as saccades, is a\nchallenging problem when the sequence does not follow a consistent, fixed\npattern - yet this is something humans do naturally and effortlessly. We\nexplore how grid cell-based path integration in a cortical network can support\nreliable recognition of objects given an arbitrary sequence of inputs.

We show that GridCellNet can reliably perform classification,\ngeneralizing to both unseen examples and completely novel sequence\ntrajectories. We further show that inference is often successful after sampling\na fraction of the input space, enabling the predictive GridCellNet to\nreconstruct the rest of the image given just a few movements.

In this paper, to close the\nunder-determined set of equations, we remove the mass density using\nobservations and leave the temperature and the chemical potential as\nposition-dependent variables. We analyze observations of the mass profiles of\n175 late-type galaxies in the Spitzer Photometry \\& Accurate Rotation Curves\n(SPARC) database as well as 26 late-type dwarfs in the Little Things database,\nto construct the temperature profile of their DM halos by assuming that (1) DM\nin the halos obeys either the Fermi-Dirac or the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution, and (2) the halos are in the virial state.

Each\nbuild target specifies the information that is needed to build a software\nartifact or run tests. It is common to execute a subset of build targets at\neach revision and make sure that the change does not break the codebase.\nGoogle's build service system uses Bazel to build targets. Bazel takes as input\na build that specifies the execution context, flags and build targets to run.\nThe outputs are the build libraries, binaries or test results. To be able to\nsupport developer's daily activities, the build service system runs millions of\nbuilds per day. It is a known issue that a build with many targets could run\nout of the allocated memory or exceed its execution deadline. This is\nproblematic because it reduces the developer's productivity, e.g. code\nsubmissions or binary releases. In this paper, we propose a technique that\npredicts the memory usage and executor occupancy of a build.

A distributed framework is proposed to\npartition the optimal control problem of a networked MAS into several local\noptimal control problems in factorial subsystems, such that each (central)\nagent behaves optimally to minimize the joint cost function of a subsystem that\ncomprises a central agent and its neighboring agents, and the local control\nactions (policies) only rely on the knowledge of local observations.

Creating larger periodic DTCs in the lab remains a longstanding\nchallenge, yet it is necessary for developing the technological applications of\nDTCs, e.g., as a quantum memory for highly-entangled qubits, or exploring\ninteresting features beyond subharmonic dynamics, e.g., condensed matter\nphenomena in the time domain. By highlighting the connection between DTCs and\nquantum error correction, we devise a general and realistic scheme for building\nDTCs exhibiting any large period observable dynamics, which is observable even\nat sufficiently small system sizes. Our proposal uses an array of spin-1/2\nchains to simulate a repetition code at the hardware level, which has essential\nproperties to realize robust observable dynamics.

Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the\nscene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational\nreasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future\ntrajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative\nneural system (called STG-DAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction involving\nheterogeneous agents. The system takes a step forward to explicit interaction\nmodeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph\nrepresentation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We\nalso employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle\ntrajectory prediction. The constraint not only ensures physical feasibility but\nalso enhances model performance. Moreover, the proposed prediction model can be\neasily adopted by multi-target tracking frameworks. The tracking accuracy\nproves to be improved by empirical results.

For the last two decades, considerable experimental evidence\naccumulated that the mammalian cortex with its diversity in cell types and\nconnections might exhibit SOC. Here we review experimental findings of\nisolated, layered cortex preparations to self-organize towards four dynamical\nmotifs identified in the cortex in vivo: up-states, oscillations, neuronal\navalanches, and coherence potentials. During up-states, the synchronization\nobserved for nested theta/gamma-oscillations embeds scale-invariant neuronal\navalanches that exhibit robust power law scaling in size with a slope of -3/2\nand a critical branching parameter of 1. This dynamical coordination, tracked\nin the local field potential (nLFP) and pyramidal neuron activity using\n2-photon imaging, emerges autonomously in superficial layers of organotypic\ncortex cultures and acute cortex slices, is homeostatically regulated, displays\nseparation of time scales, and reveals unique size vs. quiet time dependencies.\nA threshold operation identifies coherence potentials; avalanches that in\naddition maintain the precise time course of propagated synchrony. Avalanches\nemerge under conditions of external driving. Control parameters are established\nby the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) and the neuromodulator\ndopamine. This rich dynamical repertoire is not observed in dissociated cortex\ncultures, which lack cortical layers and exhibit dynamics similar to a\n1st-order phase transition.

The notable characteristics of\nour proposed method are as follows. 1) The propagation of high-level features\nwhich usually have relatively strong semantic information is enhanced in the\ndecoding procedure; 2) With the help of PCSP, the gradient vanishing issues\ncaused by non-linear operations in top-down information flows can be\nalleviated; 3) Thanks to the full exploration of high-level features, the\ndecoding process of our method is relatively memory efficient compared against\nthose of existing methods. Integrating DNTDF with EfficientNet, we construct a\nhighly light-weighted SOD model, with very low computational complexity. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comprehensive experiments\nare conducted on six widely-used benchmark datasets. The comparisons to the\nmost state-of-the-art methods as well as the carefully-designed baseline models\nverify our insights on the top-down flow modeling for SOD.

In particular, in the prototypical case of\nmetric-based short-range kernels, the spectral gap admits a lower-bound\nexpressed in terms of the discrete Fourier coefficients of the radial kernel,\nwhich enables us to quantify an emerging flocking behavior for non-vacuous\nsolutions. These large-time behavior results apply as long as the solutions\nremain smooth.

As this is a labor-intensive\nand error-prone task, automatic ICD coding of medical reports using machine\nlearning has gained significant interest in the last decade.

Nevertheless, such\nmulti-label approach is challenging due to the extremely large label set size.\nFurthermore, the interpretability of the predictions is essential for the\nendusers (e.g., healthcare providers and insurance companies).

We made this approach viable through extensive data\ncollection to acquire phrase-level human coder annotations to supervise our\nmodels on learning the specific relations between the input text and predicted\nICD codes.

We exploit\nthe low rank linear dynamics of the system to calculate an efficient basis for\nour solution, the coefficients of which are then calculated through an\noptimization problem where the cost function to be minimized is the triadic\nconsistency of the solution with itself as well as with the input mean flow.\nOur approach constitutes, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nnonlinear and self-sustaining, resolvent-based model described in the\nliterature.

Additionally, we find\nthat as the Reynolds number increases the flow undergoes a fundamental\ntransition from a classical weakly nonlinear regime, where the forcing cascade\nis strictly down scale, to a fully nonlinear regime characterized by the\nemergence of an inverse (up scale) forcing cascade. Triadic contributions from\nthe inverse and traditional cascade destructively interfere implying that the\naccurate modeling of a certain Fourier mode requires knowledge of its immediate\nharmonic and sub-harmonic.

However, such\nspatio-temporal modelling often results in very high-dimensional feature spaces\nand large volumes of data, making training difficult and time consuming. This\npaper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel model that efficiently\nextracts both spatial and temporal features of the data by means of its\nenhanced temporal modelling based on latent features. Our proposed model\nconsists of three major networks, coined Generator, Discriminator, and\nCombiner, which are trained in an adversarial setting combined with curriculum\nlearning to enable our adaptive attention modules. In our experiments, we show\nthe effectiveness of our approach by reporting our competitive results on both\nthe AFEW-VA and SEWA datasets, suggesting that temporal modelling improves the\naffect estimates both in qualitative and quantitative terms.

While this problem is of fundamental nature, it is highly\nrelevant practically, e.g., in the context of partitioning the recently\nproposed Citizens Broadband Radio Service band.

In this paper, we characterize this ensemble\nand classify the phases that can be established as steady states. Symmetry\nplays a nonstandard role in that the physical symmetry imposed on the circuit\nelements does not on its own dictate the possible phases. Instead, it is\nextended by dynamical symmetries associated with this ensemble to form an\nenlarged symmetry. Thus, we predict phases that have no equilibrium counterpart\nand could not have been supported by the physical circuit symmetry alone. We\ngive the following examples. First, we classify the phases of a circuit\noperating on qubit chains with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. One striking\nprediction, corroborated with numerical simulation, is the existence of\ndistinct volume-law phases in one dimension, which nonetheless support true\nlong-range order. We furthermore argue that owing to the enlarged symmetry,\nthis system can in principle support a topological area-law phase, protected by\nthe combination of the circuit symmetry and a dynamical permutation symmetry.\nSecond, we consider a Gaussian fermionic circuit that only conserves fermion\nparity.

A novel approach that uses the link prediction problem in social\nnetworks has been proposed in the literature that model the typical user-item\ninformation as a bipartite network in which link prediction would actually mean\nrecommending an item to a user. The standard recommender system methods suffer\nfrom the problems of sparsity and scalability. Since link prediction measures\ninvolve computations pertaining to small neighborhoods in the network, this\napproach would lead to a scalable solution to recommendation. One of the issues\nin this conversion is that link prediction problem is modelled as a binary\nclassification task whereas the problem of recommender systems is solved as a\nregression task in which the rating of the link is to be predicted. We overcome\nthis issue by predicting top k links as recommendations with high ratings\nwithout predicting the actual rating. Our work extends similar approaches in\nthe literature by focusing on exploiting the probabilistic measures for link\nprediction. Moreover, in the proposed approach, prediction measures that\nutilize temporal information available on the links prove to be more effective\nin improving the accuracy of prediction. This approach is evaluated on the\nbenchmark 'Movielens' dataset. We show that the usage of temporal probabilistic\nmeasures helps in improving the quality of recommendations.

To Follow this route, we use a slightly reformulated\nmodel addressed in PRD95, 123521 (2017).

The problem\nhas been solved by the slow adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian in time. The\nmethods for controlling a qutrit system using projection operators have been\ndeveloped and the numerical simulation has been performed. The Hamiltonians for\ntwo well-known cluster-ing methods, one-hot encoding and k-means ++, have been\nbuilt. The first method has been used to partition a set of six points into\nthree or two clusters and the second method, to partition a set of nine points\ninto three clusters and seven points into four clusters. The simulation has\nshown that the clustering problem can be ef-fectively solved on qutrits\nrepresented by the spins S = 1. The advantages of clustering on qutrits over\nthat on qubits have been demonstrated. In particular, the number of qutrits\nrequired to represent data points is smaller than the number of qubits by a\nfactor of log2 N / log3 N . Since, for qutrits, it is easier to partition the\ndata points into three clusters rather than two ones, the approximate\nhierarchical procedure of data partition-ing into a larger number of clusters\nis accelerated. At the exact data partition into more than three clusters, it\nhas been proposed to number the clusters by the numbers of states of the\ncorresponding multi-spin subsys-tems, instead of using the numbers of\nindividual spins.

Moreover the spectra of cosmic rays\nescaping the remnants have a complex shape that is not obviously the same as\nthe spectra observed at the Earth. Here we investigate the process of particle\nacceleration at the termination shock that develops in the bubble excavated by\nstar clusters' winds in the interstellar medium. While the main limitation to\nthe maximum energy in supernova remnants comes from the need for effective wave\nexcitation upstream so as to confine particles in the near-shock region and\nspeed up the acceleration process, at the termination shock of star clusters\nthe confinement of particles upstream in guaranteed by the geometry of the\nproblem. We develop a theory of diffusive shock acceleration at such shock and\nwe find that the maximum energy may reach the PeV region for powerful clusters\nin the high end of the luminosity tail for these sources. A crucial role in\nthis problem is played by the dissipation of energy in the wind to magnetic\nperturbations. Under reasonable conditions the spectrum of the accelerated\nparticles has a power law shape with a slope $4\\div 4.3$, in agreement with\nwhat is required based upon standard models of cosmic ray transport in the\nGalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

To this end, we build the connection of DNN and continuity\nequation where the measure is conserved to model the forward propagation\nprocess of DNN which has not been addressed before. DNN learns the\ntransformation of the input distribution to the output one. However, in the\nmeasure space, there are infinite curves connecting two distributions. Which\none can lead to good optimization and generaliztion for DNN? By diving the\noptimal transport theory, we find DNN with weight decay attempts to learn the\ngeodesic curve in the Wasserstein space, which is induced by the optimal\ntransport map. Compared with plain network, ResNet is a better approximation to\nthe geodesic curve, which explains why ResNet can be optimized and generalize\nbetter. Numerical experiments show that the data tracks of both plain network\nand ResNet tend to be line-shape in term of line-shape score (LSS), and the map\nlearned by ResNet is closer to the optimal transport map in term of optimal\ntransport score (OTS). In a word, we conclude a mathematical principle of deep\nlearning is to learn the geodesic curve in the Wasserstein space; and deep\nlearning is a great engineering realization of continuous transformation in\nhigh-dimensional space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 09:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 01:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

Manually detecting and replacing deprecated APIs is a tedious and\ntime-consuming task due to the large number of API calls used in the projects.\nMoreover, the lack of proper documentation for these deprecated APIs makes the\ntask challenging. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm and a tool\nAPIScanner that automatically detects deprecated APIs in Python libraries.

Thus, it may fail to infer the next preferred item if conceptually\nsimilar items are not dominant in recent interactions. To this end, an\nalternative solution is to represent each user with multiple embedding vectors\nencoding different aspects of the user's intentions. Nevertheless, recent work\non multi-interest embedding usually considers a small number of concepts\ndiscovered via clustering, which may not be comparable to the large pool of\nitem categories in real systems.

Therefore, pretrained language models (PLMs), like BERT and RoBERTa,\nmay substantially contribute to the recommendation quality. However, it's\nextremely challenging to have news recommenders trained together with such big\nmodels: the learning of news recommenders requires intensive news encoding\noperations, whose cost is prohibitive if PLMs are used as the news encoder. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, {SpeedyFeed}, which efficiently\ntrains PLMs-based news recommenders of superior quality. SpeedyFeed is\nhighlighted for its light-weighted encoding pipeline, which gives rise to three\nmajor advantages. Firstly, it makes the intermedia results fully reusable for\nthe training workflow, which removes most of the repetitive but redundant\nencoding operations. Secondly, it improves the data efficiency of the training\nworkflow, where non-informative data can be eliminated from encoding. Thirdly,\nit further saves the cost by leveraging simplified news encoding and compact\nnews representation.

It aims to model the dynamic preferences of users from their\nhistorical interactions and predict their next items. The accumulated user\nbehavior records on real systems could be very long. This rich data brings\nopportunities to track actual interests of users. Prior efforts mainly focus on\nmaking recommendations based on relatively recent behaviors. However, the\noverall sequential data may not be effectively utilized, as early interactions\nmight affect users' current choices. Also, it has become intolerable to scan\nthe entire behavior sequence when performing inference for each user, since\nreal-world system requires short response time. To bridge the gap, we propose a\nnovel long sequential recommendation model, called Dynamic Memory-based\nAttention Network (DMAN). It segments the overall long behavior sequence into a\nseries of sub-sequences, then trains the model and maintains a set of memory\nblocks to preserve long-term interests of users. To improve memory fidelity,\nDMAN dynamically abstracts each user's long-term interest into its own memory\nblocks by minimizing an auxiliary reconstruction loss. Based on the dynamic\nmemory, the user's short-term and long-term interests can be explicitly\nextracted and combined for efficient joint recommendation. Empirical results\nover four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model in\ncapturing long-term dependency over various state-of-the-art sequential models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 11:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

Without\nquery from user, it is challenging for system to match user traffic and ads\nsuitably. System packs up a group of users with common properties such as the\nsame gender or similar shopping interests into a crowd. Here term crowd can be\nviewed as a tag over users. Then advertisers bid for different crowds and\ndeliver their ads to those targeted users. Matching module in most industrial\ndisplay advertising systems follows a two-stage paradigm. When receiving a user\nrequest, matching system (i) finds the crowds that the user belongs to; (ii)\nretrieves all ads that have targeted those crowds. However, in applications\nsuch as display advertising at Alibaba, with very large volumes of crowds and\nads, both stages of matching have to truncate the long-tailed parts for online\nserving, under limited latency. That's to say, not all ads have the chance to\nparticipate in online matching. This results in sub-optimal result for both\nadvertising performance and platform revenue. In this paper, we study the\ntruncation problem and propose a Truncation Free Matching System (TFMS). The\nbasic idea is to decouple the matching computation from the online pipeline.\nInstead of executing the two-stage matching when user visits, TFMS utilizes a\nnear-line truncation-free matching to pre-calculate and store those top\nvaluable ads for each user. Then the online pipeline just needs to fetch the\npre-stored ads as matching results. In this way, we can jump out of online\nsystem's latency and computation cost limitations, and leverage flexible\ncomputation resource to finish the user-ad matching. TFMS has been deployed in\nour productive system since 2019, bringing (i) more than 50% improvement of\nimpressions for advertisers who encountered truncation before, (ii) 9.4%\nRevenue Per Mile gain, which is significant enough for the business.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 12:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

They offer significant advantages\ncompared to standard cameras due to their high temporal resolution, high\ndynamic range and lack of motion blur. However, events only measure the varying\ncomponent of the visual signal, which limits their ability to encode scene\ncontext. By contrast, standard cameras measure absolute intensity frames, which\ncapture a much richer representation of the scene. Both sensors are thus\ncomplementary. However, due to the asynchronous nature of events, combining\nthem with synchronous images remains challenging, especially for learning-based\nmethods. This is because traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not\ndesigned for asynchronous and irregular data from additional sensors. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Recurrent Asynchronous Multimodal (RAM)\nnetworks, which generalize traditional RNNs to handle asynchronous and\nirregular data from multiple sensors. Inspired by traditional RNNs, RAM\nnetworks maintain a hidden state that is updated asynchronously and can be\nqueried at any time to generate a prediction.

This behavior penalizes the performance of a CNN for the\nre-identification task, since it should identify diverse and fine grained\nfeatures. It is then essential to make the network learn a wide variety of\nfiner characteristics in order to make the re-identification process of people\neffective and robust to finer changes. In this article, we introduce Deep\nMiner, a method that allows CNNs to \"mine\" richer and more diverse features\nabout people for their re-identification. Deep Miner is specifically composed\nof three types of branches: a Global branch (G-branch), a Local branch\n(L-branch) and an Input-Erased branch (IE-branch). G-branch corresponds to the\ninitial backbone which predicts global characteristics, while L-branch\nretrieves part level resolution features. The IE-branch for its part, receives\npartially suppressed feature maps as input thereby allowing the network to\n\"mine\" new features (those ignored by G-branch) as output. For this special\npurpose, a dedicated suppression procedure for identifying and removing\nfeatures within a given CNN is introduced. This suppression procedure has the\nmajor benefit of being simple, while it produces a model that significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) re-identification methods. Specifically, we\nconduct experiments on four standard person re-identification benchmarks and\nwitness an absolute performance gain up to 6.5% mAP compared to SOTA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 13:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

The purpose of kernel learning\nis to learn an appropriate RKHS according to different machine learning\nscenarios and training samples. Because RKHS is uniquely generated by the\nkernel function, kernel learning can be regarded as kernel function learning.\nThis paper proposes a Domain Adaptive Learning method based on Sample-Dependent\nand Learnable Kernels (SDLK-DAL). The first contribution of our work is to\npropose a sample-dependent and learnable Positive Definite Quadratic Kernel\nfunction (PDQK) framework. Unlike learning the exponential parameter of\nGaussian kernel function or the coefficient of kernel combinations, the\nproposed PDQK is a positive definite quadratic function, in which the symmetric\npositive semi-definite matrix is the learnable part in machine learning\napplications.

Currently there is a gap in the space of available\npartitioning algorithms. On the one hand, there are streaming algorithms that\nhave been adopted to partition massive graph data on small machines. In the\nstreaming model, vertices arrive one at a time including their neighborhood and\nthen have to be assigned directly to a block. These algorithms can partition\nhuge graphs quickly with little memory, but they produce partitions with low\nsolution quality. On the other hand, there are offline (shared-memory)\nmultilevel algorithms that produce partitions with high quality but also need a\nmachine with enough memory. We make a first step to close this gap by\npresenting an algorithm that computes significantly improved partitions of huge\ngraphs using a single machine with little memory in streaming setting. First,\nwe adopt the buffered streaming model which is a more reasonable approach in\npractice. In this model, a processing element can store a buffer, or batch, of\nnodes before making assignment decisions. When our algorithm receives a batch\nof nodes, we build a model graph that represents the nodes of the batch and the\nalready present partition structure. This model enables us to apply multilevel\nalgorithms and in turn compute much higher quality solutions of huge graphs on\ncheap machines than previously possible. To partition the model, we develop a\nmultilevel algorithm that optimizes an objective function that has previously\nshown to be effective for the streaming setting. This also removes the\ndependency on the number of blocks k from the running time compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art. Overall, our algorithm computes, on average, 75.9%\nbetter solutions than Fennel using a very small buffer size. In addition, for\nlarge values of k our algorithm becomes faster than Fennel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 11:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to\ninformation retrieval tools. In this paper, we present a novel approach to\ndocument structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process\nthe low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual\nre-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous\nliterature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used\nas input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each\nprinting command according to its structural function in the page. This\napproach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more\nfine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual\nmethods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure\nresolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more\nnaturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing\ncommands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and\nit is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to\ndeploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through\nextensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature\nengineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average\nF1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels.

The use of (deterministic) time-local algorithms in a distributed\nsetting automatically leads to globally consistent decisions.\n  Our key observation is that time-local online algorithms (in which the output\nat a given time only depends on local inputs in the temporal dimension) are\nclosely connected to local distributed graph algorithms (in which the output of\na given node only depends on local inputs in the spatial dimension).

In\nthis paper, the Paper I of the PAST series, we revisit the kinematic method for\nclassification of Galactic components and extend the applicable range of\nvelocity ellipsoid from about 100 pc to 1, 500 pc from the sun in order to\ncover most known planet hosts. Furthermore, we revisit the Age-Velocity\ndispersion Relation (AVR), which allows us to derive kinematic age with a\ntypical uncertainty of 10-20% for an ensemble of stars. Applying the above\nrevised methods, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e. Galactic\npositions, velocities, the relative membership probabilities among the thin\ndisk, thick disk, Hercules stream, and the halo) as well as other basic stellar\nparameters for 2,174 host stars of 2,872 planets by combining data from Gaia,\nLAMOST, APOGEE, RAVE, and the NASA exoplanet archive. The revised kinematic\nmethod and AVR as well as the stellar catalog of kinematic properties and ages\nlay foundation for future studies on exoplanets from two dimensions of space\nand time in the Galactic context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 02:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Furthermore, a tensor\nprocessing unit based on 4x4 mesh with 1.2 TOPS (operation per second when 100%\nutilization) computing capability at 20G baud rate is proposed and analyzed to\nform a paralleled photonic CNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 04:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

However, little\nattention has been paid to the description of the dynamical development of each\nindividual networked unit in the process towards the synchronization of the\nwhole ensemble. In this paper, we show how in a network of identical dynamical\nsystems, nodes belonging to the same degree class differentiate in the same\nmanner visiting a sequence of states of diverse complexity along the route to\nsynchronization independently on the global network structure. In particular,\nwe observe, just after interaction starts pulling orbits from the initially\nuncoupled attractor, a general reduction of the complexity of the dynamics of\nall units being more pronounced in those with higher connectivity. In the weak\ncoupling regime, when synchronization starts to build up, there is an increase\nin the dynamical complexity whose maximum is achieved, in general, first in the\nhubs due to their earlier synchronization with the mean field. For very strong\ncoupling, just before complete synchronization, we found a hierarchical\ndynamical differentiation with lower degree nodes being the ones exhibiting the\nlargest complexity departure. We unveil how this differentiation route holds\nfor several models of nonlinear dynamics including toroidal chaos and how it\ndepends on the coupling function.

During this decennium, in several experiments, the electromagnetic\ninduction was there, but it was not seen or recognized. Faraday built up a\nlocal theory of electromagnetic induction based on the idea that there is an\ninduced current when there is an intersection between lines of magnetic force\nand a conductor in relative motion. In 1873, Maxwell, within a Lagrangian\ndescription of electric currents, wrote down a 'general law of electromagnetic\ninduction' in which a fundamental role is played by the vector potential. A\nmodern reformulation of Maxwell's general law is based on the definition of the\ninduced emf as the line integral of the Lorentz force on a unit positive charge\nand the use of the equation that relates the electric field to the potentials.\nMaxwell's general law has been rapidly forgotten; instead, the \"flux rule\" has\ndeeply taken root. The \"flux rule\" not always yields the correct prediction, it\ndoes not say where the induced emf is localized, it requires ad hoc choices of\nthe integration paths. It is not a physical law but only a calculation tool. To\nunderstand why Maxwell's `general law' has been forgotten, also a sample of\nrepresentative textbooks, distributed over about a century, has been analyzed.\nIn this framework, a part of the paper deals with the idea of rotating lines of\nmagnetic force, falsified by Faraday, but common in the first decades of the\nTwentieth century and astonishingly resumed recently. It is shown that this\nhypothesis is incompatible with Maxwell - Lorentz - Einstein electromagnetism\nand that it is falsified also by recent experiments.

However, unlike\nplasmonics-based nanophotonic devices, which are typically built using a very\nlimited number of low loss optical materials, the newly found class of surface\nwaves may be supported by a much broader range of lossy media. Such materials\nas graphite seems to be ideal in UV nanophotonics applications.

However, since experiments\nare typically limited in duration, observed treatment effects are not always\npermanently stable, sometimes revealing increasing or decreasing patterns over\ntime. There are multiple causes for a treatment effect to change over time. In\nthis paper, we focus on a particular cause, user-learning, which is primarily\nassociated with novelty or primacy. Novelty describes the desire to use new\ntechnology that tends to diminish over time. Primacy describes the growing\nengagement with technology as a result of adoption of the innovation.\nUser-learning estimation is critical because it holds experimentation\nresponsible for trustworthiness, empowers organizations to make better\ndecisions by providing a long-term view of expected impact, and prevents user\ndissatisfaction.

We use\nthis approach to test and estimate user-learning in many experiments at\nMicrosoft.
