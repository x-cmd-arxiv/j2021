The\noriginal single file retrieval setting by Maddah-Ali and Niesen has been\nrecently extended to general Scalar Linear Function Retrieval (SLFR) by Wan et\nal., who proposed a linear scheme that surprisingly achieves the same optimal\nload (under the constraint of uncoded cache placement) as in single file\nretrieval. This paper's goal is to characterize the conditions under which a\ngeneral SLFR linear scheme is optimal and gain practical insights into why the\nspecific choices made by Wan et al. work. This paper shows that the optimal\ndecoding coefficients are necessarily the product of two terms, one only\ninvolving the encoding coefficients and the other only the demands. In\naddition, the relationships among the encoding coefficients are shown to be\ncaptured by the cycles of certain graphs. Thus, a general linear scheme for\nSLFR can be found by solving a spanning tree problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Although typically being computationally\nefficient, and readily scaling with respect to the number of analyses being\nunified, approximate approaches can have significant shortcomings -- the\nquality of the inference can degrade rapidly with the number of analyses being\nunified, and can be substantially biased even when unifying a small number of\nanalyses that do not concur. In contrast, the recent Fusion approach of Dai et\nal. (2019) is a rejection sampling scheme which is readily parallelisable and\nis exact (avoiding any form of approximation other than Monte Carlo error),\nalbeit limited in applicability to unifying a small number of low-dimensional\nanalyses. In this paper we introduce a practical Bayesian Fusion approach. We\nextend the theory underpinning the Fusion methodology and, by embedding it\nwithin a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we are able to recover the correct\ntarget distribution. By means of extensive guidance on the implementation of\nthe approach, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that Bayesian Fusion\nis robust to increasing numbers of analyses, and coherently unifying analyses\nwhich do not concur. This is achieved while being computationally competitive\nwith approximate schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 16:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Previous adversarial example generation algorithms\nfor adversarial white-box attacks used Jacobian gradient information to add\nperturbations. This information is too imprecise and inexplicit, which will\ncause unnecessary perturbations when generating adversarial examples. This\npaper aims to address this issue. We first propose to apply a more informative\nand distilled gradient information, namely integrated gradient, to generate\nadversarial examples. To further make the perturbations more imperceptible, we\npropose to employ the restriction combination of $L_0$ and $L_1/L_2$ secondly,\nwhich can restrict the total perturbations and perturbation points\nsimultaneously. Meanwhile, to address the non-differentiable problem of $L_1$,\nwe explore a proximal operation of $L_1$ thirdly.

IFPA is suitable for situations\nwhere there are a determined number of points to be perturbed. IUA is suitable\nfor situations where no perturbation point number is preset in order to obtain\nmore adversarial examples. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms on both structured and unstructured datasets, and we compare them\nwith five baseline generation algorithms.

It is found that the oscillatory part of the measured\nmagnetic torque signal consists of low frequency (LF) contributions\n(frequencies up to 1000 T) and high frequency (HF) contributions (several\nclusters of frequencies from 7-22 kT). Increased resolution and angle-resolved\nmeasurements allow us to show that the high oscillation frequencies originate\nfrom magnetic breakdown (MB) orbits involving clusters of individual $\\alpha$\nhole and $\\beta$ electron pockets from the diamond shaped FS in the Z-R-A\nplane.

One drawback however is\nthe high computational complexity and high memory consumption of CNNs which\nmakes them unfeasible for execution on embedded platforms which are constrained\non physical resources needed to support CNNs. Quantization has often been used\nto efficiently optimize CNNs for memory and computational complexity at the\ncost of a loss of prediction accuracy. We therefore propose a method to\noptimally quantize the weights, biases and activations of each layer of a\npre-trained CNN while controlling the loss in inference accuracy to enable\nquantized inference. We quantize the 32-bit floating-point precision parameters\nto low bitwidth fixed-point representations thereby finding optimal bitwidths\nand fractional offsets for parameters of each layer of a given CNN. We quantize\nparameters of a CNN post-training without re-training it. Our method is\ndesigned to quantize parameters of a CNN taking into account how other\nparameters are quantized because ignoring quantization errors due to other\nquantized parameters leads to a low precision CNN with accuracy losses of up to\n50% which is far beyond what is acceptable. Our final method therefore gives a\nlow precision CNN with accuracy losses of less than 1%. As compared to a method\nused by commercial tools that quantize all parameters to 8-bits, our approach\nprovides quantized CNN with averages of 53% lower memory consumption and 77.5%\nlower cost of executing multiplications for the two CNNs trained on the four\ndatasets that we tested our work on. We find that layer-wise quantization of\nparameters significantly helps in this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 17:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

The sample spans a stellar mass range of 8.3 $\\leq$ log (M$_*$ /\nM$_\\odot$) $\\leq$ 11.16, and a variety of morphological types.

This implies that a relatively large fraction of the\nmetals in these Fornax systems is locked up in dust, which is possibly due to\naltered chemical evolution as a result of the dense environment. The low ratios\nare not only driven by HI deficiencies, but H$_2$-to-dust ratios are also\nsignificantly decreased.

Those systems\nhave demonstrated to be very efficient in the hydrodynamic generation of\ntopological excitations, such as vortex-antivortex pairs or dark solitons.\nHowever, the lifetime and motion of those excitations were limited by the\ndriven dissipative nature of the system. In this thesis, we present a rich\nvariety of results about the generation and control of such topological\nexcitations. Taking advantage of the optical bistability present in our system,\nwe were able to greatly enhanced the propagation length of vortices and\nsolitons generated in the wake of a structural defect, revealing in the mean\ntime an unexpected binding mechanism of the solitons which propagate parallel.\nThis behaviour was recovered in a specifically designed experiment, where we\nartificially imprint dark soliton pairs on demand on a polariton superfluid.\nThe adaptability of our technique allowed for a detailed study of this\nphenomenon, that we directly connected to the driven-dissipative nature of our\nsystem. Finally, confined dark solitons were generated within guided intensity\nchannels on a static polariton fluid. The absence of flow lead to the\ndevelopment of transverse snake instabilities of which we studied the\ninteresting properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 17:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

A major challenge in the theoretical\ndescription of these effects, which makes the application of standard methods\nvery difficult, is the fact that orientable particles have both translational\nand orientational degrees of freedom which do not necessarily relax on the same\ntime scale. In this work, we derive the general mathematical form of a field\ntheory for soft matter systems with two different time scales. This allows to\nobtain a phase field crystal model for polar (i.e., nonspherical or active)\nparticles with translational and orientational memory. Notably, this theory is\nof third order in temporal derivatives and can thus be seen as a spatiotemporal\njerky dynamics. We obtain the phase diagram of this model, which shows that,\nunlike in the passive case, the linear stability of the liquid state depends on\nthe damping coefficients. Moreover, we investigate sound waves in active\nmatter. It is found that, in active fluids, there are two different mechanisms\nfor sound propagation. For certain parameter values and sufficiently high\nfrequencies, sound mediated by polarization waves experiences less damping than\nusual passive sound mediated by pressure waves of the same frequency. By\ncombining the different modes, acoustic frequency filters based on active\nfluids could be realized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 17:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

We find excellent\nagreement between the calculated and the measured spin-orbit excitations.\nContrary to the expectations, the analysis of the many-body wave function shows\nthat the two Ir (Ir$^{4+}$ and Ir$^{5+}$) ions in the Ir$_2$O$_9$ dimer unit in\nthis compound preserve their local J$_{\\rm eff}$ character close to 1/2 and 0,\nrespectively. The local point group symmetry at each of the Ir sites assumes an\nimportant role, significantly limiting the direct $d$--$d$ hybridisation. Our\nresults emphasize that minute details in the local crystal field (CF)\nenvironment can lead to dramatic differences in electronic states in iridates\nand 5$d$ oxides in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 18:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Due to the multiscale nature of neutrino\ntransport in CCSN simulations, an implicit treatment of neutrino-matter\ninteractions is desired, which requires solutions of coupled nonlinear systems\nin each step of the time integration scheme. In this paper we design and\ncompare nonlinear iterative solvers for implicit systems with energy coupling\nneutrino-matter interactions commonly used in CCSN simulations. Specifically,\nwe consider electron neutrinos and antineutrinos, which interact with static\nmatter configurations through the Bruenn~85 opacity set. The implicit systems\narise from the discretization of a non-relativistic two-moment model for\nneutrino transport, which employs the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for\nphase-space discretization and an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration\nscheme. In the context of this DG-IMEX scheme, we propose two approaches to\nformulate the nonlinear systems -- a coupled approach and a nested approach.\nFor each approach, the resulting systems are solved with Anderson-accelerated\nfixed-point iteration and Newton's method. The performance of these four\niterative solvers has been compared on relaxation problems with various degree\nof collisionality, as well as proto-neutron star deleptonization problems with\nseveral matter profiles adopted from spherically symmetric CCSN simulations.\nNumerical results suggest that the nested Anderson-accelerated fixed-point\nsolver is more efficient than other tested solvers for solving implicit\nnonlinear systems with energy coupling neutrino-matter interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 18:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

It\nis known that even for $t=1$, a CountSketch allows estimating coordinates of\n$v$ with variance bounded by $\\|v\\|_2^2/s$. For $t > 1$, the estimator takes\nthe median of $2t-1$ independent estimates, and the probability that the\nestimate is off by more than $2 \\|v\\|_2/\\sqrt{s}$ is exponentially small in\n$t$. This suggests choosing $t$ to be logarithmic in a desired inverse failure\nprobability. However, implementations of CountSketch often use a small,\nconstant $t$.

However, the well-known Forster rate expression that predicts an\n$R^{-6}$ dependence, is limited by several approximations. Notable among them\nis the neglect of the vibronic relaxation in the reactant (donor) and product\n(acceptor) manifolds. Vibronic relaxation can play an important role when the\nenergy transfer rate is faster than the vibronic relaxation rate. Under such\nconditions, donor to acceptor energy transfer can occur from the excited\nvibronic states. This phenomenon is not captured by the usual formulation based\non the overlap of donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra.

Rather than\nrelying solely on examples of task inputs and outputs, these approaches use\nvaluable additional data for improving model correctness and aligning learned\nmodels with human priors. Meanwhile, a growing body of evidence suggests that\nsome language models can (1) store a large amount of knowledge in their\nparameters, and (2) perform inference over tasks in textual inputs at test\ntime.

However, the principles governing relations between\nenvironmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of\nintelligent control, remain elusive, partially due to the substantial challenge\nof performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning. We\nintroduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a novel\ncomputational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn\nchallenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments using\nonly low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate\nseveral relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence\nand the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the\nevolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a\nmorphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, evolution rapidly\nselects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late\nin the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of\ntheir descendants. In agents that learn and evolve in complex environments,\nthis result constitutes the first demonstration of a long-conjectured\nmorphological Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic\nbasis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of morphological\nintelligence through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically\nstable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 18:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The paths followed by the known extreme trans-Neptunian objects\n(ETNOs) effectively avoid direct gravitational perturbations from the four\ngiant planets, yet their orbital eccentricities are in the range between\n0.69-0.97. Solar system dynamics studies show that such high values of the\neccentricity can be produced via close encounters or secular perturbations. In\nboth cases, the presence of yet-to-be-discovered trans-Plutonian planets is\nrequired.\n  Aims. If the high eccentricities of the known ETNOs are the result of\nrelatively recent close encounters with putative planets, the mutual nodal\ndistances of sizeable groups of ETNOs with their assumed perturber may still be\nsmall enough to be identifiable geometrically. In order to confirm or reject\nthis possibility, we used Monte Carlo random search techniques.\n  Methods. Two arbitrary orbits may lead to close encounters when their mutual\nnodal distance is sufficiently small. We generated billions of random planetary\norbits with parameters within the relevant ranges and computed the mutual nodal\ndistances with a set of randomly generated orbits with parameters consistent\nwith those of the known ETNOs and their uncertainties. We monitored which\nplanetary orbits had the maximum number of potential close encounters with\nsynthetic ETNOs and we studied the resulting distributions.\n  Results. We provide narrow ranges for the orbital parameters of putative\nplanets that may have experienced orbit-changing encounters with known ETNOs.\n  Conclusions. Our calculations suggest that more than one perturber is\nrequired if scattering is the main source of orbital modification for the known\nETNOs. Perturbers might not be located farther than 600 AU and they have to\nfollow moderately eccentric and inclined orbits to be capable of experiencing\nclose encounters with multiple known ETNOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

To\nstudy these coefficients, we specialize to a theoretically and experimentally\nmotivated tight-binding model for a chiral magnetic metal in (magnetic) space\ngroup [(M)SG] P2$_1$3 (No. 198.9), a nonpolar group of recent experimental\ninterest that hosts both chiral magnets and topological semimetals (TSMs).\nUsing the Kubo formula for viscosity, we compute two forms of the Hall\nviscosity, phonon and ``momentum'' (conventional) and show that for the\ntight-binding model we consider, both forms realize the novel cubic Hall\nviscosity. We conclude by discussing the implication of our results for\ntransport in 2D magnetic metals and discuss some candidate materials in which\nthese effects may be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 19:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 19:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

Recently, the detection of gamma-ray emission has been\nreported toward the Coma cluster with Fermi-LAT. Assuming that this gamma-ray\nemission arises from hadronic interactions in the ICM, we aim at exploring the\nimplication of this signal on the cosmic ray content of the Coma cluster. We\nuse the MINOT software to build a physical model of the cluster and apply it to\nthe Fermi-LAT data. We also consider contamination from compact sources and the\nimpact of various systematic effects. We confirm that a significant gamma-ray\nsignal is observed within the characteristic radius $\\theta_{500}$ of the Coma\ncluster, with a test statistic TS~27 for our baseline model. The presence of a\npossible point source may account for most of the observed signal. However,\nthis source could also correspond to the peak of the diffuse emission of the\ncluster itself and extended models match the data better. We constrain the\ncosmic ray to thermal energy ratio within $R_{500}$ to $X_{\\rm\nCRp}=1.79^{+1.11}_{-0.30}$\\% and the slope of the energy spectrum of cosmic\nrays to $\\alpha=2.80^{+0.67}_{-0.13}$. Finally, we compute the synchrotron\nemission associated with the secondary electrons produced in hadronic\ninteractions assuming steady state. This emission is about four times lower\nthan the overall observed radio signal, so that primary cosmic ray electrons or\nreacceleration of secondary electrons is necessary to explain the total\nemission. Assuming an hadronic origin of the signal, our results provide the\nfirst quantitative measurement of the cosmic ray proton content in a\ncluster.[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 19:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Now, after three and a half decades of research,\ninvolving a wide range of experimental characterizations, it is possible to\ndelineate a clear and consistent cuprate story. It starts with doping holes\ninto a charge-transfer insulator, resulting in in-gap states. These states\nexhibit a pseudogap resulting from the competition between antiferromagnetic\nsuperexchange $J$ between nearest-neighbor Cu atoms (a real-space interaction)\nand the kinetic energy of the doped holes, which, in the absence of\ninteractions, would lead to extended Bloch-wave states whose occupancy is\ncharacterized in reciprocal space. To develop some degree of coherence on\ncooling, the spin and charge correlations must self-organize in a cooperative\nfashion. A specific example of resulting emergent order is that of spin and\ncharge stripes, as observed in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$. While stripe order\nfrustrates bulk superconductivity, it nevertheless develops pairing and\nsuperconducting order of an unusual character. The antiphase order of the spin\nstripes decouples them from the charge stripes, which can be viewed as\nhole-doped, two-leg, spin-$\\frac12$ ladders. To achieve superconducting order,\nthe pair correlations in neighboring ladders must develop phase order. In the\npresence of spin stripe order, antiphase Josephson coupling can lead to\npair-density-wave superconductivity. Alternatively, in-phase superconductivity\nrequires that the spin stripes have an energy gap, which empirically limits the\ncoherent superconducting gap. Hence, superconducting order in the cuprates\ninvolves a compromise between the pairing scale, which is maximized at\n$x\\sim\\frac18$, and phase coherence, which is optimized at $x\\sim0.2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 19:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 01:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

Using 50 real mutualistic networks, we show that\nwhen the relative importance of shared partners is incorporated via weighted\ncompetition, the feasibility area in the parameter space is highly correlated\nwith May's stability criteria and can be predicted by a functional relationship\nbetween the number of species, the network connectance and the average\ninteraction strength in the community. Our work reopens a decade-long debate\nabout the complexity-stability relationship in ecological communities, and\nhighlights the role of the relative structures of different interaction types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 19:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

The level of contamination\ncaused by these systematics is often linked to the scan strategy, and scan\nstrategies for satellite experiments can significantly mitigate these\nsystematics. However, no detailed study has been performed for ground-based\nexperiments. Here we show that under the assumption of constant elevation scans\n(CESs), the ability of the scan strategy to mitigate these systematics is\nstrongly limited, irrespective of the detailed structure of the scan strategy.\nWe calculate typical values and maps of the quantities coupling the scan to the\nsystematics, and show how these quantities vary with the choice of observing\nelevations.

Although randomization balances covariates within subgroups in\nexpectation, chance imbalance may be amplified in small subgroups and harm the\nprecision. Covariate adjustment in overall analysis of RCT is often conducted,\nvia either ANCOVA or propensity score weighting, but for subgroup analysis has\nbeen rarely discussed. In this article, we develop propensity score weighting\nmethodology for covariate adjustment to improve the precision and power of\nsubgroup analyses in RCTs. Methods: We extend the propensity score weighting\nmethodology to subgroup analyses by fitting a logistic propensity model with\npre-specified covariate-subgroup interactions. We show that, by construction,\noverlap weighting exactly balances the covariates with interaction terms in\neach subgroup. Extensive simulations were performed to compare the operating\ncharacteristics of unadjusted, different propensity score weighting and the\nANCOVA estimator. We apply these methods to the HF-ACTION trial to evaluate the\neffect of exercise training on 6-minute walk test in pre-specified subgroups.\nResults: Standard errors of the adjusted estimators are smaller than those of\nthe unadjusted estimator. The propensity score weighting estimator is as\nefficient as ANCOVA, and is often more efficient when subgroup sample size is\nsmall (e.g.<125), and/or when outcome model is misspecified. The weighting\nestimators with full-interaction propensity model consistently outperform the\nstandard main-effect propensity model. Conclusion: Propensity score weighting\nis a transparent and objective method to adjust chance imbalance of important\ncovariates in subgroup analyses of RCTs. It is crucial to include the full\ncovariate-subgroup interactions in the propensity score model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 20:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 14:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

The mobility pattern is associated to a\ncomplex network in which nodes represent blocks while the links represent the\ntraveling path of the individuals. We implemented three confinement strategies\nin order to mitigate the disease spreading: 1) global confinement, 2) partial\nrestriction to mobility, and 3) localized confinement. In the first case, it\nwas observed that a global isolation policy prevents the massive outbreak of\nthe disease. In the second case, a partial restriction to mobility could lead\nto a massive contagion if this was not complemented with sanitary measures such\nas the use of masks and social distancing. Finally, a local isolation policy\nwas proposed, conditioned to the health status of each block. It was observed\nthat this mitigation strategy was able to contain and even reduce the outbreak\nof the disease by intervening in specific regions of the city according to\ntheir level of contagion.

This creates a conceptual and\ncomputational overhead. Simple, classic unsupervised approaches like\nMultidimensional Scaling (MSD) or the Laplacian eigenmap skip the necessity of\ntedious objective optimization, directly exploiting data geometry.\nUnfortunately, their reliance on very costly operations such as matrix\neigendecomposition make them unable to scale to large graphs that are common in\ntoday's digital world. In this paper we present Cleora: an algorithm which gets\nthe best of two worlds, being both unsupervised and highly scalable. We show\nthat high quality embeddings can be produced without the popular step-wise\nlearning framework with example sampling. An intuitive learning objective of\nour algorithm is that a node should be similar to its neighbors, without\nexplicitly pushing disconnected nodes apart. The objective is achieved by\niterative weighted averaging of node neigbors' embeddings, followed by\nnormalization across dimensions. Thanks to the averaging operation the\nalgorithm makes rapid strides across the embedding space and usually reaches\noptimal embeddings in just a few iterations. Cleora runs faster than other\nstate-of-the-art CPU algorithms and produces embeddings of competitive quality\nas measured on downstream tasks: link prediction and node classification.

We also find that using the cosmic variance error calculated\nwith Monte-Carlo simulations using the fiducial model parameters whilst\nassuming the late-reionization model for the simulated data also does not\nstrongly bias the inference. This implies we may be able to sparsely sample and\ninterpolate the cosmic variance error over the parameter space, substantially\nreducing computational costs.

This inspired dozens of variations of his\ndefinition of actual causation, the most prominent of which are due to Halpern\n& Pearl.

Many\npast researches focused on homogeneous heat transfer of He II in a uniform\nchannel driven by a planar heater. In this paper, we report our systematic\nstudy of He II transient heat transfer in nonhomogeneous geometries that are\npertinent to emergent applications. By solving the He II two-fluid equation of\nmotion coupled with the Vinen's equation for vortex-density evolution, we\nexamine and compare the characteristics of transient heat transfer from planar,\ncylindrical, and spherical heaters in He II. Our results show that as the\nheater turns on, an outgoing second-sound pulse emerges, in which the vortex\ndensity grows rapidly. These vortices attenuate the second sound and result in\na heated He II layer in front of the heater, i.e., the thermal layer. In the\nplanar case where the vortices are created throughout the space, the\nsecond-sound pulse is continuously attenuated, leading to a strong thermal\nlayer that diffusively spreads following the heat pulse. On the contrary, in\nthe cylindrical and the spherical heater cases, vortices are created mainly in\na thin thermal layer near the heater surface. As the heat pulse ends, a\nrarefaction tail develops following the second-sound pulse, in which the\ntemperature drops. This rarefaction tail can promptly suppress the thermal\nlayer and take away all the thermal energy deposited in it. The effects of the\nheater size, heat flux, pulse duration, and temperature on the thermal-layer\ndynamics are discussed. We also show how the peak heat flux for the onset of\nboiling in He II can be studied in our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 22:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

A particular challenge for an\nautonomous vehicle is that of identifying a target trajectory - or, in the case\nof a competition vehicle, the racing line. Many existing approaches to finding\nthe racing line are either not time-optimal solutions, or are computationally\nexpensive - rendering them unsuitable for real-time application using on-board\nprocessing hardware. This study describes a machine learning approach to\ngenerating an accurate prediction of the racing line in real-time on desktop\nprocessing hardware. The proposed algorithm is a feed-forward neural network,\ntrained using a dataset comprising racing lines for a large number of circuits\ncalculated via traditional optimal control lap time simulation. The network\npredicts the racing line with a mean absolute error of +/-0.27m, and just\n+/-0.11m at corner apex - comparable to human drivers, and autonomous vehicle\ncontrol subsystems. The approach generates predictions within 33ms, making it\nover 9,000 times faster than traditional methods of finding the optimal\ntrajectory.

Datasets\nare critical for benchmarking progress in fair computer vision, and often\nemploy broad racial categories as population groups for measuring group\nfairness. Similarly, diversity is often measured in computer vision datasets by\nascribing and counting categorical race labels. However, racial categories are\nill-defined, unstable temporally and geographically, and have a problematic\nhistory of scientific use. Although the racial categories used across datasets\nare superficially similar, the complexity of human race perception suggests the\nracial system encoded by one dataset may be substantially inconsistent with\nanother. Using the insight that a classifier can learn the racial system\nencoded by a dataset, we conduct an empirical study of computer vision datasets\nsupplying categorical race labels for face images to determine the\ncross-dataset consistency and generalization of racial categories. We find that\neach dataset encodes a substantially unique racial system, despite nominally\nequivalent racial categories, and some racial categories are systemically less\nconsistent than others across datasets. We find evidence that racial categories\nencode stereotypes, and exclude ethnic groups from categories on the basis of\nnonconformity to stereotypes.

The\nlight-weighted model is good for improving the transcribing computing\nefficiency and also useful for mobile devices, Driverless Vehicles, etc. Our\nmodel weight is reduced to ~10% the size of DeepSpeech2, but our model accuracy\nremains close to that of DeepSpeech2. If combined with a Language Model, our\nLVCSR system is able to achieve 91.5% word accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 23:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

Our results further show the utility of the\nEuclidean-signature semi classical method towards tackling Lorentzian signature\nproblems without having to invoke a Wick rotation. This feature of not needing\nto apply a Wick rotation makes this method potentially very useful for tackling\na variety of problems in bosonic relativistic field theory and quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 23:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

As the largest coal producer, the mining industry in China\nhad to deal with many hazards induced by methane for decades. To solve this\nissue, underground methane extraction is commonly used in underground coal\nmines. However, underground methane extraction is hampered by low production\nrate and low efficiency because of slow gas emission from coal primarily\ncontrolled by gas desorption and permeability. It is well known that\ntemperature has a great impact on gas sorption. The higher the temperature the\nlarger the desorption rate. As the depth of coal mines increases beyond 1000m\ncoal mines suffer elevated air temperatures caused by the natural geothermal\ngradient. The elevated temperature in such mines provides a potential\neconomical way for geothermal energy extraction and utilization in deep coal\nmines which can largely cut the expenses of installation and operation\nmaintenance. Therefore, a novel method is proposed to enhance underground\nmethane extraction by deep heat stimulation. This paper mainly presents an\nassessment of previous and ongoing research in the related field and provides a\nfirst feasibility analysis of this method applied in the underground\nenvironment. The technique proposed in this early appraisal is deemed\nsignificant for coalbed methane drainage enhancing the productivity of deep\ncoal mines by geothermal technology and can also be extended for many\napplications in relevant areas such as shale gas, and tight oil.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 00:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

In this paper, we propose an automatic\ncharacter face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from\na single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games.\nAlthough 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D\nfaces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the\nmeshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods\nrequire a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such\ndatasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected\nunder laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations.\nTo tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition\nmethod, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM\nmesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction\nnetworks.

The band width of the covariance matrix is\nrelated to the width of the kernel. We find the presence of constant negative\nterms in the elements of the covariance matrix both on and off-diagonal. These\nnegative correlations are related to the fact that the total number of\nparticles is fixed at each time step.

These alloys,\nwhich are liquid at ambient conditions, have the largest interfacial tension of\nany liquid at room temperature. The ability to modulate the tension offers the\npossibility to create forces that change the shape and position of the metal.\nIt has been known since the late 1800s that electrocapillarity-the use of\npotential to modulate the electric double layer on the surface of metals in\nelectrolyte-lowers the interfacial tension of liquid metal. Yet, this\nphenomenon can only achieve modest changes in interfacial tension since it is\nlimited to potential windows that avoid reactions. A recent discovery suggests\nthat reactions driven by the electrochemical oxidation of gallium alloys cause\nthe interfacial tension to decrease from ~500 mN/m at 0 V to ~0 mN/m at ~0.8 V,\na change in tension that goes well beyond what is possible via conventional\nelectrocapillarity or surfactants. The changes in tension are reversible;\nreductive potentials return the metal back to a state of high interfacial\ntension. This report aims to summarize key work and introduce beginners to this\nfield by including electrochemistry basics while addressing misconceptions.

These research areas\nare highly relevant for the foundations of physics as well as the development\nof quantum technologies. In the first part, focussing on causality, we develop\ntechniques for using generalised entropies to analyse distinctions between\nclassical and non-classical causal structures. We derive new properties of\nTsallis entropies of systems that follow from the relevant causal structure,\nand apply these to obtain new necessary constraints for classicality in the\nTriangle causal structure. Supplementing the method with the post-selection\ntechnique, we provide evidence that Shannon and Tsallis entropic constraints\nare insufficient for detecting non-classicality in Bell scenarios with\nnon-binary outcomes. This points to the need for better methods of\ncharacterising correlations in non-classical causal structures. Further, we\ninvestigate the relationships between causality and space-time by developing a\nframework for modelling cyclic and fine-tuned influences in non-classical\ntheories. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such causal models\nto be compatible with a space-time structure and for ruling out operationally\ndetectable causal loops. In particular, this provides an operational framework\nfor analysing post-quantum theories admitting jamming non-local correlations.\nIn the second part, we investigate multi-agent logical paradoxes such as the\nFrauchiger-Renner paradox and develop a framework for analysing such paradoxes\nin arbitrary physical theories. Applying this to box world, a post-quantum\ntheory, we derive a stronger paradox that does not rely on post-selection.

Recent progress in structured\nnon-convex optimization has offered global convergence guarantees for gradient\ndescent under certain statistical assumptions on the low-rank matrix and the\nsampling set.

Beam alignment (BA) allows the base station (BS) to adjust the direction\nand width of the beam used for communication. During BA, the BS transmits a\nnumber of scanning beams covering different angular regions. The goal is to\nminimize the expected width of the uncertainty region (UR) that includes the\nangle of departure of the user. Conventionally, in interactive BA, it is\nassumed that the feedback corresponding to each scanning packet is received\nprior to transmission of the next one. However, in practice, the feedback delay\ncould be larger because of propagation or system constraints. This paper\ninvestigates BA strategies that operate under arbitrary fixed feedback delays.\nThis problem is analyzed through a source coding prospective where the feedback\nsequences are viewed as source codewords. It is shown that these codewords form\na codebook with a particular characteristic which is used to define a new class\nof codes called d-unimodal codes. By analyzing the properties of these codes, a\nlower bound on the minimum achievable expected beamwidth is provided. The\nresults reveal potential performance improvements in terms of the BA duration\nit takes to achieve a fixed expected width of the UR over the state-of-the-art\nBA methods which do not consider the effect of delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 05:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

Since the CSI is not available at the BS, we treat the\nunknown objective function as the black-box function and take the beamformer,\nthe phase shift, and the receiving filter as the input. Then the objective\nfunction is decomposed as the sum of low-dimension subfunctions to reduce the\ncomplexity.

The users estimate the sum MSE of the training symbols\nas the objective value and feed it back to the BS.

Query optimizers\nrely on a large range of statistical synopses -- including attribute-level\nhistograms and table-level samples -- for accurate cardinality estimation. As\nthe complexity of selection predicates and the number of join predicates\nincrease, two problems arise. First, statistics cannot be incrementally\ncomposed to effectively estimate the cost of the sub-plans generated in plan\nenumeration. Second, small errors are propagated exponentially through join\noperators, which can lead to severely sub-optimal plans. In this paper, we\nintroduce COMPASS, a novel query optimization paradigm for in-memory databases\nbased on a single type of statistics -- Fast-AGMS sketches. In COMPASS, query\noptimization and execution are intertwined. Selection predicates and sketch\nupdates are pushed-down and evaluated online during query optimization. This\nallows Fast-AGMS sketches to be computed only over the relevant tuples -- which\nenhances cardinality estimation accuracy. Plan enumeration is performed over\nthe query join graph by incrementally composing attribute-level sketches -- not\nby building a separate sketch for every sub-plan. We prototype COMPASS in MapD\n-- an open-source parallel database -- and perform extensive experiments over\nthe complete JOB benchmark. The results prove that COMPASS generates better\nexecution plans -- both in terms of cardinality and runtime -- compared to four\nother database systems. Overall, COMPASS achieves a speedup ranging from 1.35X\nto 11.28X in cumulative query execution time over the considered competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 06:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

We present this\napproach for three edge-on lenticular galaxies from the Fornax3D project -- FCC\n153, FCC 170, and FCC 177 -- in order to infer their mass assembly histories\nindividually and in the context of the Fornax cluster. The method was tested on\nmock data from simulations to quantify its reliability. We find that the\ngalaxies studied here have all been able to form dynamically-cold (intrinsic\nvertical velocity dispersion $\\sigma_z \\lesssim 50\\ {\\rm km}\\ {\\rm s}^{-1}$)\nstellar disks after cluster infall. Moreover, the pre-existing (old) high\nangular momentum components have retained their angular momentum (orbital\ncircularity $\\lambda_z > 0.8$) through to the present day. Comparing the\nderived assembly histories with a comparable galaxy in a low-density\nenvironment -- NGC 3115 -- we find evidence for cluster-driven suppression of\nstellar accretion and merging. We measured the intrinsic stellar\nage--velocity-dispersion relation and find that the shape of the relation is\nconsistent with galaxies in the literature across redshift. There is tentative\nevidence for enhancement in the luminosity-weighted intrinsic vertical velocity\ndispersion due to the cluster environment. But importantly, there is an\nindication that metallicity may be a key driver of this relation. We finally\nspeculate that the cluster environment is responsible for the S0 morphology of\nthese galaxies via the gradual external perturbations, or `harassment',\ngenerated within the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 07:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 02:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

However, most existing\nreward extrapolation methods require massive demonstrations, making it\ndifficult to be applied in tasks of limited training data.

In deployments of biometrics,\nsecure storage of biometric information is necessary in order to protect the\nusers' privacy. In this context, biometric cryptosystems are designed to meet\nkey requirements of biometric information protection enabling a\nprivacy-preserving storage and comparison of biometric data.\n  This work investigates the application of a well-known biometric\ncryptosystem, i.e. the improved fuzzy vault scheme, to facial feature vectors\nextracted through deep convolutional neural networks. To this end, a feature\ntransformation method is introduced which maps fixed-length real-valued deep\nfeature vectors to integer-valued feature sets. As part of said feature\ntransformation, a detailed analysis of different feature quantisation and\nbinarisation techniques is conducted. At key binding, obtained feature sets are\nlocked in an unlinkable improved fuzzy vault. For key retrieval, the efficiency\nof different polynomial reconstruction techniques is investigated. The proposed\nfeature transformation method and template protection scheme are agnostic of\nthe biometric characteristic. In experiments, an unlinkable improved deep face\nfuzzy vault-based template protection scheme is constructed employing features\nextracted with a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network trained\nwith the additive angular margin loss (ArcFace). For the best configuration, a\nfalse non-match rate below 1% at a false match rate of 0.01%, is achieved in\ncross-database experiments on the FERET and FRGCv2 face databases.

The uncontrollable amount of the work-roll deflection leads\nto the high deviations in the permissible thickness of the plate along its\nwidth. In the context of the Austenitic Stainless Steels (ASS), due to the\ninstability of the Austenite phase in a cold temperature, cold deformation\nleads to the production of Strain-Induced Martensite (SIM), which improves the\nmechanical properties. It leads to the hardening of the ASS 316L during the\ncold deformation, which causes the Strain-Stress curve of the ASS 316L to\nbehave non-linearly, which distinguishes it from other categories of steels. To\naccount for this phenomenon, we propose to utilize a Machine Learning (ML)\nmethod to predict more accurately the flow stress of the ASS 316L during the\ncold rolling. Furthermore, we conduct various mechanical tensile tests in order\nto obtain the required dataset, Stress316L, for training the neural network.\nMoreover, instead of using a constant value of flow stress during the\nmulti-pass rolling process, we use a Finite Difference (FD) formulation of the\nequilibrium equation in order to account for the dynamic behavior of the flow\nstress, which leads to the estimation of the mean pressure, which the strip\nenforces to the rolls during deformation. Finally, using the Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA), the deflection of the work-roll tools will be calculated. As a\nresult, we end up with a generalized model for the calculation of the roll\ndeflection, specific to the ASS 316L. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst model for ASS 316L which considers dynamic flow stress and SIM of the\nrolled plate, using FEM and an ML approach, which could contribute to the\nbetter design of the tolls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 08:13:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 12:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

A recent\nalternative that does not have this drawback relies on learning the target\nimage using internal learning. One such prominent example is the Deep Image\nPrior (DIP) technique that trains a network directly on the input image with a\nleast-squares loss. In this paper, we propose a new image restoration framework\nthat is based on minimizing a loss function that includes a \"projected-version\"\nof the Generalized SteinUnbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE) and parameterization of\nthe latent image by a CNN.

We support our findings with\ndetailed numerical calculations. Strong modification of the photon spectrum\nbelow the break energy due to the synchrotron emission of secondary pairs is\nfound, unless the bulk Lorentz factor is very large ($\\Gamma \\gtrsim 10^3$).\nMoreover, this scenario predicts unreasonably high Poynting luminosities\nbecause of the strong magnetic fields ($10^6-10^7$ G) that are necessary for\nthe incomplete proton cooling. Our results strongly disfavour marginally fast\ncooling protons as an explanation of the low-energy spectral break in the\nprompt GRB spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 09:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 10:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

We show that large\ndroplets only form when they break the surrounding matrix in a cavitation\nevent. The energy barrier associated with cavitation stabilizes small droplets\non the order of the mesh size and diminishes the stochastic effects of\nnucleation. Consequently, the cavitated droplets have similar sizes and highly\ncorrelated positions. In particular, we predict the density of cavitated\ndroplets, which increases with faster cooling, as in the experiments. Our model\nalso suggests how adjusting the cooling protocol and the density of nucleation\nsites affects the droplet size distribution.

The signature of such states inside Feynman diagrams in relation with\ntheir singularities is highlighted. The main mechanisms of formation of\ntetraquark states, provided by the diquark model and the molecular scheme, are\nconsidered together with their specific implications. The properties of\ntetraquark states at large $N_c$ are analyzed through the Feynman diagrams that\ndescribe two-meson scattering amplitudes. It turns out that, in that limit, the\npossible formation of tetraquark states is mainly due to the mutual\ninteractions of their internal mesonic clusters. These essentially arise from\nthe quark-rearrangement, or quark-interchange, mechanism. In coupled-channel\nmeson-meson scattering amplitudes, one may expect the occurrence of two\nindependent tetraquark states, each having priviledged couplings with the two\nmesons of their dominant channel.

A simple case of isolated isotopic defects is explored in\nmore detail. Contrary to the bulk conductivity in the linear chain, the Kapitza\nresistance is finite. However, the universal thermodynamic limit does not exist\nin this case. In other terms, the exact value of the resistance is not uniquely\ndefined and depends on the way of approaching the infinite lengths of the chain\nfragments. For this reason, and also due to the explicit dependence on the\nparameters of the thermostats, the resistance cannot be considered as a local\nproperty of the defect. Asymptotic scaling behavior of the heat flux in the\ncase of very heavy defect is explored and compared to the nonlinear\ncounterparts; similarities in the scaling behavior are revealed.

The latter\nare particularly relevant in winter and are responsible for the formation of\nenergetic small scales that extend over the whole depth of the mixed layer. The\nknowledge of the transport properties of oceanic flows at depth, which is\nessential to understand the coupling between surface and interior dynamics,\nhowever, is still limited.

We apply this\nmethod to a simple 2D model system where a test particle is placed on a plane\nand constrained by a random distribution of points with number density $\\nu$.\nTwo striking differences between wire frame and rod suspensions are found: 1)\nThe linear elasticity per particle for wire frames is very large, scaling like\n$\\nu^2 L^4$, whereas for rods it much smaller and independent of concentration.\n2) Rods always shear thin but wire frames shear harden for densities less than\n$\\sim \\sqrt{K/k_B T L^4}$, where $K$ is the bending modulus of the particles.\nThe deformation of wire frames is found to be important even for small strains,\nwith the proportion of deformed particles at a particular strain, $\\gamma$,\nbeing given by $(\\nu L^2)^2 \\gamma^2$. Our results agree well with a simple\nsimulation of the 2D system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 11:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

At test time they typically employ\nbeam search to avoid locally optimal but globally suboptimal predictions.\nHowever, due to model errors, a larger beam size can lead to deteriorating\nperformance according to the evaluation metric. For this reason, it is common\nto rerank the output of beam search, but this relies on beam search to produce\na good set of hypotheses, which limits the potential gains. Other alternatives\nto beam search require changes to the training of the model, which restricts\ntheir applicability compared to beam search. This paper proposes incremental\nbeam manipulation, i.e. reranking the hypotheses in the beam during decoding\ninstead of only at the end. This way, hypotheses that are unlikely to lead to a\ngood final output are discarded, and in their place hypotheses that would have\nbeen ignored will be considered instead. Applying incremental beam manipulation\nleads to an improvement of 1.93 and 5.82 BLEU points over vanilla beam search\nfor the test sets of the E2E and WebNLG challenges respectively.

The ECSN\nhas very unique light curves in broad bands, especially the U band, and does\nnot resemble any currently observed SN. This ECSN progenitor being part of a\nbinary will lose its envelope for which reason the light curve becomes short\nand undetectable. The SN from the 9.6 solar masses progenitor exhibits also\nquite an unusual light curve, explained by the absence of metals in the initial\ncomposition. The artificially iron polluted 9.6 solar masses model demonstrates\nlight curves closer to normal SNe IIP. The SN from the 9 solar masses\nprogenitor remains the best candidate for so-called low-luminosity SNe IIP like\nSN 1999br and SN 2005cs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 12:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

The conventional approach to retrieving the\nsmooth function from the raw data is through various smoothing techniques.\nHowever, the smoothing model is not adequate to recover the smooth curve or\ncapture the data variation in some situations. These include cases where there\nis a large amount of measurement error, the smoothing basis functions are\nincorrectly identified, or the step jumps in the functional mean levels are\nneglected. To address these challenges, a factor-augmented smoothing model is\nproposed, and an iterative numerical estimation approach is implemented in\npractice. Including the factor model component in the proposed method solves\nthe aforementioned problems since a few common factors often drive the\nvariation that cannot be captured by the smoothing model. Asymptotic theorems\nare also established to demonstrate the effects of including factor structures\non the smoothing results. Specifically, we show that the smoothing coefficients\nprojected on the complement space of the factor loading matrix is\nasymptotically normal. As a byproduct of independent interest, an estimator for\nthe population covariance matrix of the raw data is presented based on the\nproposed model. Extensive simulation studies illustrate that these factor\nadjustments are essential in improving estimation accuracy and avoiding the\ncurse of dimensionality. The superiority of our model is also shown in modeling\nCanadian weather data and Australian temperature data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 12:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

Simple RNN models\nassume that sequences of hospital visits follow strict causal dependencies\nbetween consecutive visits.

In order to answer these\nquestions, the EHT Collaboration first endorsed the working hypothesis that the\ncentral object is a black hole described by the Kerr metric, i.e. a spinning\nKerr black hole as predicted by classical general relativity. They chose this\nhypothesis based on previous research and observations of the galaxy M87. After\nhaving adopted the Kerr black hole hypothesis, the EHT Collaboration proceeded\nto test it. They confronted this hypothesis with the data collected in the 2017\nEHT experiment.

Existing simulation platforms\nuse either pre-determined trajectories or deterministic driving models to model\nthe BVs' behaviors. However, pre-determined BV trajectories can not react to\nthe AV's maneuvers, and deterministic models are different from real human\ndrivers due to the lack of stochastic components and errors. Both methods lead\nto unrealistic traffic scenarios. This paper presents a learning-based\nstochastic driving model that meets the unique needs of AV testing, i.e.\ninteractive and human-like. The model is built based on the\nlong-short-term-memory (LSTM) architecture. By incorporating the concept of\nquantile-regression to the loss function of the model, the stochastic behaviors\nare reproduced without any prior assumption of human drivers. The model is\ntrained with the large-scale naturalistic driving data (NDD) from the Safety\nPilot Model Deployment(SPMD) project and then compared with a stochastic\nintelligent driving model (IDM). Analysis of individual trajectories shows that\nthe proposed model can reproduce more similar trajectories to human drivers\nthan IDM. To validate the ability of the proposed model in generating a\nnaturalistic driving environment, traffic simulation experiments are\nimplemented.

Although numerous\nreconstruction methods have been developed, they have not effectively addressed\nthe issues associated with large gaps in the time series over cloudy and rainy\nregions, due to the insufficient utilization of the spatial and temporal\ncorrelations. In this paper, an adaptive Spatio-Temporal Tensor Completion\nmethod (termed ST-Tensor) method is proposed to reconstruct long-term NDVI time\nseries in cloud-prone regions, by making full use of the multi-dimensional\nspatio-temporal information simultaneously. For this purpose, a\nhighly-correlated tensor is built by considering the correlations among the\nspatial neighbors, inter-annual variations, and periodic characteristics, in\norder to reconstruct the missing information via an adaptive-weighted low-rank\ntensor completion model. An iterative l1 trend filtering method is then\nimplemented to eliminate the residual temporal noise. This new method was\ntested using MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products from 2001 to 2018 obtained in\nthe region of Mainland Southeast Asia, where the rainy climate commonly induces\nlarge gaps and noise in the data. The qualitative and quantitative results\nindicate that the ST-Tensor method is more effective than the five previous\nmethods in addressing the different missing data problems, especially the\ntemporally continuous gaps and spatio-temporally continuous gaps. It is also\nshown that the ST-Tensor method performs better than the other methods in\ntracking NDVI seasonal trajectories, and is therefore a superior option for\ngenerating high-quality long-term NDVI time series for cloud-prone regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 13:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

Measuring the microscopic structure of such systems\nis a formidable challenge, often met by particle knockout scattering\nexperiments. While such measurements are fundamental for mapping the structure\nof atomic nuclei, their interpretation is often challenged by quantum\nmechanical initial- and final-state interactions (ISI/FSI) of the incoming and\nscattered particles. Here we overcome this fundamental limitation by measuring\nthe quasi-free scattering of 48 GeV/c 12C ions from hydrogen. The distribution\nof single protons is studied by detecting two protons at large angles in\ncoincidence with an intact 11B nucleus. The 11B detection is shown to select\nthe transparent part of the reaction and exclude the otherwise large ISI/FSI\nthat would break the 11B apart. By further detecting residual 10B and 10Be\nnuclei, we also identified short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon-nucleon pairs,\nand provide direct experimental evidence for the separation of the pair\nwave-function from that of the residual many-body nuclear system.

We investigate how the global level of particles' alignment (order) is\naffected by their motion and the noise amplitude $\\eta$. In the static case\nscenario $v=0$ where particles are fixed at the sites of a square lattice and\ninteract with their first neighbors, we find that for any noise $\\eta_c>0$ the\nsystem reaches a steady state of complete disorder in the thermodynamic limit,\nwhile for $\\eta=0$ full order is eventually achieved for a system with any\nnumber of particles $N$.

These\ndrawbacks hinder the wide use of cryptocurrencies by masses. To address these\nchallenges, payment channel network concept is touted as the most viable\nsolution to be used for micro-payments. The idea is exchanging the ownership of\nmoney by keeping the state of the accounts locally. The users inform the\nblockchain rarely, which decreases the load on the blockchain. Specifically,\npayment channel networks can provide transaction approvals in seconds by\ncharging a nominal fee proportional to the payment amount. Such attraction on\npayment channel networks inspired many recent studies which focus on how to\ndesign them and allocate channels such that the transactions will be secure and\nefficient. However, as payment channel networks are emerging and reaching large\nnumber of users, privacy issues are becoming more relevant that raise concerns\nabout exposing not only individual habits but also businesses' revenues. In\nthis paper, we first propose a categorization of the existing payment networks\nformed on top of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies. After discussing several\nemerging attacks on user/business privacy in these payment channel networks, we\nqualitatively evaluate them based on a number of privacy metrics that relate to\nour case. Based on the discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of the\napproaches, we offer possible directions for research for the future of privacy\nbased payment channel networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 14:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

In recent years, it has been shown that,\nby placing inertial sensors on segments that are connected by rotational\njoints, the motion of that kinematic chain can be tracked accurately. These\nmethods specifically avoid using magnetometer measurements, which are known to\nbe unreliable since the magnetic field at the different sensor locations is\ntypically different. They rely on the assumption that the motion of the\nkinematic chain is sufficiently rich to assure observability of the relative\npose. However, a formal investigation of this crucial requirement has not yet\nbeen presented, and no specific conditions for observability have so far been\ngiven. In this work, we present an observability analysis and show that the\nrelative pose of the body segments is indeed observable under a very mild\ncondition on the motion.

We investigate the effect of the amount of excitation\nand of stationary periods in the data on the accuracy of the estimates.

A chemical simulation of a gas parcel in a low-mass\nstar-forming core with a full level of irradiation by interstellar photons and\ncosmic rays was compared to a simulation of a core receiving only one-tenth of\nsuch irradiation. In the full irradiation model, the abundances of carbon\nchains were found to be higher by a factor of few to few hundred, compared to\nthe model with low irradiation. Higher carbon-chain abundances in the\nprestellar stage and, presumably, in the extended circumstellar envelope, arise\nbecause of irradiation of gas and dust by interstellar photons and cosmic rays.\nA full standard rate of cosmic-ray induced ionization is essential for a high\ncarbon-chain abundance peak to occur in the circumstellar envelope, which is\nheated by the protostar (the \"true\" WCCC phenomenon).

Currently, deep learning is the state of\nthe art for automatic segmentation, but is usually limited by the need for\nsupervised training with large datasets that have been manually segmented by\ntrained clinicians. The goal of semi-superised and unsupervised image\nsegmentation is to greatly reduce, or even eliminate, the need for training\ndata and therefore to minimze the burden on clinicians when training\nsegmentation models. To this end we introduce a novel network architecture for\ncapable of unsupervised and semi-supervised image segmentation called\nTricycleGAN. This approach uses three generative models to learn translations\nbetween medical images and segmentation maps using edge maps as an intermediate\nstep. Distinct from other approaches based on generative networks, TricycleGAN\nrelies on shape priors rather than colour and texture priors. As such, it is\nparticularly well-suited for several domains of medical imaging, such as\nultrasound imaging, where commonly used visual cues may be absent.

One\nway to study them is take local data, the number of solutions modulo $p$, and\ncreate an $L$-function. The behavior of this global object is related to two of\nthe seven Clay Millennial Problems: the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture\nand the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. We study one-parameter families over\n$\\mathbb{Q}(T)$, which are of the form $y^2=x^3+A(T)x+B(T)$, with non-constant\n$j$-invariant. We define the r-th moment of an elliptic curve to be $A_{r,E}(p)\n:= \\frac1{p} \\sum_{t \\bmod p} a_t(p)^r$, where $a_t(p)$ is $p$ minus the number\nof solutions to $y^2 = x^3 + A(t)x + B(t) \\bmod p$. Rosen and Silverman showed\nbiases in the first moment equal the rank of the Mordell-Weil group of rational\nsolutions.\n  Michel proved that $pA_{2,E}(p)=p^2+O(p^{3/2})$. Based on several special\nfamilies where computations can be done in closed form, Miller in his thesis\nconjectured that the largest lower-order term in the second moment that does\nnot average to $0$ is on average negative. He further showed that such a\nnegative bias has implications in the distribution of zeros of the elliptic\ncurve $L$-function near the central point. To date, evidence for this\nconjecture is limited to special families. In addition to studying some\nadditional families where the calculations can be done in closed form, we also\nsystematically investigate families of various rank.

Entropy coding compresses fixed-length values with variable-length\ncodes, encoding most probable values with fewer bits. We propose the EFloat\ncompressed floating point number format that uses a variable field boundary\nbetween the exponent and significand fields. EFloat uses entropy coding on\nexponent values and signs to minimize the average width of the exponent and\nsign fields, while preserving the original FP32 exponent range unchanged. Saved\nbits become part of the significand field increasing the EFloat numeric\nprecision by 4.3 bits on average compared to other reduced-precision floating\npoint formats. EFloat makes 8-bit and even smaller floats practical without\nsacrificing the exponent range of a 32-bit floating point representation. We\ncurrently use the EFloat format for saving memory capacity and bandwidth\nconsumption of large vector embedding models such as those used for database\nembeddings. Using the RMS error as metric, we demonstrate that EFloat provides\nhigher accuracy than other floating point formats with equal bit budget. The\nEF12 format with 12-bit budget has less end-to-end application error than the\n16-bit BFloat16. EF16 with 16-bit budget has an RMS-error 17 to 35 times less\nthan BF16 RMS-error for a diverse set of embedding models.

A novel\nmultiscale Bayesian inference approach is introduced based on deep\nprobabilistic generative models. Such generative models provide a flexible\nrepresentation by inferring on each scale a low-dimensional latent encoding\nwhile allowing hierarchical parameter generation from coarse- to fine-scales.\nCombining the multiscale generative model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),\ninference across scales is achieved enabling us to efficiently obtain posterior\nparameter samples at various scales. The estimation of coarse-scale parameters\nusing a low-dimensional latent embedding captures global and notable parameter\nfeatures using an inexpensive but inaccurate solver. MCMC sampling of the\nfine-scale parameters is enabled by utilizing the posterior information in the\nimmediate coarser-scale. In this way, the global features are identified in the\ncoarse-scale with inference of low-dimensional variables and inexpensive\nforward computation, and the local features are refined and corrected in the\nfine-scale. The developed method is demonstrated with two types of permeability\nestimation for flow in heterogeneous media. One is a Gaussian random field\n(GRF) with uncertain length scales, and the other is channelized permeability\nwith the two regions defined by different GRFs. The obtained results indicate\nthat the method allows high-dimensional parameter estimation while exhibiting\nstability, efficiency and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 11:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 04:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

The present work develops an approach for characterizing the coverage\nand interrelationship between discrete signals that can be fitted by a set of\nreference functions, allowing the definition of transition networks between the\nconsidered discrete signals. While the adjacency between discrete signals is\ndefined in terms of respective Euclidean distances, the property of being\nadjustable by the reference functions provides an additional constraint leading\nto a surprisingly diversity of transition networks topologies. First, we\nmotivate the possibility to define transitions between parametric continuous\nfunctions, a concept that is subsequently extended to discrete functions and\nsignals. Given that the set of all possible discrete signals in a bound region\ncorresponds to a finite number of cases, it becomes feasible to verify the\nadherence of each of these signals with respect to a reference set of\nfunctions. Then, by taking into account also the Euclidean proximity between\nthose discrete signals found to be adjustable, it becomes possible to obtain a\nrespective transition network that can be not only used to study the properties\nand interrelationships of the involved discrete signals as underlain by the\nreference functions, but which also provide an interesting complex network\ntheoretical model on itself, presenting a surprising diversity of topological\nfeatures, including modular organization coexisting with more uniform portions,\ntails and handles, as well as hubs.

In this paper, we develop an Individual-based\nReinforcement Learning Epidemic Control Agent (IDRLECA) to search for smart\nepidemic control strategies that can simultaneously minimize infections and the\ncost of mobility intervention. IDRLECA first hires an infection probability\nmodel to calculate the current infection probability of each individual. Then,\nthe infection probabilities together with individuals' health status and\nmovement information are fed to a novel GNN to estimate the spread of the virus\nthrough human contacts. The estimated risks are used to further support an RL\nagent to select individual-level epidemic-control actions. The training of\nIDRLECA is guided by a specially designed reward function considering both the\ncost of mobility intervention and the effectiveness of epidemic control.\nMoreover, we design a constraint for control-action selection that eases its\ndifficulty and further improve exploring efficiency. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that IDRLECA can suppress infections at a very low level\nand retain more than 95% of human mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 08:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

This thesis studies different deep learning-based approaches,\nhighlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme. In fact, these\napproaches are promising that some of them can navigate the robot in unknown\nand dynamic environments. In this thesis, one of the deep learning methods\nbased on convolutional neural network (CNN) is realized by software\nimplementations. There are different preparation studies to complete this\nthesis such as introduction to Linux, robot operating system (ROS), C++,\npython, and GAZEBO simulator. Within this work, we modified the drone network\n(namely, DroNet) approach to be used in an indoor environment by using a ground\nrobot in different cases. Indeed, the DroNet approach suffers from the absence\nof goal-oriented motion. Therefore, this thesis mainly focuses on tackling this\nproblem via mapping using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path\nplanning techniques using Dijkstra. Afterward, the combination between the\nDroNet ground robot-based, mapping, and path planning leads to a goal-oriented\nmotion, following the shortest path while avoiding the dynamic obstacle.\nFinally, we propose a low-cost approach, for indoor applications such as\nrestaurants, museums, etc, on the base of using a monocular camera instead of a\nlaser scanner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 23:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

The total force in a system not affected by\nexternal forces is thus zero. However, according to the principles of\nrelativity, a signal cannot propagate at speeds exceeding the speed of light.\nHence the action and reaction cannot be generated at the same time due to the\nrelativity of simultaneity. Thus, the total force cannot be null at a given\ntime. In a previous paper \\cite{MTAY1}, we have shown that Newt\\-on'n third law\ncannot strictly hold in a distributed system, where the different parts are at\na finite distance from each other. This is due to the finite speed of signal\npropagation, which cannot exceed the speed of light in the vacuum. A specific\nexample of two current loops with time dependent currents demonstrated that the\nsumming of the total force in the system does not add up to zero. This analysis\nled to the suggestion of a relativistic engine \\cite{MTAY3,AY1}. As the system\nis affected by a total force for a finite period, the system acquires\nmechanical momentum and energy. Now the question then arises how can we\naccommodate the law of momentum and energy conservation. The subject of\nmomentum conversation was discussed in \\cite{MTAY4}, while preliminary results\nregarding energy conservation were discussed in \\cite{AY2,RY,RY2}. Previous\nanalysis relied on the fact that the bodies were macroscopically natural, which\nmeans that the number of electrons and ions is equal in every volume element.\nHere we relax this assumption and study charged bodies, thus analyzing the\nconsequences on a possible electric relativistic engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 17:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}
