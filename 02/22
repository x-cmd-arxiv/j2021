The ability of deep learning methods to learn the\nnon-linear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding\nhigh-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas\nof research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image\nsuper-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved\nby integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a\ncustomized Tchebichef convolutional layer ($TCL$). The role of TCL is to\nconvert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain\nusing Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the aforementioned\ntransformation is achieved using another layer known as the Inverse Tchebichef\nconvolutional Layer (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the\ntransform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the\nTchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and\nlow-frequency representation of images that makes the task of super-resolution\nsimplified. We, further, introduce transfer learning approach to enhance the\nquality of Covid based medical images.

A low dimensional\nrepresentation of an anatomically detailed arterial network is outlined, and a\nphysiologically realistic posterior distribution for its parameters is\nconstructed through a Bayesian approach. This approach combines both\nphysiological/geometrical constraints and the available measurements reported\nin the literature. A key contribution of this work is to present a framework\nfor including all such available information for the creation of virtual\npatients (VPs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to sample\nrandom VPs from this posterior distribution, and the pressure and flow-rate\nprofiles associated with the VPs are computed through a model of pulse wave\npropagation. This combination of the arterial network parameters (representing\nthe VPs) and the haemodynamics waveforms of pressure and flow-rates at various\nlocations (representing functional response of the VPs) makes up the VPD. While\n75,000 VPs are sampled from the posterior distribution, 10,000 are discarded as\nthe initial burn-in period. A further 12,857 VPs are subsequently removed due\nto the presence of negative average flow-rate. Due to an undesirable behaviour\nobserved in some VPs -- asymmetric under- and over-damped pressure and\nflow-rate profiles in the left and right sides of the arterial system -- a\nfilter is proposed for their removal. The final VPD has 28,868 subjects. It is\nshown that the methodology is appropriate by comparing the VPD statistics to\nthose reported in literature across real populations. A good agreement between\nthe two is found while respecting physiological/geometrical constraints.

However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the\nconvolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies\nin the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage\nself-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn\nrepresentations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore\nTransformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using\nTransformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks.\nMajority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for\nvision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However,\ncompared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the\nnumber of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently\ntrain transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated\nAxial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing\nan additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to\ntrain the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global\ntraining strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically,\nwe operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features,\nrespectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three\ndifferent medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves\nbetter performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based\narchitectures.

The\nrelay is constrained to operate without knowledge of the codebooks, i.e., it\nperforms oblivious processing. Moreover, due to the bottleneck constraint, it\nis impossible for the relay to inform the destination node of the perfect\nchannel state information (CSI) in each channel realization. To evaluate the\nbottleneck rate, we first provide an upper bound by assuming that the\ndestination node can get the perfect CSI at no cost. Then, we provide four\nachievable schemes where each scheme satisfies the bottleneck constraint and\ngives a lower bound to the bottleneck rate. In the first and second schemes,\nthe relay splits the capacity of the relay-destination link into two parts, and\nconveys both the CSI and its observation to the destination node. Due to CSI\ntransmission, the performance of these two schemes is sensitive to the MIMO\nchannel dimension, especially the channel input dimension. To ensure that it\nstill performs well when the channel dimension grows large, in the third and\nfourth achievable schemes, the relay only transmits compressed observation to\nthe destination node.

We argue that on the temperatures comparable to\nthe electroweak scale, characteristic for the early Universe and objects like\nneutron stars, the description of electromagnetic fields in conductive plasmas\nneeds to be extended to include the effects of chiral anomaly. It is\ndemonstrated that chiral effects can have a significant influence on the\nevolution of magnetic fields, tending to produce exponential amplification,\ncreation of magnetic helicity from initially non-helical fields, and can lead\nto an inverse energy transfer. We further discuss the modified\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations around the electroweak transition. The obtained\nsolutions demonstrate that the asymmetry between right-handed and left-handed\ncharged fermions of negligible mass typically grows with time when approaching\nthe electroweak crossover from higher temperatures, until it undergoes a fast\ndecrease at the transition, and then eventually gets damped at lower\ntemperatures in the broken phase. At the same time, the dissipation of magnetic\nfields gets slower due to the chiral effects. We furthermore report some first\nanalytical attempts in the study of chiral magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.\nUsing the analysis of simplified regimes and qualitative arguments, it is shown\nthat anomalous effects can strongly support turbulent inverse cascade and lead\nto a faster growth of the correlation length, when compared to the evolution\npredicted by the non-chiral magnetohydrodynamics.

A linearized AC optimal power flow (LAC-OPF)\napproach with consideration of network losses, reactive power, and voltage\nmagnitude constraints is utilized in the proposed two-stage stochastic DA\nscheduling model. Using an engineering insight, a two-level LAC-OPF\n(TL-LAC-OPF) approach is proposed to (i) reduce the number of binary variables\nof the LAC-OPF approach which decreases the computational burden, and (ii)\nobtain LAC-OPF pre-defined parameters adaptively so that the accuracy of\nLAC-OPF approach is increased as a result of reducing artificial losses.\nFurthermore, as the CAES efficiency depends on its thermodynamic and\noperational conditions, the proposed two-stage stochastic DA scheduling model\nis developed by considering its thermodynamic characteristics to obtain a more\nrealistic market decision at the first place. The proposed model is applied to\nIEEE 30-bus and 57-bus test systems using GAMS software, and is compared with\nthree traditional approaches, i.e., AC-OPF, DC-OPF, and LAC-OPF.

By using the optically thin\ncounterparts, [13C II] and [O I]145 respectively, we conclude that the\nself-absorption is dominated by the warm (>80 K) foreground PDR gas and not by\nthe surrounding cold molecular cloud. We estimate the column densities of C+\nand O of the PDR to be 3e18 and 2e19 cm^-2, respectively. Comparison of stellar\nfar-ultraviolet flux and reprocessed infrared radiation suggest enhanced\nclumpiness of the gas to the north-west. Analysis of the emission from the PDR\ngas suggests the presence of at least three density components consisting of\nhigh density (10^6 cm^-3) clumps, medium density (10^4 cm^-3) and diffuse (10^3\ncm^-3) interclump medium. The medium density component primarily contributes to\nthe thermal pressure of the PDR gas which is in pressure equilibrium with the\nmolecular cloud to the west. We find that the PDR is tilted and warped with the\nsouth-eastern side of the cavity being denser on the front and the\nnorth-western side being denser on the rear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

ICF recommends items to a target user based\non their similarities to the previously interacted items of the user. Great\nprogresses have been achieved for ICF in recent years by applying advanced\nmachine learning techniques (e.g., deep neural networks) to learn the item\nsimilarity from data. The early methods simply treat all the historical items\nequally and recently proposed methods attempt to distinguish the different\nimportance of historical items when recommending a target item. Despite the\nprogress, we argue that those ICF models neglect the diverse intents of users\non adopting items (e.g., watching a movie because of the director, leading\nactors, or the visual effects). As a result, they fail to estimate the item\nsimilarity on a finer-grained level to predict the user's preference to an\nitem, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose a\ngeneral feature-level attention method for ICF models. The key of our method is\nto distinguish the importance of different factors when computing the item\nsimilarity for a prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we\ndesign a light attention neural network to integrate both item-level and\nfeature-level attention for neural ICF models.

This paper presents a novel\njoint delay and angle estimation approach for wideband mmWave fully-connected\nhybrid uniform cylindrical arrays. We first design a new hybrid beamformer to\nreduce the dimension of received signals on the horizontal plane by exploiting\nthe convergence of the Bessel function, and to reduce the active beams in the\nvertical direction through preselection. The important recurrence relationship\nof the received signals needed for subspace-based angle and delay estimation is\npreserved, even with substantially fewer RF chains than antennas.

To date, the study of elementary photoexcitation,\nnamely the exciton, in 2D semiconductors with intrinsic magnetic order remains\na challenge due to the lack of suitable material platforms. Here, we report an\nobservation of excitons coupled to zigzag antiferromagnetic order in the\nlayered antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3 using both photoluminescence (PL) and\noptical reflection spectroscopy. The exciton exhibits a linewidth as narrow as\n~350 ueV with near unity linear polarization in the PL spectrum. As the\nthicknesses of samples is reduced from five layers to bilayers, the PL\nintensity is drastically suppressed and eventually vanishes in monolayers,\nconsistent with the calculated bandgap being highly indirect for both bilayer\nand monolayer. We observed strong linear dichroism (LD) over a broad spectra\nrange, which shares the same optical anisotropy axis, being locked to the\nzigzag direction, as the exciton PL. Both LD and the degree of linear\npolarization in the exciton PL decrease as the temperature increases and become\nnegligible above the Neel temperature. These observations suggest both optical\nquantities are probes of the symmetry breaking magnetic order parameter. In\naddition, a sharp resonance in the LD spectrum is observed with an energy near\nthe exciton PL. There exist over ten exciton-A1g phonon bound states on its\nhigh energy side, which likely result from the strong modulation of the\nligand-to-metal charge transfer energy by strong electron-lattice interactions.\nOur work establishes NiPS3 as a new 2D platform for exploring magneto-exciton\nphysics with strong correlations, as well as a building block for 2D\nheterostructures for engineering physical phenomena with time reversal symmetry\nbreaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 03:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The current study focuses on hiding\nsuch sensitive communities so that the community affiliation of the targeted\nnodes can be concealed.

Moreover, we\ncarefully develop a BRAM-only matching process to fully utilize FPGA's on-chip\nmemory, which avoids the expensive intermediate data transfer between FPGA's\nBRAM and DRAM. Comprehensive experiments show that FAST achieves up to 462.0x\nand 150.0x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm DAF and CECI,\nrespectively.

The finding of general knowledge is further hindered by the\nunidirectional distillation, as the student should obey the teacher and may\ndiscard some knowledge that is truly general but refuted by the teacher.

The other is the sub-optimal identification feature learning caused\nby small batch size when end-to-end training. To overcome these problems, we\npropose a decoupled and memory-reinforced network (DMRNet).

Several centrality measures\nhave been proposed recently to evaluate the performance of nodes based on their\ncorrelation, showing that the interaction between nodes has an influence on the\nimportance of nodes.

Our main idea is that the\nimportance of nodes being linked not only to the relative position in the\nnetwork but also to the correlations with each other. The nodes in the complex\nnetworks are classified according to the distance matrix, then the correlation\ncoefficient between pairs of nodes is calculated. From the whole perspective in\nthe network, the global similarity centrality (GSC) is proposed based on the\nrelevance and shortest distance between any two nodes. The efficiency, accuracy\nand monotonicity of the proposed method are analyzed in two artificial datasets\nand eight real datasets of different sizes. Experimental results show that the\nperformance of GSC method outperforms those current state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Iron-based superconductors exhibit\nhigh upper critical fields and low electromagnetic anisotropy, making them\nparticularly attractive for high-field applications, especially in particle\naccelerator magnets, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, medical magnetic\nresonance imaging systems and nuclear fusion reactors. Herein, through an\nindustrially scalable and cost-effective manufacturing strategy, a practical\nlevel critical current density up to 1.1x10^5 A/cm2 at 4.2 K in an external\nmagnetic field of 10 T was achieved in Cu/Ag composite sheathed Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2\nsuperconducting tapes. The preparation strategy combines flat rolling to induce\ngrain texture and a subsequent hot-isostatic-pressing densification. By varying\nthe parameters of rolling, the degree of grain texture was engineered. It is\nfound that the transport properties of the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 tapes can be enhanced\nby applying a large amount of deformation during rolling, which can be\nattributed to the improved degree of c-axis texture. Microstructure\ncharacterizations on the highest-performance tape demonstrate that the\nBa1-xKxFe2As2 phase has a uniform element distribution and small grains with\ngood connectivity. Grain boundary pinning is consequently enhanced as proved by\nlarge currents circulating through the sample even at 25 K.

This has led to the\nbirth of many iterative algorithms to solve them. A powerful strategy to boost\nthe performance of these algorithms is known as safe screening: it allows the\nearly identification of zero coordinates in the solution, which can then be\neliminated to reduce the problem's size and accelerate convergence. In this\nwork, we extend the existing Gap Safe screening framework by relaxing the\nglobal strong-concavity assumption on the dual cost function. Instead, we\nexploit local regularity properties, that is, strong concavity on well-chosen\nsubsets of the domain. The non-negativity constraint is also integrated to the\nexisting framework. Besides making safe screening possible to a broader class\nof functions that includes beta-divergences (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence), the proposed approach also improves upon the existing Gap Safe\nscreening rules on previously applicable cases (e.g., logistic regression). The\nproposed general framework is exemplified by some notable particular cases:\nlogistic function, beta = 1.5 and Kullback-Leibler divergences. Finally, we\nshowcase the effectiveness of the proposed screening rules with different\nsolvers (coordinate descent, multiplicative-update and proximal gradient\nalgorithms) and different data sets (binary classification, hyperspectral and\ncount data).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 09:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 15:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Prior art on hybrid architectures has mainly focused on greedy\noptimization algorithms to estimate frequency-flat narrowband mmWave channels,\ndespite the fact that in practice, the large bandwidth associated with mmWave\nchannels results in frequency-selective channels. In this paper, we consider a\nfrequency-selective wideband mmWave system and propose two deep learning (DL)\ncompressive sensing (CS) based algorithms for channel estimation.} The proposed\nalgorithms learn critical apriori information from training data to provide\nhighly accurate channel estimates with low training overhead.

Mask R-CNN is a classic method of instance segmentation, but\nwe find that its predicted masks are unclear and inaccurate near contours. To\ncope with this problem, we draw on the idea of contour matching based on\ndistance transformation image and propose a novel loss function, called contour\nloss. Contour loss is designed to specifically optimize the contour parts of\nthe predicted masks, thus can assure more accurate instance segmentation. In\norder to make the proposed contour loss to be jointly trained under modern\nneural network frameworks, we design a differentiable k-step distance\ntransformation image calculation module, which can approximately compute\ntruncated distance transformation images of the predicted mask and\ncorresponding ground-truth mask online. The proposed contour loss can be\nintegrated into existing instance segmentation methods such as Mask R-CNN, and\ncombined with their original loss functions without modification of the\ninference network structures, thus has strong versatility.

Since $\\hbar$ is a dimensionful\nconstant, we may always work in natural units in which $\\hbar = 1$. Dimensional\nanalysis teaches us that all physical laws can be expressed purely in terms of\ndimensionless quantities. This indicates that the existence of a dimensionally\nconsistent constraint on $\\Delta x \\Delta p$ requires the existence of a\ndimensionful parameter with units of action, and that any definition of the\nclassical limit must be formulated in terms of dimensionless quantities (such\nas quantum numbers). Therefore, bounds on classical uncertainty (formulated in\nterms of statistical ensembles) can only be written in terms of dimensionful\nscales of the system under consideration, and can be readily compared to their\nquantum counterparts after being non-dimensionalized. We compare the\nuncertainty of certain coupled classical systems and their quantum counterparts\n(such as harmonic oscillators and particles in a box), and show that they\nconverge in the classical limit.

We analyse the morphology and evolution of\nflare arcades that formed during five well-known eruptive flares. We show that\nthe arcades have a common saddle-like shape. The saddles occur despite the fact\nthat the flares were of different classes (C to X), occurred in different\nmagnetic environments, and were observed in various projections. The saddles\nare related to the presence of longer, relatively-higher, and inclined flare\nloops, consistently observed at the ends of the arcades, which we term\n`cantles'. Our observations indicate that cantles typically join straight\nportions of flare ribbons with hooked extensions of the conjugate ribbons. The\norigin of the cantles is investigated in stereoscopic observations of the 2011\nMay 9 eruptive flare carried out by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and\nExtreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI). The mutual separation of the instruments led\nto ideal observational conditions allowing for simultaneous analysis of the\nevolving cantle and the underlying ribbon hook. Based on our analysis we\nsuggest that the formation of one of the cantles can be explained by magnetic\nreconnection between the erupting structure and its overlying arcades.

This structured regularization enhances interpretability by\npenalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable,\nthus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent\ndimension.

As the number of IRS reflecting\nelements or IRS-aided users increases, the channel training overhead becomes\nexcessively high, which results in long delay and low throughput in data\ntransmission. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new\nanchor-assisted channel estimation approach, where two anchor nodes, namely A1\nand A2, are deployed near the IRS for facilitating its aided base station (BS)\nin acquiring the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels required for data transmission.\nSpecifically, in the first scheme, the partial channel state information (CSI)\non the element-wise channel gain square of the common BS-IRS link for all users\nis first obtained at the BS via the anchor-assisted training and feedback.\nThen, by leveraging such partial CSI, the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels are\nefficiently resolved at the BS with additional training by the users. While in\nthe second scheme, the BS-IRS-A1 and A1-IRS-A2 channels are first estimated via\nthe training by A1. Then, with additional training by A2, all users estimate\ntheir individual cascaded A2-IRS-user channels simultaneously. Based on the CSI\nfed back from A2 and all users, the BS resolves the cascaded BS-IRS-user\nchannels efficiently. In both schemes, the quasi-static channels among the\nfixed BS, IRS, and two anchors are estimated off-line only, which greatly\nreduces the real-time training overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that\nour proposed anchor-assisted channel estimation schemes achieve superior\nperformance as compared to existing IRS channel estimation schemes, under\nvarious practical setups. In addition, the first proposed scheme outperforms\nthe second one when the number of antennas at the BS is sufficiently large, and\nvice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 10:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 01:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 02:40:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

This makes\nthe size of black hole photon ring depend on polarization. Further assuming\nthat the EEP violation is small, we derive an approximate analytic expression\nfor spherical black holes showing that the change in size of the photon ring is\nproportional to the violation parameters. We also discuss several cases of this\nanalytic expression for specific models. Finally, we explore the effects of\nblack hole rotation and derive a modified proportionality relation between the\nchange in size of photon ring and the violation parameters. The numerical and\nanalytic results show that the influence of black hole rotation on the\nconstraints of EEP violation is relatively weak for small magnitude of EEP\nviolation and small rotation speed of black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 10:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 02:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

First, a novel expansion many-body\nmethod applicable to superfluid open-shell nuclei, the so-called Bogoliubov\nin-medium similarity renormalization group (BIMSRG) theory, is formulated. This\ngeneralization of standard single-reference IMSRG theory for closed-shell\nsystems parallels the recent extensions of coupled cluster, self-consistent\nGreen's function or many-body perturbation theory. Within the realm of IMSRG\ntheories, BIMSRG provides an interesting alternative to the already existing\nmulti-reference IMSRG (MR-IMSRG) method applicable to open-shell nuclei.\n  The algebraic equations for low-order approximations, i.e., BIMSRG(1) and\nBIMSRG(2), can be derived manually without much difficulty. However, such a\nmethodology becomes already impractical and error prone for the derivation of\nthe BIMSRG(3) equations, which are eventually needed to reach high accuracy.\nBased on a diagrammatic formulation of BIMSRG theory, the second objective of\nthe present paper is thus to describe the third version (v3.0.0) of the ADG\ncode that automatically (1) generates all valid BIMSRG(n) diagrams and (2)\nevaluates their algebraic expressions in a matter of seconds. This is achieved\nin such a way that equations can easily be retrieved for both the flow equation\nand the Magnus expansion formulations of BIMSRG.\n  Expanding on this work, the first future objective is to numerically\nimplement BIMSRG(2) (eventually BIMSRG(3)) equations and perform ab initio\ncalculations of mid-mass open-shell nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 10:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

A CAD system\nfor lung cancer diagnosis includes nodule candidate detection and nodule\nmalignancy evaluation. Recently, deep learning-based pulmonary nodule detection\nhas reached satisfactory performance ready for clinical application. However,\ndeep learning-based nodule malignancy evaluation depends on heuristic inference\nfrom low-dose computed tomography volume to malignant probability, which lacks\nclinical cognition. Methods:In this paper, we propose a joint radiology\nanalysis and malignancy evaluation network (R2MNet) to evaluate the pulmonary\nnodule malignancy via radiology characteristics analysis. Radiological features\nare extracted as channel descriptor to highlight specific regions of the input\nvolume that are critical for nodule malignancy evaluation. In addition, for\nmodel explanations, we propose channel-dependent activation mapping to\nvisualize the features and shed light on the decision process of deep neural\nnetwork. Results:Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate that\nthe proposed method achieved area under curve of 96.27% on nodule radiology\nanalysis and AUC of 97.52% on nodule malignancy evaluation. In addition,\nexplanations of CDAM features proved that the shape and density of nodule\nregions were two critical factors that influence a nodule to be inferred as\nmalignant, which conforms with the diagnosis cognition of experienced\nradiologists. Conclusion:Incorporating radiology analysis with nodule malignant\nevaluation, the network inference process conforms to the diagnostic procedure\nof radiologists and increases the confidence of evaluation results. Besides,\nmodel interpretation with CDAM features shed light on the regions which DNNs\nfocus on when they estimate nodule malignancy probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

While other approaches focus on spatial or temporal\ncontext only, the proposed approach uses 3D convolutions as a key technology to\nfactor in, spatio-temporal features in cohesive video frames. This is done by\ncapturing temporal information in features with a low and also with a high\nlevel of abstraction. The lean network architecture with about 21k trainable\nparameters is mainly based on a pre-trained VGG-16 network. The MOSNET uses a\nnew feature map fusion technique, which enables the network to focus on the\nappropriate level of abstraction, resolution, and the appropriate size of the\nreceptive field regarding the input. Furthermore, the end-to-end deep learning\nbased approach can be extended by feature based image alignment as a\npre-processing step, which brings a gain in performance for some scenes.\nEvaluating the end-to-end deep learning based MOSNET network in a scene\nindependent manner leads to an overall F-measure of 0.803 on the CDNet2014\ndataset. A small temporal window of five input frames, without the need of any\ninitialization is used to obtain this result. Therefore the network is able to\nperform well on scenes captured with non-static cameras where the image content\nchanges significantly during the scene. In order to get robust results in\nscenes captured with a moving camera, feature based image alignment can\nimplemented as pre-processing step. The MOSNET combined with pre-processing\nleads to an F-measure of 0.685 when cross-evaluating with a relabeled LASIESTA\ndataset, which underpins the capability generalise of the MOSNET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

It will encourage the network to generate more\nsemantically meaningful features for each category. After integrating the\ntarget class cues into the query features, we then propose a pyramid feature\nfusion module to mine the fused features for the final classifier. Furthermore,\nto take more advantage of the support image-mask pair, we propose a\nself-prototype guidance branch to support image segmentation.

For inference, we propose a fused prototype guidance\nbranch for the segmentation of the query image. Specifically, we leverage the\nprediction of the query image to extract the pseudo-prototype and combine it\nwith the initial prototype.

Usually, the well known parabolic\napproximation is employed for the definition of the symmetry energy without\navoiding some drawbacks. In the present paper, a class of nuclear models,\nsuitable for the description of the inner and outer core of neutron stars, is\napplied in studying the effect of higher orders of the expansion of the energy\non the location of the crust-core transition. The thermodynamical and dynamical\nmethods are used for the determination of the transition density $n_{\\rm t}$\nand pressure $P_{\\rm t}$. The corresponding energy density functional is\napplied for the study of some relevant properties of both nonrotating and\nslowly rotating neutron stars.

While the widespread use of surrogate\nexplainers is a welcome addition to inspect and understand black-box models,\nassessing the robustness and reliability of the explanations is key for their\nsuccess. Additionally, whilst existing work in the explainability field\nproposes various strategies to address this problem, the challenges of working\nwith data in the wild is often overlooked. For instance, in image\nclassification, distortions to images can not only affect the predictions\nassigned by the model, but also the explanation. Given a clean and a distorted\nversion of an image, even if the prediction probabilities are similar, the\nexplanation may still be different. In this paper we propose a methodology to\nevaluate the effect of distortions in explanations by embedding perceptual\ndistances that tailor the neighbourhoods used to training surrogate explainers.\nWe also show that by operating in this way, we can make the explanations more\nrobust to distortions. We generate explanations for images in the Imagenet-C\ndataset and demonstrate how using a perceptual distances in the surrogate\nexplainer creates more coherent explanations for the distorted and reference\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 12:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 10:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

Magnetic particle\nimaging (MPI) is one of the most promising approaches for direct measurements\nof the SPION distribution. In this paper, we systematically investigate a\nsingle-harmonic-based narrowband MPI approach. Herein, only the 3rd harmonic at\n15 kHz of the SPION signal induced in an excitation magnetic field of 5 kHz is\nmeasured via a narrowband detection system for imaging during scanning a\nfield-free-point in a field of view. Experiments on spot and line phantoms are\nperformed to evaluate the spatial distribution by the assessment of the full\nwidth at half maximum and modulation transfer function at different excitation\nmagnetic fields from 4 to 10 mT. Experimental results demonstrate that\nreconstructed images have a spatial resolution of 1.6 and 1.5 mm for a gradient\nfield of 2.2 T/m and 4.4 T/m in x- and z-direction, respectively, at an\nexcitation magnetic field of 4 mT. In terms of line gap, two lines with a gap\nof 0.5 mm are resolved. With increasing the excitation magnetic field to 10 mT,\nthe spatial resolution gets worse to 2.4 and 2.0 mm in x- and z-direction,\nrespectively. Moreover, the custom-built MPI scanner allows a limit of\ndetection of 53 microgram (Fe)/mL (500 ng Fe weight) using perimag SPIONs. In\naddition, the excellent performance is demonstrated by imaging experiments on\nan \"emg\" logo phantom.

A precise definition of the crystal growth location,\nhowever, requires elaborate pre-epitaxy processes for substrate patterning. Our\nmolecular dynamics simulations reveal that homoepitaxial silicon nanofilms can\nbe directly deposited by a crystalline silicon tip rubbing against the\nsubstrate, thus enabling geometrically controlled crystal growth with no need\nfor substrate pre-patterning. We name this solid-phase epitaxial growth\ntriboepitaxy as it solely relies on shear-induced amorphization and\nrecrystallization that occur even at low temperature at the sliding interface\nbetween two silicon crystals. The interplay between the two concomitant,\nshear-induced processes is responsible for the formation of an amorphous\nsliding interface with constant nanometric thickness. If the two elastically\nanisotropic crystals slide along different crystallographic orientations, the\namorphous layer can move unidirectionally perpendicular to the sliding plane,\ncausing the crystal with lowest elastic energy per atom to grow at the expenses\nof the other crystal. As triboepitaxial growth is governed by the shear elastic\nresponse of the two crystals along the sliding direction, it can be implemented\nas a mechanical scanning-probe lithography method in which epitaxial growth is\ncontrolled by tuning the crystallographic misorientation between tip and\nsubstrate, the tip's size or the normal force.

Double Field Theory is T-duality covariant formulation of the\nsupergravity limit of String Theory, which generalises Kaluza-Klein theory by\nunifying metric and Kalb-Ramond field on a doubled-dimensional space. In light\nof the proposed correspondence, this doubled geometry is interpreted as an\natlas description of the higher geometry of bundle gerbes.

For a selection of continuous risk distributions, exact analytic\nformulas or numerical results for the ROC curve AUC and overlap measure are\npresented and demonstrate a linear or near-linear dependence on their standard\ndeviation.

Arsenic exposure through drinking water\nis among one of the primary arsenic exposure routes that can be effectively\nmanaged by active testing and water treatment. From the public and\nenvironmental health management perspective, it is critical to allocate the\nlimited resources to establish an effective arsenic sampling and testing plan\nfor health risk mitigation. We present a spatially adaptive sampling design\napproach based on an estimation of the spatially varying underlying\ncontamination distribution.

The objective of this paper is to propose a statistical\nmethod that performs successfully in these circumstances. Our proposal is based\non the use of models with specific baseline hazard, imputing the number of\nprior episodes when unknown, with a stratified model depending on whether the\nindividual had or had not previously been at risk, and the use of a frailty\nterm. The performance is examined in different scenarios through a\ncomprehensive simulation study.The proposed method achieves notable performance\neven when the percentage of subjects at risk before the beginning of the\nfollow-up is very elevated, with biases that are often under 10\\% and coverages\nof around 95\\%, sometimes somewhat conservative. If the baseline hazard is\nconstant, it seems to be that the ``Gap Time'' approach is better; if it is not\nconstant, the ``Counting Process'' seems to be a better choice. Because of the\nlack of knowledge of the prior episodes that have been experienced by a part\n(or all) of subjects, the use of common baseline methods is not advised.

Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular,\nit was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in\nchildren protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an\ninverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try\nto reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not\nmonotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that\ndepends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with\nmost existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked\nfor ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the\nprotease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The\nnegative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not\nparadoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation\nthat predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus\npropagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to\nprotect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low\nACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the\ninflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the\nangiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation\ntriggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its\nmany post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome\nof children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower\nACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the\nalternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the\nanti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

We have reconstructed the jerk\nparameter using the observational data sets. From the analysis of the jerk\nparameter, it is observed that, our derived model shows a marginal departure\nfrom the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 15:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

This presents\na computational bottleneck in statistical manifold learning when observations\nof probability distributions rather than vector-valued variables are available\nor when data size is large. We resolve this problem by proposing a new method\nfor approximation in statistical manifold learning. The novelty of our\napproximation is the strongly consistent distance estimators based on\nindependent and identically distributed samples from probability distributions.\nBy exploiting the connection between Hellinger/total variation distance for\ndiscrete distributions and the L2/L1 norm, we demonstrate that the proposed\ndistance estimators, combined with approximate nearest neighbor searching,\ncould largely improve the computational efficiency with little to no loss in\nthe accuracy of manifold embedding. The result is robust to different manifold\nlearning algorithms and different approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. The\nproposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds of electricity\nusage. This application demonstrates how underlying structures in high\ndimensional data, including anomalies, can be visualized and identified, in a\nway that is scalable to large datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 12:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 03:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

Assuming that the particle\nenergy is the dominant scale in the problem, an approximate solution of\nclassical equations of motion is derived and the characteristic features of the\nmotion are examined. A specific regime is found with comparable strong field\nquantum parameters of the beams, when the electron trajectory exhibits\nultrashort spike-like features, which bears great significance to the\ncorresponding radiation properties. An analytical expression for the spectral\ndistribution of spontaneous radiation is derived in the framework of the\nBaier-Katkov semiclassical approximation based on the classical trajectory. All\nthe analytical results are further validated by exact numerical calculations.\nWe consider a non-resonant regime of interaction, when the laser frequencies in\nthe electron rest frame are far from each other, avoiding stimulated emission.\nSpecial attention is devoted to settings when the description of radiation via\nthe local constant field approximation fails and to corresponding spectral\nfeatures. Periodic and non-periodic regimes are considered, when lab\nfrequencies of the laser waves are always commensurate. The sensitivity of\nspectra with respect to the electron beam spread, focusing and finite duration\nof the laser beams is explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 15:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 09:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}
