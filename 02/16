The techniques\nknown so far to prove size and depth lower bounds for Stabbing Planes are\ngeneralizations of those used for the Cutting Planes proof system established\nvia communication complexity arguments. As such they work for the lifted\nversion of combinatorial statements. Rank lower bounds for Cutting Planes are\nalso obtained by geometric arguments called protection lemmas.\n  In this work we introduce two new geometric approaches to prove size/depth\nlower bounds in Stabbing Planes working for any formula: (1) the antichain\nmethod, relying on Sperner's Theorem and (2) the covering method which uses\nresults on essential coverings of the boolean cube by linear polynomials, which\nin turn relies on Alon's combinatorial Nullenstellensatz.\n  We demonstrate their use on classes of combinatorial principles such as the\nPigeonhole principle, the Tseitin contradictions and the Linear Ordering\nPrinciple. By the first method we prove almost linear size lower bounds and\noptimal logarithmic depth lower bounds for the Pigeonhole principle and\nanalogous lower bounds for the Tseitin contradictions over the complete graph\nand for the Linear Ordering Principle. By the covering method we obtain a\nsuperlinear size lower bound and a logarithmic depth lower bound for Stabbing\nPlanes proof of Tseitin contradictions over a grid graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 16:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 11:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 15:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Under this setting, neural\nnetwork training performance may vary significantly according to the data\ndistribution and even hurt training convergence. Most of the previous work has\nfocused on a difference in the distribution of labels or client shifts. Unlike\nthose settings, we address an important problem of FL, e.g., different\nscanners/sensors in medical imaging, different scenery distribution in\nautonomous driving (highway vs. city), where local clients store examples with\ndifferent distributions compared to other clients, which we denote as feature\nshift non-iid.

The exact conditions of thermal metamorphism and the\nrelationship between the unheated and heated CM chondrites are not well\nconstrained but are crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of\nhydrous asteroids. Here we have used position-sensitive-detector X-ray\ndiffraction (PSD-XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission\ninfrared (IR) spectroscopy to characterise the mineralogy and water contents of\n14 heated CM and ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites. We show that heated CM\nchondrites underwent the same degree of aqueous alteration as the unheated CMs,\nhowever upon thermal metamorphism their mineralogy initially (300 to 500C)\nchanged from hydrated phyllosilicates to a dehydrated amorphous phyllosilicate\nphase. At higher temperatures (over 500C) we observe recrystallisation of\nolivine and Fe-sulphides and the formation of metal. Thermal metamorphism also\ncaused the water contents of heated CM chondrites to decrease from 13 wt\npercent to 3 wt percent and a subsequent reduction in the intensity of the 3\nmicron feature in IR spectra. We estimate that the heated CM chondrites have\nlost 15 to 65 percent of the water they contained at the end of aqueous\nalteration. If impacts were the main cause of metamorphism, this is consistent\nwith shock pressures of 20 to 50 GPa.

Many contemporary\nand emerging application areas such as digital healthcare and digital marketing\ncan benefit from modeling with C-MDPs due to the causal mechanisms underlying\nthe relationship between interventions and states/rewards. We propose the\ncausal upper confidence bound value iteration (C-UCBVI) algorithm that exploits\nthe causal structure in C-MDPs and improves the performance of standard\nreinforcement learning algorithms that do not take causal knowledge into\naccount. We prove that C-UCBVI satisfies an $\\tilde{O}(HS\\sqrt{ZT})$ regret\nbound, where $T$ is the the total time steps, $H$ is the episodic horizon, and\n$S$ is the cardinality of the state space. Notably, our regret bound does not\nscale with the size of actions/interventions ($A$), but only scales with a\ncausal graph dependent quantity $Z$ which can be exponentially smaller than\n$A$. By extending C-UCBVI to the factored MDP setting, we propose the causal\nfactored UCBVI (CF-UCBVI) algorithm, which further reduces the regret\nexponentially in terms of $S$. Furthermore, we show that RL algorithms for\nlinear MDP problems can also be incorporated in C-MDPs.

Owing to\nthe large amount of available bandwidth, THz frequencies can potentially\nprovide wireless capacity performance gains and enable high-resolution sensing.\nHowever, operating a wireless system at the THz-band is limited by a highly\nuncertain channel. Effectively, these channel limitations lead to unreliable\nintermittent links as a result of a short communication range, and a high\nsusceptibility to blockage and molecular absorption. Consequently, such\nimpediments could disrupt the THz band's promise of high-rate communications\nand high-resolution sensing capabilities. In this context, this paper\npanoramically examines the steps needed to efficiently deploy and operate\nnext-generation THz wireless systems that will synergistically support a\nfellowship of communication and sensing services. For this purpose, we first\nset the stage by describing the fundamentals of the THz frequency band.

These seven defining features allow us\nto shed light on how to re-engineer wireless systems as we know them today so\nas to make them ready to support THz bands. Furthermore, these features\nhighlight how THz systems turn every communication challenge into a sensing\nopportunity. Ultimately, the goal of this article is to chart a forward-looking\nroadmap that exposes the necessary solutions and milestones for enabling THz\nfrequencies to realize their potential as a game changer for next-generation\nwireless systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 16:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 02:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Most of the\npreviously known misalignments involve isolated hot Jupiters, for which\nplanet-planet scattering or secular effects from a wider-orbiting planet are\nthe leading explanations. In theory, star/disk misalignments can result from\nturbulence during star formation or the gravitational torque of a wide-orbiting\ncompanion star, but no definite examples of this scenario are known. An ideal\nexample would combine a coplanar system of multiple planets -- ruling out\nplanet-planet scattering or other disruptive post-formation events -- with a\nbackward-rotating star, a condition that is easier to obtain from a primordial\nmisalignment than from post-formation perturbations.

It is well known that in 1D, gapped\nground states have the split property with respect to cutting the system into\nleft and right half-chains. In 2D, however, the split property fails to hold\nfor interesting models such as Kitaev's toric code. In fact, we will show that\nthis failure is the reason that anyons can exist in that model.\n  There is a folklore saying that the existence of anyons, like in the toric\ncode model, implies long-range entanglement of the state. In this paper, we\nprove this folklore in an infinite dimensional setting. More precisely, we show\nthat long-range entanglement, in a way that we will define precisely, is a\nnecessary condition to have non-trivial superselection sectors. Anyons in\nparticular give rise to such non-trivial sectors. States with the split\nproperty for cones, on the other hand, do not admit non-trivial sectors.\n  A key technical ingredient of our proof is that under suitable assumptions on\nlocality, the automorphisms generated by local interactions can be\n'approximately factorized': they can be written as the tensor product of\nautomorphisms localized in a cone and its complement respectively, followed by\nan automorphism acting near the 'boundary' of $\\Lambda$, and conjugation with a\nunitary. This result may be of independent interest. This technique also allows\nus to prove that the approximate split property, a weaker version of the split\nproperty that is satisfied in e.g. the toric code, is stable under applying\nsuch automorphisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 17:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 21:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

We here present a novel\ntechnique in which the EOS of a quark star is suitably rescaled to produce a\nsmooth change of the specific enthalpy across a very thin crust. The\nintroduction of the crust has been carefully tested by considering the\noscillation properties of isolated quark stars, showing that the response of\nthe simulated quark stars matches accurately the perturbative predictions.\nUsing this technique, we have carried out the first fully general-relativistic\nsimulations of the merger of quark-star binaries finding several important\ndifferences between quark-star binaries and hadronic-star binaries with the\nsame mass and comparable tidal deformability. In particular, we find that\ndynamical mass loss is significantly suppressed in quark-star binaries. In\naddition, quark-star binaries have merger and post-merger frequencies that obey\nthe same quasi-universal relations derived from hadron stars if expressed in\nterms of the tidal deformability, but not when expressed in terms of the\naverage stellar compactness. Hence, it may be difficult to distinguish the two\nclasses of stars if no information on the stellar radius is available. Finally,\ndifferences are found in the distributions in velocity and entropy of the\nejected matter, for which quark-stars have much smaller tails. Whether these\ndifferences in the ejected matter will leave an imprint in the electromagnetic\ncounterpart and nucleosynthetic yields remains unclear, calling for the\nconstruction of an accurate model for the evaporation of the ejected quarks\ninto nucleons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 18:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 18:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The\nasymptotic cost as a function of the bond dimension remains the same as for\nstandard CMPS. I illustrate the method on the self-interacting scalar field,\na.k.a. the $\\phi^4_2$ model. Aside from providing unequaled precision in the\ncontinuum, the numerical results obtained are truly variational, and thus\nprovide rigorous energy upper bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 18:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 11:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

To date, various techniques have been\nproposed to achieve promising results, such as canonical correlation analysis\nbased methods, etc. In the meanwhile, it is critical for decision-makers to be\nable to understand the prediction results from these methods. For example,\ngiven the diagnostic result that a model provided based on the X-ray images of\na patient at different poses, the doctor needs to know why the model made such\na prediction.

We address the problem of forecasting rare events in a\nprototypical example, Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). Approximately once\nevery other winter, the boreal stratospheric polar vortex rapidly breaks down,\nshifting midlatitude surface weather patterns for months. We focus on two key\nquantities of interest: the probability of an SSW occurring, and the expected\nlead time if it does occur, as functions of initial condition. These\n\\emph{optimal forecasts} concretely measure the event's progress. Direct\nnumerical simulation can estimate them in principle, but is prohibitively\nexpensive in practice: each rare event requires a long integration to observe,\nand the cost of each integration grows with model complexity. We describe an\nalternative approach using integrations that are \\emph{short} compared to the\ntimescale of the warming event. We compute the probability and lead time\nefficiently by solving equations involving the transition operator, which\nencodes all information about the dynamics. We relate these optimal forecasts\nto a small number of interpretable physical variables, suggesting optimal\nmeasurements for forecasting. We illustrate the methodology on a prototype SSW\nmodel developed by Holton and Mass (1976) and modified by stochastic forcing.\nWhile highly idealized, this model captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of\nSSWs and exhibits the key forecasting challenge: the dramatic separation in\ntimescales between a single event and the return time between successive\nevents. Our methodology is designed to fully exploit high-dimensional data from\nmodels and observations, and has the potential to identify detailed predictors\nof many complex rare events in meteorology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 18:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 01:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Extracting multiple quasinormal mode\nfrequencies from the ringdown signal allows the remnant black hole to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Previous studies on numerical relativity\nsimulations of aligned-spin binaries have found that it is possible to start\nthe ringdown analysis much earlier than previously thought if overtones (and\npossibly mirror modes) are included. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio\nin the ringdown making identification of subdominant modes easier. In this\npaper we study, for the first time, black hole binaries with misaligned spins\nand find a much greater variation in the performance of ringdown fits than in\nthe aligned-spin case. The inclusion of mirror modes and higher harmonics,\nalong with overtones, improves the reliability of ringdown fits with an early\nstart time; however, there remain cases with poor performing fits. While using\novertones in conjunction with an early ringdown start time is an enticing\npossibility, it is necessary to proceed with caution. We also consider for the\nfirst time the use of numerical relativity surrogate models in this type of\nquasinormal mode study and address important questions of accuracy in the\nunderlying numerical waveforms used for the fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 09:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 09:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

We demonstrate this\ntechnique for Supernova 1972E, the nearest known SN Ia in over 125 years. Some\nmodels of Type Ia supernovae describe a white dwarf with a non-degenerate\ncompanion that donates enough mass to trigger thermonuclear detonation.\nHydrodynamic simulations and stellar evolution models show that these donor\nstars survive the explosion, and show increased luminosity for at least a\nthousand years. Thus, late-time observations of the exact location of a\nsupernova after its ejecta have faded can constrain the presence of a surviving\ndonor star and progenitor models. We find the explosion site of SN 1972E by\nanalyzing 17 digitized photographic plates taken with the European Southern\nObservatory 1m Schmidt and 1 plate taken with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American\nObservatory 1.5m telescope from 1972-1974.

The first policy (sometimes known as \"super-scoring\") allows students\nto report the max of the scores they achieve. The other policy requires that\nall scores be reported.\n  We find in our model that requiring that all scores be reported results in\nsuperior outcomes in equilibrium, both from the perspective of the college (the\nadmissions rule is more accurate), and from the perspective of equity across\npopulations: a student's probability of admission is independent of their\npopulation, conditional on their type. In particular, the false positive rates\nand false negative rates are identical in this setting, across the highly and\npoorly resourced student populations.

Self-supervised\nnetwork representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without\nexternal supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the\nlocal node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI\nfor short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node\nclassification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI\nmerely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information\nbetween node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal\n(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).\nSecondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges\nwith different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various\nrelations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a\nnovel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning\nnode embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more\nspecific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic\nand intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we\npropose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision\nsignal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node\nembedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate\nthe proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering\nand supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on these tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 16:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 15:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Methods: We employed\ntwo independent X-ray spectral-timing methods applied to the NICER data of MAXI\nJ1820+070. We first identified and tracked the evolution of a characteristic\nfrequency of soft X-ray reverberation lags. Then, we studied the spectral\nevolution of the quasi-thermal component responsible for the observed thermal\nreverberation lags. Results: The frequency of thermal reverberation lags\nsteadily increases throughout most of the outburst, implying that the relative\ndistance between the X-ray source and the disc decreases as the source softens.\nHowever, near transition this evolution breaks, showing a sudden increase\n(decrease) of lag amplitude (frequency). The temperature of the quasi-thermal\ncomponent in covariance spectra consistently increases throughout all the\nanalysed observations. Conclusions: The behaviour of thermal reverberation lags\nnear transition might be related to the relativistic plasma ejections detected\nat radio wavelengths, suggesting a causal connection between the two phenomena.\nThroughout most of the hard and hard-intermediate states the disc is consistent\nwith being truncated (with an inner radius $R_{\\rm in}>\\sim 10 R_{\\rm g}$),\nreaching close to the innermost stable circular orbit only near transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 20:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

For subaquatic granular flows, drag\nbetween grains and the pore fluid is substantially higher and the physical\nbehaviour is more complex. High drag forces constrain the rearrangement of\ngrains and dilatancy, leading to a considerable build-up of pore pressure. Its\ntransient and dynamic description is the key to modelling subaquatic granular\nflows but out of the scope of incompressible models. In this work, we advance\nfrom the incompressible $\\mu(I)$-rheology to the compressible\n$\\mu(J)$-$\\phi(J)$-rheology to account for pore pressure, dilatancy, and the\nscaling laws under subaquatic conditions. The model is supplemented with\ncritical state theory to yield the correct properties in the quasi-static\nlimit.

As these metrics rely on sorting predicted items' scores\n(and thus, on items' ranks), their derivatives are either undefined or zero\neverywhere. This makes them unsuitable for gradient-based optimisation, which\nis the usual method of learning appropriate scoring functions. Commonly used\nLTR loss functions are only loosely related to the evaluation metrics, causing\na mismatch between the optimisation objective and the evaluation criterion. In\nthis paper, we address this mismatch by proposing NeuralNDCG, a novel\ndifferentiable approximation to NDCG. Since NDCG relies on the\nnon-differentiable sorting operator, we obtain NeuralNDCG by relaxing that\noperator using NeuralSort, a differentiable approximation of sorting. As a\nresult, we obtain a new ranking loss function which is an arbitrarily accurate\napproximation to the evaluation metric, thus closing the gap between the\ntraining and the evaluation of LTR models. We introduce two variants of the\nproposed loss function. Finally, the empirical evaluation shows that our\nproposed method outperforms previous work aimed at direct optimisation of NDCG\nand is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 20:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 08:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Prototype generation methods aim to create a small set of\nsynthetic observations that accurately represent a training dataset but greatly\nreduce the computational cost of learning from it. Assigning soft labels to\nprototypes can allow increasingly small sets of prototypes to accurately\nrepresent the original training dataset.

Deviating from this trend, we study the fairness\nnotion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which\nserves as a sweet spot between the too stringent notion of ex-post\nenvy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. iEF is a\nnatural generalization of envy-freeness to random allocations in the sense that\na deterministic envy-free allocation is iEF (when viewed as a degenerate\nlottery). It is also certainly meaningful as it allows for a richer solution\nspace, which includes solutions that are provably better than envy-freeness\naccording to several criteria. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness\nnotions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency. Even though\nseveral of our results apply to general fair division problems, we are\nparticularly interested in instances with equal numbers of agents and items\nwhere allocations are perfect matchings of the items to the agents.\nEnvy-freeness can be trivially decided and (when it can be achieved, it)\nimplies full efficiency in this setting. Although computing iEF allocations in\nmatching allocation instances is considerably more challenging, we show how to\ncompute them in polynomial time, while also maximizing several efficiency\nobjectives.

We argue that in\ntrue open-world learning, the underlying feature representation should be\nlearned in a self-supervised manner. Under this self-supervised feature\nrepresentation, we introduce the problem of detecting unknowns as samples\nbelonging to Out-of-Label space. We differentiate between Out-of-Label space\ndetection and the conventional Out-of-Distribution detection depending upon\nwhether the unknowns being detected belong to the native-world (same as feature\nrepresentation) or a new-world, respectively. Our unifying open-world learning\nframework combines three individual research dimensions, which typically have\nbeen explored independently, i.e., Incremental Learning, Out-of-Distribution\ndetection and Open-World Learning.

The incremental learning component of our pipeline provides the new\nstate-of-the-art on established ImageNet-100 protocol.

In this paper, we\nargue that data-saving is still possible without impacting either users privacy\nor Webcompat. Our main observation is that Web images make up a large portion\nof Web traffic and have negligible impact on Webcompat. To this end we make two\nmain contributions. First, we quantify the potential savings that image\nmanipulation, such as dimension resizing, quality compression, and transcoding,\nenables at large scale: 300 landing and 880 internal pages. Next, we design and\nbuild Browselite, an entirely client-side tool that achieves such data savings\nthrough opportunistically instrumenting existing server-side tooling to perform\nimage compression, while simultaneously reducing the total amount of image data\nfetched. The effect of Browselite on the user experience is quantified using\nstandard page load metrics and a real user study of over 200 users across 50\noptimized web pages.

However, in practice, there is no test set: the\nground-truth is not known, so the number of possible pairs to predict over is\nquadratic in the number of nodes in the graph. Moreover, because graphs are\nsparse, most of these possible pairs will not be links. Thus, link prediction\nmethods, which often rely on proximity-preserving embeddings or heuristic\nnotions of node similarity, face a vast search space, with many pairs that are\nin close proximity, but that should not be linked. To mitigate this issue, we\nintroduce LinkWaldo, a framework for choosing from this quadratic,\nmassively-skewed search space of node pairs, a concise set of candidate pairs\nthat, in addition to being in close proximity, also structurally resemble the\nobserved edges. This allows it to ignore some high-proximity but\nlow-resemblance pairs, and also identify high-resemblance, lower-proximity\npairs. Our framework is built on a model that theoretically combines Stochastic\nBlock Models (SBMs) with node proximity models. The block structure of the SBM\nmaps out where in the search space new links are expected to fall, and the\nproximity identifies the most plausible links within these blocks, using\nlocality sensitive hashing to avoid expensive exhaustive search. LinkWaldo can\nuse any node representation learning or heuristic definition of proximity, and\ncan generate candidate pairs for any link prediction method, allowing the\nrepresentation power of current and future methods to be realized for link\nprediction in practice. We evaluate LinkWaldo on 13 networks across multiple\ndomains, and show that on average it returns candidate sets containing 7-33%\nmore missing and future links than both embedding-based and heuristic\nbaselines' sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 22:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

CO emission from\neach of the three galaxies is detected in deep NOEMA observations, allowing us\nto derive molecular gas fractions Mgas/Mstar of 13-23%. We also reconstruct the\nstar formation histories by fitting models to the observed photometry and\noptical spectroscopy, finding evidence for recent rejuvenation in one object,\nslow quenching in another, and rapid quenching in the third system. To better\nconstrain the quenching mechanism we explore the depletion times for our sample\nand other similar samples at z~0.7 from the literature. We find that the\ndepletion times are highly dependent on the method adopted to measure the star\nformation rate: using the UV+IR luminosity we obtain depletion times about 6\ntimes shorter than those derived using dust-corrected [OII] emission. When\nadopting the star formation rates from spectral fitting, which are arguably\nmore robust, we find that recently quenched galaxies and star-forming galaxies\nhave similar depletion times, while older quiescent systems have longer\ndepletion times.

In this paper, we\nconstrain the mass-loss prescriptions for red supergiants by using the rise\ntime and peak luminosity distribution of Type II supernovae in radio. We take\nthe de Jager and van Loon mass-loss rates for red supergiants, calculate the\nrise time and peak luminosity distribution based on them, and compare the\nresults with the observed distribution.

However, blockchain technology is far\nfrom homogeneous - not only with regard to its applications, which now go far\nbeyond cryptocurrencies and have reached businesses and the public sector, but\nalso with regard to its technical characteristics and, in particular, its power\nconsumption. This paper summarizes the status quo of the power consumption of\nvarious implementations of blockchain technology, with special emphasis on the\nrecent 'Bitcoin Halving' and so-called 'zk-rollups'. We argue that although\nBitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains do indeed consume a lot of power,\nalternative blockchain solutions with significantly lower power consumption are\nalready available today, and new promising concepts are being tested that could\nfurther reduce in particular the power consumption of large blockchain networks\nin the near future. From this we conclude that although the criticism of\nBitcoin's power consumption is legitimate, it should not be used to derive an\nenergy problem of blockchain technology in general. In many cases in which\nprocesses can be digitised or improved with the help of more energy-efficient\nblockchain variants, one can even expect net energy savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 22:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

An inherent property of real-world videos is the high correlation\nof information across frames which can translate into redundancy in either\ntemporal or spatial feature maps of the models, or both. The type of redundant\nfeatures depends on the dynamics and type of events in the video: static videos\nhave more temporal redundancy while videos focusing on objects tend to have\nmore channel redundancy. Here we present a redundancy reduction framework,\ntermed VA-RED$^2$, which is input-dependent. Specifically, our VA-RED$^2$\nframework uses an input-dependent policy to decide how many features need to be\ncomputed for temporal and channel dimensions. To keep the capacity of the\noriginal model, after fully computing the necessary features, we reconstruct\nthe remaining redundant features from those using cheap linear operations. We\nlearn the adaptive policy jointly with the network weights in a differentiable\nway with a shared-weight mechanism, making it highly efficient. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple video datasets and different visual tasks show that our\nframework achieves $20\\% - 40\\%$ reduction in computation (FLOPs) when compared\nto state-of-the-art methods without any performance loss.

We find that this \"flyby induced high-e migration\" could account for\na significant fraction of the observed HJ population, although the result\ndepends on several uncertain parameters, including the density and lifetime of\nbirth stellar clusters, and the occurrence rate of the \"cold Jupiter + outer\ncompanion\" systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 00:27:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 17:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

We propose a novel\ndeep-learning-based approach that directly predicts whole heart surface meshes\nfrom volumetric CT and MR image data. Our approach leverages a graph\nconvolutional neural network to predict deformation on mesh vertices from a\npre-defined mesh template to reconstruct multiple anatomical structures in a 3D\nimage volume. Our method demonstrated promising performance of generating whole\nheart reconstructions with as good or better accuracy than prior\ndeep-learning-based methods on both CT and MR data. Furthermore, by deforming a\ntemplate mesh, our method can generate whole heart geometries with better\nanatomical consistency and produce high-resolution geometries from lower\nresolution input image data. Our method was also able to produce temporally\nconsistent surface mesh predictions for heart motion from CT or MR cine\nsequences, and therefore can potentially be applied for efficiently\nconstructing 4D whole heart dynamics.

These\nlimitations manifest as compatibility conditions that relate the quantities\ndescribing the director field to the geometry of the embedding space. For\nexample, in two dimensions (2D) the splay and bend fields suffice to determine\na director uniquely (up to rigid motions) and must comply with one relation\nlinear in the Gaussian curvature of the embedding manifold. In 3D there are\nadditional local fields describing the director, i.e. fields available to a\nlocal observer residing within the material, and a number of distinct ways to\nyield geometric frustration. So far it was unknown how many such local fields\nare required to uniquely describe a 3D director field, nor what are the\ncompatibility relations they must satisfy. In this work, we address these\nquestions directly. We employ the method of moving frames to show that a\ndirector field is fully determined by five local fields. These fields are shown\nto be related to each other and to the curvature of the embedding space through\nsix differential relations. As an application of our method, we characterize\nall uniform distortion director fields, i.e., directors for which all the local\ncharacterizing fields are constant in space, in manifolds of constant\ncurvature. The classification of such phases has been recently provided for\ndirectors in Euclidean space, where the textures correspond to foliations of\nspace by parallel congruent helices. For non-vanishing curvature, we show that\nthe pure twist phase is the only solution in positively curved space, while in\nthe hyperbolic space uniform distortion fields correspond to foliations of\nspace by (non-necessarily parallel) congruent helices. Further analysis is\nexpected to allow to also construct of new non-uniform director fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 01:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 12:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

To this end, we propose Meta-MGNN, a novel model for\nfew-shot molecular property prediction. Meta-MGNN applies molecular graph\nneural network to learn molecular representation and builds a meta-learning\nframework for model optimization.

A simple and effective way is to extract\nkeywords directly from the knowledge-base of products, i.e., attributes or\ntitle, as the recommendation reason. However, generating recommendation reason\nfrom product knowledge doesn't naturally respond to users' interests.\nFortunately, on some E-commerce websites, there exists more and more\nuser-generated content (user-content for short), i.e., product\nquestion-answering (QA) discussions, which reflect user-cared aspects.\nTherefore, in this paper, we consider generating the recommendation reason by\ntaking into account not only the product attributes but also the\ncustomer-generated product QA discussions. In reality, adequate user-content is\nonly possible for the most popular commodities, whereas large sums of long-tail\nproducts or new products cannot gather a sufficient number of user-content. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a user-inspired multi-source posterior\ntransformer (MSPT), which induces the model reflecting the users' interests\nwith a posterior multiple QA discussions module, and generating recommendation\nreasons containing the product attributes as well as the user-cared aspects.\nExperimental results show that our model is superior to traditional generative\nmodels.

In this work, we make use of deep residual\nneural networks to solve the non-stationary ODE (flow equation) based on a\nEuler's discretization scheme. The central idea is to represent time-dependent\nvelocity fields as fully connected ReLU neural networks (building blocks) and\nderive optimal weights by minimizing a regularized loss function. Computing\nminimizing paths between deformations, thus between shapes, turns to find\noptimal network parameters by back-propagating over the intermediate building\nblocks. Geometrically, at each time step, ResNet-LDDMM searches for an optimal\npartition of the space into multiple polytopes, and then computes optimal\nvelocity vectors as affine transformations on each of these polytopes. As a\nresult, different parts of the shape, even if they are close (such as two\nfingers of a hand), can be made to belong to different polytopes, and therefore\nbe moved in different directions without costing too much energy.

Thus, an external human machine interface (eHMI) can be viewed as a\nnovel explicit communication method for providing driving intentions of an\nautomated driving vehicle (AV) to pedestrians when they need to negotiate in an\ninteraction, e.g., an encountering scene. However, the eHMI may not guarantee\nthat the pedestrians will fully recognize the intention of the AV.

The unreliable nature of wireless connectivity, together with\nconstraints in computing resources at edge devices, dictates that the local\nupdates at edge devices should be carefully crafted and compressed to match the\nwireless communication resources available and should work in concert with the\nreceiver. Thus motivated, we propose SGD-based bandlimited coordinate descent\nalgorithms for such settings. Specifically, for the wireless edge employing\nover-the-air computing, a common subset of k-coordinates of the gradient\nupdates across edge devices are selected by the receiver in each iteration, and\nthen transmitted simultaneously over k sub-carriers, each experiencing\ntime-varying channel conditions.

In general,\nthere is a tremendous gap between static and dynamic graph settings for the\nlazy simple random walk: Although $O(n^3)$ cover time was shown for any static\ngraphs of $n$ vertices, there is an edge-changing dynamic graph with an\nexponential hitting time. On the other hand, previous works indicate that the\nrandom walk on a dynamic graph with a time-homogeneous stationary distribution\nbehaves almost identically to that on a static graph.\n  In this paper, we strengthen this insight by obtaining general and improved\nbounds. Specifically, we consider a random walk according to a sequence\n$(P_t)_{t\\geq 1}$ of irreducible and reversible transition matrices such that\nall $P_t$ have the same stationary distribution. We bound the mixing, hitting,\nand cover times in terms of the hitting and relaxation times of the random walk\naccording to the worst fixed $P_t$. Moreover, we obtain the first bounds of the\nhitting and cover times of multiple random walks and the coalescing time on\ndynamic graphs. These bounds can be seen as an extension of the well-known\nbounds of random walks on static graphs. Our results generalize the previous\nupper bounds for specific random walks on dynamic graphs, e.g., lazy simple\nrandom walks and $d_{\\max}$-lazy walks, and give improved and tight upper\nbounds in various cases. As an interesting consequence of our generalization,\nwe obtain tight bounds for the lazy Metropolis walk [Nonaka, Ono, Sadakane, and\nYamashita, TCS10] on any dynamic graph: $O(n^2)$ mixing time, $O(n^2)$ hitting\ntime, and $O(n^2\\log n)$ cover time. Additionally, our coalescing time bound\nimplies the consensus time bound of the pull voting on a dynamic graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 01:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed\nproblem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs,\nwhere the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input\ngraph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our\nanalysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic\nconnectivity of graphs with signed edge weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 19:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

In this paper, a novel CD method based on the graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) and multiscale object-based technique is proposed\nfor both homogeneous and heterogeneous images. First, the object-wise high\nlevel features are obtained through a pre-trained U-net and the multiscale\nsegmentations. Treating each parcel as a node, the graph representations can be\nformed and then, fed into the proposed multiscale graph convolutional network\nwith each channel corresponding to one scale. The multiscale GCN propagates the\nlabel information from a small number of labeled nodes to the other ones which\nare unlabeled. Further, to comprehensively incorporate the information from the\noutput channels of multiscale GCN, a fusion strategy is designed using the\nfather-child relationships between scales.

In the SC-PIR system, a user aims to retrieve one out of $K$ files\nfrom $N$ servers while revealing nothing about its identity to any individual\nserver, in which the $K$ files are stored at the $N$ servers in an uncoded form\nand each server can store up to $\\mu K$ equivalent files, where $\\mu$ is the\nnormalized storage capacity of each server.

Then, the optimal sub-packetization for\ncapacity-achieving linear SC-PIR schemes is characterized as the solution to an\noptimization problem, which is typically hard to solve because of involving\nindicator functions. Moreover, a new notion of array called Storage Design\nArray (SDA) is introduced for the SC-PIR system. With any given SDA, an\nassociated capacity-achieving SC-PIR scheme is constructed. Next, the SC-PIR\nschemes that have equal-size packets are investigated.

Of particular interest are two-dimensional COFs, where the\norganic building units are linked by covalent bonds within a plane. Most\nproperties of these COFs are determined by the relative arrangement of\nneighboring layers. These are typically found to be laterally displaced, which,\nfor example, reduces the electronic coupling between the layers. In the present\ncontribution, we use dispersion-corrected density-functional theory to\nelucidate the origin of that displacement, showing that the common notion that\nthe displacement is a consequence of electrostatic repulsions of polar building\nblocks can be misleading.

One method of characterizing the robustness of a neural\nnetwork model is through its Lipschitz constant, which forms a robustness\ncertificate. A natural question to ask is, for a fixed model class (such as\nneural networks) and a dataset of size $n$, what is the smallest achievable\nLipschitz constant among all models that fit the dataset? Recently, (Bubeck et\nal., 2020) conjectured that when using two-layer networks with $k$ neurons to\nfit a generic dataset, the smallest Lipschitz constant is\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}})$. This implies that one would require one neuron\nper data point to robustly fit the data. In this work we derive a lower bound\non the Lipschitz constant for any arbitrary model class with bounded Rademacher\ncomplexity. Our result coincides with that conjectured in (Bubeck et al., 2020)\nfor two-layer networks under the assumption of bounded weights. However, due to\nour result's generality, we also derive bounds for multi-layer neural networks,\ndiscovering that one requires $\\log n$ constant-sized layers to robustly fit\nthe data. Thus, our work establishes a law of robustness for weight bounded\nneural networks and provides formal evidence on the necessity of\nover-parametrization in deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 11:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

These ideas are developed in a general, axiomatic setting, and\napplied to relational structures, where the comonadic constructions for\npebbling, Ehrenfeucht-Fra\\\"iss\\'e and modal bisimulation games recently\nintroduced by Abramsky et al. are recovered, showing that many of the\nfundamental notions of finite model theory and descriptive complexity arise\nfrom instances of arboreal covers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 12:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:35:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 21:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 16:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Hence, it is\ncrucial to implement fast and accurate algorithms for State of Health (SoH)\nmonitoring on the Battery Management System. The task is challenging due to the\ncomplexity and multitude of the factors contributing to the battery\ndegradation, especially because the different degradation processes occur at\nvarious timescales and their interactions play an important role. Data-driven\nmethods bypass this issue by approximating the complex processes with\nstatistical or machine learning models. This paper proposes a data-driven\napproach which is understudied in the context of battery degradation, despite\nits simplicity and ease of computation: the Multivariable Fractional Polynomial\n(MFP) regression. Models are trained from historical data of one exhausted cell\nand used to predict the SoH of other cells. The data are characterised by\nvarying loads simulating dynamic operating conditions. Two hypothetical\nscenarios are considered: one assumes that a recent capacity measurement is\nknown, the other is based only on the nominal capacity. It was shown that the\ndegradation behaviour of the batteries under examination is influenced by their\nhistorical data, as supported by the low prediction errors achieved (root mean\nsquared errors from 1.2% to 7.22% when considering data up to the battery End\nof Life). Moreover, we offer a multi-factor perspective where the degree of\nimpact of each different factor is analysed. Finally, we compare with a Long\nShort-Term Memory Neural Network and other works from the literature on the\nsame dataset. We conclude that the MFP regression is effective and competitive\nwith contemporary works, and provides several additional advantages e.g. in\nterms of interpretability, generalisability, and implementability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 12:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

The main challenge comes from the heterogeneity --\nthe diverse types of nodes and edges. Besides, for a given node in a HIN, the\nsignificance of a neighborhood node depends not only on the structural distance\nbut semantics. How to effectively capture both structural and semantic\nrelations is another challenge. The current state-of-the-art methods are based\non the algorithm of meta-path and therefore have a serious disadvantage -- the\nperformance depends on the arbitrary choosing of meta-path(s). However, the\nselection of meta-path(s) is experience-based and time-consuming.

Recently, researchers proposed different types of structural pruning\nintending to reduce also the computation complexity. In this work, we first\nsuggest a new measure called mask-diversity which correlates with the expected\naccuracy of the different types of structural pruning. We focus on the recently\nsuggested N:M fine-grained block sparsity mask, in which for each block of M\nweights, we have at least N zeros. While N:M fine-grained block sparsity allows\nacceleration in actual modern hardware, it can be used only to accelerate the\ninference phase. In order to allow for similar accelerations in the training\nphase, we suggest a novel transposable fine-grained sparsity mask, where the\nsame mask can be used for both forward and backward passes. Our transposable\nmask guarantees that both the weight matrix and its transpose follow the same\nsparsity pattern; thus, the matrix multiplication required for passing the\nerror backward can also be accelerated. We formulate the problem of finding the\noptimal transposable-mask as a minimum-cost flow problem. Additionally, to\nspeed up the minimum-cost flow computation, we also introduce a fast\nlinear-time approximation that can be used when the masks dynamically change\nduring training. Our experiments suggest a 2x speed-up in the matrix\nmultiplications with no accuracy degradation over vision and language models.\nFinally, to solve the problem of switching between different structure\nconstraints, we suggest a method to convert a pre-trained model with\nunstructured sparsity to an N:M fine-grained block sparsity model with little\nto no training.

Such activity is expected to drive the secular evolution of the nucleus\nand generate super winds, while the intense radiation fields and extreme gas\nand cosmic ray densities present may act to modify the outcome of star\nformation with respect to more quiescent galactic regions. The centre of the\nMilky Way is the only example of this phenomenon where, by virtue of its\nproximity, individual stars may be resolved. Previous studies have revealed\nthat it hosts a rich population of massive stars; these are located within\nthree clusters, with an additional contingent dispersed throughout the Central\nMolecular Zone (CMZ). We employed VLT+KMOS to obtain homogeneous, high S/N\nspectroscopy of the later cohort for classification and quantitative analysis.\nIncluding previously identified examples, we found a total of 83 isolated\nmassive stars within the Galactic Centre, which are biased towards objects\nsupporting powerful stellar winds and/or extensive circumstellar envelopes. No\nfurther stellar clusters, or their tidally stripped remnants, were identified,\nalthough an apparent stellar overdensity was found to be coincident with the\nSgr B1 star forming region. The cohort of isolated massive stars within the CMZ\nis comparable in size to that of the known clusters but, due to observational\nbiases, is likely highly incomplete at this time. Combining both populations\nyields over 320 spectroscopically classified stars that are expected to undergo\ncore collapse within the next 20Myr. Given that this is presumably an\nunderestimate of the true number, the population of massive stars associated\nwith the CMZ appears unprecedented amongst star formation complexes within the\nMilky Way, and one might anticipate that they play a substantial role in the\nenergetics and evolution of the nuclear region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 12:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

EXor-type objects are protostars that display powerful UV-optical\noutbursts caused by intermittent and powerful events of magnetospheric\naccretion.

Several parameters, such as plasma stream velocities,\ncharacteristic densities, and temperatures, can be retrieved from present\nobservations. As of yet, however, there is no information about the magnetic\nfield values and the exact underlying accretion scenario is also under\ndiscussion.\n  Methods. We use laboratory plasmas, created by a high power laser impacting a\nsolid target or by a plasma gun injector, and make these plasmas propagate\nperpendicularly to a strong external magnetic field. The propagating plasmas\nare found to be well scaled to the presently inferred parameters of EXor-type\naccretion event, thus allowing us to study the behaviour of such episodic\naccretion processes in scaled conditions.\n  Results. We propose a scenario of additional matter accretion in the\nequatorial plane, which claims to explain the increased accretion rates of the\nEXor objects, supported by the experimental demonstration of effective plasma\npropagation across the magnetic field. In particular, our laboratory\ninvestigation allows us to determine that the field strength in the accretion\nstream of EXor objects, in a position intermediate between the truncation\nradius and the stellar surface, should be of the order of 100 gauss. This, in\nturn, suggests a field strength of a few kilogausses on the stellar surface,\nwhich is similar to values inferred from observations of classical T Tauri\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 13:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

In this study, we investigate to what extent an automated visual\nanalysis of apartment floor plans on online real estate platforms can enhance\nhedonic rent price appraisal. We propose a tailored two-staged deep learning\napproach to learn price-relevant designs of floor plans from historical price\ndata. Subsequently, we integrate the floor plan predictions into hedonic rent\nprice models that account for both structural and locational characteristics of\nan apartment. Our empirical analysis based on a unique dataset of 9174 real\nestate listings suggests that current hedonic models underutilize the available\ndata. We find that (1) the visual design of floor plans has significant\nexplanatory power regarding rent prices - even after controlling for structural\nand locational apartment characteristics, and (2) harnessing floor plans\nresults in an up to 10.56% lower out-of-sample prediction error. We further\nfind that floor plans yield a particularly high gain in prediction performance\nfor older and smaller apartments. Altogether, our empirical findings contribute\nto the existing research body by establishing the link between the visual\ndesign of floor plans and real estate prices. Moreover, our approach has\nimportant implications for online real estate platforms, which can use our\nfindings to enhance user experience in their real estate listings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 14:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

For this method we prove\nthat the multiclass regret is exactly a weighted sum of constituent binary\nregrets where the weighing is determined by the tree structure.\n  We also introduce a leverage-hierarchical classification method, which\npotentially yields smaller log-loss and regret. The advantages of these\nclassification methods are demonstrated by simulation on both synthetic and\nreal-life datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 14:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

A\ndistinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set\nup under general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent,\nqueuing systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with\ntime-varying transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper.\nAlthough more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for\nexponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also\nsignificantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar\nlevel of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a\nsufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's\noccupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose\na class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a\nbalanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate\nthe approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess\nthe effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is\npossible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as\nthe mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 15:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to implement\neffective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to\nunderstand this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models\ncapable of predicting the impact of different scenarios. Besides, they should\nbe able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way, so to understand the\npossible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in\nrelation to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection.\nThis paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the\nCOVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction scenarios.

Results suggest that virus spreading would\nhave been similar if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on\na-priori risk parameters instead of a national lockdown would have been put in\nplace in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic.

This question remains fundamentally unresolved. In the\nmodeling of heat transfer problems with no phase change, the temperature and\nheat flux continuity conditions lead to the interface temperature. However, in\nproblems with phase change, the heat flux condition is used to determine the\namount of mass changing phase. This makes the interface temperature\nindeterminate unless an additional condition is imposed. A common approach in\nthe modeling of boiling is to assume that the interface attains the saturation\ntemperature according some measure of pressure at the interface. This\nassumption is usually applied even under highly non-equilibrium scenarios where\nsignificant temperature gradients and mass transport occur across the\ninterface. In this work, an ab-initio thermodynamic principle is introduced\nbased on the entropy production at the interface that fully specifies the\nassociated temperature under non-equilibrium scenarios. Physically, the\nthermodynamic principle provides a theoretical limit on the space of possible\nphase change rates that can occur by associating the mass flux with a\ncorresponding interfacial entropy production rate; a stronger statement is made\nthat a system with sufficient degrees of freedom selects the maximum entropy\nproduction, giving the observed phase change rate and associated interface\nproperties. This entropic principle captures experimental and computational\nvalues of the interface temperature that can deviate by over $50\\%$ from the\nassumed saturation values. It also accounts for temperature jumps\n(discontinuities) at the interface whose difference can exceed 15 degrees\nCelcius.

We identify the inverse radius, $1/R$, as the\ncontraction parameter. After the contraction, the resulting representation is\nfound to be the continuous spin representation in four dimensions. Even though\nthe scaling symmetry survives the contraction, but the special conformal\ntranslation vector changes and behaves like the four-momentum vector. We also\ndiscussed the generalization to $d$ dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 23:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

There are two common approaches to fitting\ngeometric shapes to data: the geometric (iterative) approach and algebraic\n(non-iterative) approach. The geometric approach is a nonlinear iterative\nmethod that minimizes the sum of the squares of Euclidean distances of the\nobserved points to the ellipses and regarded as the most accurate method, but\nit needs a good initial guess to improve the convergence rate. The algebraic\napproach is based on minimizing the algebraic distances with some constraints\nimposed on parametric space.
