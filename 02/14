Recommender systems (RS) for online games\nface unique challenges since they must fulfill players' distinct desires, at\ndifferent user levels, based on their action sequences of various action types.\nAlthough many sequential RS already exist, they are mainly single-sequence,\nsingle-task, and single-user-level. In this paper, we introduce a new\nsequential recommendation model for multiple sequences, multiple tasks, and\nmultiple user levels (abbreviated as M$^3$Rec) in Tencent Games platform, which\ncan fully utilize complex data in online games. We leverage Graph Neural\nNetwork and multi-task learning to design M$^3$Rec in order to model the\ncomplex information in the heterogeneous sequential recommendation scenario of\nTencent Games. We verify the effectiveness of M$^3$Rec on three online games of\nTencent Games platform, in both offline and online evaluations. The results\nshow that M$^3$Rec successfully addresses the challenges of recommendation in\nonline games, and it generates superior recommendations compared with\nstate-of-the-art sequential recommendation approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 16:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 13:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

In this contribution, we utilize attention to\nimprove the automatic detection of defect patterns for wafers within the domain\nof semiconductor manufacturing. Previous works in the domain have often\nutilized classical machine learning approaches such as KNNs, SVMs, or MLPs,\nwhile a few have already used modern approaches like deep neural networks\n(DNNs). However, one problem in the domain is that the faults are often very\nsmall and have to be detected within a larger size of the chip or even the\nwafer. Therefore, small structures in the size of pixels have to be detected in\na vast amount of image data. One interesting principle of the human brain for\nsolving this problem is visual attention. Hence, we employ here a biologically\nplausible model of visual attention for automatic visual inspection. We propose\na hybrid system of visual attention and a deep neural network. As demonstrated,\nour system achieves among other decisive advantages an improvement in accuracy\nfrom 81% to 92%, and an increase in accuracy for detecting faults from 67% to\n88%. Hence, the error rates are reduced from 19% to 8%, and notably from 33% to\n12% for detecting a fault in a chip. These results show that attention can\ngreatly improve the performance of visual inspection systems. Furthermore, we\nconduct a broad evaluation, identifying specific advantages of the biological\nattention model in this application, and benchmarks standard deep learning\napproaches as an alternative with and without attention.\n  This work is an extended arXiv version of the original conference article\npublished in \"IECON 2020\", which has been extended regarding visual attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 16:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

To address this challenge, we propose PerSim, a model-based offline\nRL approach which first learns a personalized simulator for each agent by\ncollectively using the historical trajectories across all agents, prior to\nlearning a policy. We do so by positing that the transition dynamics across\nagents can be represented as a latent function of latent factors associated\nwith agents, states, and actions; subsequently, we theoretically establish that\nthis function is well-approximated by a \"low-rank\" decomposition of separable\nagent, state, and action latent functions. This representation suggests a\nsimple, regularized neural network architecture to effectively learn the\ntransition dynamics per agent, even with scarce, offline data.

The simplest rearrangement in\nconfluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells,\ncalled a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must\nexecute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion\nmolecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time\ncompared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this\nidea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1\ntransitions, which we call the \"T1 delay time\". We study how variations in T1\ndelay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of\ntissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based\ntimescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show\nthat the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale\ncollective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two.\nWe extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent\nextension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1\ndelay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and\nrosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a\nmore elastic-like -- and less fluid-like -- tissue response. Our work suggests\nthat molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen\nglobal tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 02:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

However,\ncorrectly using security APIs is usually challenging for developers who lack\ncybersecurity training. Prior work shows that many developers misuse security\nAPIs; such misuses can introduce vulnerabilities into software, void security\nprotections, and present security exploits to hackers. To eliminate such\nAPI-related vulnerabilities, this paper presents SEADER -- our new approach\nthat detects and repairs security API misuses. Given an exemplar, insecure code\nsnippet, and its secure counterpart, SEADER compares the snippets and conducts\ndata dependence analysis to infer the security API misuse templates and\ncorresponding fixing operations. Based on the inferred information, given a\nprogram, SEADER performs inter-procedural static analysis to search for any\nsecurity API misuse and to propose customized fixing suggestions for those\nvulnerabilities.\n  To evaluate SEADER, we applied it to 25 <insecure, secure> code pairs, and\nSEADER successfully inferred 18 unique API misuse templates and related fixes.\nWith these vulnerability repair patterns, we further applied SEADER to 10\nopen-source projects that contain in total 32 known vulnerabilities. Our\nexperiment shows that SEADER detected vulnerabilities with 100% precision, 84%\nrecall, and 91% accuracy. Additionally, we applied SEADER to 100 Apache\nopen-source projects and detected 988 vulnerabilities; SEADER always customized\nrepair suggestions correctly. Based on SEADER's outputs, we filed 60 pull\nrequests. Up till now, developers of 18 projects have offered positive\nfeedbacks on SEADER's suggestions. Our results indicate that SEADER can\neffectively help developers detect and fix security API misuses. Whereas prior\nwork either detects API misuses or suggests simple fixes, SEADER is the first\ntool to do both for nontrivial vulnerability repairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 20:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

We\nidentify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal\ndefinitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash\ntrading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and\ntwo-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify\nthese activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30\\% of all traded\ntokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the\ntokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for\nfuture research. Our findings underpin the need for countermeasures that are\napplicable in decentralized systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 20:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

In this paper, we propose a new and enhanced multiple access mechanism\nbased on the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Federated\nlearning (FL). A new Monte Carlo (MC) reward updating method for DRL training\nis proposed and the access history of each station is used to derive a\nDRL-based MAC protocol that improves the network throughput vis-a-vis the\ntraditional distributed coordination function (DCF). Further, federated\nlearning (FL) is applied to achieve fairness among users. The simulation\nresults showcase that the proposed federated reinforcement multiple access\n(FRMA) performs better than basic DCF by 20% and DCF with\nrequest-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) by 5% while guaranteeing the fairness\nin user-dense scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 22:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Technically, we model each intent as an attentive combination\nof KG relations, encouraging the independence of different intents for better\nmodel capability and interpretability.

In this paper, we propose the notion of\ndoping -- addition of an extremely sparse matrix to a structured matrix. Doping\nfacilitates additional degrees of freedom for a small number of parameters,\nallowing them to independently diverge from the fixed structure. To train LSTMs\nwith doped structured matrices, we introduce the additional parameter matrix\nwhile slowly annealing its sparsity level. However, we find that performance\ndegrades as we slowly sparsify the doping matrix, due to co-matrix adaptation\n(CMA) between the structured and the sparse matrices. We address this over\ndependence on the sparse matrix using a co-matrix dropout regularization (CMR)\nscheme. We provide empirical evidence to show that doping, CMA and CMR are\nconcepts generally applicable to multiple structured matrices (Kronecker\nProduct, LMF, Hybrid Matrix Decomposition). Additionally, results with doped\nkronecker product matrices demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy at large\ncompression factors (10 - 25x) across 4 natural language processing\napplications with minor loss in accuracy. Doped KP compression technique\noutperforms previous state-of-the art compression results by achieving 1.3 -\n2.4x higher compression factor at a similar accuracy, while also beating strong\nalternatives like pruning and low-rank methods by a large margin (8% or more).\nAdditionally, we show that doped KP can be deployed on commodity hardware using\nthe current software stack and achieve 2.5 - 5.5x inference run-time speed-up\nover baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 05:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Our goal\nis to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of\nconvolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN\narchitecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based\ngenerator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly\na multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and\nlow-level textures.

Our best architecture achieves\nhighly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using\nconvolutional backbones.

However, the fruits of representation learning have\nyet to be fully-realized in federated settings. Although data in federated\nsettings is often non-i.i.d. across clients, the success of centralized deep\nlearning suggests that data often shares a global feature representation, while\nthe statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks is concentrated in the\nlabels. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel federated learning\nframework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across\nclients and unique local heads for each client. Our algorithm harnesses the\ndistributed computational power across clients to perform many local-updates\nwith respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the\nrepresentation.

Compared to structure-aware encodings, computation-aware\nencodings map architectures with similar accuracies to the same region, which\nimproves the downstream architecture search performance (Zhang et al., 2019;\nWhite et al., 2020a). In this work, we introduce a Computation-Aware\nTransformer-based Encoding method called CATE.

We compare CATE with eleven encodings under three major\nencoding-dependent NAS subroutines in both small and large search spaces.

Moreover, BP decoding\nof stabilizer codes suffers a performance loss from the short cycles in the\nunderlying Tanner graph. In this paper, we propose a refined BP algorithm for\ndecoding quantum codes by passing scalar messages. For a given error syndrome,\nthis algorithm decodes to the same output as the conventional quaternary BP but\nwith a check-node complexity the same as binary BP.

One solution to this problem is to model the click\nand the reading duration simultaneously under the multi-task learning (MTL)\nframework. There are two challenges in the modeling.

There is a rational\ninformation designer (designer) who possesses one signal source and aims to\ncontrol the equilibrium behaviors of the agents by designing the information\nstructure of her signals sent to the agents. An obedient principle is\nestablished which states that it is without loss of generality to focus on the\ndirect information design when the information design incentivizes each agent\nto select the signal sent by the designer, such that the design process avoids\nthe predictions of the agents' strategic selection behaviors.

However, with\nincreasing number of antenna elements, the ability of allocating a single\nRF-chain per antenna becomes infeasible and unaffordable. As a cost-effective\nalternative, the design of hybrid precoding has been considered where the\nlimited-scattering signals are captured by a high-dimensional RF precoder\nrealized by an analog phase-shifter network followed by a low-dimensional\ndigital precoder at baseband. In this paper, the max-min fair problem is\nconsidered to design a low-complexity hybrid precoder for multi-group\nmulticasting systems in mmWave channels. The problem is non-trivial due to two\nmain reasons: the original max-min problem for multi-group multicasting for a\nfully-digital precoder is non-convex, and the analog precoder places constant\nmodules constraint which restricts the feasible set of the precoders in the\ndesign problem. Therefore, we consider a low complexity hybrid precoder design\nto tackle and benefit from the mmWave channel structure. Each analog beamformer\nwas designed to maximize the minimum matching component for users within a\ngiven group. Once obtained, the digital precoder was attained by solving the\nmax-min problem of the equivalent channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 15:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

DCM is typically analyzed with the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm. However, because the inversion of a large-scale continuous\nsystem is difficult when noisy observations are present, DCM by EM is typically\nlimited to a small number of compartments ($<10$). Another drawback with the\ncurrent method is its complexity; when the forward model changes, the posterior\nmean changes, and we need to re-derive the algorithm for optimization. In this\nproject, we propose the Multiple-Shooting Adjoint (MSA) method to address these\nlimitations. MSA uses the multiple-shooting method for parameter estimation in\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) under noisy observations, and is\nsuitable for large-scale systems such as whole-brain analysis in functional MRI\n(fMRI). Furthermore, MSA uses the adjoint method for accurate gradient\nestimation in the ODE; since the adjoint method is generic, MSA is a generic\nmethod for both linear and non-linear systems, and does not require\nre-derivation of the algorithm as in EM. We validate MSA in extensive\nexperiments: 1) in toy examples with both linear and non-linear models, we show\nthat MSA achieves better accuracy in parameter value estimation than EM;\nfurthermore, MSA can be successfully applied to large systems with up to 100\ncompartments; and 2) using real fMRI data, we apply MSA to the estimation of\nthe whole-brain effective connectome and show improved classification of autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD) vs. control compared to using the functional\nconnectome.

In this article, the author\nexamines the computational aspects of a new class of rings called Halidon rings\nand their applications with the help of computer codes. In representation\ntheory, Maschke's theorem has an important role in studying the irreducible\nsubrepresentations of a given group representation. Mainly the study is related\nto a finite field of characteristic which does not divide the order of the\ngiven finite group or the field of real or complex numbers. This article also\nexamines the possibility of replacing the finite field in the theorem with\nhalidon rings in such a way that the theorem is still valid. Halidon rings are\nrings with the unit element, containing a primitive $m^{th}$ root of unity and\n$m$ is invertible in the ring. The field of complex numbers is a halidon ring\nwith any index $ m \\geq 1$. Some computer codes have been developed to\nestablish the existence of halidon rings which are not fields and the\ncomputation of units, involutions and idempotents in both halidon rings and\nhalidon group rings. The application halidon rings in Discrete Fourier\nTransform (DFT) is studied and two computer codes have been developed to\ncalculate DFT and inverse DFT\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 16:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 17:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}
