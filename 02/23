For Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), current research strategies for explaining models focus on the\ntarget classes within the associated training dataset. As a result, the\nunderstanding of hidden feature map activations is limited by the\ndiscriminative knowledge gleaned during training. The aim of our work is to\nexplain and expand CNNs models via the mirroring or alignment of CNN to an\nexternal knowledge base. This will allow us to give a semantic context or label\nfor each visual feature. We can match CNN feature activations to nodes in our\nexternal knowledge base. This supports knowledge-based interpretation of the\nfeatures associated with model decisions. To demonstrate our approach, we build\ntwo separate graphs. We use an entity alignment method to align the feature\nnodes in a CNN with the nodes in a ConceptNet based knowledge graph. We then\nmeasure the proximity of CNN graph nodes to semantically meaningful knowledge\nbase nodes. Our results show that in the aligned embedding space, nodes from\nthe knowledge graph are close to the CNN feature nodes that have similar\nmeanings, indicating that nodes from an external knowledge base can act as\nexplanatory semantic references for features in the model. We analyse a variety\nof graph building methods in order to improve the results from our embedding\nspace. We further demonstrate that by using hierarchical relationships from our\nexternal knowledge base, we can locate new unseen classes outside the CNN\ntraining set in our embeddings space, based on visual feature activations. This\nsuggests that we can adapt our approach to identify unseen classes based on CNN\nfeature activations. Our demonstrated approach of aligning a CNN with an\nexternal knowledge base paves the way to reason about and beyond the trained\nmodel, with future adaptations to explainable models and zero-shot learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

This\nvorticity amplification comes about through two different instability\nmechanisms of the initial vortex tubes, assumed anti-parallel and with a mirror\nplane of symmetry. At moderate Reynolds number, the tubes destabilize via a\nCrow instability, with the nonlinear development leading to strong flattening\nof the cores into thin sheets. These sheets then break down into filaments\nwhich can repeat the process. At higher Reynolds number, the instability\nproceeds via the elliptical instability, producing vortex tubes that are\nperpendicular to the original tube directions. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat these same transition between Crow and Elliptical instability occurs at\nmoderate Reynolds number when we vary the initial angle $\\beta$ between two\nstraight vortex tubes. We demonstrate that when the angle between the two tubes\nis close to $\\pi/2$, the interaction between tubes leads to the formation of\nthin vortex sheets. The subsequent breakdown of these sheets involves a\ntwisting of the paired sheets, followed by the appearance of a localized cloud\nof small scale vortex structures. At smaller values of the angle $\\beta$\nbetween the two tubes, the breakdown mechanism changes to an elliptic\ncascade-like mechanism. Whereas the interaction of two vortices depends on the\ninitial condition, the rapid formation of fine-scales vortex structures appears\nto be a robust feature, possibly universal at very high Reynolds numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 16:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

To distinguish between supercritically accreting BHs, weakly or\nstrongly magnetised NSs, we study the long-term X-ray spectral evolution of a\nsample of 17 ULXs, 6 of which are known to host NSs.

Due to the unbearable labeling cost,\nexisting methods are predominately developed in an unsupervised manner.\nNonetheless, the anomalies they identify may turn out to be data noises or\nuninteresting data instances due to the lack of prior knowledge on the\nanomalies of interest. Hence, it is critical to investigate and develop\nfew-shot learning for network anomaly detection.

Superspreaders represent a group of people\nwho have much more social contacts than others. The widespread deployment of\nWLAN infrastructure enables non-invasive contact tracing via people's\nubiquitous mobile devices. This technology offers promise for detecting\nsuperspreaders. In this paper, we propose a general framework for\nWLAN-log-based superspreader detection. In our framework, we first use WLAN\nlogs to construct contact graphs by jointly considering human symmetric and\nasymmetric interactions. Next, we adopt three vertex centrality measurements\nover the contact graphs to generate three groups of superspreader candidates.\nFinally, we leverage SEIR simulation to determine groups of superspreaders\namong these candidates, who are the most critical individuals for the spread of\ndisease based on the simulation results. We have implemented our framework and\nevaluate it over a WLAN dataset with 41 million log entries from a large-scale\nuniversity. Our evaluation shows superspreaders exist on university campuses.\nThey change over the first few weeks of a semester, but stabilize throughout\nthe rest of the term. The data also demonstrate that both symmetric and\nasymmetric contact tracing can discover superspreaders, but the latter performs\nbetter with daily contact graphs. Further, the evaluation shows no consistent\ndifferences among three vertex centrality measures for long-term (i.e., weekly)\ncontact graphs, which necessitates the inclusion of SEIR simulation in our\nframework. We believe our proposed framework and these results may provide\ntimely guidance for public health administrators regarding effective testing,\nintervention, and vaccination policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 16:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 04:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

It is a hot\nand active domain that strives to handle several core issues; particularly,\nwhich tasks are correlated and similar, and how to share the knowledge among\ncorrelated tasks. Existing works usually do not distinguish the polarity and\nmagnitude of feature weights and commonly rely on linear correlation, due to\nthree major technical challenges in: 1) optimizing the models that regularize\nfeature weight polarity, 2) deciding whether to regularize sign or magnitude,\n3) identifying which tasks should share their sign and/or magnitude patterns.\nTo address them, this paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework that\ncan regularize feature weight signs across tasks. We innovatively formulate it\nas a biconvex inequality constrained optimization with slacks and propose a new\nefficient algorithm for the optimization with theoretical guarantees on\ngeneralization performance and convergence.

Even though he published only three papers, much more\nmaterial is available, beginning with the records of his many interventions at\nthe Chapel Hill conference in 1957, which are here analyzed in detail, and show\nthat he had already considerably developed his ideas on gravity.

Popular methods that have been largely employed till date for\nestimation of such treatment effects suffer from slow rates of convergence\n(i.e. slower than $\\sqrt{n}$). In this paper, we present a new model coined\nSCENTS: Score Explained Non-Randomized Treatment Systems, and a corresponding\nmethod that allows estimation of the treatment effect at $\\sqrt{n}$ rate in the\npresence of fairly general forms of confoundedness, when the `score' variable\non whose basis treatment is assigned can be explained via certain feature\nmeasurements of the individuals under study.

The latter is usually based on the so-called relative\nentropy of coherence, a widely used quantifier in quantum resource theories. In\nthis paper we argue that, despite satisfying fluctuation theorems and having a\nclear resource-theoretic interpretation, this splitting has shortcomings.\nFirst, it predicts that at low temperatures the entropy production will always\nbe dominated by the classical term, irrespective of the quantum nature of the\nprocess. Second, for infinitesimal quenches, the radius of convergence diverges\nexponentially as the temperature decreases, rendering the functions\nnon-analytic. Motivated by this, we provide here a complementary approach,\nwhere the entropy production is split in a way such that the contributions from\npopulations and coherences are written in terms of a thermal state of a\nspecially dephased Hamiltonian. The physical interpretation of our proposal is\ndiscussed in detail. We also contrast the two approaches by studying work\nprotocols in a transverse field Ising chain, and a macrospin of varying\ndimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 18:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 13:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Both the angularly-resolved and the\nangularly-integrated spectra are reported, which are valid in an arbitrary\nplane wave.

The SHMR for\nmassive galaxies varies more or less continuously, from rising to falling, with\ndecreasing disc fraction and decreasing Hubble type.

An important question is to\nunderstand what is special about maximally chaotic systems which saturate this\nbound. Here we provide further evidence for the `hydrodynamic' origin of chaos\nin such systems, and discuss hallmarks of maximally chaotic systems. We first\nprovide evidence that a hydrodynamic effective field theory of chaos we\npreviously proposed should be understood as a theory of maximally chaotic\nsystems. We then emphasize and make explicit a signature of maximal chaos which\nwas only implicit in prior literature, namely the suppression of exponential\ngrowth in commutator squares of generic few-body operators.

Compared to existing models,\nour model estimates all rather than a finite subset of quantiles, scales well\nto high dimensions, and accounts for estimation uncertainty. While the model is\narbitrarily flexible, interpretable marginal quantile effects are estimated\nusing accumulative local effect plots and variable importance measures. A\nsimulation study shows that our model can better recover quantiles of the\nresponse distribution when the data is sparse, and an analysis of birth weight\ndata is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 19:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 20:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 04:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

In this work, active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) activity in different environments has been studied. The\nfractions of radio and optical AGN in four different environments have been\ncompared using samples of void, isolated, group member, and the brightest group\ngalaxies (BGGs). Galaxies in voids show significantly lower stellar ages,\nconcentrations, colours and surface mass densities, and they experience more\none-on-one interactions compared to the isolated galaxies and galaxies in\ngroups. In order to study pure environmental effects, the biases caused by the\nstellar mass and galaxy type quantified by 4000$\\AA$ break strength have been\nremoved. While the results confirm no dependence of the optical AGN activity on\nenvironment in blue galaxies and with lower significance in green galaxies, a\nhigher fraction of optical AGN has been observed for the massive red galaxies\nin voids compared to the galaxies in dense environments. This may be related to\nthe higher amount of one-on-one interaction observed in the void galaxies, or\nit may reflect more fundamental differences in the host galaxies or\nenvironments of the voids. The radio-mode AGN activity increases in dense\nenvironment for red galaxies. No changes in the radio-loud AGN fraction have\nbeen observed for the blue and green galaxies. This shows that the effect of\nenvironment on AGN activity is not significant in the presence of cold gas in\ngalaxies. We also discuss whether the efficiency of gas accretion depends on\nthe properties of the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 19:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Mutation analysis is considered one of the strongest test-adequacy\ncriteria. Mutation testing builds on top of mutation analysis and is a testing\ntechnique that uses mutants as test goals to create or improve a test suite.\nMutation testing has long been considered intractable because the sheer number\nof mutants that can be created represents an insurmountable problem -- both in\nterms of human and computational effort. This has hindered the adoption of\nmutation testing as an industry standard. For example, Google has a codebase of\ntwo billion lines of code and more than 500,000,000 tests are executed on a\ndaily basis. The traditional approach to mutation testing does not scale to\nsuch an environment. To address these challenges, this paper presents a\nscalable approach to mutation testing based on the following main ideas: (1)\nMutation testing is done incrementally, mutating only changed code during code\nreview, rather than the entire code base; (2) Mutants are filtered, removing\nmutants that are likely to be irrelevant to developers, and limiting the number\nof mutants per line and per code review process; (3) Mutants are selected based\non the historical performance of mutation operators, further eliminating\nirrelevant mutants and improving mutant quality. Evaluation in a\ncode-review-based setting with more than 24,000 developers on more than 1,000\nprojects shows that the proposed approach produces orders of magnitude fewer\nmutants and that context-based mutant filtering and selection improve mutant\nquality and actionability.

Methods: A 3D U-NET was\nutilized to output dose predictions using organ-at-risk (OAR), high-risk\nclinical target volume (HRCTV), and possible source locations. A sample of\nprevious T&O treatments comprising 397 cases (273 training:62 validation:62\ntest), HRCTV and OARs (bladder/rectum/sigmoid) was used. Structures and dose\nwere interpolated to 1x1x2.5mm3 dose planes with two input channels (source\npositions, voxel identification) and one output channel for dose. We evaluated\ndose difference (\\Delta D)(xyz)=D_(actual)(x,y,z)-D_(predicted)(x,y,z) and dice\nsimilarity coefficients in all cohorts across the clinically-relevant dose\nrange (20-130% of prescription), mean and standard deviation. We also examined\ndiscrete DVH metrics used for T&O plan quality assessment: HRCTV D_90%(dose to\nhottest 90% volume) and OAR D_2cc, with \\Delta\nD_x=D_(x,actual)-D_(x,predicted). Pearson correlation coefficient, standard\ndeviation, and mean quantified model performance on the clinical metrics.\nResults: Voxel-wise dose difference accuracy for 20-130% dose range for\ntraining(test) ranges for mean (\\Delta D) and standard deviation for all voxels\nwas [-0.3%+/-2.0% to +1.0%+/-12.0%] ([-0.1%+/-4% to +4.0%+/-26%]). Voxel-wise\ndice similarity coefficients for 20-130% dose ranged from [0.96, 0.91]([0.94,\n0.87]).

Being\npre-defined, however, these codebooks are commonly not optimized for specific\nenvironments, user distributions, and/or possible hardware impairments. This\nleads to large codebook sizes with high beam training overhead which increases\nthe initial access/tracking latency and makes it hard for these systems to\nsupport highly mobile applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper\ndevelops a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns how to iteratively\noptimize the codebook beam patterns (shapes) relying only on the receive power\nmeasurements and without requiring any explicit channel knowledge. The\ndeveloped model learns how to autonomously adapt the beam patterns to best\nmatch the surrounding environment, user distribution, hardware impairments, and\narray geometry. Further, this approach does not require any knowledge about the\nchannel, array geometry, RF hardware, or user positions. To reduce the learning\ntime, the proposed model designs a novel Wolpertinger-variant architecture that\nis capable of efficiently searching for an optimal policy in a large discrete\naction space, which is important for large antenna arrays with quantized phase\nshifters. This complex-valued neural network architecture design respects the\npractical RF hardware constraints such as the constant-modulus and quantized\nphase shifter constraints.

Compared to\nconventional 2D images, OIs can provide more immersive experience to consumers,\nbenefitting from the higher resolution and plentiful field of views (FoVs).\nMoreover, observing OIs is usually in the head mounted display (HMD) without\nreferences. Therefore, an efficient blind quality assessment method, which is\nspecifically designed for 360-degree images, is urgently desired. In this\npaper, motivated by the characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) and\nthe viewing process of VR visual contents, we propose a novel and effective\nno-reference omnidirectional image quality assessment (NR OIQA) algorithm by\nMulti-Frequency Information and Local-Global Naturalness (MFILGN).\nSpecifically, inspired by the frequency-dependent property of visual cortex, we\nfirst decompose the projected equirectangular projection (ERP) maps into\nwavelet subbands. Then, the entropy intensities of low and high frequency\nsubbands are exploited to measure the multi-frequency information of OIs.\nBesides, except for considering the global naturalness of ERP maps, owing to\nthe browsed FoVs, we extract the natural scene statistics features from each\nviewport image as the measure of local naturalness. With the proposed\nmulti-frequency information measurement and local-global naturalness\nmeasurement, we utilize support vector regression as the final image quality\nregressor to train the quality evaluation model from visual quality-related\nfeatures to human ratings. To our knowledge, the proposed model is the first\nno-reference quality assessment method for 360-degreee images that combines\nmulti-frequency information and image naturalness. Experimental results on two\npublicly available OIQA databases demonstrate that our proposed MFILGN\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 22:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Here we\nstudy a class of recurrent neural networks called combinatorial\nthreshold-linear networks (CTLNs) whose dynamics are determined by the\nstructure of a directed graph. They are a special case of TLNs, a popular\nframework for modeling neural activity in computational neuroscience. In prior\nwork, CTLNs were found to be surprisingly tractable mathematically. For small\nnetworks, the fixed points of the network dynamics can often be completely\ndetermined via a series of graph rules that can be applied directly to the\nunderlying graph. For larger networks, it remains a challenge to understand how\nthe global structure of the network interacts with local properties. In this\nwork, we propose a method of covering graphs of CTLNs with a set of smaller\ndirectional graphs that reflect the local flow of activity. While directional\ngraphs may or may not have a feedforward architecture, their fixed point\nstructure is indicative of feedforward dynamics. The combinatorial structure of\nthe graph cover is captured by the nerve of the cover. The nerve is a smaller,\nsimpler graph that is more amenable to graphical analysis. We present three\nnerve theorems that provide strong constraints on the fixed points of the\nunderlying network from the structure of the nerve. We then illustrate the\npower of these theorems with some examples.

Recently, machine learning techniques have emerged as\na powerful and cost-effective strategy to learn from existing datasets and\nperform predictions on unseen molecules. Accordingly, the explosive rise of\ndata-driven techniques raises an important question: What confidence can be\nassigned to molecular property predictions and what techniques can be used for\nthat purpose?\n  Areas covered: In this work, we discuss popular strategies for predicting\nmolecular properties relevant to drug design, their corresponding uncertainty\nsources and methods to quantify uncertainty and confidence. First, our\nconsiderations for assessing confidence begin with dataset bias and size,\ndata-driven property prediction and feature design. Next, we discuss property\nsimulation via molecular docking, and free-energy simulations of binding\naffinity in detail. Lastly, we investigate how these uncertainties propagate to\ngenerative models, as they are usually coupled with property predictors.\n  Expert opinion: Computational techniques are paramount to reduce the\nprohibitive cost and timing of brute-force experimentation when exploring the\nenormous chemical space. We believe that assessing uncertainty in property\nprediction models is essential whenever closed-loop drug design campaigns\nrelying on high-throughput virtual screening are deployed. Accordingly,\nconsidering sources of uncertainty leads to better-informed experimental\nvalidations, more reliable predictions and to more realistic expectations of\nthe entire workflow. Overall, this increases confidence in the predictions and\ndesigns and, ultimately, accelerates drug design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 01:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Recent\nworks have suggested that multi-modal deep learning analysis can benefit from\nexplicitly disentangling anatomical (shape) and modality (appearance)\ninformation into separate image presentations. In this work, we challenge\nmainstream strategies by showing that they do not naturally lead to\nrepresentation disentanglement both in theory and in practice. To address this\nissue, we propose a margin loss that regularizes the similarity in\nrelationships of the representations across subjects and modalities. To enable\nrobust training, we further use a conditional convolution to design a single\nmodel for encoding images of all modalities. Lastly, we propose a fusion\nfunction to combine the disentangled anatomical representations as a set of\nmodality-invariant features for downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on three multi-modal neuroimaging datasets. Experiments show that our\nproposed method can achieve superior disentangled representations compared to\nexisting disentanglement strategies. Results also indicate that the fused\nanatomical representation has potential in the downstream task of zero-dose PET\nreconstruction and brain tumor segmentation.

This paper first proposes a topic\nmodel for audio descriptions, comprehensively analyzing the hierarchical audio\ntopics that are commonly covered. We then explore a transfer learning scheme to\naccess local and global information. Two source tasks are identified to\nrespectively represent local and global information, being Audio Tagging (AT)\nand Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC). Experiments are conducted on the AAC\nbenchmark dataset Clotho and Audiocaps, amounting to a vast increase in all\neight metrics with topic transfer learning.

Considering\nthe ever-evolving Web data and new emerging categories, instead of the\nlaborious supervised setting, in this paper, we focus on the\nminimally-supervised setting that aims to categorize documents effectively,\nwith a couple of seed documents annotated per category. We recognize that texts\ncollected from the Web are often structure-rich, i.e., accompanied by various\nmetadata. One can easily organize the corpus into a text-rich network, joining\nraw text documents with document attributes, high-quality phrases, label\nsurface names as nodes, and their associations as edges. Such a network\nprovides a holistic view of the corpus' heterogeneous data sources and enables\na joint optimization for network-based analysis and deep textual model\ntraining. We therefore propose a novel framework for minimally supervised\ncategorization by learning from the text-rich network. Specifically, we jointly\ntrain two modules with different inductive biases -- a text analysis module for\ntext understanding and a network learning module for class-discriminative,\nscalable network learning. Each module generates pseudo training labels from\nthe unlabeled document set, and both modules mutually enhance each other by\nco-training using pooled pseudo labels.

A recent work by\nAsharov, Lin, and Shi (SODA'21) showed that if the elements to be sorted have\nshort keys whose length $k = o(\\log n)$, then one can indeed overcome the\n$n\\log n$ barrier for sorting circuits, by leveraging non-comparison-based\ntechniques. More specifically, Asharov et al.~showed that there exist $O(n)\n\\cdot \\min(k, \\log n)$-sized sorting circuits for $k$-bit keys, ignoring\n$poly\\log^*$ factors. Interestingly, the recent works by Farhadi et al.\n(STOC'19) and Asharov et al.

Note also that proving any {\\it unconditional}\nsuper-linear circuit lower bound for a wide class of problems is beyond the\nreach of current techniques.\n  Unfortunately, the approach taken by Asharov et al.~to achieve optimality in\nsize somewhat crucially relies on sacrificing the depth: specifically, their\ncircuit is super-{\\it poly}logarithmic in depth even for 1-bit keys. Asharov et\nal.~phrase it as an open question how to achieve optimality both in size and\ndepth. In this paper, we close this important gap in our understanding. We\nconstruct a sorting circuit of size $O(n) \\cdot \\min(k, \\log n)$ (ignoring\n$poly\\log^*$ terms) and depth $O(\\log n)$.

To be precise, given is an $n\\times m$ pattern matrix ($n\\le m$) whose\nentries take fixed zero, unknown generic values, and missing values that are\nfree to be chosen from the complex field, the question of interest is whether\nthere is a matrix completion with rank no more than $n-k$ ($k\\ge 1$) for almost\nall values of the unknown generic entries, which is called the generic low-rank\nmatrix completion (GLRMC) associated with $({\\cal M},k)$, and abbreviated as\nGLRMC$({\\cal M},k)$.

The\nobserved spectra are commonly fitted using simple 1-Temperature (1-T) or 2-T\nmodels. However, the actual temperature distribution of the gas can be complex\nbecause of the interaction between galactic outflows and halo gas. Here we\ndemonstrate this by analysing 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of the CGM with a\nrealistic outflow model. We investigate the physical properties of the\nsimulated hot CGM, which shows a broad distribution in density, temperature,\nand metallicity. By constructing and fitting the simulated spectra, we show\nthat, while the 1-T and 2-T models are able to fit the synthesized spectra\nreasonably well, the inferred temperature(s) does not bear much physical\nmeaning. Instead, we propose a log-normal distribution as a more physical\nmodel. The log-normal model better fits the simulated spectra while reproducing\nthe gas temperature distribution. We also show that when the star formation\nrate is high, the spectra inside the bi-conical outflows are distinct from that\noutside, as outflows are generally hotter and more metal-enriched.

At present, the mainstream RL algorithms are data-driven,\nrelying on millions of iterations and a large number of empirical data to learn\na policy. Although data-driven RL may have excellent asymptotic performance, it\nusually yields slow convergence speed. As a comparison, model-driven RL employs\na differentiable transition model to improve convergence speed, in which the\npolicy gradient (PG) is calculated by using the backpropagation through time\n(BPTT) technique. However, such methods suffer from numerical instability,\nmodel error sensitivity and low computing efficiency, which may lead to poor\npolicies. In this paper, a mixed policy gradient (MPG) method is proposed,\nwhich uses both empirical data and the transition model to construct the PG, so\nas to accelerate the convergence speed without losing the optimality guarantee.\nMPG contains two types of PG: 1) data-driven PG, which is obtained by directly\ncalculating the derivative of the learned Q-value function with respect to\nactions, and 2) model-driven PG, which is calculated using BPTT based on the\nmodel-predictive return. We unify them by revealing the correlation between the\nupper bound of the unified PG error and the predictive horizon, where the\ndata-driven PG is regraded as 0-step model-predictive return. Relying on that,\nMPG employs a rule-based method to adaptively adjust the weights of data-driven\nand model-driven PGs. In particular, to get a more accurate PG, the weight of\nthe data-driven PG is designed to grow along the learning process while the\nother to decrease. Besides, an asynchronous learning framework is proposed to\nreduce the wall-clock time needed for each update iteration.

For DDM we derive a\nversion of the cosmological free streaming limit that is independent of the DM\nproduction mechanism, finding that DDM cannot produce an appreciable core in\nFornax without violating Ly-$\\alpha$ limits. If the Ly-$\\alpha$ limit is\ndiscounted for some reason, then stellar kinematics data does allow a DDM core\nwhich could prolong GC orbits. For SIDM we find that significant prolongation\nof GC orbits could be obtained for values of the self-interaction cross section\nconsidered in previous works. In addition to reassessing the inspiral time\nusing updated observational data, we give a new perspective on the so-called GC\ntiming problem, demonstrating that for a cuspy cold DM profile dynamical\nfriction predicts a $z=0$ radial distribution for the innermost GCs that is\nindependent of initial conditions. The observed orbits of Fornax GCs are\nconsistent with this expectation with a mild apparent fine-tuning at the level\nof $\\sim25\\%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 07:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 11:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Techniques for partitioning of shared resources - cache and\nbandwidth - and prefetching throttling have been proposed to mitigate\ncontention and reduce the average memory access time. However, existing\nproposals only employ a single or a subset of these techniques and are\ntherefore not able to exploit the full potential of coordinated management of\ncache, bandwidth and prefetching. Our characterization results show that\napplication performance, in several cases, is sensitive to prefetching, cache\nand bandwidth allocation.

Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods,\non the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs\nthat are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally\npreserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of\nexisting graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as\na multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph\nstructure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head\nattention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between\nnodes according to their structural dependencies.

Can we select the best neural architectures without\ninvolving any training and eliminate a drastic portion of the search cost? We\nprovide an affirmative answer, by proposing a novel framework called\ntraining-free neural architecture search (TE-NAS).

Data-driven techniques make efforts to reduce the computation\nsignificantly by a database. One type of methods relies on human poses to\nsynthesize fitted garments which cannot be applied to general cloth. Another\ntype of methods adds details to the coarse meshes without such restrictions.\nHowever, existing works usually utilize coordinate-based representations which\ncannot cope with large-scale deformation, and requires dense vertex\ncorrespondences between coarse and fine meshes. Moreover, as such methods only\nadd details, they require coarse meshes to be close to fine meshes, which can\nbe either impossible, or require unrealistic constraints when generating fine\nmeshes. To address these challenges, we develop a temporally and spatially\nas-consistent-as-possible deformation representation (named TS-ACAP) and a\nDeformTransformer network to learn the mapping from low-resolution meshes to\ndetailed ones. This TS-ACAP representation is designed to ensure both spatial\nand temporal consistency for sequential large-scale deformations from cloth\nanimations. With this representation, our DeformTransformer network first\nutilizes two mesh-based encoders to extract the coarse and fine features,\nrespectively. To transduct the coarse features to the fine ones, we leverage\nthe Transformer network that consists of frame-level attention mechanisms to\nensure temporal coherence of the prediction. Experimental results show that our\nmethod is able to produce reliable and realistic animations in various datasets\nat high frame rates: 10 ~ 35 times faster than physics-based simulation, with\nsuperior detail synthesis abilities than existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 08:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Recently, recursive causal discovery algorithms\nhave gained particular attention among the research community due to their\nability to provide good results by using Conditional Independent (CI) tests in\nsmaller sub-problems. However, each of such algorithms needs a refinement\nfunction to remove undesired causal relations of the discovered graphs.\nNotably, with the increase of the problem size, the computation cost (i.e., the\nnumber of CI-tests) of the refinement function makes an algorithm expensive to\ndeploy in practice.

Spherically symmetric spacelike cross-sections of the outer\ntrapping horizon define in- and outgoing lightlike congruences.

Requirements engineering remains a discipline that is faced with a\nlarge number of challenges, including the implementation of a requirements\nelicitation process in industry.

We investigate the SoTA with respect\nto requirements elicitation, examining practitioners' practices. We focus on\nthe techniques, the roles involved, and the challenges associated to the\nprocess. Method. We conducted an interview-based survey study involving 24\npractitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies. Results. We found that\ngroup interaction techniques, including meetings and workshops, are the most\npopular type of elicitation techniques that are employed by the practitioners,\nexcept in the case of small projects. We noted that customers are frequently\ninvolved in the elicitation process, except in the case of market-driven\norganizations. Technical staff (for example, developers and architects) are\nmore frequently involved in the elicitation process compared to the involvement\nof business- or strategic staff. Finally, we identified a number of challenges\nwith respect to stakeholders. These challenges include difficulties in\nunderstanding and prioritizing their needs.

We perform several experiments on a cloud dataset evaluating different\nlanguage models for obtaining numerical log representations such as BERT,\nGPT-2, and XL.

This paper proposes a novel audiovisual data\nfusion framework for speaker localization by assigning individual dynamic\nstream weights to specific regions in the localization space. This fusion is\nachieved via a neural network, which combines the predictions of individual\naudio and video trackers based on their time- and location-dependent\nreliability. A performance evaluation using audiovisual recordings yields\npromising results, with the proposed fusion approach outperforming all baseline\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 09:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 07:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

Gamma rays have to pass through the surrounding massive\nstellar cluster which luminous stars can accidentally appear close to the\nobserver's line of sight. In such a case, soft radiation of massive stars can\ncreate enough target for transient absorption of the gamma rays in multi-GeV to\nTeV energy range. We consider the effect of such stellar encounters on the\ngamma-ray spectrum produced within the massive stellar cluster surrounding a\ncentral SMBH. We predict characteristic, time-dependent effects on the\ngamma-ray spectra due to the encounter with the single luminous star and also\nstellar binary system. We conclude that during the encounter, the gamma-ray\nspectrum of an active galaxy should steepen at tens of GeV and harden in the\nrange of hundreds of GeV. As an example, we consider such effects on the\nspectra observed from a typical blazar, 1ES\\ 1959+650 (in an active state) and\nalso in the case of a radio galaxy M87 (in a low state).

By considering two stable formations\nof the 2D GeMC, namely the pure GeX and Janus Ge2XY monolayers (X, Y = S, Se,\nand Te), we observed the PST around the valence band maximum where the spin\norientation is enforced by the lower point group symmetry of the crystal.

Due to the coherent coupling between photons and\nmatter-degrees of freedom, polaritons -- hybrid light-matter quasiparticles --\nemerge, which can significantly influence matter properties and complex\nprocesses such as chemical reactions (strong coupling). In this thesis we\npropose a way to overcome these problems by reformulating the coupled\nelectron-photon problem in an exact way in a different, purpose-build Hilbert\nspace, where no longer electrons and photons are the basic physical entities\nbut the polaritons. Representing an N-electron-M-mode system by an N-polariton\nwave function with hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics, we show explicitly how to turn\nelectronic-structure methods into polaritonic-structure methods that are\naccurate from the weak to the strong-coupling regime. We elucidate this\nparadigmatic shift by a comprehensive review of light-matter coupling, as well\nas by highlighting the connection between different electronic-structure\nmethods and quantum-optical models. This extensive discussion accentuates that\nthe polariton description is not only a mathematical trick, but it is grounded\nin a simple and intuitive physical argument: when the excitations of a system\nare hybrid entities a formulation of the theory in terms of these new entities\nis natural. Finally, we discuss in great detail how to adopt standard\nalgorithms of electronic-structure methods to adhere to the new hybrid\nFermi-Bose statistics. Guaranteeing the corresponding nonlinear inequality\nconstraints in practice requires a careful development, implementation and\nvalidation of numerical algorithms. This extra numerical complexity is the\nprice we pay for making the coupled matter-photon problem feasible for\nfirst-principle methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 11:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In this context, Wansing\nintroduced the notion of proper display calculi as one possible design\nframework for proof calculi in which the analiticity desiderata are realized in\na particularly transparent way. Recently, the theory of properly displayable\nlogics (i.e. those logics that can be equivalently presented with some proper\ndisplay calculus) has been developed in connection with generalized Sahlqvist\ntheory (aka unified correspondence). Specifically, properly displayable logics\nhave been syntactically characterized as those axiomatized by analytic\ninductive axioms, which can be equivalently and algorithmically transformed\ninto analytic structural rules so that the resulting proper display calculi\nenjoy a set of basic properties: soundness, completeness, conservativity, cut\nelimination and subformula property.

However,\nso far this proof strategy for syntactic completeness has been implemented on a\ncase-by-case base, and not in general. In this paper, we address this gap by\nproving syntactic completeness for properly displayable logics in any normal\n(distributive) lattice expansion signature.

Phase averaging is a technique to filter fast motions from the\ndynamics whilst still accounting for their effect on the slow dynamics. Phase\naveraging is useful for deriving reduced models that can be solved numerically\nwith more efficiency, since larger timesteps can be taken. Recently, Haut and\nWingate (2014) introduced the idea of computing finite window numerical phase\naverages in parallel as the basis for a coarse propagator for a\nparallel-in-time algorithm. In this contribution, we provide a framework for\nhigher order phase averages that aims to better approximate the unaveraged\nsystem whilst still filtering fast motions. Whilst the basic phase average\nassumes that the solution independent of changes of phase, the higher order\nmethod expands the phase dependency in a basis which the equations are\nprojected onto. In this new framework, the original numerical phase averaging\nformulation arises as the lowest order version of this expansion. Our new\nprojection onto functions that are $k$th degree polynomials in the phase gives\nrise to higher order corrections to the phase averaging formulation. We\nillustrate the properties of this method on an ODE that describes the dynamics\nof a swinging spring due to Lynch (2002). Although idealized, this model shows\nan interesting analogy to geophysical flows as it exhibits a slow dynamics that\narises through the resonance between fast oscillations. On this example, we\nshow convergence to the non-averaged (exact) solution with increasing\napproximation order also for finite averaging windows. At zeroth order, our\nmethod coincides with a standard phase average, but at higher order it is more\naccurate in the sense that solutions of the phase averaged model track the\nsolutions of the unaveraged equations more accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 11:53:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 20:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 13:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

It is one of the most controversial ideas in\nbiodiversity conservation. Perhaps the most convincing reason for legalizing\nwildlife trade is that trade revenue could fund the protection and conservation\nof poached species. In this paper, we examine the possible poacher-population\ndynamic consequences of legal trade funding conservation. The model consists of\na manager scavenging carcasses for wildlife products, who then sells the\nproducts, and directs a portion of the revenue towards funding anti-poaching\nlaw enforcement. Through a global analysis of the model, we derive the critical\nproportion of product the manager must scavenge, and the critical proportion of\ntrade revenue the manager must allocate towards increased enforcement, in order\nfor legal trade to lead to abundant long-term wildlife populations. We\nillustrate how the model could inform management with parameter values derived\nfrom the African elephant literature, under a hypothetical scenario where a\nmanager scavenges elephant carcasses to sell ivory. We find that there is a\nlarge region of parameter space where populations go extinct under legal trade,\nunless a significant portion of trade revenue is directed towards protecting\npopulations from poaching.

We further explore chemically inert tracers to observe geometrical\nasymmetries, and if the location of inner boundary of a 3D GCM matters for the\nclouds that form. The large day/night temperature differences of ultra-hot\nJupiters cause large chemical asymmetries: cloud-free days but cloudy nights,\natomic vs. molecular gases and respectively different mean molecular weights,\ndeep thermal ionospheres vs. low-ionised atmospheres, undepleted vs enhanced\nC/O. WASP-18b, as the heaviest planet in the sample, has the lowest global C/O.\nThe global climate may be considered as similar amongst ultra-hot Jupiters, but\ndifferent to that of hot gas giants. The local weather, however, is individual\nfor each planet since the local thermodynamic conditions, and hence the local\ncloud and gas properties, differ. The morning and the evening terminator of\nultra-hot Jupiters will carry signatures of their strong chemical asymmetry\nsuch that ingress/egress asymmetries can be expected. An increased C/O ratio is\na clear sign of cloud formation, making cloud modelling a necessity when\nutilizing C/O (or other mineral ratios) as tracer for planet formation. The\nchanging geometrical extension of the atmosphere from the day to the nightside\nmay be probed through chemically inert species like helium.

We propose a method\nfor inferring computational models from cross-sectional data using Langevin\ndynamics.

Our method is a 'baseline' method which\ninitiates the development of computational models which can be iteratively\nenhanced through the inclusion of expert knowledge. We validate the proposed\nmethod against two population-based longitudinal datasets and observe\nsignificant predictive power in comparison with random choice algorithms.

The solute infiltrates that medium by\ndiffusion and the reactions with the impermeable sites produce new porous sites\nwith a probability $r$, which is proportional to the ratio of reaction and\ndiffusion rates at the scale of a lattice site.

In the literature, the existing approaches\ncan generally be categorized as decomposition-based methods and\ndimension-reduction-based methods. The former decomposes a large-scale problem\ninto several smaller subproblems, while the latter transforms the original\nhigh-dimensional solution space into a low-dimensional space. However, it is\nworth noting that a given large-scale optimization problem may not always be\ndecomposable, and it is also difficult to guarantee that the global optimum of\nthe original problem is preserved in the reduced low-dimensional problem space.\nThis paper thus proposes a new search paradigm, namely the multi-space\nevolutionary search, to enhance the existing evolutionary search methods for\nsolving large-scale optimization problems. In contrast to existing approaches\nthat perform an evolutionary search in a single search space, the proposed\nparadigm is designed to conduct a search in multiple solution spaces that are\nderived from the given problem, each possessing a unique landscape. The\nproposed paradigm makes no assumptions about the large-scale optimization\nproblem of interest, such as that the problem is decomposable or that a certain\nrelationship exists among the decision variables.

At the time of the observations, the pulsar was\nsurrounded by an accretion disc, displayed X-ray pulsations and its luminosity\nwas consistent with magnetically funneled accretion onto the neutron star.\nCurrent accretion models fail to account for the luminosity of both optical and\nultraviolet pulsations; these are instead more likely driven by\nsynchro-curvature radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere or just outside of it.\nThis interpretation would imply that particle acceleration can take place even\nwhen mass accretion is going on, and opens up new perspectives in the study of\ncoherent optical/UV pulsations from fast spinning accreting neutron stars in\nlow-mass X-ray binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 14:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In practice, this allows us to use a plethora of analytic and numeric\nmethods that permit the models' characterization.

This means that, even below the critical threshold,\nrumors can survive for a long time.

In particular, we provide the following algorithms for\nminor-free unbounded degree graphs. (1) A tester for Hamiltonicity with\ntwo-sided error with $poly(1/\\epsilon)$-query complexity, where $\\epsilon$ is\nthe proximity parameter. (2) A local algorithm, as defined by Rubinfeld et al.\n(ICS 2011), for constructing a spanning subgraph with almost minimum weight,\nspecifically, at most a factor $(1+\\epsilon)$ of the optimum, with\n$poly(1/\\epsilon)$-query complexity. Both our algorithms use partition oracles,\na tool introduced by Hassidim et al. (FOCS 2009), which are oracles that\nprovide access to a partition of the graph such that the number of cut-edges is\nsmall and each part of the partition is small. The polynomial dependence in\n$1/\\epsilon$ of our algorithms is achieved by combining the recent\n$poly(d/\\epsilon)$-query partition oracle of Kumar-Seshadhri-Stolman (ECCC\n2021) for minor-free graphs with degree bounded by $d$.\n  For bounded degree minor-free graphs we introduce the notion of covering\npartition oracles which is a relaxed version of partition oracles and design a\n$poly(d/\\epsilon)$-time covering partition oracle. Using our covering partition\noracle we provide the same results as above (except that the tester for\nHamiltonicity has one-sided error) for minor-free bounded degree graphs, as\nwell as showing that any property which is monotone and additive (e.g.\nbipartiteness) can be tested in minor-free graphs by making\n$poly(d/\\epsilon)$-queries.\n  The benefit of using the covering partition oracle rather than the partition\noracle in our algorithms is its simplicity and an improved polynomial\ndependence in $1/\\epsilon$ in the obtained query complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 14:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Although many academic studies have conducted on the adoption\nof various forms of ecommerce, there are little research topics on East African\ncountries, The adoption of B2C e-commerce in East African countries has faced\nmany challenges that have been unaddressed because of the complex nature of\ne-commerce in these nations. This study examines the adaptation of B2C in East\nAfrica using the theory of diffusion of innovation. Data collected from 279\nparticipants in Tanzania were used to test the research model. The results show\nthat awareness, infrastructure innovation and social media play a significant\nrole in the adoption of e-commerce. Lack of good e-commerce policy and\nawareness discourages the adoption of B2C. We also examine how time influences\nthe adaptation of B2C e-commerce to the majority.

ImageNet-A is a famous dataset of natural\nadversarial examples. By analyzing this dataset, we hypothesized that large,\ncluttered and/or unusual background is an important reason why the images in\nthis dataset are difficult to be classified. We validated the hypothesis by\nreducing the background influence in ImageNet-A examples with object detection\ntechniques. Experiments showed that the object detection models with various\nclassification models as backbones obtained much higher accuracy than their\ncorresponding classification models. A detection model based on the\nclassification model EfficientNet-B7 achieved a top-1 accuracy of 53.95%,\nsurpassing previous state-of-the-art classification models trained on ImageNet,\nsuggesting that accurate localization information can significantly boost the\nperformance of classification models on ImageNet-A. We then manually cropped\nthe objects in images from ImageNet-A and created a new dataset, named\nImageNet-A-Plus. A human test on the new dataset showed that the deep\nlearning-based classifiers still performed quite poorly compared with humans.\nTherefore, the new dataset can be used to study the robustness of\nclassification models to the internal variance of objects without considering\nthe background disturbance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 14:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Our algorithm employs a recurrent function to\napproximate the optimal policy, which maps the system states and reference\nvalues directly to the control inputs. The number of prediction steps is equal\nto the number of recurrent cycles of the learned policy function. With an\narbitrary initial policy function, the proposed RMPC algorithm can converge to\nthe optimal policy by directly minimizing the designed loss function.

This technique is applied to the\nsimulated circulation of a terrestrial planet and a gaseous hot Jupiter.

While this can be simplistically described as \"Breiman\nwon\", these same developments also expose the limitations of the\nprediction-first philosophy that he espoused, making careful statistical\nanalysis all the more important. This paper outlines these exciting recent\ndevelopments in the random forest literature which, in our view, occurred as a\nresult of a necessary blending of the two ways of thinking Breiman originally\ndescribed.

However, real-life scenarios oftentimes share\ncomplexities that prevent from the use of the as-is LR model, and instead\nhighlight the need to include high-order interactions to capture data\nvariability. This becomes even more challenging because of: (i) datasets\ngrowing wider, with more and more variables; (ii) studies being typically\nconducted in strongly imbalanced settings; (iii) samples going from very large\nto extremely small; (iv) the need of providing both predictive models and\ninterpretable results. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Learning\nhigh-order Interactions via targeted Pattern Search (LIPS), to select\ninteraction terms of varying order to include in a LR model for an imbalanced\nbinary classification task when input data are categorical. LIPS's rationale\nstems from the duality between item sets and categorical interactions. The\nalgorithm relies on an interaction learning step based on a well-known frequent\nitem set mining algorithm, and a novel dissimilarity-based interaction\nselection step that allows the user to specify the number of interactions to be\nincluded in the LR model. In addition, we particularize two variants (Scores\nLIPS and Clusters LIPS), that can address even more specific needs.

Assume that\ntwo edge-correlated graphs are independently edge-sampled from a common parent\ngraph with a power-law degree distribution. A set of correctly matched\nvertex-pairs is chosen at random and revealed as initial seeds. Our goal is to\nuse the seeds to recover the remaining latent vertex correspondence between the\ntwo graphs. Departing from the existing approaches that focus on the use of\nhigh-degree seeds in $1$-hop neighborhoods, we develop an efficient algorithm\nthat exploits the low-degree seeds in suitably-defined $D$-hop neighborhoods.\nSpecifically, we first match a set of vertex-pairs with appropriate degrees\n(which we refer to as the first slice) based on the number of low-degree seeds\nin their $D$-hop neighborhoods. This significantly reduces the number of\ninitial seeds needed to trigger a cascading process to match the rest of the\ngraphs.

Preferential attachment based on node degree has been widely adopted\nfor modeling network growth. However, many evidences exist which show deviation\nof real network growth from what a pure degree-based model suggests. It seems\nthat node degree is not a reliable measure for predicting the preference of\nnewcomers in attaching to the network, or at least, it does not tell the whole\nstory. In this paper, we argue that there is another dimension to network\ngrowth, one that we call node \"coreness\". The new dimension gives insights on\nthe global influence of nodes, in comparison to the local view the degree\nmetric provides. We found that the probability of existing nodes attracting new\nnodes generally follows an exponential dependence on node coreness, while at\nthe same time, follows a power-law dependence on node degree. That is to say,\nhigh-coreness nodes are more powerful than high-degree nodes in attracting\nnewcomers. The new dimension further discloses some hidden phenomena which\nhappen in the process of network growth. The power of node degree in attracting\nnewcomers increases over time while the influence of coreness decreases, and\nfinally, they reach a state of equilibrium in the growth. All these theories\nhave been tested on real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 23:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Many advanced materials with novel photonic\nmicro-nanostructures have already been developed to enable highly efficient\ndaytime radiative coolers, among which the flexible hierarchical porous\ncoatings (HPCs) are a more distinguished category. However, it is still hard to\nprecisely control the size distribution of the randomized pores within the\nHPCs, usually resulting in a deficient solar reflection at the near-infrared\noptical regime under diverse fabrication conditions of the coatings. We report\nhere a three-phase (i.e., air pore-phase, microsphere-phase and polymer-phase)\nself-assembled hybrid porous composite coating which dramatically increases the\naverage solar reflectance and yields a remarkable temperature drop of ~10 degC\nand 30 degC compared to the ambient circumstance and black paint, respectively,\naccording to the rooftop measurements. Mie theory and Monte Carlo simulations\nreveal the origin of the low reflectivity of as-prepared two-phase porous HPCs,\nand the optical cooling improvement of the three-phase porous composite\ncoatings is attributed to the newly generated interfaces possessing the high\nscattering efficiency between the hierarchical pores and silica microspheres\nhybridized with appropriate mass fractions. As a result, the hybrid porous\ncomposite approach enhances the whole performance of the coatings, which\nprovides a promising alternative to the flexible daytime radiative cooler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 09:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

To control the operation\ntemperature while maintaining high input powers is often a dilemma. Enormous\nworks have been done for the purpose. Here, a passive temperature management\nmethod based on near-field heat transfer is introduced, utilizing\ngraphene-plasmon enhanced evanescence wave tunneling. Within a pump power\ntolerance range of 0.5-7 KW m-2, the device can automatically regulate its\nthermal emissivity to quickly acquire thermal homeostasis around a designed\ntemperature. It is compact, fully passive and could be incorporated into chip\ndesign.

In surface gravity waves, a common goal for microswimmers is\nvertical migration (e.g., to reach the free surface or to dive to deeper\ndepths). By modelling microswimmers as spheroidal bodies with an intrinsic\nswimming velocity that supplements advection and reorientation by the flow, we\ninvestigate how shape and swimming affect vertical transport of microswimmers\nin waves. We find that it is possible for microswimmers to be initially\nswimming downwards, but to recover and head back to the surface, and vice\nversa. This is because the coupling between swimming and flow-induced\nreorientations introduces a shape dependency in the vertical transport. From a\nwave-averaged analysis of microswimmer trajectories, we show that each\ntrajectory is bounded by critical planes in the position-orientation phase\nspace that depend only on the shape. We also give explicit solutions to these\ntrajectories and determine the fraction of microswimmers that begin within the\nwater column and eventually reach the surface. For microswimmers that are\ninitially randomly oriented, the fraction that reach the surface increases\nmonotonically as the starting depth decreases, as expected, but also varies\nwith shape and swimming speed. In the limit of small swimming speed, the\nfraction of highly prolate microswimmers reaching the surface is 0.5,\nsuggesting that these swimmers would be able to choose direction of vertical\ntransport with small changes in swimming behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 15:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 10:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}
