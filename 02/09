On\nvarious medical image segmentation tasks, the u-shaped architecture, also known\nas U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success.\nHowever, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, U-Net\ngenerally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range\ndependency. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have\nemerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention\nmechanisms, but can result in limited localization abilities due to\ninsufficient low-level details. In this paper, we propose TransUNet, which\nmerits both Transformers and U-Net, as a strong alternative for medical image\nsegmentation. On one hand, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from\na convolution neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for\nextracting global contexts. On the other hand, the decoder upsamples the\nencoded features which are then combined with the high-resolution CNN feature\nmaps to enable precise localization.\n  We argue that Transformers can serve as strong encoders for medical image\nsegmentation tasks, with the combination of U-Net to enhance finer details by\nrecovering localized spatial information.

Thus, the methods need to train a specific model for each\nscale factor, which is both inefficient and impractical for storage and\ncomputation in real applications. To address this limitation, in this work, we\npropose a novel method called ``Meta-PU\" to firstly support point cloud\nupsampling of arbitrary scale factors with a single model. In the Meta-PU\nmethod, besides the backbone network consisting of residual graph convolution\n(RGC) blocks, a meta-subnetwork is learned to adjust the weights of the RGC\nblocks dynamically, and a farthest sampling block is adopted to sample\ndifferent numbers of points.

Earlier solutions of\nthese equations employed a staggered solution scheme for the two sets of\nequations in which the plastic distortion was updated via time integration of\nits rate, as found from Orowan's law. In this work, we show that such a direct\ntime integration scheme can suffer from accumulation of numerical errors.

A promising approach to solve both of these\nproblems is an attention bottleneck, which provides a simple and effective\nframework for learning high performing policies, even in the presence of\ndistractions. However, due to poor scalability of attention architectures,\nthese methods cannot be applied beyond low resolution visual inputs, using\nlarge patches (thus small attention matrices).

This allows our attention-based controllers to scale to\nlarger visual inputs, and facilitate the use of smaller patches, even\nindividual pixels, improving generalization.

For example, in a muddy\nchildren puzzle, one could ask whether each child will eventually find out\nwhether (s)he is muddy, regardless of the number of children.\n  Our framework is regular model checking (RMC)-based, wherein synchronous\nfinite-state automata (equivalently, monadic second-order logic over words) are\nused to specify the systems.

Of special interests is the addition of the\nso-called iterated public announcement operators, which are crucial for\nreasoning about knowledge in parameterized systems.

It is also known that anomalous chiral\nsymmetry breaking can occur through interactions alone, as is the case for\ninteracting one dimensional systems. In this paper we investigate the interplay\nbetween these two modes of anomalous chiral symmetry breaking in the context of\ninteracting Weyl semimetals. Using Fujikawa's path integral method we show that\nthe chiral charge continuity equation is modified by the presence of\ninteractions which can be viewed as including the effect of the electric and\nmagnetic fields generated by the interacting quantum matter. This can be\nunderstood further using dimensional reduction and a Luttinger liquid\ndescription of the lowest Landau level. These effects manifest themselves in\nthe non-linear response of the system. In particular we find an interaction\ndependent density response due to a change in the magnetic field as well as a\ncontribution to the non-equilibrium and inhomogeneous anomalous Hall response\nwhile preserving its equilibrium value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 17:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

In this work, we\nstudied the long-term evolution and the stratification of different atmospheric\nparameters of three light bridges formed in the same host sunspot by different\nmechanisms.

We find that, in general, the\nbehaviour of the three light bridges is typical of this kind of structure with\nthe magnetic field strength, inclination, and temperature values between the\nvalues at the umbra and the penumbra. We also find that they are of a\nsignificantly non-magnetic character (particularly at the axis of the light\nbridges) as it is deduced from the filling factor. In addition, within the\ncommon behaviour of the physical properties of light bridges, we observe that\neach one exhibits a particular behaviour. Another interesting result is that\nthe light bridge cools down, the magnetic field decreases, and the magnetic\nfield lines get more inclined higher in the atmosphere.

In this study, we\npropose a novel framework called Trace BERT (T-BERT) to generate trace links\nbetween source code and natural language artifacts. To address data sparsity,\nwe leverage a three-step training strategy to enable trace models to transfer\nknowledge from a closely related Software Engineering challenge, which has a\nrich dataset, to produce trace links with much higher accuracy than has\npreviously been achieved. We then apply the T-BERT framework to recover links\nbetween issues and commits in Open Source Projects. We comparatively evaluated\naccuracy and efficiency of three BERT architectures.

However, the majority of work only\nconsiders the joint distribution, which has limited utility in practical\nsituations. A more general and useful problem is arbitrary conditional density\nestimation, which aims to model any possible conditional distribution over a\nset of covariates, reflecting the more realistic setting of inference based on\nprior knowledge. We propose a novel method, Arbitrary Conditioning with Energy\n(ACE), that can simultaneously estimate the distribution $p(\\mathbf{x}_u \\mid\n\\mathbf{x}_o)$ for all possible subsets of unobserved features $\\mathbf{x}_u$\nand observed features $\\mathbf{x}_o$. ACE is designed to avoid unnecessary bias\nand complexity -- we specify densities with a highly expressive energy function\nand reduce the problem to only learning one-dimensional conditionals (from\nwhich more complex distributions can be recovered during inference). This\nresults in an approach that is both simpler and higher-performing than prior\nmethods.

We find that\nadding $>4.1 \\mu$m medium filters at comparable depth to the broad-band filters\ncan significantly improve photo-$z$s and yield close to order-of-magnitude\nimprovements in the determination of quantities such as stellar ages,\nmetallicities, SF-related quantities and emission line fluxes at $z\\sim8$. For\nresolved sources, the proposed approach enables spatially-resolved\ndetermination of these quantities that would be prohibitive with slit\nspectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Since the first experimental demonstration of atomic\nself-ordering in a system composed of a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a\nquantized electromagnetic mode of a high-$Q$ optical cavity, the field has\nrapidly evolved over the past decade. The composite quantum-gas--cavity systems\noffer the opportunity to implement, simulate, and experimentally test\nfundamental solid-state Hamiltonians, as well as to realize non-equilibrium\nmany-body phenomena beyond conventional condensed-matter scenarios.

Notable examples range from\nHubbard-like models with long-range interactions exhibiting a\nlattice-supersolid phase, over emergent magnetic orderings and quasicrystalline\nsymmetries, to the appearance of dynamic gauge potentials and non-equilibrium\ntopological phases.

Here, using\nmeasurements on single crystals of Ho$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ in combination with\ndipolar Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the magnetoresistance is highly\nsensitive to the density of monopoles. Moreover, we find that for the\norientations of magnetic field in which the monopole density is enhanced, a\nstrong coupling emerges between the magnetic charges on the holmium sublattice\nand the antiferromagnetically ordered iridium ions, leading to an ability to\nmanipulate the antiferromagnetic domains via a uniform external field. Our\nresults pave the way to a quantitative experimental measure of monopole density\nand provide a powerful illustration of the interplay between the various\nmagnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in the frustrated pyrochlore\niridates. This interdependence holds promise for potential functional\nproperties arising from the link between magnetic and electric charges, as well\nas for the control of antiferromagnetic domain walls, a key goal in the design\nof next-generation spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 19:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Given this, with MAPbI1.5Br1.5 as a model system, here we address the\ninfluence of critical factors like the spatial randomness of phase segregation,\ninfluence of ion migration, and the effect of increased non radiative\nrecombination at material interfaces. Interestingly, our analytical model and\ndetailed statistical simulations indicate a unique trend morphology evolution\nwith increased phase segregation results, surprisingly, in a recovery in\nefficiency while non-radiative recombination at grain/domain boundaries results\nin efficiency degradation. Further, our quantitative and predictive estimates\nidentify critical parameters for interface states beyond which device\nvariability could be an important system level bottleneck. Indeed, these\nestimates are broadly applicable to systems which undergo phase segregation and\nhave interesting implications to perovskite based optoelectronic devices from\nstability concerns to engineering approaches that attempt to arrest phase\nsegregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 19:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 06:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Quantization maps floating-point weights and activations in a trained\nmodel to low-bitwidth integer values using scale factors. Excessive\nquantization, reducing precision too aggressively, results in accuracy\ndegradation. When scale factors are shared at a coarse granularity across many\ndimensions of each tensor, effective precision of individual elements within\nthe tensor are limited. To reduce quantization-related accuracy loss, we\npropose using a separate scale factor for each small vector of ($\\approx$16-64)\nelements within a single dimension of a tensor. To achieve an efficient\nhardware implementation, the per-vector scale factors can be implemented with\nlow-bitwidth integers when calibrated using a two-level quantization scheme. We\nfind that per-vector scaling consistently achieves better inference accuracy at\nlow precision compared to conventional scaling techniques for popular neural\nnetworks without requiring retraining. We also modify a deep learning\naccelerator hardware design to study the area and energy overheads of\nper-vector scaling support. Our evaluation demonstrates that per-vector scaled\nquantization with 4-bit weights and activations achieves 37% area saving and\n24% energy saving while maintaining over 75% accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet.\n4-bit weights and 8-bit activations achieve near-full-precision accuracy for\nboth BERT-base and BERT-large on SQuAD while reducing area by 26% compared to\nan 8-bit baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 19:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

The recent discovery of a both spectroscopic and photometric\nvariable UHE white dwarf led to the speculation that the UHE lines might be\ncreated in a shock-heated circumstellar magnetosphere. We investigate\n(multi-band) light curves from several ground- and space-based surveys of all\n16 currently known UHE white dwarfs (including one newly discovered) and eight\nwhite dwarfs that show only the HeII line problem, as both phenomena are\nbelieved to be connected.

The high\nvariability rate is in stark contrast to the variability rate amongst normal\nhot white dwarfs (we find $9^{+4}_{-2}$%), marking UHE and HeII line problem\nwhite dwarfs as a new class of variable stars. The period distribution of our\nsample agrees with both the orbital period distribution of post-common envelope\nbinaries and the rotational period distribution of magnetic white dwarfs if we\nassume that the objects in our sample will spin-up as a consequence of further\ncontraction. The lack of increasing photometric amplitudes towards longer\nwavelengths, as well as the non-detection of optical emission lines arising\nfrom the highly irradiated face of a hypothetical secondary in the optical\nspectra of our stars, makes it seem unlikely that an irradiated late type\ncompanion is the origin of the photometric variability.

In many instances, such network heterogeneity is preserved in\nthe limit which turns from being a single Fokker-Planck equation (also known as\nMcKean-Vlasov) to an infinite system of non-linear partial differential\nequations (PDE) coupled by means of a graphon. While appealing from an applied\nviewpoint, few rigorous results exist on the graphon particle system. This note\naddresses such limit system focusing on the relation between interaction\nnetwork and initial conditions: if the system initial datum and the graphon\ndegrees satisfy a suitable condition, a significantly simpler representation of\nthe solution is available. Interesting conclusions can be drawn from this\nresult: substantially different graphons can give rise to exactly the same\nparticle behavior, e.g., if the initial condition is independent of the\ngraphon, the particle behavior is indistinguishable from the well-known\nmean-field limit as long as the graphon has constant degree; step-kernels, a\nbuilding block of graph limit theory, can be used to approximate the graphon\nparticle system with a finite system of Fokker-Planck equations and an explicit\nrate of convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 20:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 17:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 08:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

This\nis because the computation and memory requirements of A* search grow linearly\nwith the size of the action space. This burden becomes even more apparent when\nA* search uses a heuristic function learned by computationally expensive\nfunction approximators, such as deep neural networks. To address this problem,\nwe introduce Q* search, a search algorithm that uses deep Q-networks to guide\nsearch in order to take advantage of the fact that the sum of the transition\ncosts and heuristic values of the children of a node can be computed with a\nsingle forward pass through a deep Q-network without explicitly generating\nthose children. This significantly reduces computation time and requires only\none node to be generated per iteration. We use Q* search to solve the Rubik's\ncube when formulated with a large action space that includes 1872 meta-actions\nand find that this 157-fold increase in the size of the action space incurs\nless than a 4-fold increase in computation time and less than a 3-fold increase\nin number of nodes generated when performing Q* search. Furthermore, Q* search\nis up to 129 times faster and generates up to 1288 times fewer nodes than A*\nsearch. Finally, although obtaining admissible heuristic functions from deep\nneural networks is an ongoing area of research, we prove that Q* search is\nguaranteed to find a shortest path given a heuristic function that neither\noverestimates the cost of a shortest path nor underestimates the transition\ncost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 20:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 17:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Each of\nthese two independent distributions are half q-Gaussians with different\nnon-extensivity parameter q and temperature parameter beta.

For positive returns, q approaches a\nconstant value of 1 after a certain lag, indicating the distributions have\nreached equilibrium. On the other hand, for negative returns, the q values do\nnot reach a stationary value over the time scales studied. In the present\nmodel, the markets show a transition from normal to superdiffusive behavior (a\npossible phase transition) during the 2008 crash period.

Reflection and\nabsorption of laser light provide a measurable force from photon momentum\nexchange that is directly proportional to laser power, which can be measured\nwith an electrostatic balance traceable to the SI. We aim for a relative\nuncertainty of $10^{-3}$ with coverage factor $k=2$. For this purpose, we have\ndesigned a monolithic parallelogram 4-bar linkage incorporating elastic\ncircular notch flexure hinges. The design is optimized to address the main\nfactors driving force measurement uncertainty from the balance mechanism:\ncorner loading errors, balance stiffness, stress in the flexure hinges,\nsensitivity to vibration, and sensitivity to thermal gradients. Parasitic\nrotations in the free end of the 4-bar linkage during arcuate motion are\nconstrained by machining tolerances. An analytical model shows this affects the\nforce measurement less than 0.01 percent.

The fossil record of stars in galaxies has mostly been excavated\nfor passive galaxies, since the light of star-forming galaxies is dominated by\nyoung stars which have much weaker atmospheric absorption features. Here we use\nthe largest reference cosmological simulation of the EAGLE project to\ninvestigate the origin of variations in stellar $\\alpha$-enhancement among\nstar-forming galaxies at $z=0$, and their impact on integrated spectra. The\ndefinition of $\\alpha$-enhancement in a composite stellar population is\nambiguous. We elucidate two definitions - termed `mean' and `galactic'\n$\\alpha$-enhancement - in more detail. While a star-forming galaxy has a high\n`mean' $\\alpha$-enhancement when its stars formed rapidly, a galaxy with a\nlarge `galactic' $\\alpha$-enhancement generally had a delayed star formation\nhistory. We find that absorption-line strengths of Mg and Fe correlate with\nvariations in $\\alpha$-enhancement. These correlations are strongest for the\n`galactic' $\\alpha$-enhancement. However, we show that these are mostly caused\nby other effects which are cross-correlated with $\\alpha$-enhancement, such as\nvariations in the light-weighted age. This severely complicates the retrieval\nof $\\alpha$-enhancements in star-forming galaxies. The ambiguity is not severe\nfor passive galaxies and we confirm that spectral variations in these galaxies\nare caused by measurable variations in $\\alpha$-enhancements. We suggest that\nthis more complex coupling between $\\alpha$-enhancement and star formation\nhistories can guide the interpretation of new observations of star-forming\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 22:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Thus, identifying factors\nmoderating the S&P verification helps software development organizations\nimprove the S&P verification, releasing software that meets security and\nperformance requirements. Objective: To present moderator factors influencing\nS&P verification activities and actions to promote S&P moderator factors.\nMethod: Multiple case study using qualitative analysis of observational data to\nidentify S&P moderators factors.

Here we develop a Bayesian inversion framework that uses\nInterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surface deformation data to\ninfer the laterally heterogeneous permeability of a transient linear\nporoelastic model of a confined GW aquifer. The Bayesian solution of this\ninverse problem takes the form of a posterior probability density of the\npermeability. Exploring this posterior using classical Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) methods is computationally prohibitive due to the large dimension of the\ndiscretized permeability field and the expense of solving the poroelastic\nforward problem. However, in many partial differential equation (PDE)-based\nBayesian inversion problems, the data are only informative in a few directions\nin parameter space. For the poroelasticity problem, we prove this property\ntheoretically for a one-dimensional problem and demonstrate it numerically for\na three-dimensional aquifer model. We design a generalized preconditioned\nCrank--Nicolson (gpCN) MCMC method that exploits this intrinsic low\ndimensionality by using a low-rank based Laplace approximation of the posterior\nas a proposal, which we build scalably. The feasibility of our approach is\ndemonstrated through a real GW aquifer test in Nevada.

State-of-the-art methods addressing this problem assume\nthe angles associated with the projections are known a-priori. Given this\nknowledge, the reconstruction process is straightforward as it can be\nformulated as a convex problem. Here, we tackle a more challenging setting: 1)\nthe projection angles are unknown, 2) they are drawn from an unknown\nprobability distribution. In this set-up our goal is to recover the image and\nthe projection angle distribution using an unsupervised adversarial learning\napproach. For this purpose, we formulate the problem as a distribution matching\nbetween the real projection lines and the generated ones from the estimated\nimage and projection distribution. This is then solved by reaching the\nequilibrium in a min-max game between a generator and a discriminator. Our\nnovel contribution is to recover the unknown projection distribution and the\nimage simultaneously using adversarial learning. To accommodate this, we use\nGumbel-softmax approximation of samples from categorical distribution to\napproximate the generator's loss as a function of the unknown image and the\nprojection distribution. Our approach can be generalized to different inverse\nproblems. Our simulation results reveal the ability of our method in\nsuccessfully recovering the image and the projection distribution in various\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 00:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

The literature on PDHG has mostly focused on\nsettings where the problem at hand is assumed to be feasible. When the problem\nis not feasible, the iterates of the algorithm do not converge. In this\nscenario, we show that the iterates diverge at a controlled rate towards a\nwell-defined ray. The direction of this ray is known as the infimal\ndisplacement vector $v$. The first contribution of our work is to prove that\nthis vector recovers certificates of primal and dual infeasibility whenever\nthey exist. Based on this fact, we propose a simple way to extract approximate\ninfeasibility certificates from the iterates of PDHG. We study three different\nsequences that converge to the infimal displacement vector: the difference of\niterates, the normalized iterates, and the normalized average. All of them are\neasy to compute, and thus the approach is suitable for large-scale problems.\nOur second contribution is to establish tight convergence rates for these\nsequences. We demonstrate that the normalized iterates and the normalized\naverage achieve a convergence rate of $O(1/k)$, improving over the known rate\nof $O(1/\\sqrt{k})$. This rate is general and applies to any fixed-point\niteration of a nonexpansive operator. Thus, it is a result of independent\ninterest since it covers a broad family of algorithms, including, for example,\nADMM, and can be applied settings beyond linear programming, such as quadratic\nand semidefinite programming. Further, in the case of linear programming we\nshow that, under nondegeneracy assumptions, the iterates of PDHG identify the\nactive set of an auxiliary feasible problem in finite time, which ensures that\nthe difference of iterates exhibits eventual linear convergence to the infimal\ndisplacement vector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 01:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

We first\npresent generic results about antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic superexchange\ninteractions valid in a broad class of Mott insulators, where we also estimate\ntypical field strength to observe DC electric-field effects: $\\sim\n1~\\mathrm{MV/cm}$ for inorganic Mott insulators such as transition-metal oxides\nand $\\sim 0.1~\\mathrm{MV/cm}$ for organic ones. Next, we apply these results to\ngeometrically frustrated quantum spin systems. Our theory widely applies to\n(quasi-)two-dimensional and thin-film systems and one-dimensional quantum spin\nsystems on various lattices such as square, honeycomb, triangular, and kagome\nones. In this paper, we give our attention to those on the square lattice and\non the chain. For the square lattice, we show that DC electric fields can\ncontrol a ratio of the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor exchange\ninteractions.

This optimization is challenging, because it has a very high\ndimensionality and is usually constrained by partial differential equations\n(PDEs) and additional inequalities.

However,\nall the constraints in PINNs are soft constraints, and hence we impose hard\nconstraints by using the penalty method and the augmented Lagrangian method. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of hPINN for a holography problem in optics and a\nfluid problem of Stokes flow. We achieve the same objective as conventional\nPDE-constrained optimization methods based on adjoint methods and numerical PDE\nsolvers, but find that the design obtained from hPINN is often simpler and\nsmoother for problems whose solution is not unique.

Furthermore, we\nexplore the role of the entropic effects in different transport regimes and\nsuggest experimental criteria for detecting them in solvated molecular\njunctions. Lastly, in order to account for nuclear tunnelling effects, we also\ndemonstrate how lifetime broadening can be introduced into the\nMarcus-Levich-Dogonadze-Jortner-type description of electron transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 04:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Limited by the definition of AP, such methods\nconsider both negative and positive instances ranking before each positive\ninstance. However, we claim that only penalizing negative instances before\npositive ones is enough, because the loss only comes from these negative\ninstances. To this end, we propose a novel loss, namely Penalizing Negative\ninstances before Positive ones (PNP), which can directly minimize the number of\nnegative instances before each positive one. In addition, AP-based methods\nadopt a fixed and sub-optimal gradient assignment strategy. Therefore, we\nsystematically investigate different gradient assignment solutions via\nconstructing derivative functions of the loss, resulting in PNP-I with\nincreasing derivative functions and PNP-D with decreasing ones. PNP-I focuses\nmore on the hard positive instances by assigning larger gradients to them and\ntries to make all relevant instances closer. In contrast, PNP-D pays less\nattention to such instances and slowly corrects them. For most real-world data,\none class usually contains several local clusters. PNP-I blindly gathers these\nclusters while PNP-D keeps them as they were. Therefore, PNP-D is more\nsuperior.

In order to achieve convergent policy parameters\nfor minimax optimization, it is important that GDA generates convergent\nvariable sequences rather than convergent sequences of function values or\ngradient norms. However, the variable convergence of GDA has been proved only\nunder convexity geometries, and there lacks understanding for general nonconvex\nminimax optimization. This paper fills such a gap by studying the convergence\nof a more general proximal-GDA for regularized nonconvex-strongly-concave\nminimax optimization. Specifically, we show that proximal-GDA admits a novel\nLyapunov function, which monotonically decreases in the minimax optimization\nprocess and drives the variable sequence to a critical point. By leveraging\nthis Lyapunov function and the K{\\L} geometry that parameterizes the local\ngeometries of general nonconvex functions, we formally establish the variable\nconvergence of proximal-GDA to a critical point $x^*$, i.e., $x_t\\to x^*,\ny_t\\to y^*(x^*)$. Furthermore, over the full spectrum of the\nK{\\L}-parameterized geometry, we show that proximal-GDA achieves different\ntypes of convergence rates ranging from sublinear convergence up to finite-step\nconvergence, depending on the geometry associated with the K{\\L} parameter.\nThis is the first theoretical result on the variable convergence for nonconvex\nminimax optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 05:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 16:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

To solve this class of stochastic optimization\nproblems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates,\nwhich are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization\nmethod for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale\nstochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop\nfashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve\nan $\\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\\cal\nO}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\\epsilon$-optimal\nsolution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\\cal O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$\nsamples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bilevel optimization\nalgorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as the stochastic\ngradient descent method for the single-level stochastic optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 06:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 06:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 04:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 02:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Despite an eminent reference and widespread use, these models lack\nthe background theory, being often viewed as a collection of empirical recipes\nwhich rely on adjustable parameters. Here we propose a tractable and\nfundamental mechanism of social mobility, which explains distance scaling of\nmigration flows and predicts the value of the scaling exponent. The mechanism\nreveals two key aspects framing social flows, which have direct analogy in\nphysics: symmetry and dissipation. In particular, we identify the conditions\nfor the social gravity scaling, when the power law exponent equals 2, and\nexplain deviations from this behaviour, including saturation transitions. The\nresulting flow distribution is determined by the spatial structure of the\nunderlying social network, rather than by distance explicitly. The theory is\nverified for residential migration in suburb networks of major Australian\ncities with diverse structure, population and size. The mechanism is directly\ntranslatable to other social contexts, such as flows of goods or information,\nand provides a universal understanding of how dynamic patterns of social\nmobility emerge from structural network properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 06:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Many existing API recommendation techniques are highly effective, but\nthey mainly support static languages. A few Python IDEs provide API\nrecommendation functionalities based on type inference and training on a large\ncorpus of Python libraries and third-party libraries. As such, they may fail to\nrecommend or make poor recommendations when type information is missing or\ntarget APIs are project-specific. In this paper, we propose a novel approach,\nPyART, to recommend APIs for Python programs in real-time. It features a\nlight-weight analysis to derives so-called optimistic data-flow, which is\nneither sound nor complete, but simulates the local data-flow information\nhumans can derive. It extracts three kinds of features: data-flow, token\nsimilarity, and token co-occurrence, in the context of the program point where\na recommendation is solicited. A predictive model is trained on these features\nusing the Random Forest algorithm. Evaluation on 8 popular Python projects\ndemonstrates that PyART can provide effective API recommendations. When\nhistoric commits can be leveraged, which is the target scenario of a\nstate-of-the-art tool ARIREC, our average top-1 accuracy is over 50% and\naverage top-10 accuracy over 70%, outperforming APIREC and Intellicode (i.e.,\nthe recommendation component in Visual Studio) by 28.48%-39.05% for top-1\naccuracy and 24.41%-30.49% for top-10 accuracy. In other applications such as\nwhen historic comments are not available and cross-project recommendation,\nPyART also shows better overall performance. The time to make a recommendation\nis less than a second on average, satisfying the real-time requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 08:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

This formal dialogue framework is the main\ncontribution of this paper. Through it, we break down compliance checking\nmechanisms into three modular components, each of which can be tailored to\nvarious needs in a vast amount of ways: an investigator agent, a suspect agent,\nand an acceptance protocol determining whether the responses of the suspect\nagent comply with the policy. This acceptance protocol presents a fundamentally\ndifferent approach to aggregation: rather than using quantitative methods to\ndeal with the non-determinism of a learning system, we leverage the use of\nargumentation semantics to investigate the notion of properties holding\nconsistently. Overall, we argue that the introduced formal dialogue framework\nopens many avenues both in the area of compliance checking and in the analysis\nof properties of opaque systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 09:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Numerical simulations reveal that this\nscenario also holds when the interactions among SPPs are given by a static\ncomplex network.

We then recover the complexity of the\noriginal problem by leveraging recent results from mixed-integer optimization.\nThe advantages of QuaSiModO are a linear increase in data requirements with\nrespect to the control dimension, performance guarantees that rely exclusively\non the accuracy of the predictive model in use, and little prior knowledge\nrequirements in control theory to solve complex control problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 09:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 13:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

The challenging issue is to maintain stable\nconnectivity between the two autonomous vehicles within an optical\ncommunication range. We define a directed optical line-of-sight (LoS) link\nbetween the two-vehicle systems. The transmitter is mounted on the AUV while\nthe surface ship is equipped with an optical receiver. However, this optical\ncommunication channel needs to preserve a stable transmitter-receiver position\nto reinforce service quality, which typically includes a bit rate and bit error\nrates. A cone-shaped beam region of the optical receiver is approximated based\non the channel model; then, a minimum bit rate is ensured if the AUV\ntransmitter remains inside of this region. Additionally, we design two control\nalgorithms for the transmitter to drive the AUV and maintain it in the\ncone-shaped beam region under an uncertain oceanic environment. Lyapunov\nfunction-based analysis that ensures asymptotic stability of the resulting\nclosed-loop tracking error is used to design the proposed NLPD controller.\nNumerical simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink to show the\ncontrollers' ability to achieve favorable tracking in the presence of the solar\nbackground noise within competitive times.

However, IB has several\nlimitations. First, the IB problem is hard to optimize. The IB Lagrangian\n$\\mathcal{L}_{IB}:=I(X;Z)-\\beta I(Y;Z)$ is non-convex and existing solutions\nguarantee only local convergence. As a result, the obtained solutions depend on\ninitialization. Second, the evaluation of a solution is also a challenging\ntask. Conventionally, it resorts to characterizing the information plane, that\nis, plotting $I(Y;Z)$ versus $I(X;Z)$ for all solutions obtained from different\ninitial points. Furthermore, the IB Lagrangian has phase transitions while\nvarying the multiplier $\\beta$. At phase transitions, both $I(X;Z)$ and\n$I(Y;Z)$ increase abruptly and the rate of convergence becomes significantly\nslow for existing solutions. Recent works with IB adopt variational surrogate\nbounds to the IB Lagrangian. Although allowing efficient optimization, how\nclose are these surrogates to the IB Lagrangian is not clear. In this work, we\nsolve the IB Lagrangian using augmented Lagrangian methods. With augmented\nvariables, we show that the IB objective can be solved with the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM).

The particular case of hands, as the\nend effectors of a robotic system that more often enter into contact with other\nelements of the environment, must be perceived and tracked with precision to\nexecute the intended tasks with dexterity and without colliding with obstacles.\nThey are fundamental for several applications, from Human-Robot Interaction\ntasks to object manipulation. Modern humanoid robots are characterized by high\nnumber of degrees of freedom which makes their forward kinematics models very\nsensitive to uncertainty. Thus, resorting to vision sensing can be the only\nsolution to endow these robots with a good perception of the self, being able\nto localize their body parts with precision. In this paper, we propose the use\nof a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to segment the robot hand from an image\nin an egocentric view.

Without imported cases, if a region is willing to implement measures\nto prevent spread at one level in number of cases, it must also be willing to\nprevent the spread with at a lower level, since it will be cheaper to do so and\nhas only positive other effects. With imported cases, if a region is not\ncoordinating with other regions, we show the cheapest policy is continually low\nbut nonzero cases due to decreasing cost of halting imported cases. When it is\ncoordinating, zero is cost-optimal.

It makes the gradient\nquantization very promising since the backward propagation requires\napproximately twice more computation than forward one. Due to the variability\nand uncertainty of gradient distribution, a lot of methods have been proposed\nto attain training stability. However, most of them ignore the channel-wise\ngradient distributions and the impact of gradients with different magnitudes,\nresulting in the degradation of final accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel INT8 quantization training framework for convolutional neural network to\naddress the above issues.

In\nthe resulting spacetime the central singularity is resolved by a black-to-white\nhole bounce, quantum effects become relevant at a unique mass independent\ncurvature scale, while they become negligible in the low curvature region near\nthe horizon and classical geometry is approached asymptotically. This is the\ncase independently of the relation between the black and white hole masses,\nwhich are thus freely specifiable independent observables. A natural question\nthen arises about the phenomenological implications of the resulting\nnon-singular effective spacetime and whether some specific relation between the\nmasses can be singled out from a phenomenological perspective. Here we focus on\nthe thermodynamic properties of the effective polymer black hole and analyse\nthe corresponding quantum corrections as functions of black and white hole\nmasses. The study of the relevant thermodynamic quantities such as temperature,\nspecific heat and horizon entropy reveals that the effective spacetime\ngenerically admits an extremal minimal-sized configuration of\nquantum-gravitational nature characterised by vanishing temperature and\nentropy. For large masses, the classically expected results are recovered at\nleading order and quantum corrections are negligible, thus providing us with a\nfurther consistency check of the model. The explicit form of the corrections\ndepends on the specific relation among the masses. In particular, a first-order\nlogarithmic correction to the entropy is obtained for a quadratic mass\nrelation. The latter corresponds to the case of proper finite length effects\nwhich turn out to be compatible with a minimal length generalised uncertainty\nprinciple associated with an extremal Planck-sized black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 12:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 07:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

In the package mecor, regression calibration methods and a\nmaximum likelihood method are implemented to correct for measurement error in a\ncontinuous covariate in regression analyses. Additionally, methods of moments\nmethods are implemented to correct for measurement error in the continuous\noutcome in regression analyses. Variance estimation of the corrected estimators\nis provided in closed form and using the bootstrap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 12:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Our condition is considerably weaker than that needed\nfor ergodic behaviour; a similar notion which demands that marginal upper and\nlower expectations of functions at a single time instant converge to so-called\nlimit-or steady state-upper and lower expectations. For this reason, we refer\nto our notion as `weak ergodicity'. Our second main result shows that, as far\nas this weakly ergodic behaviour is concerned, one should not worry about which\ntype of independence assumption to adopt-epistemic irrelevance, complete\nindependence or repetition independence. The characterisation of weak\nergodicity as well as the limit values of upper and lower expected time\naverages do not depend on such a choice.

This paper proposes a smart NILM system based on a novel local\npower histogramming (LPH) descriptor, in which appliance power signals are\ntransformed into 2D space and short histograms are extracted to represent each\ndevice. Specifically, short local histograms are drawn to represent individual\nappliance consumption signatures and robustly extract appliance-level data from\nthe aggregated power signal. Furthermore, an improved k-nearest neighbors\n(IKNN) algorithm is presented to reduce the learning computation time and\nimprove the classification performance. This results in highly improving the\ndiscrimination ability between appliances belonging to distinct categories. A\ndeep evaluation of the proposed LPH-IKNN based solution is investigated under\ndifferent data sets, in which the proposed scheme leads to promising\nperformance. An accuracy of up to 99.65% and 98.51% has been achieved on GREEND\nand UK-DALE data sets, respectively. While an accuracy of more than 96% has\nbeen attained on both WHITED and PLAID data sets.

In particular, we propose a method\nfor constructing complex solutions from simple solutions using translation and\nscaling.

There are situations where\nnonlinear superposition allows us to construct a complex composite solution\nusing similar simple solutions.

We propose that\nmeeting such goals requires treating fitness function identification as a\nsecondary optimization step. An adaptive algorithm that can vary the selection\nof fitness functions could adjust its selection throughout the generation\nprocess to maximize goal attainment, based on the current population of test\nsuites. To test this hypothesis, we have implemented two reinforcement learning\nalgorithms in the EvoSuite unit test generation framework, and used these\nalgorithms to dynamically set the fitness functions used during generation for\nthe three goals identified above.\n  We have evaluated our framework, EvoSuiteFIT, on a set of Java case examples.\nEvoSuiteFIT techniques attain significant improvements for two of the three\ngoals, and show limited improvements on the third when the number of\ngenerations of evolution is fixed.

While computing the quotient Q=F quo G\ncan be done in polynomial time with respect to the sparsities of F, G and Q,\nthis is not yet sufficient to get a polynomial-time divisibility test in\ngeneral. Indeed, the sparsity of the quotient Q can be exponentially larger\nthan the ones of F and G. In the favorable case where the sparsity #Q of the\nquotient is polynomial, the best known algorithm to compute Q has a non-linear\nfactor #G#Q in the complexity, which is not optimal.\n  In this work, we are interested in the two aspects of this problem.

The overall framework is a replica of a\nsupervised classification model, where semantic classes (e.g., dog, bird, and\nship) are replaced by instance IDs. However, scaling up the classification task\nfrom thousands of semantic labels to millions of instance labels brings\nspecific challenges including 1) the large-scale softmax computation; 2) the\nslow convergence due to the infrequent visiting of instance samples; and 3) the\nmassive number of negative classes that can be noisy. This work presents\nseveral novel techniques to handle these difficulties. First, we introduce a\nhybrid parallel training framework to make large-scale training feasible.\nSecond, we present a raw-feature initialization mechanism for classification\nweights, which we assume offers a contrastive prior for instance discrimination\nand can clearly speed up converge in our experiments. Finally, we propose to\nsmooth the labels of a few hardest classes to avoid optimizing over very\nsimilar negative pairs.

Our\napproach builds on the recently proposed Channel-SLAM method which first\nenabled leveraging of multi-path so as to improve (single) vehicle positioning.\nHere, we propose a cooperative mapping approach which builds upon the\nChannel-SLAM concept, referred to here as Team Channel-SLAM.

The\nkey intuition behind our method is the exploitation for the first time of the\ncorrelation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles. An\nalgorithm is derived for reflector selection and estimation, combined with a\nteam particle filter (TPF) so as to achieve high precision simultaneous\nmultiple vehicle positioning.

A small (1~km/s per\n0.1~pc) LSR velocity (Vlsr) gradient is detected across the axis of the\nmolecular cloud. Assuming we are observing a mass flow from the harboring cloud\nto the cluster, we derive a mass infall rate of about 10^{-4}~M_{sun}~yr^{-1}.\nThe most massive cores (labeled 1, 2, and 3) are found at the center of the\ncluster, and these are the only ones that present a signature of protostellar\nactivity in terms of emission from high-excitation molecular lines or a\nmolecular outflow. We reveal an extended (size about 0.1~pc), bipolar\ncollimated molecular outflow emerging from core 1. We believe this is powered\nby a (previously discovered) compact (size <= 1000~au) radio jet, ejected by a\nYSO embedded in core 1 (named YSO-1), since the molecular outflow and the radio\njet are almost parallel and have a comparable momentum rate. By means of\nhigh-excitation lines, we find a large (14~km/s over 500~au) Vlsr gradient at\nthe position of YSO-1, oriented approximately perpendicular to the radio jet.\nAssuming this is an edge-on, rotating disk and fitting a Keplerian rotation\npattern, we determine the YSO-1 mass to be 5.6+/-2.0~M_{sun}. The water masers\n(previously observed with VLBI) emerge within 100-300~au from YSO-1 and are\nunique tracers of the jet kinematics. Their three-dimensional (3D) velocity\npattern reveals that the gas flows along, and rotates about, the jet axis. We\nshow that the 3D maser velocities are fully consistent with the\nmagneto-centrifugal disk-wind models predicting a cylindrical rotating jet.\nUnder this hypothesis, we determine the jet radius to be about 16~au and the\ncorresponding launching radius and terminal velocity to be about 2.2~au and\n200~km/s, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 15:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

MSP problems are known for their\ncomputational intractability due to the sequential nature of the\ndecision-making structure and the uncertainty in the problem data due to the\nso-called curse of dimensionality. A common approach to tackle MSP problems\nwith a large number of stages is a rolling-horizon (RH) procedure, where one\nsolves a sequence of MSP problems with a smaller number of stages. This leads\nto a delicate issue of how many stages to include in the smaller problems used\nin the RH procedure.

For the infinite horizon case with discounted\ncosts, we derive a bound which can be used to prescribe an epsilon-sufficient\nnumber of stages.

Transfer learning enhances the\nperformance of the classifier by allowing the transfer of knowledge from one\ndomain or one dataset to others that have not been seen before, thus,\nsupporting the classifier to be more generalizable. In our study, we apply the\nprinciples of transfer learning cross multiple Arabic offensive language\ndatasets to compare the effects on system performance. This study aims at\ninvestigating the effects of fine-tuning and training Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) model on multiple Arabic offensive\nlanguage datasets individually and testing it using other datasets\nindividually. Our experiment starts with a comparison among multiple BERT\nmodels to guide the selection of the main model that is used for our study. The\nstudy also investigates the effects of concatenating all datasets to be used\nfor fine-tuning and training BERT model. Our results demonstrate the limited\neffects of transfer learning on the performance of the classifiers,\nparticularly for highly dialectic comments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 04:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

Using this\nprotocol, we collected a speech corpus in Argentine Spanish. We show clear\nevidence that the protocol effectively succeeded in influencing subjects into\nthe desired mental state of either trusting or distrusting the agent's skills,\nand present results of a perceptual study of the degree of trust performed by\nexpert listeners. Finally, we found that the subject's speech can be used to\ndetect which type of VA they were using, which could be considered a proxy for\nthe user's trust toward the VA's abilities, with an accuracy up to 76%,\ncompared to a random baseline of 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 13:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

The stability condition is\ninsensitive to the service time distributions and implies the maximal\nthroughout of secondary users. For a special case of exponential service time\ndistributions, we analyze in depth to show the effect of parameters on the\ndelay performance and the mean number of interruptions of secondary users.

Compressing such networks\nby pruning therefore becomes highly desirable. However, pruning 3D CNNs is\nlargely unexplored possibly because of the complex nature of typical pruning\nalgorithms that embeds pruning into an iterative optimization paradigm. In this\nwork, we introduce a Resource Aware Neuron Pruning (RANP) algorithm that prunes\n3D CNNs at initialization to high sparsity levels. Specifically, the core idea\nis to obtain an importance score for each neuron based on their sensitivity to\nthe loss function. This neuron importance is then reweighted according to the\nneuron resource consumption related to FLOPs or memory. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our pruning method on 3D semantic segmentation with widely\nused 3D-UNets on ShapeNet and BraTS'18 datasets, video classification with\nMobileNetV2 and I3D on UCF101 dataset, and two-view stereo matching with\nPyramid Stereo Matching (PSM) network on SceneFlow dataset. In these\nexperiments, our RANP leads to roughly 50%-95% reduction in FLOPs and 35%-80%\nreduction in memory with negligible loss in accuracy compared to the unpruned\nnetworks. This significantly reduces the computational resources required to\ntrain 3D CNNs. The pruned network obtained by our algorithm can also be easily\nscaled up and transferred to another dataset for training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 04:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}
