We particularly address two\nbuilding blocks in the pipeline, namely heterogeneous graph representation\nlearning and negative sampling. Existing message passing-based graph neural\nnetworks use edges either for graph traversal and/or selection of message\nencoding functions. Ignoring the edge semantics could have severe repercussions\non the quality of embeddings, especially when dealing with two nodes having\nmultiple relations. Furthermore, the expressivity of the learned representation\ndepends on the quality of negative samples used during training. Although\nexisting hard negative sampling techniques can identify challenging negative\nrelationships for optimization, new techniques are required to control false\nnegatives during training as false negatives could corrupt the learning\nprocess. To address these issues, first, we propose RelGNN -- a message\npassing-based heterogeneous graph attention model. In particular, RelGNN\ngenerates the states of different relations and leverages them along with the\nnode states to weigh the messages. RelGNN also adopts a self-attention\nmechanism to balance the importance of attribute features and topological\nfeatures for generating the final entity embeddings. Second, we introduce a\nparameter-free negative sampling technique -- adaptive self-adversarial (ASA)\nnegative sampling. ASA reduces the false-negative rate by leveraging positive\nrelationships to effectively guide the identification of true negative samples.\nOur experimental evaluation demonstrates that RelGNN optimized by ASA for\nrelationship prediction improves state-of-the-art performance across\nestablished benchmarks as well as on a real industrial dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 16:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Consequently, a study of the\ntrade-off between these metrics is imperative. In contrast with existing works,\nthis study proposes an efficient SE and EE trade-off algorithm for saving\nenergy in downlink Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to concurrently optimize\nSE and EE while considering battery life at the Base Station (BS). The scheme\nis formulated as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) and its Pareto\noptimal solution is examined. In contrast with other algorithms that prolong\nbattery life by considering the idle state of a BS, thereby increasing average\ndelay and energy consumption, the proposed algorithm prolongs battery life by\nadjusting the initial and final states of a BS to minimize the average delay\nand the energy consumption. Similarly, the use of an omni-directional antenna\nto spread radio signals to the user equipment in all directions causes high\ninterference and low spatial reuse. We propose using a directional antenna\ninstead of an omni-directional antenna by transmitting signals in one direction\nwhich results in no or low interference and high spatial reuse.

Yet, users\noften overprovision resources for their data processing jobs, while the\nresource usage of these jobs also typically fluctuates considerably. Therefore,\nmultiple jobs usually get scheduled onto the same shared resources to increase\nthe resource utilization and throughput of clusters. However, job runtimes and\nthe utilization of shared resources can vary significantly depending on the\nspecific combinations of co-located jobs.\n  This paper presents Hugo, a cluster scheduler that continuously learns how\nefficiently jobs share resources, considering metrics for the resource\nutilization and interference among co-located jobs. The scheduler combines\noffline grouping of jobs with online reinforcement learning to provide a\nscheduling mechanism that efficiently generalizes from specific monitored job\ncombinations yet also adapts to changes in workloads. Our evaluation of a\nprototype shows that the approach can reduce the runtimes of exemplary Spark\njobs on a YARN cluster by up to 12.5%, while resource utilization is increased\nand waiting times can be bounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 17:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Hence image-to-image or\nscanner-to-scanner translation is a crucial frontier in the area of medical\nimage analysis with a lot of potential applications. Nonetheless, a significant\npercentage of existing algorithms cannot explicitly exploit and preserve\ntexture details from target scanners and offers individual solutions towards\nspecialized task-specific architectures. In this paper, we design a multi-scale\ntexture transfer to enrich the reconstruction images with more details.\nSpecifically, after calculating textural similarity, the multi-scale texture\ncan adaptively transfer the texture information from target images or reference\nimages to restored images. Different from the pixel-wise matching space as done\nby previous algorithms, we match texture features in a multi-scale scheme\nimplemented in the neural space. The matching mechanism can exploit multi-scale\nneural transfer that encourages the model to grasp more semantic-related and\nlesion-related priors from the target or reference images. We evaluate our\nmulti-scale texture GAN on three different tasks without any task-specific\nmodifications: cross-protocol super-resolution of diffusion MRI, T1-Flair, and\nFlair-T2 modality translation. Our multi-texture GAN rehabilitates more\nhigh-resolution structures (i.e., edges and anatomy), texture (i.e., contrast\nand pixel intensities), and lesion information (i.e., tumor). The extensively\nquantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior results in inter-protocol or inter-scanner translation over\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 19:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

The sparse nature of event streams enables efficient downstream\nprocessing tasks as they are suited for power-efficient spiking neural\nnetworks. One of the challenges associated with neuromorphic vision is the lack\nof interpretability of event streams. While most application use-cases do not\nintend for the event stream to be visually interpreted by anything other than a\nclassification network, there is a lost opportunity to integrating these\nsensors in spaces that conventional high-speed CMOS sensors cannot go. For\nexample, biologically invasive sensors such as endoscopes must fit within\nstringent power budgets, which do not allow MHz-speeds of image integration.\nWhile dynamic vision sensing can fill this void, the interpretation challenge\nremains and will degrade confidence in clinical diagnostics. The use of\ngenerative adversarial networks presents a possible solution to overcoming and\ncompensating for a vision chip's poor spatial resolution and lack of\ninterpretability. In this paper, we methodically apply the Pix2Pix network to\nnaturalize the event stream from spike-converted CIFAR-10 and Linnaeus 5\ndatasets.

Their deployment in critical\ninfrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However,\nharnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far\nreaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment.\nAn attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending\ninformation from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium,\nthereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been\ninvestigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access\nto the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most\nresearch work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS.\nHowever, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to\ntotally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making\nCPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain\nfunctional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant\nmethodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial\nML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient.\nThis paper is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions\nbetween resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper\nconcludes with a number of research trends and promising future research\ndirections. Furthermore, with this paper, readers can have a thorough\nunderstanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS\nand countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 20:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Users could have varied preferences on\nvarious ranking signals of an email, such as relevance and recency based on\ntheir tasks at hand and even their jobs. Thus a uniform matching pattern is not\noptimal for all users. Instead, an effective email ranker should conduct\npersonalized ranking by taking users' characteristics into account. Existing\nstudies have explored user characteristics from various angles to make email\nsearch results personalized. However, little attention has been given to users'\nsearch history for characterizing users. Although users' historical behaviors\nhave been shown to be beneficial as context in Web search, their effect in\nemail search has not been studied and remains unknown. Given these\nobservations, we propose to leverage user search history as query context to\ncharacterize users and build a context-aware ranking model for email search. In\ncontrast to previous context-dependent ranking techniques that are based on raw\ntexts, we use ranking features in the search history. This frees us from\npotential privacy leakage while giving a better generalization power to unseen\nusers. Accordingly, we propose a context-dependent neural ranking model (CNRM)\nthat encodes the ranking features in users' search history as query context and\nshow that it can significantly outperform the baseline neural model without\nusing the context. We also investigate the benefit of the query context vectors\nobtained from CNRM on the state-of-the-art learning-to-rank model LambdaMart by\nclustering the vectors and incorporating the cluster information. Experimental\nresults show that significantly better results can be achieved on LambdaMart as\nwell, indicating that the query clusters can characterize different users and\neffectively turn the ranking model personalized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 23:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

This report received a significant amount of\ncriticism with claims that the cellular coverage, mainly available through\nLong-Term Evolution (LTE), was over-reported in some areas, especially those\nthat are rural and/or tribal [12]. We evaluate the validity of this criticism\nusing a quantitative analysis of both the dataset from which the FCC based its\nreport and a crowdsourced LTE coverage dataset. Our analysis is focused on the\nstate of New Mexico, a region characterized by diverse mix of\ndemographics-geography and poor broadband access. We then performed a\ncontrolled measurement campaign in northern New Mexico during May 2019.

There has\nbeen recent progress in graph modeling and in time series forecasting,\nrespectively, but an expressive and scalable approach for a network of series\ndoes not yet exist. We introduce Radflow, a novel model that embodies three key\nideas: a recurrent neural network to obtain node embeddings that depend on\ntime, the aggregation of the flow of influence from neighboring nodes with\nmulti-head attention, and the multi-layer decomposition of time series. Radflow\nnaturally takes into account dynamic networks where nodes and edges change over\ntime, and it can be used for prediction and data imputation tasks. On\nreal-world datasets ranging from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand nodes,\nwe observe that Radflow variants are the best performing model across a wide\nrange of settings. The recurrent component in Radflow also outperforms N-BEATS,\nthe state-of-the-art time series model. We show that Radflow can learn\ndifferent trends and seasonal patterns, that it is robust to missing nodes and\nedges, and that correlated temporal patterns among network neighbors reflect\ninfluence strength. We curate WikiTraffic, the largest dynamic network of time\nseries with 366K nodes and 22M time-dependent links spanning five years. This\ndataset provides an open benchmark for developing models in this area, with\napplications that include optimizing resources for the web. More broadly,\nRadflow has the potential to improve forecasts in correlated time series\nnetworks such as the stock market, and impute missing measurements in\ngeographically dispersed networks of natural phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

In\nparticular, many hypotheses have been put forth for the reasons for the\nunder-representation and under-performance of women in physics. Here, we\npresent a framework for helping all students learn in science courses that\ntakes into account four factors: 1) characteristics of instruction and learning\ntools, 2) implementation of instruction and learning tools, 3) student\ncharacteristics, and 4) students' environments. While there has been much\nresearch on factor 1 (characteristics of instruction and learning tools), there\nhas been less focus on factor 2 (students' characteristics, and in particular,\nmotivational factors). Here, we focus on the baseline motivational\ncharacteristics of introductory physics students obtained from survey data to\ninform factor 2 of the framework. A longitudinal analysis of students'\nmotivational characteristics in two-semester introductory physics courses was\nperformed by administering pre- and post-surveys that evaluated students'\nself-efficacy, grit, fascination with physics, value associated with physics,\nintelligence mindset, and physics epistemology. Female students reported lower\nself-efficacy, fascination and value, and had a more \"fixed\" view of\nintelligence in the context of physics compared to male students. Grit was the\nonly factor on which female students reported averages that were equal to or\nhigher than male students throughout introductory physics courses. These gender\ndifferences can at least partly be attributed to the societal stereotypes and\nbiases about who belongs in physics and can excel in it. The findings inform\nthe framework and have implications for the development and implementation of\neffective pedagogies and learning tools to help all students learn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 03:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

It is possible to artificially create\nlow-dimensional systems by fabricating ultrathin films, quantum wires, or\nquantum dots with flat interfaces. Some experiments have been performed on\nultrathin compounds of strongly correlated electron systems. However, since it\nis technically difficult to control multiple elements precisely, most of the\nproperties of artificially fabricated low-dimensional compounds fall into\nuncharted territory. Here we show that extraordinary metal-insulator\ntransitions that oscillate depending on the scale occur in CaRuO_3 films with a\nthickness of around several unit cells. We grow high-crystalline CaRuO_3\nultrathin films, whose surface roughness is controlled at 199 pm, by molecular\nbeam epitaxy. We observe that resistivity oscillates with a magic thickness of\n25 {\\AA}, which changes by 3 and 9 orders of magnitude at room temperature and\nat low temperature, respectively. These changes are much larger than quantum\nsize effects. We also confirm the same periodicity with photoelectron\nspectroscopy by etching the ultrathin film. Considering the large energy,\nperiodicity and anisotropy, we conclude that the oscillating transitions\noriginate from the commensurability of Mott insulation triggered by Peierls\ninstability arising from a dual restriction on the dimensions in wavenumber\nspace and real space.

A\nrecuperation energy-optimal speed profile is computed based on the impending\ndeceleration requirements for turning or stopping at an intersection. This is\ncomputed to maximize the regenerative braking energy while satisfying the\nphysical limits of an electrified powertrain. In automated driving, the\npowertrain of an electrified vehicle can be directly controlled by the vehicle\ncontrol unit such that it follows the computed optimal speed profile. To obtain\nsmooth optimal deceleration speed profiles, optimal deceleration commands are\ndetermined by a parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model that is\nobtained by regression analyses with real vehicle driving test data. The\nparameters are dependent on preview information such as residual time and\ndistance as well as target speed. The key design parameter is deceleration\ntime, which determines the deceleration speed profile to satisfy the residual\ntime and distance constraints as well as the target speed requirement. The\nbounds of deceleration commands corresponding to the physical limits of the\npowertrain are deduced from realistic deceleration test driving. The state\nconstraints are dynamically updated by considering the anticipated road load\nand the deceleration preference. For validation and comparisons of the EDPS\nwith different preview distances, driving simulation tests with a virtual road\nenvironment and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity are presented.

The light-curve modeling\nindicates that the anomalies are generated by source crossings over the\nplanetary caustics induced by planetary companions to the hosts. The estimated\nplanet/host separation (scaled to the angular Einstein radius $\\theta_{\\rm E}$)\nand mass ratio are $(s, q) = (1.81, 1.24\\times10^{-3})$ and $(s, q) = (1.25,\n2.38\\times10^{-3})$, respectively.

In some cases there is on-going shell\nburning on the white dwarf due to its high mass accretion rate or a prior nova\neruption, in other cases nuclear fusion occurs only occasionally as recurrent\nnova events. In this study we measure the spectral indices of a sample of\nsymbiotic systems in the Southern Hemisphere using the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array.

The results show a range of a factor of 10^4 in radio luminosity, and\na factor of 100 in linear size. These numbers are consistent with a picture\nwhere the rate of shell burning on the white dwarf determines the radio\nluminosity. Therefore, our findings also suggest that radio luminosity can be\nused to determine whether a symbiotic star is powered by accretion alone or\nalso by shell burning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 04:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Using this recursive procedure, at code length n, we can compute\nthe weight distribution of any polar cosets in time O(n^2). We show that any\npolar code can be represented as a disjoint union of such polar cosets;\nmoreover, this representation extends to polar codes with dynamically frozen\nbits. However, the number of polar cosets in such representation scales\nexponentially with a parameter introduced herein, which we call the mixing\nfactor.

We prove\nthat among all decreasing monomial codes with rates at most 1/2, self-dual\nReed-Muller codes have the largest mixing factors.

The intruder is estimated to reach\na specific location on the perimeter at a specific time.

The nuclear rainbow pattern,\nestablished as a broad oscillation of the Airy minima in the elastic cross\nsection, originates from an interference of the refracted far-side scattering\namplitudes. It is natural to expect a similar rainbow pattern also in the\ninelastic scattering of a nucleus-nucleus system that exhibits a pronounced\nrainbow pattern in the elastic channel.

To fill this gap, we introduce\nthe first speech corpus and pronunciation lexicon for the Kurdish language.\nRegarding speech corpus, we designed a sentence collection in which the ratio\nof di-phones in the collection resembles the real data of the Central Kurdish\nlanguage. The designed sentences are uttered by 576 speakers in a controlled\nenvironment with noise-free microphones (called AsoSoft Speech-Office) and in\nTelegram social network environment using mobile phones (denoted as AsoSoft\nSpeech-Crowdsourcing), resulted in 43.68 hours of speech. Besides, a test set\nincluding 11 different document topics is designed and recorded in two\ncorresponding speech conditions (i.e., Office and Crowdsourcing). Furthermore,\na 60K pronunciation lexicon is prepared in this research in which we faced\nseveral challenges and proposed solutions for them. The Kurdish language has\nseveral dialects and sub-dialects that results in many lexical variations. Our\nmethods for script standardization of lexical variations and automatic\npronunciation of the lexicon tokens are presented in detail. To setup the\nrecognition engine, we used the Kaldi toolkit. A statistical tri-gram language\nmodel that is extracted from the AsoSoft text corpus is used in the system.\nSeveral standard recipes including HMM-based models (i.e., mono, tri1, tr2,\ntri2, tri3), SGMM, and DNN methods are used to generate the acoustic model.\nThese methods are trained with AsoSoft Speech-Office and AsoSoft\nSpeech-Crowdsourcing and a combination of them. The best performance achieved\nby the SGMM acoustic model which results in 13.9% of the average word error\nrate (on different document topics) and 4.9% for the general topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 09:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Depriving users of control over who they\nwill work with stifles creativity, causes psychological discomfort and results\nin less-than-optimal collaboration results. In this work, we propose an\nalternative model, called Self-Organizing Teams (SOTs), which relies on the\ncrowd of online workers itself to organize into effective teams. Supported but\nnot guided by an algorithm, SOTs are a new human-centered computational\nstructure, which enables participants to control, correct and guide the output\nof their collaboration as a collective. Experimental results, comparing SOTs to\ntwo benchmarks that do not offer user agency over the collaboration, reveal\nthat participants in the SOTs condition produce results of higher quality and\nreport higher teamwork satisfaction. We also find that, similarly to machine\nlearning-based self-organization, human SOTs exhibit emergent collective\nproperties, including the presence of an objective function and the tendency to\nform more distinct clusters of compatible teammates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 09:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

It describes the continuous distribution of spherical\nparticles, governed by hard-core interactions. An important quantity of this\nmodel is the normalizing factor of this distribution, called the partition\nfunction. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating the\ngrand-canonical partition function of the hard-sphere model in $d$ dimensions.\nUp to a fugacity of $\\lambda < \\text{e}/2^d$, the runtime of our algorithm is\npolynomial in the volume of the system. This covers the entire known\nreal-valued regime for the uniqueness of the Gibbs measure.\n  Key to our approach is to define a discretization that closely approximates\nthe partition function of the continuous model. This results in a discrete\nhard-core instance that is exponential in the size of the initial hard-sphere\nmodel. Our approximation bound follows directly from the correlation decay\nthreshold of an infinite regular tree with degree equal to the maximum degree\nof our discretization. To cope with the exponential blow-up of the discrete\ninstance we use clique dynamics, a Markov chain that was recently introduced in\nthe setting of abstract polymer models. We prove rapid mixing of clique\ndynamics up to the tree threshold of the univariate hard-core model. This is\nachieved by relating clique dynamics to block dynamics and adapting the\nspectral expansion method, which was recently used to bound the mixing time of\nGlauber dynamics within the same parameter regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 10:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

For different reasons including computational\nperformance and Big Data management issues, we focus our research on Eulerian\ndebris flow modeling. Rather than using complex multiphase debris models, we\nrather use an empirical transportation and deposition model that takes into\naccount the interaction with the main water flow, friction/contact with the\nground but also debris interaction. In particular, for debris interaction, we\nhave used ideas coming from vehicular traffic flow modeling. We introduce a\nvelocity regularization term similar to the so-called ``anticipation term'' in\ntraffic flow modeling that takes into account the local flow between\nneighboring debris and makes the problem mathematically well-posed. It prevents\nfrom the generation of ``Dirac measures of debris'' at shock waves. As a\nresult, the model is able to capture emerging phenomenons like debris\naggregation and accumulations, and possibly to react on the main flow by\ncreating hills of debris and make the main stream deviate. We also discuss the\nway to derive quantities of interest (QoI), especially ``damage functions''\nfrom the debris density and momentum fields. We believe that this original\nunexplored debris approach can lead to a valuable analysis of tsunami flooding\ndamage assessment with Physics-based damage functions.

Such\napplications require a short flow completion time (FCT) to perform their jobs\neffectively. However, TCP is oblivious to the composite nature of application\ndata and artificially inflates the FCT of such flows by several orders of\nmagnitude. This is due to TCP's Internet-centric design that fixes the\nretransmission timeout (RTO) to be at least hundreds of milliseconds. To better\nunderstand this problem, in this paper, we use empirical measurements in a\nsmall testbed to study, at a microscopic level, the effects of various types of\npacket losses on TCP's performance. In particular, we single out packet losses\nthat impact the tail end of small flows, as well as bursty losses, that span a\nsignificant fraction of the small congestion window of TCP flows in\ndata-centers, to show a non-negligible effect on the FCT. Based on this, we\npropose the so-called, timely-retransmitted ACKs (or T-RACKs), a simple loss\nrecovery mechanism to conceal the drawbacks of the long RTO even in the\npresence of heavy packet losses. Interestingly enough, T-RACKS achieves this\ntransparently to TCP itself as it does not require any change to TCP in the\ntenant's virtual machine (VM). T-RACKs can be implemented as a software shim\nlayer in the hypervisor between the VMs and server's NIC or in hardware as a\nnetworking function in a SmartNIC. Simulation and real testbed results show\nthat T-RACKs achieves remarkable performance improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 11:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Millimeter-scale single crystals with homogeneous\nelement distribution can be efficiently acquired and easily exfoliated or\nintercalated in this materials category. Multifarious physical properties like\nsuperconductivity, magnetic ordering, metal-insulator transition and corrosion\nresistance have been exploited. Further research based on the concept of\nhigh-entropy van der Waals materials will enrich the high-throughput design of\nnew systems with intriguing properties and practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 11:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 14:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

Even the\ndevelopment of modern programming languages uses the CI/CD approach to swiftly\nprovide new language features and to adapt to new development environments.\nUnlike in the conventional approach, in the modern CI/CD approach, a language\nspecification is no more the oracle of the language semantics because both the\nspecification and its implementations can co-evolve.

One potential answer is reputation, whereby agents trade the immediate\ncost of cooperation for the future benefits of having a good reputation. Game\ntheoretical models have shown that specific social norms can make cooperation\nstable, but how agents can independently learn to establish effective\nreputation mechanisms on their own is less understood. We use a simple model of\nreinforcement learning to show that reputation mechanisms generate two\ncoordination problems: agents need to learn how to coordinate on the meaning of\nexisting reputations and collectively agree on a social norm to assign\nreputations to others based on their behavior. These coordination problems\nexhibit multiple equilibria, some of which effectively establish cooperation.\nWhen we train agents with a standard Q-learning algorithm in an environment\nwith the presence of reputation mechanisms, convergence to undesirable\nequilibria is widespread. We propose two mechanisms to alleviate this: (i)\nseeding a proportion of the system with fixed agents that steer others towards\ngood equilibria; and (ii), intrinsic rewards based on the idea of\nintrospection, i.e., augmenting agents' rewards by an amount proportionate to\nthe performance of their own strategy against themselves. A combination of\nthese simple mechanisms is successful in stabilizing cooperation, even in a\nfully decentralized version of the problem where agents learn to use and assign\nreputations simultaneously. We show how our results relate to the literature in\nEvolutionary Game Theory, and discuss implications for artificial, human and\nhybrid systems, where reputations can be used as a way to establish trust and\ncooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 12:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

In previous 1D hydrodynamic simulations, the transition region\nadaptive conduction (TRAC) method has been proven to capture aspects better\nthat are related to mass evaporation and energy exchange. We aim to extend this\nmethod to fully multidimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) settings, as\nrequired for any realistic application in the solar atmosphere. Because modern\nMHD simulation tools efficiently exploit parallel supercomputers and can handle\nautomated grid refinement, we design strategies for any-dimensional block\ngrid-adaptive MHD simulations. We propose two different strategies and\ndemonstrate their working with our open-source MPI-AMRVAC code. We benchmark\nboth strategies on 2D prominence formation based on the\nevaporation--condensation scenario, where chromospheric plasma is evaporated\nthrough the transition region and then is collected and ultimately condenses in\nthe corona. A field-line-based TRACL method and a block-based TRACB method are\nintroduced and compared in block grid-adaptive 2D MHD simulations. Both methods\nyield similar results and are shown to satisfactorily correct the\nunderestimated chromospheric evaporation, which comes from a poor spatial\nresolution in the transition region. Because fully resolving the transition\nregion in multidimensional MHD settings is virtually impossible, TRACB or TRACL\nmethods will be needed in any 2D or 3D simulations involving transition region\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 13:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

In this work, by leveraging\ntechniques like overparameterization and straight-through estimators, we\npropose a unified method that enables accurate end-to-end gradient based tree\ntraining and can be deployed in a variety of settings like offline supervised\nlearning and online learning with bandit feedback. Using extensive validation\non standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method provides best of both\nworlds, i.e., it is competitive to, and in some cases more accurate than\nmethods designed \\textit{specifically} for the supervised settings; and in\nbandit settings, where most existing tree learning techniques are not\napplicable, our models are still accurate and significantly outperform the\napplicable SOTA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 14:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 05:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 06:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Despite being major space weather drivers, our knowledge\nof the CME properties in the inner heliosphere remains constrained by the\nscarcity of observations at distances other than 1 au. Furthermore, most CMEs\nare observed in situ by single spacecraft, requiring numerical models to\ncomplement the sparse observations available. We aim to assess the ability of\nthe linear force-free spheromak CME model in EUHFORIA to describe the radial\nevolution of interplanetary CMEs, yielding new context for observational\nstudies. We model one well-studied CME, and investigate its radial evolution by\nplacing virtual spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line in the simulation domain.\nTo directly compare observational and modelling results, we characterise the\ninterplanetary CME signatures between 0.2 and 1.9 au from modelled time series,\nexploiting techniques traditionally employed to analyse real in situ data.\nResults show that the modelled radial evolution of the mean solar wind and CME\nvalues is consistent with observational and theoretical expectations. The CME\nexpands as a consequence of the decaying pressure in the surrounding wind: the\nexpansion is rapid within 0.4 au, and moderate at larger distances. The early\nrapid expansion could not explain the overestimated CME radial size in our\nsimulation, suggesting this is an intrinsic limitation of the spheromak\ngeometry used. The magnetic field profile indicates a relaxation of the CME\nduring propagation, while ageing is most probably not a substantial source of\nmagnetic asymmetry beyond 0.4 au. We also report a CME wake that is\nsignificantly shorter than suggested by observations. Overall, EUHFORIA\nprovides a consistent description of the radial evolution of solar wind and\nCMEs; nevertheless, improvements are required to better reproduce the CME\nradial extension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 14:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

A fixed step-size scheme\ndefines a family of time-homogeneous Markov chains, parametrized by the\nstep-size. Here, using this formulation, non-asymptotic performance bounds are\nderived, under Lyapunov conditions. Then, for any step-size, the corresponding\nMarkov chain is proved to admit a unique stationary distribution, and to be\ngeometrically ergodic. This result gives rise to a family of stationary\ndistributions indexed by the step-size, which is further shown to converge to a\nDirac measure, concentrated at the solution of the problem at hand, as the\nstep-size goes to 0. Finally, the asymptotic rate of this convergence is\nestablished, through an asymptotic expansion of the bias, and a central limit\ntheorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 14:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

However, because the decoder predicts text\ntokens (such as characters or words) in an autoregressive manner, it is\ndifficult for an AED model to predict all tokens in parallel. This makes the\ninference speed relatively slow. We believe that because the encoder already\ncaptures the whole speech utterance, which has the token-level relationship\nimplicitly, we can predict a token without explicitly autoregressive language\nmodeling. When the prediction of a token does not rely on other tokens, the\nparallel prediction of all tokens in the sequence is realizable. Based on this\nidea, we propose a non-autoregressive speech recognition model called LASO\n(Listen Attentively, and Spell Once). The model consists of an encoder, a\ndecoder, and a position dependent summarizer (PDS). The three modules are based\non basic attention blocks. The encoder extracts high-level representations from\nthe speech. The PDS uses positional encodings corresponding to tokens to\nconvert the acoustic representations into token-level representations. The\ndecoder further captures token-level relationships with the self-attention\nmechanism. At last, the probability distribution on the vocabulary is computed\nfor each token position. Therefore, speech recognition is re-formulated as a\nposition-wise classification problem. Further, we propose a cross-modal\ntransfer learning method to refine semantics from a large-scale pre-trained\nlanguage model BERT for improving the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 15:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 01:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 09:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 06:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 06:29:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 15:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

A controller network learns an\nimage selection policy by maximising an accumulated reward based on the target\ntask performance on the controller-selected validation set, whilst the target\ntask predictor is optimised using the training set. The trained controller is\ntherefore able to reject those images that lead to poor accuracy in the target\ntask. In this work, we show that the controller-predicted image quality can be\nsignificantly different from the task-specific image quality labels that are\nmanually defined by humans.

In the paper, several models of dark\nstars with Planck cores are considered, resulting in the following hypothesis\non the composition of dark matter. The galaxies are flooded with low-energetic\nradiation from the dark stars. The particle type can be photons and gravitons\nfrom the Standard Model, can also be a new type of massless particles. The\nmodel estimations show that the extremely large redshift factor $z\\sim10^{49}$\nand the emission wavelength $\\lambda_0\\sim10^{14}$m can be reached.

The distribution of sources also describes the\ndeviations from the flat shape. The model provides a good fit of experimental\nrotation curves. Outbreaks caused by a fall of an external object on a dark\nstar lead to emission wavelength shifted towards smaller values. The model\nestimations give the outbreak wavelength $\\lambda\\sim1$m compatible with fast\nradio bursts. The paper raises several principal questions.

Mathematical modeling and field observations have shown\nthat, under seasonal variation, the incidence rates of some endemic infectious\ndiseases fluctuate dramatically and the dynamics is often characterized by\nchaotic oscillations in the absence of specific vaccination programs. In fact,\nthe existence of chaotic behavior has been precisely stated in the literature\nas a noticeable feature in the dynamics of the classical\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) seasonally forced epidemic model.

In surface mining, assay\nmeasurements taken from production drilling often provide useful information\nthat allows initially inaccurate surfaces created using sparse exploration data\nto be revised and subsequently improved. Recently, a Bayesian warping technique\nhas been proposed to reshape modeled surfaces using geochemical and spatial\nconstraints imposed by newly acquired blasthole data. This paper focuses on\nincorporating machine learning into this warping framework to make the\nlikelihood computation generalizable. The technique works by adjusting the\nposition of vertices on the surface to maximize the integrity of modeled\ngeological boundaries with respect to sparse geochemical observations. Its\nfoundation is laid by a Bayesian derivation in which the geological domain\nlikelihood given the chemistry, p(g|c), plays a similar role to p(y(c)|g). This\nobservation allows a manually calibrated process centered around the latter to\nbe automated since ML techniques may be used to estimate the former in a\ndata-driven way. Machine learning performance is evaluated for gradient\nboosting, neural network, random forest and other classifiers in a binary and\nmulti-class context using precision and recall rates. Once ML likelihood\nestimators are integrated in the surface warping framework, surface shaping\nperformance is evaluated using unseen data by examining the categorical\ndistribution of test samples located above and below the warped surface.\nLarge-scale validation experiments are performed to assess the overall efficacy\nof ML assisted surface warping as a fully integrated component within an ore\ngrade estimation system where the posterior mean is obtained via Gaussian\nProcess inference with a Matern 3/2 kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 10:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 01:28:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 02:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

To be able to generate complex beam deformations via\ndielectric actuator, a linear distribution of electric potential on the beam\ncross section is proposed. Based on this electric potential, the electric field\nand the strain-like electrical variable are defined for the beam, where the\nstrain-like electrical variable is work-conjugated to the electric\ndisplacement. The electromechanically coupled strain energy for the beam is\nderived consistently from continuum electromechanics, which leads to the direct\napplication of the material models in the continuum to the beam model. The\nelectromechanically coupled problem in beam dynamics is first spatially\nsemidiscretized by 1D finite elements and then solved via variational time\nintegration. By applying different electrical boundary conditions, different\ndeformations of the beam are obtained in the numerical examples, including\ncontraction, shear, bending and torsion. The damping effect induced by the\nviscosity as well as the total energy of the beam are evaluated. The\ndeformations of the electromechanically coupled beam model are compared with\nthe results of the 3D finite element model, where a good agreement of the\ndeformations in the beam model and that in the 3D finite element model is\nobserved. However, less degrees of freedom are required to resolve the complex\ndeformations in the beam model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 14:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

A model representing\na benchmark configuration conforming to government-mandated operational\nguidelines, with demand estimated from disease burden data and service times\ncloser to international estimates (higher than observed), was also developed.\nSimulation outcomes for the three observed configurations indicate negligible\npatient waiting times and low resource utilisation values at observed patient\ndemand estimates.
