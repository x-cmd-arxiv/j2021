Simply said, while it is a fact that Deep Learning\n(DL) has become prevalent as a type of machine learning design inspired by the\nway humans learn, and utilized to perform automatic actions people might\ndescribe as intelligent, we want to anticipate, here, a discussion around the\nsubject whether machines, trained following this procedure, can extrapolate,\nfrom archaeological data, concepts and meaning in the same way that humans\nwould do. Even prior to getting to technical results, we will start our\nreflection with a very basic concept: Is a collection of satellite images with\nnotable archaeological sites informative enough to instruct a DL machine to\ndiscover new archaeological sites, as well as other potential locations of\ninterest? Further, what if similar results could be reached with less\nintelligent machines that learn by having people manually program them with\nrules? Finally: If with barrier of meaning we refer to the extent to which\nhuman-like understanding can be achieved by a machine, where should be posed\nthat barrier in the archaeological data science?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

In\nalternative models, Yukawa couplings may instead arise from a seesaw type\nmechanism involving the mixing of Standard Model (SM) chiral fermions with new\nvector-like fermions, controlled by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a new\ncomplex Higgs singlet field $\\langle \\Phi \\rangle$. For example, the largest\nthird family $(t,b)$ quark Yukawa couplings may be forbidden by a $U(1)'$ gauge\nor global symmetry, broken by $\\langle \\Phi \\rangle$, and generated effectively\nvia mixing with a vector-like fourth family quark doublet $(T,B)$. Such\ntheories predict a new physical Higgs singlet $\\phi$, which we refer to as the\nYukon, resulting from $\\langle \\Phi \\rangle$, in the same way that the Higgs\nboson $h^0$ results from $\\langle H\\rangle$. In a simplified model we discuss\nthe prospects for discovering the Yukon $\\phi$ in gluon-gluon fusion\nproduction, with $(t,b)$ and $(T,B)$ quarks in the loops, and decaying in the\nchannels $\\phi\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma, Z\\gamma$ and $\\phi\\rightarrow\ntT\\rightarrow tth^0,ttZ$. The potential for discovery of the Yukon $\\phi$ is\nstudied at present or future hadron colliders such as the LHC (Run 3), HL-LHC,\nHE-LHC and/or FCC.

The lithographic\nprocesses however pose a limit on the accuracy of the effective filter\nresonance frequencies. Off-resonance bias carriers could be used to suppress\nthe impact of intermodulation distortions, which nonetheless would\nsignificantly affect the effective bias circuit and the detector spectral\nperformance. In this paper we present a frequency shift algorithm (FSA) to\nallow off-resonance readout of TES's while preserving the on-resonance bias\ncircuit and spectral performance, demonstrating its application to the FDM\nreadout of a X-ray TES microcalorimeter array.

Previous studies show the angular power spectrum\n$(C_{\\ell})$ of the radio emission to be a broken power law, consistent with\nMHD turbulence. The break has been identified with the transition from 2D to 3D\nturbulence at the angular scale corresponding to the shell thickness.\nAlternatively, this can also be explained as 2D inverse cascade driven by\nenergy injection from knot-shock interactions. Here we present $C_{\\ell}$\nmeasured from archival VLA $5$GHz (C band) data, and Chandra X-ray data in the\nenergy ranges ${\\rm A}=0.6-1.0 \\, \\, {\\rm keV}$ and ${\\rm B} =4.2-6.0 \\, \\,\n{\\rm keV}$, both of which are continuum dominated. The different emissions all\ntrace fluctuations in the underlying plasma and possibly also the magnetic\nfield, and we expect them to be correlated. We quantify this using the cross\n$C_{\\ell}$ between the different emissions. We find that X-ray B is strongly\ncorrelated with both radio and X-ray A, however X-ray A is only very weakly\ncorrelated with radio. This supports a picture where X-ray A is predominantly\nthermal bremsstrahlung whereas X-ray B is a composite of thermal bremsstrahlung\nand non-thermal synchrotron emission. The various $C_{\\ell}$ measured here, all\nshow a broken power law behaviour. However, the slopes are typically shallower\nthan those in radio and the position of the break also corresponds to smaller\nangular scales. These findings provide observational inputs regarding the\nnature of turbulence and the emission mechanisms in Cas A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 16:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Pneumothorax is typically detected on a chest\nX-ray image through visual inspection by experienced radiologists. However, the\ndetection rate is quite low. Therefore, there is a strong need for automated\ndetection systems to assist radiologists. Despite the high accuracy levels\ngenerally reported for deep learning classifiers in many applications, they may\nnot be useful in clinical practice due to the lack of large number of\nhigh-quality labelled images as well as a lack of interpretation possibility.\nAlternatively, searching in the archive of past cases to find matching images\nmay serve as a 'virtual second opinion' through accessing the metadata of\nmatched evidently diagnosed cases. To use image search as a triaging/diagnosis\ntool, all chest X-ray images must first be tagged with identifiers, i.e., deep\nfeatures. Then, given a query chest X-ray image, the majority vote among the\ntop k retrieved images can provide a more explainable output. While image\nsearch can be clinically more viable, its detection performance needs to be\ninvestigated at a scale closer to real-world practice.

Many cities use participatory\nbudgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts\nproportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over\nlocal projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by\nits voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor\nsocial welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across\nmultiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global\nsocial welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A\nsocial-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred\nby a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.\nThus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory\nbudgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of\nfairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would\nhave received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing\nsocial welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can\nefficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in\nexpectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax\nfairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is\nwelfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 16:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

One solution is to train a supervised deep neural network on many digital\nphotos and the corresponding scanned photos. However, it requires a high labor\ncost, leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by\nsimulating degradation using image processing techniques. Their synthetic\nimages are formed with perfectly scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the\nreal-world degradation in smartphone photo scanning remains unsolved since it\nis more complicated due to lens defocus, lighting conditions, losing details\nvia printing. Besides, locally structural misalignment still occurs in data due\nto distorted shapes captured in a 3-D world, reducing restoration performance\nand the reliability of the quantitative evaluation. To solve these problems, we\npropose a semi-supervised Deep Photo Scan (DPScan). First, we present a way of\nproducing real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for\nsmartphone-scanned photo restoration. Also, Local Alignment is proposed to\nreduce the minor misalignment remaining in data. Second, we simulate many\ndifferent variants of the real-world degradation using low-level image\ntransformation to gain a generalization in smartphone-scanned image properties,\nthen train a degradation network to generalize all styles of degradation and\nprovide pseudo-scanned photos for unscanned images as if they were scanned by a\nsmartphone.

Many applications call for error rates in\nthe $10^{-15}$ regime, but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have\nphysical error rates near $10^{-3}$. Quantum error correction (QEC) promises to\nbridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many\nphysical qubits so that errors can be detected and corrected. Logical errors\nare then exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows,\nprovided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold. QEC also\nrequires that the errors are local and that performance is maintained over many\nrounds of error correction, two major outstanding experimental challenges.\nHere, we implement 1D repetition codes embedded in a 2D grid of superconducting\nqubits which demonstrate exponential suppression of bit or phase-flip errors,\nreducing logical error per round by more than $100\\times$ when increasing the\nnumber of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over\n50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analyzing error\ncorrelations with high precision, and characterize the locality of errors in a\ndevice performing QEC for the first time. Finally, we perform error detection\nusing a small 2D surface code logical qubit on the same device, and show that\nthe results from both 1D and 2D codes agree with numerical simulations using a\nsimple depolarizing error model. These findings demonstrate that\nsuperconducting qubits are on a viable path towards fault tolerant quantum\ncomputing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, models\nthat postulate that FRBs result from magnetized shocks or magnetic reconnection\nin a relativistic outflow are not specific to magnetar engines; instead, they\nrequire only the impulsive injection of relativistic energy into a dense\nmagnetized medium. Motivated thus, we outline a new scenario in which FRBs are\npowered by short-lived relativistic outflows (``flares'') from accreting black\nholes or neutron stars, which propagate into the cavity of the pre-existing\n(``quiescent'') jet. In order to reproduce FRB luminosities and rates, we are\ndriven to consider binaries of stellar-mass compact objects undergoing\nsuper-Eddington mass-transfer, similar to ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources.\nIndeed, the host galaxies of FRBs, and their spatial offsets within their\nhosts, show broad similarities with ULXs. Periodicity on timescales of days to\nyears could be attributed to precession (e.g., Lens-Thirring) of the polar\naccretion funnel, along which the FRB emission is geometrically and\nrelativistically beamed, which sweeps across the observer line of sight.\nAccounting for the most luminous FRBs via accretion power may require a\npopulation of binaries undergoing brief-lived phases of unstable\n(dynamical-timescale) mass-transfer. This will lead to secular evolution in the\nproperties of some repeating FRBs on timescales of months to years, followed by\na transient optical/IR counterpart akin to a luminous red nova, or a more\nluminous accretion-powered optical/X-ray transient.

However, statistics on test data\noften overstate model generalization, and thus, the performance of deployed\nmachine learning models can be variable and untrustworthy. Motivated by these\nconcerns, we develop methods to automatically discover and correct model errors\nbeyond those available in the data. We propose Defuse, a method that generates\nnovel model misclassifications, categorizes these errors into high-level model\nbugs, and efficiently labels and fine-tunes on the errors to correct them. To\ngenerate misclassified data, we propose an algorithm inspired by adversarial\nmachine learning techniques that uses a generative model to find naturally\noccurring instances misclassified by a model. Further, we observe that the\ngenerative models have regions in their latent space with higher concentrations\nof misclassifications. We call these regions misclassification regions and find\nthey have several useful properties. Each region contains a specific type of\nmodel bug; for instance, a misclassification region for an MNIST classifier\ncontains a style of skinny 6 that the model mistakes as a 1. We can also assign\na single label to each region, facilitating low-cost labeling. We propose a\nmethod to learn the misclassification regions and use this insight to both\ncategorize errors and correct them. In practice, Defuse finds and corrects\nnovel errors in classifiers. For example, Defuse shows that a high-performance\ntraffic sign classifier mistakes certain 50km/h signs as 80km/h. Defuse\ncorrects the error after fine-tuning while maintaining generalization on the\ntest set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 18:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

These\nfeature extractors are trained independently and usually on tasks different\nfrom the target domains, rendering these fixed features sub-optimal for\ndownstream tasks. Moreover, due to the high computational overload of dense\nvideo features, it is often difficult (or infeasible) to plug feature\nextractors directly into existing approaches for easy finetuning. To provide a\nremedy to this dilemma, we propose a generic framework ClipBERT that enables\naffordable end-to-end learning for video-and-language tasks, by employing\nsparse sampling, where only a single or a few sparsely sampled short clips from\na video are used at each training step. Experiments on text-to-video retrieval\nand video question answering on six datasets demonstrate that ClipBERT\noutperforms (or is on par with) existing methods that exploit full-length\nvideos, suggesting that end-to-end learning with just a few sparsely sampled\nclips is often more accurate than using densely extracted offline features from\nfull-length videos, proving the proverbial less-is-more principle.

Three particle flux settings with particle rates ranging\nfrom ~2.4x10^3 particles/s to ~5.2x10^6 particles/s were established for seven\nproton energies below 252.7 MeV.

This is achieved by\nusing end-grafted polymer chains that have an affinity to the substrate. For\nsufficiently strong surface interactions, a fraction of chains condenses into a\nnear-surface layer, while the remaining ones form the outer brush. The dense\nlayer and the more tenuous outer brush can be seen as coexisting microphases.\nThe effective grafting density of the outer brush is controlled by the\nadsorption strength and can be changed reversibly and in a controlled way as a\nresponse to changes in environmental parameters. The effect is demonstrated by\nnumerical SCF calculations and analyzed by scaling arguments. Since the\nthickness of the denser layer is about a few monomer sizes, its capacity to\nform a microphase is limited by the product of the brush chain length and the\ngrafting density. We explore the range of chain lengths and grafting densities\nwhere the effect is most pronounced. In this range, the SCF studies suggest\nthat individual chains inside the brush show large rapid fluctuations between\ntwo states that are separated by only a small free energy barrier. The behavior\nof the brush as a whole, however, does not reflect these large fluctuations,\nand the effective grafting density varies smoothly as a function of the control\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 20:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The effective policy requires taking into account public\ninformation and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to\nunderstand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for\nadaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome\ninclude (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different\ncontributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach\nthat enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c)\ntransparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in\nsuggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these\nchallenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work\non knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms\nof knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with.\nFurthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts,\nmanifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally,\ninterpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an\ninterpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical\nframework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over\nmulti-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous\ncounts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized\naggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional\nconstraints in a principled manner.

Our criticism thus remains valid, and disproves\nthe conclusions of the comment. This constitutes the main point of this reply.\n  We also provide a point-by-point response and discussion of Angelini et al.'s\nclaims. First, Angelini et al. claim that the prediction $2^{1/\\nu}=1$ of [1]\nis incorrect, because it results from the relation $\\lambda_{\\rm\nmax}=2^{1/\\nu}$ between the largest eigenvalue of the linearized\nrenormalization-group (RG) transformation and $\\nu$, which cannot be applied to\nthe ensemble renormalization group (ERG) method, because for the ERG\n$\\lambda_{\\rm max} =1 $. However, the feature $\\lambda_{\\rm max}=1$ is specific\nto the ERG transformation and it does not give any grounds for questioning the\nvalidity of the general relation $\\lambda_{\\rm max}=2^{1/\\nu}$ specifically for\nthe ERG transformation. Second, Angelini et al. claim that $\\nu$ should be\nextracted from an early RG regime (A), as opposed to the asymptotic regime (B)\nused to estimate $\\nu$ in [1] and that (B) is dominated by finite-size effects.\nStill, (A) is a small-wavelength, non-critical regime, which cannot\ncharacterize the critical exponent $\\nu$ related to the divergence of the\ncorrelation length. Also, the fact that (B) involves finite-size effects is a\nfeature specific to the ERG, and gives no rationale for extracting $\\nu$ from\n(A).\n  Finally, we refute the remaining claims made by Angelini et al., and thus\nstand by our assertion that the ERG method yields a prediction given by\n$2^{1/\\nu}=1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 20:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

A pair of randomly generated labeled Erdos-Renyi graphs with\npairwise correlated edges are considered.

The problem is challenged further\nin the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access\nto labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that\nachieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples\nare available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the\npredictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between\nthe input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the\nmodel's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with\nidentical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by\nexisting methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in\nthe test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains\nto propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods\nunder the UDA setting.

In\nabsence of labels, only ad-hoc ground metrics remain. Unsupervised ground\nmetric learning is thus a fundamental problem to enable data-driven\napplications of OT.

In response, we introduce a novel large-scale Korean\nhairstyle dataset, K-hairstyle, containing 500,000 high-resolution images. In\naddition, K-hairstyle includes various hair attributes annotated by Korean\nexpert hairstylists as well as hair segmentation masks. We validate the\neffectiveness of our dataset via several applications, such as hair dyeing,\nhairstyle transfer, and hairstyle classification.

In this\npaper, we theoretically prove that Mixup improves calibration in\n\\textit{high-dimensional} settings by investigating natural statistical models.\nInterestingly, the calibration benefit of Mixup increases as the model capacity\nincreases. We support our theories with experiments on common architectures and\ndatasets. In addition, we study how Mixup improves calibration in\nsemi-supervised learning.

This has motivated numerous studies on automating fake news\ndetection. Most studies explore supervised training models with different\nmodalities (e.g., text, images, and propagation networks) of news records to\nidentify fake news. However, the performance of such techniques generally drops\nif news records are coming from different domains (e.g., politics,\nentertainment), especially for domains that are unseen or rarely-seen during\ntraining. As motivation, we empirically show that news records from different\ndomains have significantly different word usage and propagation patterns.\nFurthermore, due to the sheer volume of unlabelled news records, it is\nchallenging to select news records for manual labelling so that the\ndomain-coverage of the labelled dataset is maximized. Hence, this work: (1)\nproposes a novel framework that jointly preserves domain-specific and\ncross-domain knowledge in news records to detect fake news from different\ndomains; and (2) introduces an unsupervised technique to select a set of\nunlabelled informative news records for manual labelling, which can be\nultimately used to train a fake news detection model that performs well for\nmany domains while minimizing the labelling cost.

Building\non this work, we have employed a longitudinal approach to study the way core\ndevelopers' attitudes, knowledge sharing behaviors and task performance change\nover the course of their project. Method: We first used Social Network Analysis\n(SNA) and standard statistical analysis techniques to identify and select\nartifacts and central practitioners from ten different software development\nteams.

To\nmitigate the influence of stragglers, this paper presents a novel FL algorithm,\nnamely Hybrid Federated Learning (HFL), to achieve a learning balance in\nefficiency and effectiveness. It consists of two major components: synchronous\nkernel and asynchronous updater. Unlike traditional synchronous FL methods, our\nHFL introduces the asynchronous updater which actively pulls unsynchronized and\ndelayed local weights from stragglers. An adaptive approximation method,\nAdaptive Delayed-SGD (AD-SGD), is proposed to merge the delayed local updates\ninto the joint model. The theoretical analysis of HFL shows that the\nconvergence rate of the proposed algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{t+\\tau})$\nfor both convex and non-convex optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 02:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

Our experiences suggest that\nexisting mobile UI testing tools are prone to exploration tarpits, where the\ntools get stuck with a small fraction of app functionalities for an extensive\namount of time. For example, a tool logs out an app at early stages without\nbeing able to log back in, and since then the tool gets stuck with exploring\nthe app's pre-login functionalities (i.e., exploration tarpits) instead of its\nmain functionalities. While tool vendors/users can manually hardcode rules for\nthe tools to avoid specific exploration tarpits, these rules can hardly\ngeneralize, being fragile in face of diverted testing environments and fast app\niterations. To identify and resolve exploration tarpits, we propose VET, a\ngeneral approach including a supporting system for the given specific Android\nUI testing tool on the given specific app under test (AUT). VET runs the tool\non the AUT for some time and records UI traces, based on which VET identifies\nexploration tarpits by recognizing their patterns in the UI traces. VET then\npinpoints the actions (e.g., clicking logout) or the screens that lead to or\nexhibit exploration tarpits. In subsequent test runs, VET guides the testing\ntool to prevent or recover from exploration tarpits. From our evaluation with\nstate-of-the-art Android UI testing tools on popular industrial apps, VET\nidentifies exploration tarpits that cost up to 98.6% testing time budget. These\nexploration tarpits reveal not only limitations in UI exploration strategies\nbut also defects in tool implementations. VET automatically addresses the\nidentified exploration tarpits, enabling each evaluated tool to achieve higher\ncode coverage and improve crash-triggering capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 07:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 18:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Stochastic matching is where a passenger sends out a\ncarpooling request at a meeting point, and then waits for the arrival of a\nself-selected driver who is already travelling to the requested meeting point.\nCrucially there is no centrally dispatched driver. Moreover, the carpooling is\nassured only between the meeting points, so the onus is on the passengers to\ntravel to/from them by their own means. Thus the success of a stochastic\ncarpooling service relies on the convergence, with minimal perturbation to\ntheir existing travel patterns, to the meeting points which are highly\nfrequented by both passengers and drivers. Due to the innovative nature of\nstochastic carpooling, existing off-the-shelf workflows are largely\ninsufficient for this purpose. To fill the gap in the market, we introduce a\nnovel workflow, comprising of a combination of data science and GIS (Geographic\nInformation Systems), to analyse driver GPS traces.

We consider a system\nin which a central monitor observes multiple binary Markov processes through a\ncommunication channel. The UoI of a Markov process corresponds to the monitor's\nuncertainty about its state. At each time step, only one Markov process can be\nselected to update its state to the monitor; hence there is a tradeoff among\nthe UoIs of the processes that depend on the scheduling policy used to select\nthe process to be updated. The age of information (AoI) of a process\ncorresponds to the time since its last update. In general, the associated UoI\ncan be a non-increasing function, or even an oscillating function, of its AoI,\nmaking the scheduling problem particularly challenging. This paper investigates\nscheduling policies that aim to minimize the average sum-UoI of the processes\nover the infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, and develop a Whittle index policy that is\nnear-optimal for the RMAB after proving its indexability. We further provide an\niterative algorithm to compute the Whittle index for the practical deployment\nof the policy. Although this paper focuses on UoI scheduling, our results apply\nto a general class of RMABs for which the UoI scheduling problem is a special\ncase. Specifically, this paper's Whittle index policy is valid for any RMAB in\nwhich the bandits are binary Markov processes and the penalty is a concave\nfunction of the belief state of the Markov process.

One cause for this shortcoming is that\nmodern architectures tend to rely on \"shortcuts\" - superficial features that\ncorrelate with categories without capturing deeper invariants that hold across\ncontexts. Real-world concepts often possess a complex structure that can vary\nsuperficially across contexts, which can make the most intuitive and promising\nsolutions in one context not generalize to others. One potential way to improve\no.o.d. generalization is to assume simple solutions are unlikely to be valid\nacross contexts and avoid them, which we refer to as the too-good-to-be-true\nprior.

By measuring helioseismic travel times\nbetween different location on the surface, flows and other interior properties\ncan be inferred using so-called sensitivity kernels which relate the amount of\ntravel-time shift with variations in interior proporties. In particular,\nsensitivity kernels for flows have been developed in the past, using either ray\nor Born approximation, and have been used to infer solar interior flows such as\nthe meridional circulation which is of particular interest for understanding\nthe structure and dynamics of the Sun. Here we introduce a new method for\nderiving three-dimensional sensitivity kernels for large-scale horizontal flows\nin the solar interior. We perform global-Sun wave-propagation simulations\nthrough 784 small flow perturbations placed individually in the interior of a\nsimulated Sun, and measure the shifts in helioseismic travel times caused by\nthese perturbations. Each measurement corresponds to a linear equation\nconnecting the flow perturbation velocities and the sensitivity kernels. By\nsolving the resulting large set of coupled linear equations, we derive\nthree-dimensional sensitivity kernels for horizontal flows which have a\nlongitudinal component (parallel to the wave's travel direction) and a\ntransverse component (perpendicular to the wave's travel direction). The\nkernels exhibit a \"banana\" shape, similar to kernels derived using Born\napproximation methods, and show that transverse components are not negligible\nin inversions for interior flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 09:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Alternatively, one could opt for field-specific keywords or\nhierarchical structures (e.g. PubMed's Medical Subject Headings, MeSH) to\ncompute \"interest market share\".

In some applications, such as data processing in graphs that\nrepresent physical networks, the initial network topology is known. However,\ndisconnections of edges in the network change the topology and may affect the\nsignals and processes over the network. In this paper, we consider the problem\nof edge disconnection identification in networks by using concepts from graph\nsignal processing (GSP). We assume that the graph signals measured over the\nvertices of the network can be represented as white noise that has been\nfiltered on the graph topology by a smooth graph filter. We develop the\nlikelihood ratio test (LRT) to detect a specific set of edge disconnections.\nThen, we provide the maximum likelihood (ML) decision rule for identifying\ngeneral scenarios of edge disconnections in the network. It is shown that the\nsufficient statistics of the LRT and ML decision rule are the graph frequency\nenergy levels in the graph spectral domain. However, the ML decision rule leads\nto a high-complexity exhaustive search over the edges in the network and is\npractically infeasible. Thus, we propose a low-complexity greedy method that\nidentifies a single disconnected edge at each iteration. Moreover, by using the\nsmoothness of the considered graph filter, we suggest a local implementation of\nthe decision rule, which is based solely on the measurements at neighboring\nvertices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform\nexisting detection and identification methods on a synthetic dataset and for\nline outage identification in power systems from the IEEE 118-bus test case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 10:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

However, its power cannot be\nfully utilized unless we can target the page content using fine-grained\ncategories, e.g., \"coupe\" vs. \"hatchback\" instead of \"automotive\" vs. \"sport\".\nThe widely used advertising content taxonomy (IAB taxonomy) consists of 23\ncoarse-grained categories and 355 fine-grained categories. With the large\nnumber of categories, it becomes very challenging either to collect training\ndocuments to build a supervised classification model, or to compose\nexpert-written rules in a rule-based classification system. Besides, in\nfine-grained classification, different categories often overlap or co-occur,\nmaking it harder to classify accurately. In this work, we propose wiki2cat, a\nmethod to tackle the problem of large-scaled fine-grained text classification\nby tapping on Wikipedia category graph. The categories in IAB taxonomy are\nfirst mapped to category nodes in the graph. Then the label is propagated\nacross the graph to obtain a list of labeled Wikipedia documents to induce text\nclassifiers. The method is ideal for large-scale classification problems since\nit does not require any manually-labeled document or hand-curated rules or\nkeywords.

However, the thermalization of wave energy is inefficient\nunless very short spatial scales are considered. Phase mixing is a mechanism\nthat can take energy down to dissipation lengths, but it operates over too long\na timescale. Here, we study how turbulence, driven by the nonlinear evolution\nof phase-mixed torsional Alfven waves in coronal loops, is able to take wave\nenergy down to the dissipative scales much faster than the theory of linear\nphase mixing predicts. We consider a simple model of a transversely nonuniform\ncylindrical flux tube with a constant axial magnetic field. The flux tube is\nperturbed by the fundamental mode of standing torsional Alfven waves. We solved\nthe three-dimensional (3D) ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations numerically to\nstudy the temporal evolution. Initially, torsional Alfven waves undergo the\nprocess of phase mixing because of the transverse variation of density. After\nonly few periods of torsional waves, azimuthal shear flows generated by phase\nmixing eventually trigger the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi), and the flux\ntube is subsequently driven to a turbulent state. Turbulence is very\nanisotropic and develops transversely only to the background magnetic field.\nAfter the onset of turbulence, the effective Reynolds number decreases in the\nflux tube much faster than in the initial linear stage governed by phase mixing\nalone. We conclude that the nonlinear evolution of torsional Alfven waves, and\nthe associated KHi, is a viable mechanism for the onset of turbulence in\ncoronal loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 11:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 14:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Any flow on a directed acyclic graph $G$\nhaving $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can be decomposed into a set of $O(m)$ paths.\nIn some applications, each solution (decomposition) corresponds to some\nparticular data that generated the original flow. Given the possibility of\nmultiple optimal solutions, no optimization criterion ensures the\nidentification of the correct decomposition. Hence, recently flow decomposition\nwas studied [RECOMB22] in the Safe and Complete framework, particularly for RNA\nAssembly.\n  They presented a characterization of the safe paths, resulting in an\n$O(mn+out_R)$ time algorithm to compute all safe paths, where $out_R$ is the\nsize of the raw output reporting each safe path explicitly. They also showed\nthat $out_R$ can be $\\Omega(mn^2)$ in the worst case but $O(m)$ in the best\ncase.

Becker's theory rationalizes the well-known\nphenomenon of homogamy among different-sex couples: individuals mate with their\nlikes because many characteristics, such as education, consumption behaviour,\ndesire to nurture children, religion, etc., exhibit strong complementarities in\nthe household production function. However, because of asymmetries in the\ndistributions of male and female characteristics, men and women may need to\nmarry \"up\" or \"down\" according to the relative shortage of their\ncharacteristics among the populations of men and women. Yet, among same-sex\ncouples, this limitation does not exist as partners are drawn from the same\npopulation, and thus the theory of assortative mating would boldly predict that\nindividuals will choose a partner with nearly identical characteristics.\nEmpirical evidence suggests a very different picture: a robust stylized fact is\nthat the correlation of the characteristics is in fact weaker among same-sex\ncouples. In this paper, we build an equilibrium model of same-sex marriage\nmarket which allows for straightforward identification of the gains to\nmarriage. We estimate the model with 2008-2012 ACS data on California and show\nthat positive assortative mating is weaker for homosexuals than for\nheterosexuals with respect to age and race. Our results suggest that positive\nassortative mating with respect to education is stronger among lesbians, and\nnot significantly different when comparing gay men and married different-sex\ncouples.

The non-shared architecture has the\nadvantage of mitigating internal language competition, especially when the\nshared vocabulary and model parameters are restricted in their size.

This increased awareness has led to the realisation\nthat existing legislation and regulation provides insufficient protection to\nindividuals, groups, society, and the environment from AI harms. In response to\nthis realisation, there has been a proliferation of principle-based ethics\ncodes, guidelines and frameworks. However, it has become increasingly clear\nthat a significant gap exists between the theory of AI ethics principles and\nthe practical design of AI systems. In previous work, we analysed whether it is\npossible to close this gap between the what and the how of AI ethics through\nthe use of tools and methods designed to help AI developers, engineers, and\ndesigners translate principles into practice. We concluded that this method of\nclosure is currently ineffective as almost all existing translational tools and\nmethods are either too flexible (and thus vulnerable to ethics washing) or too\nstrict (unresponsive to context). This raised the question: if, even with\ntechnical guidance, AI ethics is challenging to embed in the process of\nalgorithmic design, is the entire pro-ethical design endeavour rendered futile?\nAnd, if no, then how can AI ethics be made useful for AI practitioners? This is\nthe question we seek to address here by exploring why principles and technical\ntranslational tools are still needed even if they are limited, and how these\nlimitations can be potentially overcome by providing theoretical grounding of a\nconcept that has been termed Ethics as a Service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 21:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

To overcome these limitations,\nthis paper describes a MFEA-based approach to solve the CluSPT. The proposed\nalgorithm utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to construct the spanning trees in\nclusters while using evolutionary operators for building the spanning tree\nconnecting clusters. This approach takes advantage of both exact and\napproximate algorithms so it enables the algorithm to function efficiently on\ncomplete and sparse graphs alike.

Firstly, GFT is applicable to\na much larger class of signals, some of which cannot be analyzed with FT and\nLT.

The single fluid MHD description of a plasma is sufficiently\nadequate to study plasma phenomena . A plasma containing multi-species of\nparticles can also be described by representing each particle species by the\ncorresponding fluid. A partially ionized plasma consisting of electrons, ions\nand the neutral particles can be described as a single fluid by appropriately\ncombining the dynamics of each of the species. The three component plasma can\nalso be reduced to a two-fluid system. The most obvious way is to combine the\nelectron and the ion fluids to obtain a single fluid in the MHD limit and the\nneutral particles to form the second fluid. The other two possibilities are 1)\nto combine electron fluid and the neutral fluid into one fluid, here,\nchristened as ENe fluid, and treat the ions as the second fluid and 2) to\ncombine the ion fluid and the neutral fluid into one fluid, here, christened as\nINe fluid, and treat the electrons as the second fluid. It is found that the\nprocess of combining the electrons and the neutrals endows the neutrals with a\nnegative electric charge. So, here is a new plasma with heavy ( with mass of\nthe neutral particle assuming the electron mass to be negligible) negatively\ncharged particles along with the positively charged ions. One could in\nprinciple, similarly treat the second possibility. However , since there can be\na huge variation between the relative masses of the neutrals and the ions, the\nsystem turns out to be more complex and its discussion is deferred until later.\nHere, after establishing the framework for the two-fluid ENe-Ion system, the\ncharacteristic electrostatic wave mode of this novel two-fluid plasma is\ndetermined. The wave frequency is found to be a function of the collision\nfrequencies in addition to the dependence on usual parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 06:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 05:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}
