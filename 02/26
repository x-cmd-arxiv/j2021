We\ninvestigate collider signatures of the doubly and singly charged scalar bosons\nat the LHC for the high-luminosity upgraded option (HL-LHC) by looking at\ntransverse mass distributions etc. With the appropriate kinematical cuts we\ndemonstrate the background reduction in the minimal model in the following two\ncases depending on the mass of the scalar bosons.

Further improvements of the VLT interferometer GRAVITY (to\nGRAVITY+) and the next generation 25-40m telescopes (the ESO-ELT, the TMT and\nthe GMT) promise further progress.

This paper illustrates how to tackle the two main issues of\ntraining of large neural networks: memory limitations and impracticably large\ntraining times. Typically, training data is preloaded into memory prior to\ntraining, a particular challenge for seismic applications where data is\ntypically four times larger than that used for standard image processing tasks\n(float32 vs. uint8). Using a microseismic use case, we illustrate how over\n750GB of data can be used to train a model by using a data generator approach\nwhich only stores in memory the data required for that training batch.\nFurthermore, efficient training over large models is illustrated through the\ntraining of a 7-layer UNet with input data dimensions of 4096X4096. Through a\nbatch-splitting distributed training approach, training times are reduced by a\nfactor of four. The combination of data generators and distributed training\nremoves any necessity of data 1 subsampling or restriction of neural network\nsizes, offering the opportunity of utilisation of larger networks,\nhigher-resolution input data or moving from 2D to 3D problem spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

In this work, we investigate if the surface form of a number has any\ninfluence on how sequence-to-sequence language models learn simple arithmetic\ntasks such as addition and subtraction across a wide range of values. We find\nthat how a number is represented in its surface form has a strong influence on\nthe model's accuracy. In particular, the model fails to learn addition of\nfive-digit numbers when using subwords (e.g., \"32\"), and it struggles to learn\nwith character-level representations (e.g., \"3 2\"). By introducing position\ntokens (e.g., \"3 10e1 2\"), the model learns to accurately add and subtract\nnumbers up to 60 digits.

In order to reduce the dimensionality of the phase\nspace, classical approaches such as the P$_N$ (spherical harmonics) or the\nS$_N$ (discrete ordinates) ansatz are often used in the literature. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel approach: the hybrid discrete (H$^T_N$)\napproximation to the radiative thermal transfer equations. This approach\nacquires desirable properties of both P$_N$ and S$_N$, and indeed reduces to\neach of these approximations in various limits: H$^1_N$ $\\equiv$ P$_N$ and\nH$^T_0$ $\\equiv$ S$_T$. We prove that H$^T_N$ results in a system of hyperbolic\nequations for all $T\\ge 1$ and $N\\ge 0$. Another challenge in solving the TRT\nsystem is the inherent stiffness due to the large timescale separation between\npropagation and collisions, especially in the diffusive (i.e., highly\ncollisional) regime. This stiffness challenge can be partially overcome via\nimplicit time integration, although fully implicit methods may become\ncomputationally expensive due to the strong nonlinearity and system size. On\nthe other hand, explicit time-stepping schemes that are not also\nasymptotic-preserving in the highly collisional limit require resolving the\nmean-free path between collisions, making such schemes prohibitively expensive.\nIn this work we develop a numerical method that is based on a nodal\ndiscontinuous Galerkin discretization in space, coupled with a semi-implicit\ndiscretization in time. We conduct several numerical experiments to verify the\naccuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the H$^T_N$ ansatz and the numerical\ndiscretizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 21:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Manual testing is expensive and\ntime-consuming, especially when there are many mobile games to test and every\nsoftware version requires for extensive testing before being released. Existing\ntesting frameworks (e.g., Android Monkey) are limited because they adopt no\ndomain knowledge to play games. Learning-based tools (e.g., Wuji) involve a\nhuge amount of training data and computation before testing any game. This\npaper presents LIT -- our lightweight approach to generalize playtesting\ntactics from manual testing, and to adopt the generalized tactics to automate\ngame testing. LIT consists of two phases. In Phase I, while a human plays an\nAndroid game app G for a short period of time (e.g., eight minutes), \\tool\nrecords the user's actions (e.g., swipe) and the scene before each action.\nBased on the collected data, LIT generalizes a set of \\emph{context-aware,\nabstract playtesting tactics} which describe under what circumstances, what\nactions can be taken to play the game. In Phase II, LIT tests G based on the\ngeneralized tactics. Namely, given a randomly generated game scene, LIT\nsearches match for the abstract context of any inferred tactic; if there is a\nmatch, LIT customizes the tactic and generates a feasible event to play the\ngame. Our evaluation with nine games shows LIT to outperform two\nstate-of-the-art tools. This implies that by automating playtest, LIT will\nsignificantly reduce manual testing and boost the quality of game apps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

Two of the most\nimportant uncertainties are the sensitivity of the climate system and the\nso-called damage functions, which relate climate change to economic damages and\nbenefits. Despite broad awareness of these uncertainties, it is unclear which\nof them is most important, both on the global as well as the regional level.\nHere we apply different damage functions to data from climate models with\nvastly different climate sensitivities, and find that uncertainty in both\nclimate sensitivity and economic damage per degree of warming are of similar\nimportance for the global economic impact. Increasing the climate sensitivity\nor the sensitivity of the damage function both increases the economic damages\nglobally. Yet, at the country-level the effect varies depending on the initial\ntemperature as well as how much the country warms. Our findings emphasise the\nimportance of including these uncertainties in estimates of future economic\nimpacts, as they both are vital for the resulting impacts and thus policy\nimplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Though it has\nbeen argued in the past that the coupling of the axial meson to the nucleons is\nindeed strong, its mass is considerably heavier than that of the vector mesons\nand thus its exchange ends up being suppressed. Yet, this is not necessarily\nthe case in heavy hadrons molecules: we find that even though the contribution\nto binding from the axial meson is modest, it cannot be neglected in the\nisovector sector where vector meson exchange cancels out. This might provide a\nnatural binding mechanism for molecular candidates such as the $Z_c(3900)$,\n$Z_c(4020)$ or the more recently observed $Z_{cs}(3985)$. However the\n$Z_{cs}(3985)$ is more dependent on a mixture of different factors, which\n(besides axial meson exchange) include $\\eta$ exchange and the nature of scalar\nmeson exchange. Together they point towards the existence of two\n$Z_{cs}(3985)$-like resonances instead of one, while the observations about the\nrole of scalar meson exchange in the $Z_{cs}(3985)$ might be relevant for the\n$P_{cs}(4459)$.

Closely related to RP, the method of random Fourier\nfeatures (RFF) has also become popular, for approximating the Gaussian kernel.\nRFF applies a specific nonlinear transformation on the projected data from\nrandom projections. In practice, using the (nonlinear) Gaussian kernel often\nleads to better performance than the linear kernel (inner product), partly due\nto the tuning parameter $(\\gamma)$ introduced in the Gaussian kernel. Recently,\nthere has been a surge of interest in studying properties of RFF.\n  After random projections, quantization is an important step for efficient\ndata storage, computation, and transmission. Quantization for RP has also been\nextensive studied in the literature. In this paper, we focus on developing\nquantization algorithms for RFF. The task is in a sense challenging due to the\ntuning parameter $\\gamma$ in the Gaussian kernel. For example, the quantizer\nand the quantized data might be tied to each specific tuning parameter\n$\\gamma$. Our contribution begins with an interesting discovery, that the\nmarginal distribution of RFF is actually free of the Gaussian kernel parameter\n$\\gamma$. This small finding significantly simplifies the design of the\nLloyd-Max (LM) quantization scheme for RFF in that there would be only one LM\nquantizer for RFF (regardless of $\\gamma$). We also develop a variant named\nLM$^2$-RFF quantizer, which in certain cases is more accurate.

We study the related certification task: given an\ninstance of CFL reachability, are there small and efficiently checkable\ncertificates for the existence and for the non-existence of a path? We show\nthat, in both scenarios, there exist succinct certificates ($O(n^2)$ in the\nsize of the problem) and these certificates can be checked in subcubic (matrix\nmultiplication) time. The certificates are based on grammar-based compression\nof paths (for positive instances) and on invariants represented as matrix\nconstraints (for negative instances). Thus, CFL reachability lies in\nnondeterministic and co-nondeterministic subcubic time.\n  A natural question is whether faster algorithms for CFL reachability will\nlead to faster algorithms for combinatorial problems such as Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT). As a consequence of our certification results, we show\nthat there cannot be a fine-grained reduction from SAT to CFL reachability for\na conditional lower bound stronger than $n^\\omega$, unless the nondeterministic\nstrong exponential time hypothesis (NSETH) fails.\n  Our results extend to related subcubic equivalent problems: pushdown\nreachability and two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) language\nrecognition.

Because the typically\nslow flows are merely tiny perturbations on top of a close balance between\ngravity and the pressure gradient, such simulations place heavy demands on\nnumerical hydrodynamics schemes. We demonstrate how discretization errors on\ngrids of reasonable size can lead to spurious flows orders of magnitude faster\nthan the physical flow. Well-balanced numerical schemes can deal with this\nproblem. Three such schemes were applied in the implicit, finite-volume\nSeven-League Hydro (SLH) code in combination with a low-Mach-number numerical\nflux function. We compare how the schemes perform in four numerical experiments\naddressing some of the challenges imposed by typical problems in stellar\nhydrodynamics.

We present a comparison\nbetween two methods of cluster identification: the standard Matched Filter (MF)\nmethod in SZ cluster finding and a method using Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN). We further implement and show results for a `combined' identifier. We\napply the methods to simulated millimeter maps for several observing\nfrequencies for an SPT-3G-like survey. There are some key differences between\nthe methods. The MF method requires image pre-processing to remove point\nsources and a model for the noise, while the CNN method requires very little\npre-processing of images. Additionally, the CNN requires tuning of\nhyperparameters in the model and takes as input, cutout images of the sky.\nSpecifically, we use the CNN to classify whether or not an 8 arcmin $\\times$ 8\narcmin cutout of the sky contains a cluster. We compare differences in purity\nand completeness. The MF signal-to-noise ratio depends on both mass and\nredshift. Our CNN, trained for a given mass threshold, captures a different set\nof clusters than the MF, some of which have SNR below the MF detection\nthreshold. However, the CNN tends to mis-classify cutouts whose clusters are\nlocated near the edge of the cutout, which can be mitigated with staggered\ncutouts. We leverage the complementarity of the two methods, combining the\nscores from each method for identification. The purity and completeness of the\nMF alone are both 0.61, assuming a standard detection threshold. The purity and\ncompleteness of the CNN alone are 0.59 and 0.61. The combined classification\nmethod yields 0.60 and 0.77, a significant increase for completeness with a\nmodest decrease in purity. We advocate for combined methods that increase the\nconfidence of many lower signal-to-noise clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 21:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Here, we use the urban scaling framework to study an important,\nbut under-explored feature in this community - income inequality. We propose a\nnew method to study the scaling of income distributions by analyzing total\nincome scaling in population percentiles. We show that income in the least\nwealthy decile (10%) scales close to linearly with city population, while\nincome in the most wealthy decile scale with a significantly superlinear\nexponent. In contrast to the superlinear scaling of total income with city\npopulation, this decile scaling illustrates that the benefits of larger cities\nare increasingly unequally distributed. For the poorest income deciles, cities\nhave no positive effect over the null expectation of a linear increase. We\nrepeat our analysis after adjusting income by housing cost, and find similar\nresults. We then further analyze the shapes of income distributions. First, we\nfind that mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of income distributions all\nincrease with city size. Second, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a\ncity's income distribution and that of the largest city decreases with city\npopulation, suggesting the overall shape of income distribution shifts with\ncity population. As most urban scaling theories consider densifying\ninteractions within cities as the fundamental process leading to the\nsuperlinear increase of many features, our results suggest this effect is only\nseen in the upper deciles of the cities. Our finding encourages future work to\nconsider heterogeneous models of interactions to form a more coherent\nunderstanding of urban scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 20:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

As the result, the only known\nmethod of solving disjunctive hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is based on\nguess-and-verify, as formulated by Motik and Rosati in their original work. A\nmain obstacle is understanding how constraint propagation may be performed by a\nsolver, which, in the context of ASP, centers around the computation of\n\\textit{unfounded atoms}, the atoms that are false given a partial\ninterpretation.

Specifically, our approach consists of (i) noting that $I\\left(y;\nx\\right) = I\\left(u_y; u_x\\right)$ where $u_y$ and $u_x$ are the copula-uniform\ndual representations of $y$ and $x$ (i.e. their images under the probability\nintegral transform), and (ii) estimating the copula entropies\n$h\\left(u_y\\right)$, $h\\left(u_x\\right)$ and $h\\left(u_y, u_x\\right)$ by\nsolving a maximum-entropy problem over the space of copula densities under a\nconstraint of the type $\\alpha_m = E\\left[\\phi_m(u_y, u_x)\\right]$.

Extensive evaluation on real-world games demonstrates\nthat Q-VR can achieve an average end-to-end performance speedup of 3.4x (up to\n6.7x) over the traditional local rendering design in commercial VR devices, and\na 4.1x frame rate improvement over the state-of-the-art static collaborative\nrendering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 21:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

The RAN protocol stack is splitting\ninto eight possible disaggregated options combined into three network units,\ni.e., Central, Distributed, and Radio. Besides that, further advances allow the\nRAN software to be virtualized on top of general-purpose vendor-neutral\nhardware, dealing with the concept of virtualized RAN (vRAN). The disaggregated\nnetwork units initiatives reach full interoperability based on the Open RAN\n(O-RAN). The combination of NG-RAN and vRAN results in vNG-RAN, enabling the\nmanagement of disaggregated units and protocols as a set of radio functions.\nThe placement of these functions is challenging since the best decision can be\nbased on multiple constraints, such as the RAN protocol stack split, routing\npaths of transport networks with restricted bandwidth and latency requirements,\ndifferent topologies and link capabilities, asymmetric computational resources,\netc. This article proposes the first exact model for the placement optimization\nof radio functions for vNG-RAN planning, named PlaceRAN.

In the case\nof systems such as the animal vasculature, the transport of fluids is hindered\nby the inherent viscous resistance to flow while being kept in a dynamic state\nby the pulsatile nature of the heart and elastic properties of the vessel\nwalls. While this imparted pulsatility necessarily increases the dissipation of\nenergy caused by the resistance, the vessel elasticity helps to reduce overall\ndissipation by attenuating the amplitude of the pulsatile components of the\nflow. However, we find that this reduction in energy loss comes at the price of\nincreasing the time required to respond to changes in the flow boundary\nconditions for vessels longer than a critical size. In this regime, dissipation\nand response time are found to follow a simple power law scaling relation both\nin single vessels as well as hierarchically structured networks. We validate\nthe model in human vasculature and apply biologically relevant parameters to\nshow that response time has to be considered alongside dissipation as an\nimportant fitness cost function in the evolutionary optimization of animal\nvascular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 22:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 18:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 15:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

However, since the arms are adaptively selected--thereby\nyielding non-iid data--conducting inference accurately is not straightforward.\nIn particular, sample averaging, which is used in the family of UCB and\nThompson sampling (TS) algorithms, does not provide a good choice as it suffers\nfrom bias and a lack of good statistical properties (e.g. asymptotic\nnormality). Our thesis in this paper is that more sophisticated inference\nschemes that take into account the adaptive nature of the sequentially\ncollected data can unlock further performance gains, even though both UCB and\nTS type algorithms are optimal in the worst case. In particular, we propose a\nvariant of TS-style algorithms--which we call doubly adaptive TS--that\nleverages recent advances in causal inference and adaptively reweights the\nterms of a doubly robust estimator on the true mean reward of each arm. Through\n20 synthetic domain experiments and a semi-synthetic experiment based on data\nfrom an A/B test of a web service, we demonstrate that using an adaptive\ninferential scheme (while still retaining the exploration efficacy of TS)\nprovides clear benefits in online decision making: the proposed DATS algorithm\nhas superior empirical performance to existing baselines (UCB and TS) in terms\nof regret and sample complexity in identifying the best arm.

First, we prove that for $\\theta$ in $(1/2,1]$, the\nunderlying semigroup is not analytic, but is differentiable for $\\theta$ in\n$(0,1)$; this is in sharp contrast with known results for a single similarly\ndamped elastic system, where the semigroup is analytic for $\\theta$ in\n$[1/2,1]$; this shows that the degeneracy dominates the dynamics of the\ninteracting systems, preventing analyticity in that range.

For\neffectively managing inter-cell interferences (ICIs) among UEs due to intense\nreuse of time-frequency resource block (RB) resource, a first $p$-tier based RB\ncoordination criterion is proposed and adopted.

Although many strategies have been proposed to counter the\nhot-spot problem, one area that has received little attention is that of\nresolution.

It was not known whether the\nproperties that can be lost include the important property of termination (with\nprobability 1). In this paper, we first show that, for randomized algorithms,\ntermination can indeed be lost.\n  Golab et al. also introduced strong linearizability, and proved that strongly\nlinearizable objects can be used as if they were atomic objects, even for\nrandomized algorithms: they preserve the algorithm's correctness properties,\nincluding termination. Unfortunately, there are important cases where strong\nlinearizability is impossible to achieve. In particular, Helmi et al. MWMR\nregisters do not have strongly linearizable implementations from SWMR\nregisters.\n  So we propose a new type of register linearizability, called write\nstrong-linearizability, that is strictly stronger than linearizability but\nstrictly weaker than strong linearizability. We prove that some randomized\nalgorithms that fail to terminate with linearizable registers, work with write\nstrongly-linearizable ones. In other words, there are cases where\nlinearizability is not sufficient but write strong-linearizability is. In\ncontrast to the impossibility result mentioned above, we prove that write\nstrongly-linearizable MWMR registers are implementable from SWMR registers.\nAchieving write strong-linearizability, however, is harder than achieving just\nlinearizability: we give a simple implementation of MWMR registers from SWMR\nregisters and we prove that this implementation is linearizable but not write\nstrongly-linearizable. Finally, we prove that any linearizable implementation\nof SWMR registers is necessarily write strongly-linearizable; this holds for\nshared-memory, message-passing, and hybrid systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 00:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

Since the gas pipeline transient flow\nequations are less than the states, the boundary conditions are used as\nsupplementary constraints to predict the transient states. To increase the\nmeasurement redundancy, the zero mass flow rate constraints at the sink nodes\nare taken as virtual measurements. Secondly, to ensure the stability under bad\ndata condition, the robust Kalman filter algorithm is proposed by introducing a\ntime-varying scalar matrix to regulate the measurement error variances\ncorrectly according to the innovation vector at every time step. At last, the\nproposed method is applied to a 30-node gas pipeline networks in several kinds\nof measurement conditions. The simulation shows that the proposed robust\ndynamic state estimation can decrease the effects of bad data and achieve\nbetter estimating results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 01:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

For chest X-ray\nimaging, annotating large-scale data requires professional domain knowledge and\nis time-consuming. Thus, existing public chest X-ray datasets usually adopt\nlanguage pattern based methods to automatically mine labels from reports.\nHowever, this results in label uncertainty and inconsistency. In this paper, we\npropose many-to-one distribution learning (MODL) and K-nearest neighbor\nsmoothing (KNNS) methods from two perspectives to improve a single model's\ndisease identification performance, rather than focusing on an ensemble of\nmodels. MODL integrates multiple models to obtain a soft label distribution for\noptimizing the single target model, which can reduce the effects of original\nlabel uncertainty. Moreover, KNNS aims to enhance the robustness of the target\nmodel to provide consistent predictions on images with similar medical\nfindings. Extensive experiments on the public NIH Chest X-ray and CheXpert\ndatasets show that our model achieves consistent improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 02:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

A common task is\nto infer the underlying tree structure, given only observations of its terminal\nnodes. Many algorithms for tree recovery are computationally intensive, which\nlimits their applicability to trees of moderate size. For large trees, a common\napproach, termed divide-and-conquer, is to recover the tree structure in two\nsteps. First, recover the structure separately of multiple, possibly random\nsubsets of the terminal nodes. Second, merge the resulting subtrees to form a\nfull tree. Here, we develop Spectral Top-Down Recovery (STDR), a deterministic\ndivide-and-conquer approach to infer large latent tree models. Unlike previous\nmethods, STDR partitions the terminal nodes in a non random way, based on the\nFiedler vector of a suitable Laplacian matrix related to the observed nodes. We\nprove that under certain conditions, this partitioning is consistent with the\ntree structure. This, in turn, leads to a significantly simpler merging\nprocedure of the small subtrees. We prove that STDR is statistically consistent\nand bound the number of samples required to accurately recover the tree with\nhigh probability. Using simulated data from several common tree models in\nphylogenetics, we demonstrate that STDR has a significant advantage in terms of\nruntime, with improved or similar accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 02:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 09:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

We illustrate\nthat instead of reaching to one of the two undesirable extreme cases in the\ndilemma, a valid generative solution resides in a narrow \"elbow\" region in\nbetween. And we show that item perturbation can enforce slate variation and\nmitigate the over-concentration of generated slates, which expand the \"elbow\"\nperformance to an easy-to-find region. We further propose to separate a pivot\nselection phase from the generation process so that the model can apply\nperturbation before generation. Empirical results show that this simple\nmodification can provide even better variance with the same level of accuracy\ncompared to post-generation perturbation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 05:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

Based on a multi-band observational analysis, we find that\nthis whole event starts with a small filament whose eruption occurs at a\ncoronal geyser site after a series of homologous jets.

We formulate a Behavioral version of the\nInput-Output Parametrization (BIOP) for the optimal predictive control of\nunknown systems using output-feedback dynamic control policies. The main\nadvantages of the proposed framework are that 1) the state-space parameters and\nthe initial state need not be specified for controller synthesis, 2) it can be\nused in combination with state-of-the-art impulse response estimators, and 3)\nit allows to recover suboptimality results on learning the Linear Quadratic\nGaussian (LQG) controller, therefore revealing, in a quantitative way, how the\nlevel of noise in the data affects the performance of behavioral methods.\nSpecifically, it is shown that the performance degrades linearly with the\nprediction error of the behavioral model.

Although the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is\nwidely accepted as the most efficient variable importance measure for random\nforests, little is known about its statistical properties.

Consequently, we mathematically formalize the various\nimplemented MDA algorithms, and then establish their limits when the sample\nsize increases. This asymptotic analysis reveals that these MDA versions differ\nas importance measures, since they converge towards different quantities. More\nimportantly, we break down these limits into three components: the first two\nterms are related to Sobol indices, which are well-defined measures of a\ncovariate contribution to the response variance, widely used in the sensitivity\nanalysis field, as opposed to the third term, whose value increases with\ndependence within covariates. Thus, we theoretically demonstrate that the MDA\ndoes not target the right quantity to detect influential covariates in a\ndependent setting, a fact that has already been noticed experimentally. To\naddress this issue, we define a new importance measure for random forests, the\nSobol-MDA, which fixes the flaws of the original MDA, and consistently\nestimates the accuracy decrease of the forest retrained without a given\ncovariate, but with an efficient computational cost.

Ice mixtures of H$_2$O and CH$_4$ were grown in different conditions\nand the sublimation of CH$_4$ was monitored via infrared spectroscopy or via\nthe mass loss of a cryogenic quartz crystal microbalance.

Diffusion coefficients of methane on amorphous solid water have been\nmeasured to be between 10$^{-12}$ and 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ for\ntemperatures ranging between 42 K and 60 K.

First, the composite channel\ncontaining the direct path plus the product of reflected channels through the\nRIS is characterized.

By leveraging correlations between different data sets, multi-fidelity\nmethods often yield superior generalization when compared to models based\nsolely on a small amount of high-fidelity data. In this work, we present the\nuse of artificial neural networks applied to multi-fidelity regression\nproblems. By elaborating a few existing approaches, we propose new neural\nnetwork architectures for multi-fidelity regression. The introduced models are\ncompared against a traditional multi-fidelity scheme, co-kriging. A collection\nof artificial benchmarks are presented to measure the performance of the\nanalyzed models. The results show that cross-validation in combination with\nBayesian optimization consistently leads to neural network models that\noutperform the co-kriging scheme. Additionally, we show an application of\nmulti-fidelity regression to an engineering problem. The propagation of a\npressure wave into an acoustic horn with parametrized shape and frequency is\nconsidered, and the index of reflection intensity is approximated using the\nmulti-fidelity models. A finite element model and a reduced basis model are\nadopted as the high- and low-fidelity, respectively. It is shown that the\nmulti-fidelity neural network returns outputs that achieve a comparable\naccuracy to those from the expensive, full-order model, using only very few\nfull-order evaluations combined with a larger amount of inaccurate but cheap\nevaluations of a reduced order model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 11:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

State-of-art flight controllers can stabilize and control a\nquadrotor even when subjected to the complete loss of a rotor. However, these\nmethods rely on external sensors, such as GPS or motion capture systems, for\nstate estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this has not yet been achieved\nwith only onboard sensors. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that\ncombines fault-tolerant control and onboard vision-based state estimation to\nachieve position control of a quadrotor subjected to complete failure of one\nrotor. Experimental validations show that our approach is able to accurately\ncontrol the position of a quadrotor during a motor failure scenario, without\nthe aid of any external sensors. The primary challenge to vision-based state\nestimation stems from the inevitable high-speed yaw rotation (over 20 rad/s) of\nthe damaged quadrotor, causing motion blur to cameras, which is detrimental to\nvisual inertial odometry (VIO). We compare two types of visual inputs to the\nvision-based state estimation algorithm: standard frames and events.\nExperimental results show the advantage of using an event camera especially in\nlow light environments due to its inherent high dynamic range and high temporal\nresolution. We believe that our approach will render autonomous quadrotors\nsafer in both GPS denied or degraded environments.

Due to their hardware simplicity, these\naccelerators have evolved in terms of width from 64-bit vectors in Intel MMX to\n512-bit wide vector units in Intel Xeon Phi and AVX-512.

The dipolar interaction is found to promote chain-like\narrangement in such a cluster. Irrespective of cluster size, the local\nhysteresis response depends strongly on the corresponding dipolar field acted\non a nanoparticle. In a small k-mer, there is a wide variation in local\nhysteresis as a function of nanoparticle position. On the other hand, the local\nhysteresis is more uniform for larger k-mer, except for MNPs at the boundary.\nIn the case of superparamagnetic nanoparticle and weak dipolar interaction, the\nlocal hysteresis loop area Ai is minimal and depends weakly on the k-mer size.\nWhile for ferromagnetic counterpart, Ai is considerably large even for weakly\ninteracting MNPs. The value of Ai is found to be directly proportional to the\ndipolar field acting on the nanoparticle. The dipolar interaction and k-mer\nsize also enhances the coercivity and remanence. There is always an increase in\nAi with clutser size and dipolar interaction strength.

They have wide applications ranging from\ncomputer science to economics and biology. Yet, even though a player's payoff\nonly depends on the actions of their direct neighbors in graphical games,\ncomputing the Nash equilibria and making statements about the convergence time\nof \"natural\" local dynamics in particular can be highly challenging. In this\nwork, we present a novel approach for classifying complexity of Nash equilibria\nin graphical games by establishing a connection to local graph algorithms, a\nsubfield of distributed computing. In particular, we make the observation that\nthe equilibria of graphical games are equivalent to locally verifiable\nlabelings (LVL) in graphs; vertex labelings which are verifiable with a\nconstant-round local algorithm. This connection allows us to derive novel lower\nbounds on the convergence time to equilibrium of best-response dynamics in\ngraphical games. Since we establish that distributed convergence can sometimes\nbe provably slow, we also introduce and give bounds on an intuitive notion of\n\"time-constrained\" inefficiency of best responses. We exemplify how our results\ncan be used in the implementation of mechanisms that ensure convergence of best\nresponses to a Nash equilibrium. Our results thus also give insight into the\nconvergence of strategy-proof algorithms for graphical games, which is still\nnot well understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 13:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 12:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

We\ncan no longer depend on Moore's Law to increase computing performance. The only\nway to achieve higher performance or lower energy consumption is by building\ndomain-specific hardware accelerators. To efficiently design and verify those\ndomain-specific accelerators, we need agile hardware development. One of the\nmain obstacles when proposing such a modern method is the lack of modern tools\nto attack it. To be able to verify a design in such a time-constrained\ndevelopment method, one needs to have efficient tools both for design and\nverification.\n  This paper thus proposes ChiselVerify, an open-source tool for verifying\ncircuits described in any Hardware Description Language. It builds on top of\nthe Chisel hardware construction language and uses Scala to drive the\nverification using a testing strategy inspired by the Universal Verification\nMethodology (UVM) and adapted for designs described in Chisel. ChiselVerify is\ncreated based on three key ideas. First, our solution highly increases the\nproductivity of the verification engineer, by allowing hardware testing to be\ndone in a modern high-level programming environment. Second, the framework\nfunctions with any hardware description language thanks to the flexibility of\nChisel blackboxes. Finally, the solution is well integrated into the existing\nChisel universe, making it an extension of currently existing testing\nlibraries.\n  We implement ChiselVerify in a way inspired by the functionalities found in\nSystemVerilog.

This paper proposes a flexible and modular\nframework based on a micromorphic continuum encompassing matrix and fiber\nphases.

Accordingly, the fibrous constituents can be naturally associated\nwith the micromorphic directors and their non-affine motion within the bulk\nmaterial can be efficiently captured. Furthermore, constitutive relations can\nbe formulated based on kinematics quantities specifically linked to the\nmaterial response of the matrix, the fibres and their mutual interactions.\nAssociated stress quantities are naturally derived from a micromorphic\nvariational principle featuring dedicated governing equations for displacement\nand director fields. This aspect of the framework is crucial for the truly\nnon-affine elastic deformation description.

State-of-the-art action detectors based on Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable results by adopting\ntwo-stream or 3D CNN architectures. However, these methods typically operate in\na non-real-time, ofline fashion due to system complexity to reason\nspatio-temporal information. Consequently, their high computational cost is not\ncompliant with emerging real-world scenarios such as service robots or public\nsurveillance where detection needs to take place at resource-limited edge\ndevices. In this paper, we propose ACDnet, a compact action detection network\ntargeting real-time edge computing which addresses both efficiency and\naccuracy. It intelligently exploits the temporal coherence between successive\nvideo frames to approximate their CNN features rather than naively extracting\nthem. It also integrates memory feature aggregation from past video frames to\nenhance current detection stability, implicitly modeling long temporal cues\nover time. Experiments conducted on the public benchmark datasets UCF-24 and\nJHMDB-21 demonstrate that ACDnet, when integrated with the SSD detector, can\nrobustly achieve detection well above real-time (75 FPS). At the same time, it\nretains reasonable accuracy (70.92 and 49.53 frame mAP) compared to other\ntop-performing methods using far heavier configurations.

Thus it is necessary to\nreboot further investigation into the effect of the solar offset. In this work,\nfor the first time the combined studies of the solar offset, nuclei spectra and\nanisotropy are performed based on the SDP model. As a result, to reproduce CR\nspectra and anisotropy, the thickness of the halo $\\rm (\\xi z_h)$ increases\nlinearly with the displacement of the Sun. When the offset is $\\rm \\sim8~pc$ as\nestimated from the matter-borne methods, $\\rm \\xi z_h$ is about 0.9 kpc, which\nis a much thicker halo than usually. Moreover, the PeV anisotropy could\nestimate the value of diffusion coefficient, thus breaking the degeneracy of\ndiffusion coefficient and halo thickness. Therefore it is a good messenger to\nconstrain the halo thickness. On the other hand, the anisotropy in PeV energy\nregion, as a new probe, might also shed new light to constrain the solar\noffset.

We infer that the two subgroups\nof 14 H-poor (Type IIb/Ib/Ic/Ibn) and 15 H-rich (Type II/IIn) CCSNe have\ndifferent underlying progenitor age distributions, with the H-poor progenitors\nbeing younger at 3$\\sigma$ significance. However, we do note that the available\nsample sizes of CCSNe and host LIRGs are so far small, and the statistical\ncomparisons between subgroups do not take into account possible systematic or\nmodel errors related to the estimated starburst ages.

By\nintelligently adjusting the reflection coefficients of a large number of\npassive reflecting elements, the IRS can modify the wireless propagation\nenvironment in favour of signal transmission. Different from most of the prior\nworks which did not consider any cooperation between IRSs, in this work we\npropose and study a cooperative double-IRS aided multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) communication system under the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation channels.\nWe investigate the capacity maximization problem by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit covariance matrix and the passive beamforming matrices of the two\ncooperative IRSs. Although the above problem is non-convex and difficult to\nsolve, we transform and simplify the original problem by exploiting a tractable\ncharacterization of the LoS channels. Then we develop a novel low-complexity\nalgorithm whose complexity is independent of the number of IRS elements.\nMoreover, we analyze the capacity scaling orders of the double-IRS aided MIMO\nsystem with respect to an asymptotically large number of IRS elements or\ntransmit power, which significantly outperform those of the conventional\nsingle-IRS aided MIMO system, thanks to the cooperative passive beamforming\ngain brought by the double-reflection link and the spatial multiplexing gain\nharvested from the two single-reflection links. Extensive numerical results are\nprovided to show that by exploiting the LoS channel properties, our proposed\nalgorithm can achieve a desirable performance with low computational time.\nAlso, our capacity scaling analysis is validated, and the double-IRS system is\nshown to achieve a much higher rate than its single-IRS counterpart as long as\nthe number of IRS elements or the transmit power is not small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

In this regard, the focus in academia is\nincreasingly shifting from traditional technologies to electricity consuming\nalternatives. Calculating and comparing their performance with respect to\ntraditional technologies requires conversion factors (CFs) like a primary\nenergy factor and a CO2eq intensity. These reflect the PE and CE associated\nwith each unit of electricity consumed. Previous work has shown that the\ncalculation and use of CFs is a contentious and multifaceted issue. However,\nthis has mostly remained a theoretical discussion.

To satisfy strict URLLC requirements for uplink data\ntransmission, the specifications of 5G systems introduce the grant-free channel\naccess method. According to this method, a User Equipment (UE) performs packet\ntransmission without requesting channel resources from a base station (gNB).\nWith the grant-free channel access, the gNB configures the uplink transmission\nparameters in a long-term time scale. Since the channel quality can\nsignificantly change in time and frequency domains, the gNB should select\nrobust transmission parameters to satisfy the URLLC requirements. Many existing\nstudies consider fixed robust uplink transmission parameter selection that\nallows satisfying the requirements even for UEs with poor channel conditions.\nHowever, the more robust transmission parameters are selected, the lower is the\nnetwork capacity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm that selects\nthe transmission parameters depending on the channel quality based on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio statistics analysis at the gNB. Simulation results\nobtained with NS-3 show that the algorithm allows meeting the URLLC latency and\nreliability requirements while reducing the channel resource consumption more\nthan twice in comparison with the fixed transmission parameters selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

To address the performance\ndegradation on long videos, we further extend VSLNet to VSLNet-L by applying a\nmulti-scale split-and-concatenation strategy. VSLNet-L first splits the\nuntrimmed video into short clip segments; then, it predicts which clip segment\ncontains the target moment and suppresses the importance of other segments.\nFinally, the clip segments are concatenated, with different confidences, to\nlocate the target moment accurately.

They affect the\nchemical, magnetic, dynamical, and optical properties of their environment,\nfrom galaxies down to the interstellar medium, star-forming regions, and\nprotoplanetary disks. Their coagulation leads to shifts in their size\ndistribution and ultimately to the formation of planets. However, although the\ncoagulation process is reasonably uncomplicated to numerically implement by\nitself, it is difficult to couple it with multidimensional hydrodynamics\nnumerical simulations because of its high computational cost. We propose here a\nsimple method for tracking the coagulation of grains at far lower cost. Given\nan initial grain size distribution, the state of the distribution at time t is\nsolely determined by the value of a single variable integrated along the\ntrajectory, independently of the specific path taken by the grains. Although\nthis method cannot account for processes other than coagulation, it is\nmathematically exact, fast, inexpensive, and can be used to evaluate the effect\nof grain coagulation in most astrophysical contexts. It is applicable to all\ncoagulation kernels in which local physical conditions and grain properties can\nbe separated. We also describe another method for calculating the average\nelectric charge of grains and the density of ions and electrons in environments\nthat are shielded from radiation fields, given the density and temperature of\nthe gas, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, and the average mass of the ions. The\nequations we provide are fast to integrate numerically and can be used in\nmultidimensional numerical simulations to self-consistently calculate on the\nfly the local resistivities that are required to model nonideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 02:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 17:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 12:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Locating\nthe root-cause service, i.e., the service that contains the root cause of the\noutage, is a crucial step to mitigate the impact of the outage. In current\nindustrial practice, this is generally performed in a bootstrap manner and\nlargely depends on human efforts: the service that directly causes the outage\nis identified first, and the suspected root cause is traced back manually from\nservice to service during diagnosis until the actual root cause is found.\nUnfortunately, production cloud systems typically contain a large number of\ninterdependent services.
