The network takes an RGB image as input,\nregresses albedo, shadow and normal maps from which we infer least squares\noptimal spherical harmonic lighting coefficients. Our network is trained using\nlarge uncontrolled multiview and timelapse image collections without ground\ntruth. By incorporating a differentiable renderer, our network can learn from\nself-supervision. Since the problem is ill-posed we introduce additional\nsupervision. Our key insight is to perform offline multiview stereo (MVS) on\nimages containing rich illumination variation. From the MVS pose and depth\nmaps, we can cross project between overlapping views such that Siamese training\ncan be used to ensure consistent estimation of photometric invariants. MVS\ndepth also provides direct coarse supervision for normal map estimation. We\nbelieve this is the first attempt to use MVS supervision for learning inverse\nrendering. In addition, we learn a statistical natural illumination prior. We\nevaluate performance on inverse rendering, normal map estimation and intrinsic\nimage decomposition benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

But\nwhat do these statements mean? The reasons to call some neural activity a\nrepresentation and the assumptions that come with this term are not generally\nmade clear from its common uses in neuroscience. Representation is a central\nconcept in philosophy of mind, with a rich history going back to the ancient\nperiod. In order to clarify its usage in neuroscience, here we advance a link\nbetween the connotations of this term across these disciplines. We draw on a\nbroad range of discourse in philosophy to distinguish three key aspects of\nrepresentation: correspondence, functional role, and teleology. We argue that\neach of these aspects are implied by the explanatory role the term plays in\nneuroscience. However, evidence related to all three aspects is rarely\npresented or discussed in the course of individual studies that aim to identify\nrepresentations. Overlooking the significance of all three aspects hinders\ncommunication in neuroscience, as it obscures the limitations of experimental\nparadigms and conceals gaps in our understanding of the phenomena of primary\ninterest. Working from this three-part view, we discuss how to move toward\nclearer communication about representations in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

We subsequently\npropose a hybrid semantic web agent architecture, and use the various\ncomponents and subcomponents in order to provide a focused discussion in\nrelation to existing semantic web standards and community activities. Finally,\nwe highlight open research opportunities and challenges and take a broader\nperspective of the research by discussing the potential for intelligent\nsoftware web agents as an enabling technology for emerging domains, such as\ndigital assistants, cloud computing, and the internet of things.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 11:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 14:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Exciton dynamics\nencompass multiple time and length scales. Ultrafast femtosecond processes are\nintrachain and involve a quantum mechanical correlation of the exciton and\nnuclear degrees of freedom. In contrast, post-picosecond processes involve the\nincoherent Forster transfer of excitons between polymer chains. Exciton\ndynamics is also strongly determined by the spatial and temporal disorder that\nis ubiquitous in conjugated polymers. Since excitons are delocalized over\nhundreds of atoms, a theoretical understanding of these processes is only\nrealistically possible by employing suitably parametrized coarse-grained\nexciton-phonon models. Moreover, to correctly account for ultrafast processes,\nthe exciton and phonon modes must be treated on the same quantum mechanical\nbasis and the Ehrenfest approximation must be abandoned. This further implies\nthat sophisticated numerical techniques must be employed to solve these models.\nWe begin by describing the energetic and spatial distribution of excitons in\ndisordered polymer systems. Next, we discuss ultrafast intrachain exciton\ndecoherence caused by exciton-phonon entanglement, which leads to fluorescence\ndepolarization on the timescale of 10-fs. Interactions of the polymer with its\nenvironment causes the stochastic relaxation and localization of high-energy\ndelocalized excitons onto chromophores. The coupling of excitons with torsional\nmodes also leads to various dynamical processes. On sub-ps timescales it causes\nexciton density localization and local polymer planarization, while on post-ps\ntimescales stochastic torsional fluctuations cause exciton diffusion along the\npolymer chain. Finally, we describe a first-principles, Forster-type model of\nintrachain exciton transfer and diffusion, whose starting point is a realistic\ndescription of the donor and acceptor chromophores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

An experimental observation of\nsuch transitions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has become possible in\nheavy-ion collisions, where the chiral magnetic effect converts the chiral\nasymmetry (generated by topological transitions in hot QCD matter) into an\nelectric current, under the presence of the magnetic field produced by the\ncolliding ions.

The estimation requires experimental measurements on the pathway\ncomponents. However, in practice many pathway components are left unobserved\n(latent) because they are either unknown, or difficult to measure. Latent\nvariable models (LVMs) are well-suited for such estimation. Unfortunately,\nLVM-based estimation of causal queries can be inaccurate when parameters of the\nlatent variables are not uniquely identified, or when the number of latent\nvariables is misspecified. This has limited the use of LVMs for causal\ninference in biomolecular pathways. In this manuscript, we propose a general\nand practical approach for LVM-based estimation of causal queries. We prove\nthat, despite the challenges above, LVM-based estimators of causal queries are\naccurate if the queries are identifiable according to Pearl's do-calculus, and\ndescribe an algorithm for its estimation.

Considering the case of\ndata backup strategies, we aim towards mathematically modeling the underlying\nthreat models and decision problems. By formulating backup strategies in the\nlanguage of stochastic processes, we can translate the challenge of finding\noptimal defenses into a reinforcement learning problem. This enables us to\ntrain autonomous agents that learn to optimally support planning of defense\nprocesses. In particular, we tackle the problem of finding an optimal backup\nscheme in the following adversarial setting: Given $k$ backup devices, the goal\nis to defend against an attacker who can infect data at one time but chooses to\ndestroy or encrypt it at a later time, potentially also corrupting multiple\nbackups made in between. In this setting, the usual round-robin scheme, which\nalways replaces the oldest backup, is no longer optimal with respect to\navoidable exposure. Thus, to find a defense strategy, we model the problem as a\nhybrid discrete-continuous action space Markov decision process and\nsubsequently solve it using deep deterministic policy gradients.

These events are often\nhighly structured, resembling sequential associated releases of energy. Twenty\nyears of time sequence photometry is presented, indicating a basic sinusoidal\nlight curve of mean period 6.65d, with some phase shifting and long-term\ntemporal trends in amplitude and mean brightness. Spectroscopy reveals a\npeculiar star, best resembling a K3 subgiant that has evolved off the main\nsequence moderately red-ward of the giant branch. Spectroscopic and radial\nvelocity analyses indicate a binary system orbiting its barycenter with an\nunseen companion to the K3IV primary. This is not an eclipsing system with the\ninclination of the orbit precluding eclipse by the secondary. The system is at\na distance of 1.5kpc and analysis of GAIA observations leads to the conclusion\nthat the HR diagram position of MG1-688432 is established by an intrinsic\nfeature of the system, most likely either the stellar evolutionary state of the\nobserved star or the presence of small (non-gray) dust within the system. Two\nmechanisms that might give rise to the system are 1) impacts with tidally\ndisrupted planetary debris, and 2) magnetically induced chromospheric activity.\nAn intriguing idea that requires further investigation suggests that the unseen\ncompanion is perhaps a white dwarf star which has encountered a planet and\ntidally shredded it to produce a debris and dust veil that modulates the\nbrightness of the primary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 18:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 18:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

The two-scale feature is characterized by the\nscaling property that the center of the traveling wave is located at a ring of\nradius $O((T-t)^{1/2})$ surrounding the symmetry axis while the thickness of\nthe ring collapses at a rate $O(T-t)$. The driving mechanism for this potential\nsingularity is due to an antisymmetric vortex dipole that generates a strong\nshearing layer in both the radial and axial velocity fields. Without the\nviscous regularization, the $3$D Euler equations develop a sharp front and some\nshearing instability in the far field.

For BCO, the overall\nantiferromagnetic state in its triangular lattice contains unusual zigzag spin\npatterns. Here, using simple model calculations supplemented by DFT we explain\nand extend these results. We predict that ligands that in principle should be\nspinless, such as O$^{2-}$, will develop a net polarization when they act as\nelectronic bridges between transition metal (TM) spins ferromagnetically\nordered, regardless of the number of intermediate ligand atoms. The reason is\nthe hybridization between atoms and mobility of the electrons with spins\nopposite to those of the closest TM atoms. Moreover, for bonds with TMs\nantiferromagnetically ordered, counterintuitively our calculations show that\noxygens should also have a net magnetization for the super-super-exchange cases\nTM-O-O-TM while for only one oxygen, as in Cu-O-Cu, the O-polarization should\ncancel. Our simple model also allows us to explain the presence of nodes based\non the antibonding character of the dominant singly occupied molecular orbitals\nalong the TM-O bonds. Finally, the zigzag pattern order becomes the ground\nstate mainly due to the influence of the Hubbard $U$, that creates the moments,\nin combination with a robust easy-axis anisotropy that suppresses the competing\n120$^{\\circ}$ degree antiferromagnetic order of a triangular lattice.

In the light of our previous work the Tan, Walls\nand Collett setup can be described by a precise local hidden variable model,\nhence the claimed nonclassicality of this proposal is apparent, whereas the\nnonclassicality proof proposed by Hardy is impeccable. In this work we resolve\nthe following problem: which feature of the Hardy's approach is crucial for its\nsuccessful confirmation of nonclassicality. The scheme of Hardy differs from\nthe Tan, Walls and Collett setup in two aspects. (i) It introduces a\nsuperposition of a single photon excitation with vacuum as the initial state of\none of the input modes of a 50-50 beamsplitter, which creates the superposition\nstate of two separable (exit) modes under investigation. (ii) In the final\nmeasurements Hardy's proposal utilises a varying strengths of the local\noscillator fields, whereas in the TWC case they are constant. In fact the local\noscillators in Hardy's scheme are either on or off (the local setting is\nspecified by the presence or absence of the local auxiliary field). We show\nthat it is the varying strength of the local oscillators, from setting to\nsetting, which is the crucial feature enabling violation of local realism in\nthe Hardy setup, whereas it is not necessary to use initial superposition of a\nsingle photon excitation with vacuum as the initial state of the input mode.\nNeither one needs to operate in the fully on/off detection scheme. Despite the\nfailure of the Tan, Walls and Collett scheme in proving Bell nonclassicality,\nwe show that their scheme can serve as an entanglement indicator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 18:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

For this purpose we propose a\nlow-dimensional and stylised model of two classes of networked agents (termed\n\"labourers\" and \"administrators\" hereafter) that is inspired by Joseph\nTainter's theory of collapse of complex societies. We numerically model the\ndynamics of societal complexity, measured as the share of \"administrators\",\nwhich is assumed to affect the productivity of energy-producing `labourers\". We\nshow that collapse becomes increasingly likely if the model society's\ncomplexity continuously increases in response to external stresses that emulate\nTainter's abstract notion of problems that societies need to solve. We\nadditionally provide an analytical approximation of the system's dominant\ndynamics which matches well with the numerical experiments, thus, allowing for\na precise estimate of tipping points beyond which societal collapse is\ntriggered. The administration's ability for increasing productivity of labour\nshows to be the most influential parameter for longer survival times which is\nadditionally fostered by a minimum level of social connectivity. Finally, we\nshow that agents' stochastic transitions between labour force and\nadministration, i.e. social mobility, can increase the survival time of the\nmodeled society even further.

In time-domain\napproaches where the nonlinear coupling between electromagnetic (EM) waves and\nphotocarriers can be accounted for, the Poynting vector model is no longer\napplicable. One main reason is that the photocurrent radiates low-frequency EM\nwaves out of the spectrum of the source, e.g., terahertz (THz) waves are\ngenerated in THz photoconductive antennas. These frequency components do not\ncontribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy\nis smaller than the optoelectronic material's bandgap energy.

We find that an\ninstrument with the sensitivity of AMEGO could exclude non-rotating PBHs as the\nonly DM component for masses up to $7 \\times 10^{17}$ g at 95% confidence level\n(C.L.) for a monochromatic mass distribution, improving upon current bounds by\nnearly an order of magnitude. The forecasted constraints are more stringent for\nPBHs that have rotation, or which follow extended mass distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

If true, the resulting thermonuclear explosions should be able to account\nfor at least some of the range of SNe Ia observables. To study this, we conduct\na parameter study based on 3D simulations of double detonations in CO WDs with\na He shell, assuming different core and shell masses. An admixture of C to the\nshell and solar metallicity are included in the models. The hydrodynamic\nsimulations are carried out using the AREPO code. This allows us to follow the\nHe shell detonation with high numerical resolution, and improves the\nreliability of predicted nucleosynthetic shell detonation yields. The addition\nof C to the shell leads to a lower production of 56Ni while including solar\nmetallicity increases the production of IMEs. The production of higher mass\nelements is further shifted to stable isotopes at solar metallicity. Moreover,\nwe find different core detonation ignition mechanisms depending on the core and\nshell mass configuration. This has an influence on the ejecta structure. We\npresent the bolometric light curves predicted from our explosion simulations\nusing the radiative transfer code ARTIS, and make comparisons with SNe Ia data.\nThe bolometric light curves of our models show a range of brightnesses, able to\naccount for sub-luminous to normal SNe Ia.

The\nejecta asymmetries produce a wide distribution of observables, which might\naccount for outliers in the data. However, the models overestimate the extent\nof this compared to data.

However, in GaN-based\ntransistors, where the active region can withstand extremely strong electric\nfields, the field effect on the thermal transport properties has drawn little\nattention so far.

Key to this effect is the identification of a unique pulsed optical\nfield structure, which we refer to as a V-wave, that is endowed with\nintrinsically equal diffraction and dispersion lengths in free space, thereby\nenabling self-imaging to proceed in lockstep in space and time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 20:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) along with orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be used to deal with these problems.\nNevertheless, when the propagation delay across the base station (BS) antenna\narray exceeds the symbol period, the spatial response of the BS array varies\nacross the OFDM subcarriers.

Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks of [Kempe et al., JCSS,\n2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\\{u,v\\}$\nwith time-label $t$ specifies that \"$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$\".\nThis is a symmetric relation between $u$ and $v$, and it can be interpreted\nthat the information can flow in either direction. In this paper we make a\nfirst attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge\ncan impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically,\nwe introduce the notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we\nsystematically investigate its algorithmic behavior in various situations. An\norientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive if, whenever\n$u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a\ndirected edge towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a\ndirected edge towards $w$ with some time-label $t_3\\geq t_2$. If we just demand\nthat this implication holds whenever $t_2 > t_1$, the orientation is called\nstrictly temporally transitive. Our main result is a conceptually simple, yet\ntechnically quite involved, polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a\ngiven temporal graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is transitively orientable. In wide contrast\nwe prove that, surprisingly, it is NP-hard to recognize whether $\\mathcal{G}$\nis strictly transitively orientable.

Although several learned indexes have been\nproposed to process spatial data, the main idea behind these approaches is to\nutilize the existing one-dimensional learned models, which requires either\nconverting the spatial data into one-dimensional data or applying the learned\nmodel on individual dimensions separately. As a result, these approaches cannot\nfully utilize or take advantage of the information regarding the spatial\ndistribution of the original spatial data.

To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification\n(UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the\nmodel weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale\ngraphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular\nlottery ticket hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph\nlottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core sub-dataset and sparse sub-network,\nwhich can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full dense graph\nby iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural\nnetworks, GLT can be trained in isolation to match the performance of training\nwith the full model and graph, and can be drawn from both randomly initialized\nand self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been experimentally\nverified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both\nsmall-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale\ndatasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).

The approach is\nbased on a study of the variational-analytic properties of general convex\noptimization problems that are (partial) infimal projections of the the sum of\nthe function in question and the perspective map of a convex kernel. When the\nkernel is the Euclidean norm squared, the solution map corresponds to the\nproximal map, and thus the variational properties derived for the general case\napply to the proximal case. Properties of the value function and the\ncorresponding solution map -- including local Lipschitz continuity, directional\ndifferentiability, and semismoothness -- are derived. An SC$^1$ optimization\nframework for computing epigraphical and level-set projections is thus\nestablished.

In\ndetail, we propose a novel method to disguise data hiding tools, including a\ndata embedding tool and a data extraction tool, as a deep neural network (DNN)\nwith an ordinary task (i.e., style transfer). After training the DNN for both\nstyle transfer and data hiding, while the DNN can transfer the style of an\nimage to the target one, it can also hide secret data into a cover image or\nextract secret data from a stego image.

A primary reason for their success is their ability\nto effectively capture complex temporal dynamics across multiple related time\nseries. The advantages of these deep forecasters only start to emerge in the\npresence of a sufficient amount of data. This poses a challenge for typical\nforecasting problems in practice, where there is a limited number of time\nseries or observations per time series, or both. To cope with this data\nscarcity issue, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework, Domain\nAdaptation Forecaster (DAF). DAF leverages statistical strengths from a\nrelevant domain with abundant data samples (source) to improve the performance\non the domain of interest with limited data (target). In particular, we use an\nattention-based shared module with a domain discriminator across domains and\nprivate modules for individual domains. We induce domain-invariant latent\nfeatures (queries and keys) and retrain domain-specific features (values)\nsimultaneously to enable joint training of forecasters on source and target\ndomains. A main insight is that our design of aligning keys allows the target\ndomain to leverage source time series even with different characteristics.\nExtensive experiments on various domains demonstrate that our proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets,\nand ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our design choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 07:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 05:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 07:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 04:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 22:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 01:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

SQ hosts a 30 kpc long shocked ridge\ntriggered by a galaxy collision at a relative velocity of 1000 km/s, where\nlarge amounts of molecular gas coexist with a hot, X-ray emitting, plasma. COS\nspectroscopy at five positions sampling the diverse environments of the SQ\nintra-group medium reveals very broad (2000 km/s) Ly$\\alpha$ line emission with\ncomplex line shapes. The Ly$\\alpha$ line profiles are similar to or much\nbroader than those of H$\\beta$, [CII]$\\lambda157.7\\mu$m and CO~(1-0) emission.\nThe extreme breadth of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission, compared with H$\\beta$, implies\nresonance scattering within the observed structure. Scattering indicates that\nthe neutral gas of the intra-group medium is clumpy, with a significant surface\ncovering factor. We observe significant variations in the Ly$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$\nflux ratio between positions and velocity components. From the mean line ratio\naveraged over positions and velocities, we estimate the effective escape\nfraction of Ly$\\alpha$ photons to be 10-30%. Remarkably, over more than four\norders of magnitude in temperature, the powers radiated by X-rays, Ly$\\alpha$,\nH$_2$, [CII] are comparable within a factor of a few, assuming that the ratio\nof the Ly$\\alpha$ to H$_2$ fluxes over the whole shocked intra-group medium\nstay in line with those observed at those five positions. Both shocks and\nmixing layers could contribute to the energy dissipation associated with a\nturbulent energy cascade. Our results may be relevant for the cooling of gas at\nhigh redshifts, where the metal content is lower than in this local system, and\na high amplitude of turbulence is more common.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 01:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 12:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

This has been recently evaluated by an\nexact, spatially-local relationship [Johnson, P. L. 2020, Phys. Rev. Lett.,\n\\textbf{124}, 104501], which also highlights the contribution of strain\nself-amplification. In this paper, the role of these two mechanisms is explored\nin more detail. Vorticity stretching and strain amplification interactions\nbetween velocity gradients filtered at the same scale account for about half of\nthe energy cascade rate, directly connecting restricted Euler dynamics to the\nenergy cascade. Multiscale strain amplification and vorticity stretching are\nequally important, however, and more closely resemble eddy viscosity physics.\nMoreover, ensuing evidence of a power-law decay of energy transfer\ncontributions from disparate scales supports the notion of an energy cascade,\nalbeit a `leaky' one. Besides vorticity stretching and strain\nself-amplification, a third mechanism of energy transfer is introduced and\nrelated to the vortex thinning mechanism important for the inverse cascade in\ntwo dimensions. Simulation results indicate this mechanism also provides a net\nsource of backscatter in three-dimensional turbulence, in the range of scales\nassociated with the bottleneck effect. Taken together, these results provide a\nrich set of implications for large-eddy simulation modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 02:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Recent approaches represent nuclei by means of\npolygons to differentiate between touching and overlapping nuclei and have\naccordingly achieved promising performance. Each polygon is represented by a\nset of centroid-to-boundary distances, which are in turn predicted by features\nof the centroid pixel for a single nucleus. However, using the centroid pixel\nalone does not provide sufficient contextual information for robust prediction\nand thus degrades the segmentation accuracy. To handle this problem, we propose\na Context-aware Polygon Proposal Network (CPP-Net) for nucleus segmentation.\nFirst, we sample a point set rather than one single pixel within each cell for\ndistance prediction. This strategy substantially enhances contextual\ninformation and thereby improves the robustness of the prediction. Second, we\npropose a Confidence-based Weighting Module, which adaptively fuses the\npredictions from the sampled point set. Third, we introduce a novel Shape-Aware\nPerceptual (SAP) loss that constrains the shape of the predicted polygons.\nHere, the SAP loss is based on an additional network that is pre-trained by\nmeans of mapping the centroid probability map and the pixel-to-boundary\ndistance maps to a different nucleus representation. Extensive experiments\njustify the effectiveness of each component in the proposed CPP-Net.

Two broad\nregimes of volatile element transport in and out of planetary building blocks\nhave been identified: that occurring when the nebula is still present, and that\noccurring after it has dissipated. Evidence for volatile element loss in\nplanetary bodies after the dissipation of the solar nebula is found in the high\nMn to Na abundance ratio of Mars, the Moon, and many of the solar system's\nminor bodies. This volatile loss is expected to occur when the bodies are\nheated by planetary collisions and short-lived radionuclides, and enter a\nglobal magma ocean stage early in their history. The bulk composition of\nexo-planetary bodies can be determined by observing white dwarfs which have\naccreted planetary material. The abundances of Na, Mn, and Mg have been\nmeasured for the accreting material in four polluted white dwarf systems.\nWhilst the Mn/Na abundances of three white dwarf systems are consistent with\nthe fractionations expected during nebula condensation, the high Mn/Na\nabundance ratio of GD362 means that it is not (>3 sigma). We find that heating\nof the planetary system orbiting GD362 during the star's giant branch evolution\nis insufficient to produce such a high Mn/Na. We, therefore, propose that\nvolatile loss occurred in a manner analogous to that of the solar system\nbodies, either due to impacts shortly after their formation or from heating by\nshort-lived radionuclides. We present potential evidence for a magma ocean\nstage on the exo-planetary body which currently pollutes the atmosphere of\nGD362.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 12:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

The purpose of this work is to investigate the\ndependence of observations on angular resolution (beam sizes), sensitivity\n(noise levels), distances, and molecular tracers. To this end, we use\nhigh-quality CO images of a large-scale region (25.8 <l< 49.7 deg and |b|<5\ndeg) mapped by the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey as a\nbenchmark to simulate observations with larger beam sizes and higher noise\nlevels, deriving corresponding beam filling and sensitivity clip factors. The\nsensitivity clip factor is defined to be the completeness of observed flux.\nTaking the entire image as a whole object, we found that 12CO has the largest\nbeam filling and sensitivity clip factors and C18O has the lowest. For\nmolecular cloud samples extracted from images, the beam filling factor can be\ndescribed by a characteristic size, $l_{1/4}$=0.762 (in beam size), at which\nthe beam filling factor is approximately 1/4. The sensitivity clip factor shows\na similar relationship but is more correlated with the mean voxel\nsignal-to-noise ratio of molecular clouds.

The latter situation also\ninvolves an initial boundary value problem for a nonlocal scalar equation that\nhas an interest of its own and for which we consequently provide a general\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 15:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

The learning\ncurve of the existing static and dynamic analysis tools are steep, which\nrequires understanding low-level details to interpret the findings for\nactionable optimizations. Additionally, application performance is a function\nof an infinite number of unknowns stemming from the application-, runtime-, and\ninteractions between the OS and underlying hardware, making it difficult, if\nnot impossible, to model using any deep learning technique, especially without\na large labeled dataset. In this paper, we address both of these problems by\npresenting a large corpus of a labeled dataset for the community and take a\ncomparative analysis approach to mitigate all unknowns except their source code\ndifferences between different correct implementations of the same problem. We\nput the power of deep learning to the test for automatically extracting\ninformation from the hierarchical structure of abstract syntax trees to\nrepresent source code.

Physicists are now also beginning to successfully\naddress problems in cosmology based on properties of the quantum vacuum. The\nterms ``vacuum catastrophe'' and ``old cosmological problem'' refer,\nrespectively, to the predictions that the vacuum energy density and the\ncosmological constant are both approximately 120 orders of magnitude larger\nthan the observed values. Using properties of the quantum vacuum and\nwell-established physics, it is possible to demonstrate that the huge vacuum\nenergy cannot transfer energy to normal matter; accordingly, vacuum energy\ncontributes neither to the observed energy density of the universe nor to the\ncosmological constant, which plays a central role in the accelerating expansion\nof the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 21:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}
