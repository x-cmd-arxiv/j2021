We\nanswer this affirmatively by showing that the multi-site Glauber dynamics on\nthe set of monomers in a monomer-dimer system always mixes rapidly, and that\nthis dynamics can be implemented efficiently on downward-closed families of\ngraphs where counting perfect matchings is tractable. As further applications\nof our results, we show how to sample efficiently using multi-site Glauber\ndynamics from partition-constrained strongly Rayleigh distributions, and\nnonsymmetric determinantal point processes.\n  In order to analyze mixing properties of the multi-site Glauber dynamics, we\nestablish two notions for generating polynomials of discrete set-valued\ndistributions: sector-stability and fractional log-concavity.

Existing approaches usually crop the target face from\nthe input image with respect to a bounding box calculated during\npre-processing, and thus can only parse inner facial Regions of\nInterest~(RoIs). Peripheral regions like hair are ignored and nearby faces that\nare partially included in the bounding box can cause distractions. Moreover,\nthese methods are only trained and evaluated on near-frontal portrait images\nand thus their performance for in-the-wild cases has been unexplored. To\naddress these issues, this paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce\niBugMask dataset for face parsing in the wild, which consists of 21,866\ntraining images and 1,000 testing images. The training images are obtained by\naugmenting an existing dataset with large face poses. The testing images are\nmanually annotated with $11$ facial regions and there are large variations in\nsizes, poses, expressions and background. Second, we propose RoI Tanh-polar\ntransform that warps the whole image to a Tanh-polar representation with a\nfixed ratio between the face area and the context, guided by the target\nbounding box. The new representation contains all information in the original\nimage, and allows for rotation equivariance in the convolutional neural\nnetworks~(CNNs). Third, we propose a hybrid residual representation learning\nblock, coined HybridBlock, that contains convolutional layers in both the\nTanh-polar space and the Tanh-Cartesian space, allowing for receptive fields of\ndifferent shapes in CNNs.

As collecting data on\nSOC is costly and time consuming, not much data on SOC is available, although\nunderstanding the spatial variability in SOC is of fundamental importance for\neffective soil management.\n  In this manuscript, we propose a modeling framework that can be used to gain\na better understanding of the dependence structure of a spatial process by\nidentifying regions within a spatial domain where the process displays the same\nspatial correlation range. To achieve this goal, we propose a generalization of\nthe Multi-Resolution Approximation (M-RA) modeling framework of Katzfuss (2017)\noriginally introduced as a strategy to reduce the computational burden\nencountered when analyzing massive spatial datasets.\n  To allow for the possibility that the correlation of a spatial process might\nbe characterized by a different range in different subregions of a spatial\ndomain, we provide the M-RA basis functions weights with a two-component\nmixture prior with one of the mixture components a shrinking prior.

For $4d$ and $5d$ ions, the\nspin-orbit coupling, $\\zeta$, can be as large as 0.2-0.4 eV, which is\ncomparable with and often exceeds other relevant parameters such as Hund's\ncoupling $J_{\\rm H}$, noncubic crystal field splitting $\\Delta$, and the\nelectron hopping amplitude $t$. This gives rise to a variety of\nspin-orbit-entangled degrees of freedom and, crucially, non-trivial\ninteractions between them that depend on the $d$-electron configuration, the\nchemical bonding, and the lattice geometry. Exotic electronic phases often\nemerge, including spin-orbit assisted Mott insulators, quantum spin liquids,\nexcitonic magnetism, multipolar orderings and correlated topological\nsemimetals. This paper provides a selective overview of some of the most\ninteresting spin-orbit-entangled phases that arise in $4d$ and $5d$\ntransition-metal compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 17:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Both hypothesis\nare supported by theory, but experimental data are very sparse due to the\ndifficulty to monitor the very fast processes in space and time. In this paper,\nwe are using fast camera measurements and fast emission spectroscopy of\nnanosecond plasmas in water applying a positive and a negative polarity to a\nsharp tungsten electrode. It is shown that plasma ignition is dominated by\nfield effects at the electrode-liquid interface either as field ionization for\npositive polarity or as field emission for negative polarity. This leads to a\nhot tungsten surface at a temperature of 7000 K for positive polarity, whereas\nthe surface temperature is much lower for the negative polarity. At ignition,\nthe electron density reaches 4 $\\cdot$ 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$ for positive and only\n2 $\\cdot$ 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$ for the negative polarity. At the same time, the\nemission of the \\Ha~light for the positive polarity is 4 times higher than that\nfor the negative polarity. During plasma propagation, the electron densities\nare almost identical of the order of a 1 to 2 $\\cdot$ 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$ and\ndecay after the end of the pulse over 15 ns. It is concluded that plasma\npropagation is governed by field effects in a low density region that is\ncreated either by nanovoids or by density fluctuation in super critical water\nsurrounding the electrode that is created by the pressure at the moment of\nplasma ignition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 17:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Applying these\nmethods on real images, however, remains a challenge, as it necessarily\nrequires the inversion of the images into their latent space. To successfully\ninvert a real image, one needs to find a latent code that reconstructs the\ninput image accurately, and more importantly, allows for its meaningful\nmanipulation. In this paper, we carefully study the latent space of StyleGAN,\nthe state-of-the-art unconditional generator. We identify and analyze the\nexistence of a distortion-editability tradeoff and a distortion-perception\ntradeoff within the StyleGAN latent space. We then suggest two principles for\ndesigning encoders in a manner that allows one to control the proximity of the\ninversions to regions that StyleGAN was originally trained on. We present an\nencoder based on our two principles that is specifically designed for\nfacilitating editing on real images by balancing these tradeoffs.

Haloes in cosmological simulations grow by a combination of\nrelatively smooth accretion and more violent mergers, and both processes will\nmodify subhalo orbits. To isolate the impact of the smooth growth of the host\nhalo from other relevant mechanisms, we study subhalo orbital evolution using\nnumerical calculations in which subhaloes are modelled as massless particles\norbiting in a time-varying spherical potential. We find that the radial action\nof the subhalo orbit decreases over the first few orbits, indicating that the\nresponse to the growth of the host halo is not adiabatic during this phase. The\nsubhalo orbits can shrink by a factor of $\\sim$1.5 in this phase. Subsequently,\nthe radial action is well conserved and orbital contraction slows down. We\npropose a model accurately describing the orbital evolution. Given these\nresults, we consider the spatial distribution of the population of subhaloes\nidentified in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that it is\nconsistent with this population having been accreted at z < 3, indicating that\nany subhaloes accreted earlier are unresolved in the simulations.

A relatively compact H$_2$ wind was identified at the base of\nthe large-scale outflow of W33A, with a mean visual extinction of $\\sim$63 mag.\nBy taking advantage of supplementary near-infrared maps, we identified at least\ntwo other point-like objects driving extended structures in the vicinity of\nW33A, suggesting that multiple active protostars are located within the cloud.\nThe closest object (Source B) was also identified in the NIFS field of view as\na faint point-like object at a projected distance of $\\sim$7,000 AU from W33A,\npowering extended $K$-band continuum emission detected in the same field.\nAnother source (Source C) is driving a bipolar H$_2$ jet aligned perpendicular\nto the rotation axis of W33A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 18:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

We show that quadratic regularizers prevent\nforgetting of past tasks by interpolating current and previous values of model\nparameters at every training iteration. Over multiple training iterations, this\ninterpolation operation reduces the learning rates of more important model\nparameters, thereby minimizing their movement. Our analysis also reveals two\ndrawbacks of quadratic regularization: (a) dependence of parameter\ninterpolation on training hyperparameters, which often leads to training\ninstability and (b) assignment of lower importance to deeper layers, which are\ngenerally the place forgetting occurs in DNNs.

Our main proposal is a multi-stage architecture, that\nprogressively learns restoration functions for the degraded inputs, thereby\nbreaking down the overall recovery process into more manageable steps.\nSpecifically, our model first learns the contextualized features using\nencoder-decoder architectures and later combines them with a high-resolution\nbranch that retains local information.

A conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985) asserts, for $k \\gg \\log\n|G|$, that the random walk on this graph exhibits cutoff. Further, the cutoff\ntime should be a function only of $k$ and $|G|$, to sub-leading order. This was\nverified for all Abelian groups in the '90s. We extend the conjecture to $1 \\ll\nk \\lesssim \\log |G|$. We establish cutoff for all Abelian groups under the\ncondition $k - d(G) \\gg 1$, where $d(G)$ is the minimal size of a generating\nsubset of $G$, which is almost optimal. The cutoff time is described\n(abstractly) in terms of the entropy of random walk on $\\mathbb Z^k$. This\nabstract definition allows us to deduce that the cutoff time can be written as\na function only of $k$ and $|G|$ when $d(G) \\ll \\log |G|$ and $k - d(G) \\asymp\nk \\gg 1$; this is not the case when $d(G) \\asymp \\log |G| \\asymp k$. For\ncertain regimes of $k$, we find the limit profile of the convergence to\nequilibrium. Wilson (1997) conjectured that $\\mathbb Z_2^d$ gives rise to the\nslowest mixing time for $G_k$ amongst all groups of size at most $2^d$. We give\na partial answer, verifying the conjecture for nilpotent groups. This is\nobtained via a comparison result of independent interest between the mixing\ntimes of nilpotent $G$ and a corresponding Abelian group $\\overline G$, namely\nthe direct sum of the Abelian quotients in the lower central series of $G$. We\nuse this to refine a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (1994): we show for\nnilpotent $G$ that $G_k$ is an expander provided $k - d(\\overline G) \\gtrsim\n\\log |G|$. As another consequence, we establish cutoff for nilpotent groups\nwith relatively small commutators, including high-dimensional special groups,\nsuch as Heisenberg groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 18:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

It is not possible to declare whether\none method is better than the other using those forecasts because each team's\nsubmission may correspond to different techniques over the period and involve\nhuman interventions as the teams are continuously changing/tuning their\napproach. Such forecasts may be considered \"human-expert\" forecasts and do not\nqualify as AI/ML approaches, although they can be used as an indicator of human\nexpert performance. We are interested in supporting AI/ML research in epidemic\nforecasting which can lead to scalable forecasting without human intervention.\nWhich modeling technique, learning strategy, and data pre-processing technique\nwork well for epidemic forecasting is still an open problem. To help advance\nthe state-of-the-art AI/ML applied to epidemiology, a benchmark with a\ncollection of performance points is needed and the current \"state-of-the-art\"\ntechniques need to be identified.

The\nsource nodes utilize carrier sensing to reduce collisions and adopt an\nasynchronized sleep-wake scheduling strategy to achieve a target network\nlifetime (e.g., 10 years). We use age of information (AoI) to measure the\nfreshness of status updates, and design sleep-wake parameters for minimizing\nthe weighted-sum peak AoI of the sources, subject to per-source battery\nlifetime constraints. When the sensing time (i.e., the time duration of carrier\nsensing) is zero, this sleep-wake design problem can be solved by resorting to\na two-layer nested convex optimization procedure; however, for positive sensing\ntimes, the problem is non-convex. We devise a low-complexity solution to solve\nthis problem and prove that, for practical sensing times that are short, the\nsolution is within a small gap from the optimum AoI performance. When the mean\ntransmission time of status-update packets is unknown, we devise a\nreinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively performs the following two\ntasks in an ``efficient way'': a) it learns the unknown parameter, b) it also\ngenerates efficient controls that make channel access decisions.

Flooding will occur in the vertical packed columns as a\nresult of excessive liquid accumulation, which reduces mass transfer efficiency\nand causes a large pressure drop. Pressure drop measurements are typically used\nas the hydrodynamic parameter for predicting flooding. They are, however, only\nindicative of the occurrence of transition of the flow regime across the packed\ncolumn. They offer limited spatial information to mass transfer packed column\noperators and designers. In this work, a new method using Electrical\nCapacitance Tomography (ECT) is implemented for the first time so that\nreal-time flow regime monitoring at different vertical positions is achieved in\na countercurrent packed bed column using ECT. Two normalisation methods are\nimplemented to monitor the transition from pre-loading to flooding in a column\nof 200 mm diameter, 1200 mm height filled with plastic structured packing.\nLiquid distribution in the column can be qualitatively visualised via\nreconstructed ECT images. A flooding index is implemented to quantitatively\nindicate the progression of local flooding. In experiments, the degree of local\nflooding is quantified at various gas flow rates and locations of ECT sensor.\nECT images were compared with pressure drop and visual observation.

The\nlearner often comes to rely on features that are strongly predictive of\ndecisions, but are subject to strong covariate shift.\n  Our work demonstrates a broad class of problems where this shift can be\nmitigated, both theoretically and practically, by taking advantage of a\nsimulator but without any further querying of expert demonstration. We analyze\nexisting benchmarks used to test imitation learning approaches and find that\nthese benchmarks are realizable and simple and thus insufficient for capturing\nthe harder regimes of error compounding seen in real-world decision making\nproblems. We find, in a surprising contrast with previous literature, but\nconsistent with our theory, that naive behavioral cloning provides excellent\nresults. We detail the need for new standardized benchmarks that capture the\nphenomena seen in robotics problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 20:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 14:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

The classical approaches to solving this problem use assembly graphs,\nsuch as de Bruijn graphs or overlap graphs, which maintain partial information\nabout such overlaps. For genome assembly algorithms, these graphs present a\ntrade-off between overlap information stored and scalability. Thus,\nHierarchical Overlap Graph (HOG) was proposed to overcome the limitations of\nboth these approaches.\n  For a given set $P$ of $n$ strings, the first algorithm to compute HOG was\ngiven by Cazaux and Rivals [IPL20] requiring $O(||P||+n^2)$ time using\nsuperlinear space, where $||P||$ is the cumulative sum of the lengths of\nstrings in $P$.

Nevertheless,\nfrom recent ALMA/SPHERE data, encouraging evidence of the direct and indirect\npresence of embedded planets has been identified in disks around young stars:\nco-moving point sources, gravitational perturbations, rings, cavities, and\nemission dips or shadows cast on disks. The interpretation of these\nobservations needs a robust physical framework to deduce the complex disk\ngeometry. In particular, protoplanetary disk models usually assume the gas\npressure scale-height given by the ratio of the sound speed over the azimuthal\nvelocity $H/r = c_{s\\rm }/v_{\\rm k}$. By doing so, \\textit{radiative} pressure\nfields are often ignored, which could lead to a misinterpretation of the real\nvertical structure of such disks. We follow the evolution of a gaseous disk\nwith an embedded Jupiter mass planet through hydrodynamical simulations,\ncomputing the disk scale-height including radiative pressure, which was derived\nfrom a generalization of the stellar atmosphere theory.

The\nradiation-pressure effects create a vertical optically thick column of gas and\ndust at the proto-planet location, casting a shadow in scattered light.

We introduce two key approaches that allow us to incorporate\nkinematic wave theory principles to improve the robustness of existing\nlearning-based estimation methods. First, we propose an anisotropic traffic\nkernel for the Deep CNN. The anisotropic kernel explicitly accounts for\nspace-time correlations in macroscopic traffic and effectively reduces the\nnumber of trainable parameters in the Deep CNN model. Second, we propose to use\nsimulated data for training the Deep CNN. Using a targeted simulated data for\ntraining provides an implicit way to impose desirable traffic physical features\non the learning model. In the experiments, we highlight the benefits of using\nanisotropic kernels and evaluate the transferability of the trained model to\nreal-world traffic using the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) and the German\nHighway Drone (HighD) datasets. The results demonstrate that anisotropic\nkernels significantly reduce model complexity and model over-fitting, and\nimprove the physical correctness of the estimated speed fields. We find that\nmodel complexity scales linearly with problem size for anisotropic kernels\ncompared to quadratic scaling for isotropic kernels. Furthermore, evaluation on\nreal-world datasets shows acceptable performance, which establishes that\nsimulation-based training is a viable surrogate to learning from real-world\ndata.

In the present work, we introduce a new benchmark\nfor meta-RL research, emphasizing transparency and potential for in-depth\nanalysis as well as structural richness. Alchemy is a 3D video game,\nimplemented in Unity, which involves a latent causal structure that is\nresampled procedurally from episode to episode, affording structure learning,\nonline inference, hypothesis testing and action sequencing based on abstract\ndomain knowledge. We evaluate a pair of powerful RL agents on Alchemy and\npresent an in-depth analysis of one of these agents.

An imperfect\nknowledge of material behavior across scales is a source of epistemic\nuncertainty of the overall material behavior. However, assessing this\nuncertainty is difficult due to the complex nature of material response and the\nprohibitive computational cost of integral calculations. In this paper, we\nexploit the multiscale and hierarchical nature of material response to develop\nan approach to quantify the overall uncertainty of material response without\nthe need for integral calculations. Specifically, we bound the uncertainty at\neach scale and then combine the partial uncertainties in a way that provides a\nbound on the overall or integral uncertainty. The bound provides a conservative\nestimate on the uncertainty. Importantly, this approach does not require\nintegral calculations that are prohibitively expensive.

Moreover, collisional magnetization can be determined as the\nratio of the light ion gyrofrequency to the collision frequency of light and\nheavy ion species, and the behavior of this effect in the intermediate regime\nof partially magnetized plasma is predominantly dependent on this Hall\nparameter. Multi-ion cross-field transport has been described before in the\ncollisionally magnetized plasma regime, and generalized pinch relations, which\ndescribe densities of ion species in equilibrium in that plasma, are found in\nthe literature. In this paper, the role of collisional magnetization and Larmor\nmagnetization in multi-ion collisional transport is clarified and generalized\npinch relations are extended to the partially magnetized regime, in which the\nion Hall parameter may be small, as long as electrons remain collisionally\nmagnetized. Equilibrium ion density profiles have the same dependence on\nexternal forces and on each other regardless of collisional magnetization of\nions. The expansion of the range of validity of multi-ion collisional transport\nmodels makes them applicable to a wider range of laboratory plasma conditions.\nIn particular, ion density profiles evolve sufficiently fast for radial\nimpurity transport to be observable around stagnation on MagLIF, leading to\nexpulsion of heavy ion impurities from the hotspot as long as plasma becomes\nsufficiently collisionally magnetized during the implosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 00:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

While the\nnumber of CE studies has rapidly increased since 2010, the critical issue of HB\nhas been studied in only a small fraction of CE studies. The present review\nincludes both ex-ante and ex-post bias mitigation methods. Ex-ante bias\nmitigation methods include cheap talk, real talk, consequentiality scripts,\nsolemn oath scripts, opt-out reminders, budget reminders, honesty priming,\ninduced truth telling, indirect questioning, time to think and pivot designs.\nEx-post methods include follow-up certainty calibration scales, respondent\nperceived consequentiality scales, and revealed-preference-assisted estimation.\nIt is observed that the use of mitigation methods markedly varies across\ndifferent sectors of applied economics. The existing empirical evidence points\nto their overall effectives in reducing HB, although there is some variation.\nThe paper further discusses how each mitigation method can counter a certain\nsubset of HB sources. Considering the prevalence of HB in CEs and the\neffectiveness of bias mitigation methods, it is recommended that implementation\nof at least one bias mitigation method (or a suitable combination where\npossible) becomes standard practice in conducting CEs. Mitigation method(s)\nsuited to the particular application should be implemented to ensure that\ninferences and subsequent policy decisions are as much as possible free of HB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 00:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The patch attacker can carry\nout a physical-world attack by printing and attaching an adversarial patch to\nthe victim object. In this paper, we propose DetectorGuard as the first general\nframework for building provably robust object detectors against localized patch\nhiding attacks. DetectorGuard is inspired by recent advancements in robust\nimage classification research; we ask: can we adapt robust image classifiers\nfor robust object detection? Unfortunately, due to their task difference, an\nobject detector naively adapted from a robust image classifier 1) may not\nnecessarily be robust in the adversarial setting or 2) even maintain decent\nperformance in the clean setting. To build a high-performance robust object\ndetector, we propose an objectness explaining strategy: we adapt a robust image\nclassifier to predict objectness for every image location and then explain each\nobjectness using the bounding boxes predicted by a conventional object\ndetector. If all objectness is well explained, we output the predictions made\nby the conventional object detector; otherwise, we issue an attack alert.\nNotably, 1) in the adversarial setting, we formally prove the end-to-end\nrobustness of DetectorGuard on certified objects, i.e., it either detects the\nobject or triggers an alert, against any patch hiding attacker within our\nthreat model; 2) in the clean setting, we have almost the same performance as\nstate-of-the-art object detectors.

Several acoustic features have been proposed for environmental sounds.\nAmong them is the widely-used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs),\nwhich describes frequency-domain features.

Typical CO deep\nlearning approaches leverage the problem structure in the model architecture.\nNevertheless, the model selection is still mainly based on the conventional\nmachine learning setting. Due to the discrete nature of CO problems, a single\nmodel is unlikely to learn the problem entirely. We introduce ZTop, which\nstands for Zero Training Overhead Portfolio, a simple yet effective model\nselection and ensemble mechanism for learning to solve combinatorial problems.\nZTop is inspired by algorithm portfolios, a popular CO ensembling strategy,\nparticularly restart portfolios, which periodically restart a randomized CO\nalgorithm, de facto exploring the search space with different heuristics. We\nhave observed that well-trained models acquired in the same training\ntrajectory, with similar top validation performance, perform well on very\ndifferent validation instances. Following this observation, ZTop ensembles a\nset of well-trained models, each providing a unique heuristic with zero\ntraining overhead, and applies them, sequentially or in parallel, to solve the\ntest instances. We show how ZTopping, i.e., using a ZTop ensemble strategy with\na given deep learning approach, can significantly improve the performance of\nthe current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches on three prototypical CO\ndomains, the hardest unique-solution Sudoku instances, challenging routing\nproblems, and the graph maximum cut problem, as well as on multi-label\nclassification, a machine learning task with a large combinatorial label space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 05:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

In this paper, we study a natural\nnon-local Markov chain known as the Chayes-Machta dynamics for the mean-field\ncase of the random-cluster model, where the underlying graph is the complete\ngraph on $n$ vertices. The random-cluster model is parametrized by an edge\nprobability $p$ and a cluster weight $q$.

We show that the mixing\ntime of the Chayes-Machta dynamics is $O(\\log n \\cdot \\log \\log n)$ in this\nparameter regime, which reveals that the dynamics does not undergo an\nexponential slowdown at criticality, a surprising fact that had been predicted\n(but not proved) by statistical physicists.

To\nthe best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first serverless system that\ntakes full advantage of the client-fog-cloud synergy to better serve the\nDNN-based video analytics. Specifically, the system aims to achieve two goals:\n1) Provide the optimal analytics results under the constraints of lower\nbandwidth usage and shorter round-trip time (RTT) by judiciously managing the\ncomputational and bandwidth resources deployed in the client, fog, and cloud\nenvironment. 2) Free developers from tedious administration and operation\ntasks, including DNN deployment, cloud and fog's resource management. To this\nend, we implement a holistic cloud-fog system referred to as VPaaS\n(Video-Platform-as-a-Service). VPaaS adopts serverless computing to enable\ndevelopers to build a video analytics pipeline by simply programming a set of\nfunctions (e.g., model inference), which are then orchestrated to process\nvideos through carefully designed modules. To save bandwidth and reduce RTT,\nVPaaS provides a new video streaming protocol that only sends low-quality video\nto the cloud. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs deployed at the cloud can\nidentify regions of video frames that need further processing at the fog ends.\nAt the fog ends, misidentified labels in these regions can be corrected using a\nlight-weight DNN model. To address the data drift issues, we incorporate\nlimited human feedback into the system to verify the results and adopt\nincremental learning to improve our system continuously. The evaluation\ndemonstrates that VPaaS is superior to several SOTA systems: it maintains high\naccuracy while reducing bandwidth usage by up to 21%, RTT by up to 62.5%, and\ncloud monetary cost by up to 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 05:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

It is considered that IVCT is related to\nthe hopping probability of electron (or the electron mobility) in solids. Since\ncontrolling the conductivity of ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) is a key\nsubject for the development of spintronic device applications, the manipulation\nof the conductivity through IVCT may become a new approach of band engineering\nin FMSs. In Ru-doped cobalt ferrite CoFe$_2$O$_4$ (CFO) that shows\nferrimagnetism and semiconducting transport properties, the reduction of the\nelectric resistivity is attributed to both the carrier doping caused by the Ru\nsubstitution for Co and the increase of the carrier mobility due to\nhybridization between the wide Ru $4d$ and the Fe $3d$ orbitals. The latter is\nthe so-called IVCT mechanism that is charge transfer between the mixed valence\nFe$^{2+}$/Fe$^{3+}$ states facilitated by bridging Ru $4d$ orbital: Fe$^{2+}$ +\nRu$^{4+}$ $\\leftrightarrow$ Fe$^{3+}$ + Ru$^{3+}$. To elucidate the emergence\nof the IVCT state, we have conducted x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and\nresonant photoemission spectroscopy (RPES) measurements on non-doped CFO and\nCo$_{0.5}$Ru$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (CRFO) thin films.

One challenge faced by the deployment of MEC in cellular networks\nis to support user mobility. As a result, offloaded tasks can be seamlessly\nmigrated between base stations (BSs) without compromising the\nresource-utilization efficiency and link reliability. In this paper, we tackle\nthe challenge by optimizing the policy for migration/handover between BSs by\njointly managing computation-and-radio resources. The objectives are twofold:\nmaximizing the sum offloading rate, quantifying MEC throughput, and minimizing\nthe migration cost. The policy design is formulated as a decision-optimization\nproblem that accounts for virtualization, I/O interference between virtual\nmachines (VMs), and wireless multi-access. To solve the complex combinatorial\nproblem, we develop an efficient relaxation-and-rounding based solution\napproach. The approach relies on an optimal iterative algorithm for solving the\ninteger-relaxed problem and a novel integer-recovery design. The latter\noutperforms the traditional rounding method by exploiting the derived problem\nproperties and applying matching theory. In addition, we also consider the\ndesign for a special case of \"hotspot mitigation\", referring to alleviating an\noverloaded server/BS by migrating its load to the nearby idle servers/BSs. From\nsimulation results, we observed close-to-optimal performance of the proposed\nmigration policies under various settings. This demonstrates their efficiency\nin computation-and-radio resource management for joint service migration and BS\nhandover in multi-cell MEC networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 07:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

In this work, we find that\nthe nuclear Zeeman effect can also have a significant impact on the heading\nerrors, especially for continuously-driving magnetometers with unresolved\nmagnetic transitions. It not only shifts the precession frequency but deforms\nthe heading errors and causes asymmetry: the heading errors for pump lasers\nwith opposite helicities are different. The heading error also depends on the\nrelative direction (parallel or vertical) of the probe laser to the RF driving\nmagnetic field. Thus, one can design the configuration of the magnetometer and\nmake it work in the smaller-heading-error regime. To suppress the heading\nerror, our studies suggest to sum up the output precession frequencies from\natomic cells pumped by two lasers with opposite helicities and probed by lasers\npropagating in orthogonal directions (one parallel and another perpendicular to\nthe RF field), instead of utilizing probe lasers propagating in the same\ndirections. Due to the nuclear Zeeman effect, the average precession\nfrequencies in the latter case can have a non-negligible angular dependence,\nwhile in the former case the nuclear-Zeeman-effect induced heading error can be\nlargely compensated and the residue is within 1Hz. Furthermore, for practical\nuse, we propose to simply utilize a small magnetic field parallel/antiparallel\nto the pump laser. By tuning the magnitude of this auxiliary field, the heading\nerror can be flattened around different angles, which can improve the accuracy\nwhen the magnetometer works around a certain orientation angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 07:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 13:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

This novel algorithm builds\nFM-index with no memory overhead, and the hardware system for realizing the\nalgorithm can be very compact. Parallel architecture and a special prefetch\ncontroller is designed to enhance computational efficiency. An SAII-based\nFM-index constructor is implemented on an Altera Stratix V FPGA board. The\npresented constructor can support DNA sequences of sizes up to 131,072-bp,\nwhich is enough for small-scale references and reads obtained from current\nmajor platforms.

To\naddress the conflict between learning SLO and energy efficiency, we propose\nDEAL, an energy efficient learning system that saves energy and preserves\nprivacy with a decremental learning design.

Effective human-agent collaboration requires\nusers to understand the agent's behavior, as failing to do so may cause reduced\nproductivity, misuse or frustration. Agent strategy summarization methods are\nused to describe the strategy of an agent to its destined user through\ndemonstration. A summary's objective is to maximize the user's understanding of\nthe agent's aptitude by showcasing its behaviour in a selected set of world\nstates. While shown to be useful, we show that current methods are limited when\ntasked with comparing between agents, as each summary is independently\ngenerated for a specific agent. In this paper, we propose a novel method for\ngenerating dependent and contrastive summaries that emphasize the differences\nbetween agent policies by identifying states in which the agents disagree on\nthe best course of action. We conduct user studies to assess the usefulness of\ndisagreement-based summaries for identifying superior agents and conveying\nagent differences.

We followed the mass\nand shape evolution of the galaxies as well as their interactions with other\nobjects and divided them into three classes based on the origin of the bar and\nthe subsequent history.

Class B galaxies were then partially stripped of mass,\nwhile those of class C evolved without strong interactions, thus retaining\ntheir dark matter and gas in the outskirts.

The large bootstrap\ncurrents associated with high beta plasmas may make QA configurations\nsusceptible to low n external modes, limiting their operational space. The\nviolence of the nonlinear dynamics, and, in particular, when these modes lead\nto a disruption, is not yet understood. In this paper, the nonlinear phase of\nexternal kinks in an unstable QA configuration with an edge safety factor below\ntwo is simulated. An axisymmetric approximation of this stellarator is\nconstructed in the nonlinear MHD code, JOREK, capturing the influence of the\nexternal rotational transform. The use of this approximation for the considered\nstellarator is validated by comparing the linear dynamics against the linear\nviscoresistive MHD code, CASTOR3D. The nonlinear dynamics of this stellarator\napproximation are compared with an equivalent tokamak to understand the\ninfluence of a relatively small external rotational transform. While the\nexternal rotational transform does have a stabilising influence on the MHD\nactivity, it remains violent. To explore the first order influence of a larger\nexternal rotational transform, this equilibrium parameter is artificially\nincreased for the considered stellarator, reducing the effective plasma\ncurrent. The violence of the kink instability is quantified, and shown to\nreduce with the increasing external rotational transform. At the same time, the\nexternal kink triggers internal modes that exacerbate the loss in confinement\nduring the nonlinear phase, such that it remains large over much of the\nparameter space.

From the mathematical viewpoint, a particularly difficult case\nappears when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are significantly\ndifferent (high-contrast case). The traditional derivation of the\nuni-directional models leads to four uncoupled Ostrovsky equations, for the\nright- and left-propagating waves in each layer. However, the models impose a\n``zero-mass constraint'' i.e. the initial conditions should necessarily have\nzero mean, restricting the applicability of that description. Here, we bypass\nthe contradiction in this high-contrast case by constructing the solution for\nthe deviation from the evolving mean value, using asymptotic multiple-scale\nexpansions involving two pairs of fast characteristic variables and two\nslow-time variables. By construction, the Ostrovsky equations emerging within\nthe scope of this derivation are solved for initial conditions with zero mean\nwhile initial conditions for the original system may have non-zero mean values.\nAsymptotic validity of the solution is carefully examined numerically. We apply\nthe models to the description of counter-propagating waves generated by\nsolitary wave initial conditions, or co-propagating waves generated by cnoidal\nwave initial conditions, as well as the resulting wave interactions, and\ncontrast with the behaviour of the waves in bi-layers when the linear long-wave\nspeeds in the layers are close (low-contrast case).

From\nthe radio resource allocation perspective, the solution to this problem is to\nmaximize the energy efficiency instead of the throughput. This results in the\noptimal benefit-cost ratio between data rate and energy consumption. It also\noften leads to a considerable reduction in throughput and, hence, an\nunderutilization of the available spectrum. Contemporary approaches to balance\nthese metrics based on multi-objective programming theory often lack\noperational meaning and finding the correct operating point requires careful\nexperimentation and calibration. Instead, we propose the novel concept of\nhierarchical resource allocation where conflicting objectives are ordered by\ntheir importance. This results in a resource allocation algorithm that strives\nto minimize the transmit power while keeping the data rate close the maximum\nachievable throughput. In a typical multi-cell scenario, this strategy is shown\nto reduces the transmit power consumption by 65% at the cost of a 5% decrease\nin throughput. Moreover, this strategy also saves energy in scenarios where\nglobal energy efficiency maximization fails to achieve any gain over throughput\nmaximization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 11:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

DeepReduce decomposes sparse tensors in two sets, values and\nindices, and allows both independent and combined compression of these sets.

We also propose two novel compression schemes\nthat achieve superior results: curve fitting-based for values and bloom\nfilter-based for indices.

This paper\npresents a semantic-aware WCET analysis method for data-driven monitoring\nprograms derived from graph queries. The method incorporates results obtained\nfrom low-level timing analysis into the objective function of a modern graph\nsolver. This allows the systematic generation of input graph models up to a\nspecified size (referred to as witness models) for which the monitor is\nexpected to take the most time to complete. Hence the estimated execution time\nof the monitors on these graphs can be considered as safe and tight WCET.\nAdditionally, we perform a set of experiments with query-based programs running\non a real-time platform over a set of generated models to investigate the\nrelationship between execution times and their estimates, and compare WCET\nestimates produced by our approach with results from two well-known timing\nanalyzers, aiT and OTAWA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 11:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 15:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Since we\nonly have very limited training samples, one of the key challenges lies in how\nto address (dis)occlusions, e.g. when a hand moves behind or in front of a\nbody. To address this, we introduce a novel layering approach which explicitly\nsplits the input keypoints into different layers which are processed\nindependently.

Unfortunately, this comes at\nthe cost of degraded accuracy in posterior approximation, often underperforming\nthe instance-wise variational optimization. Although the latest semi-amortized\napproaches mitigate the issue by performing a few variational optimization\nupdates starting from the VAE's amortized inference output, they inherently\nsuffer from computational overhead for inference at test time. In this paper,\nwe address the problem in a completely different way by considering a random\ninference model, where we model the mean and variance functions of the\nvariational posterior as random Gaussian processes (GP). The motivation is that\nthe deviation of the VAE's amortized posterior distribution from the true\nposterior can be regarded as random noise, which allows us to take into account\nthe uncertainty in posterior approximation in a principled manner. In\nparticular, our model can quantify the difficulty in posterior approximation by\na Gaussian variational density. Inference in our GP model is done by a single\nfeed forward pass through the network, significantly faster than semi-amortized\nmethods. We show that our approach attains higher test data likelihood than the\nstate-of-the-arts on several benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 13:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

The most effective methods\nto defend against such attacks trains on generated adversarial examples to\nlearn their distribution. Previous work aimed to align original and adversarial\nimage representations in the same way as domain adaptation to improve\nrobustness. Yet, they partially align the representations using approaches that\ndo not reflect the geometry of space and distribution. In addition, it is\ndifficult to accurately compare robustness between defended models. Until now,\nthey have been evaluated using a fixed perturbation size.

In this paper,\nwe thoroughly analyze the development of this type of instability. This\nanalysis takes into account that a highly relativistic beam loses energy only\ndue to interactions with the plasma waves propagating within the opening angle\nof the beam (we call them parallel waves), whereas excitation of oblique waves\nresults merely in an angular spreading of the beam, which reduces the\ninstability growth rate. For parallel waves, the growth rate is a few times\nlarger than for oblique ones, so they grow faster than oblique waves and drain\nenergy from the beam before it expands. However, the specific property of\nextragalactic beams is that they are extraordinarily narrow; the opening angle\nis only $\\Delta\\theta\\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$. In this case, the width of the\nresonance for parallel waves, $\\propto\\Delta\\theta^2$, is too small for them to\ngrow in realistic conditions. We perform both analytical estimates and\nnumerical simulations in the quasilinear regime. These show that for\nextragalactic beams, the growth of the waves is incapable of taking a\nsignificant portion of the beam's energy.

We examine the detectability of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$O, and O$_3$\nin high-resolution planetary thermal emission spectra at 12-18 $\\mu $m assuming\nan Earth-like profile and a simplified thermal structure. The molecular line\nwidth of such planets can be comparable to or broader than the Doppler shift\ndue to the planetary orbital motion. Given the likely difficulty in knowing the\nhigh-resolution MIR spectrum of the host star with sufficient accuracy, we\npropose to observe the target system at two quadrature phases and extract the\ndifferential spectra as the planetary signal. In this case, the signals can be\nsubstantially suppressed compared with the case where the host star spectrum is\nperfectly known, as some parts of the spectral features do not remain in the\ndifferential spectra. Despite this self-subtraction, the CO$_2$ and H$_2$O\nfeatures of nearby ($\\lesssim $ 5~pc) systems with mid-/late-M host stars would\nbe practical with a 6.5-meter-class cryogenic telescope, and orbital\ninclination could also be constrained for some of them. For CO$_2$ and N$_2$O\nin a 1~bar Earth-like atmosphere, this method would be sensitive when the\nmixing ratio is 1-10$^3$ ppm. The detectability of molecules except O$_3$ is\nnot significantly improved when the spectral resolution is higher than\n$\\mathcal{R}\\gtrsim 10,000$, although the constraint on the orbital inclination\nis improved. This study provides some benchmark cases useful for assessing the\nvalue of MIR high-resolution spectroscopy in terms of characterization of\npotentially habitable planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Our approach also provides an expression for the Soret\ncoefficient, which decides whether particles accumulate on the cold or on the\nwarm side, that is associated with the correlation between the energies of the\ninternal states and their transport properties, that instead remain\nsystem-specific quantities.

Here, we propose a deep learning approach based on graphs to detect\nplantation lines in UAV-based RGB imagery presenting a challenging scenario\ncontaining spaced plants. The first module of our method extracts a feature map\nthroughout the backbone, which consists of the initial layers of the VGG16.\nThis feature map is used as an input to the Knowledge Estimation Module (KEM),\norganized in three concatenated branches for detecting 1) the plant positions,\n2) the plantation lines, and 3) for the displacement vectors between the\nplants. A graph modeling is applied considering each plant position on the\nimage as vertices, and edges are formed between two vertices (i.e. plants).\nFinally, the edge is classified as pertaining to a certain plantation line\nbased on three probabilities (higher than 0.5): i) in visual features obtained\nfrom the backbone; ii) a chance that the edge pixels belong to a line, from the\nKEM step; and iii) an alignment of the displacement vectors with the edge, also\nfrom KEM. Experiments were conducted in corn plantations with different growth\nstages and patterns with aerial RGB imagery. A total of 564 patches with 256 x\n256 pixels were used and randomly divided into training, validation, and\ntesting sets in a proportion of 60\\%, 20\\%, and 20\\%, respectively.

To match their compositional data, the building\nblocks of both moons would have had to form in a region of the circumplanetary\ndisk situated between the icelines of carbon monoxide and dinitrogen at their\nouter limit, and the iceline of methane clathrate as their inner limit. We find\nthat a source of dust at the location of centrifugal radius does not guarantee\nthe replenishment of the disk in the volatiles assumed to be primordial in\nTitan and Enceladus. Only simulations assuming a centrifugal radius in the\n66--100 Saturnian radii range allow for the formation and growth of solids with\ncompositions consistent with those measured in Enceladus and Titan. The species\nare then able to evolve in solid forms in the system for longer periods of\ntime, even reaching an equilibrium, thus favoring the formation of Titan and\nEnceladus building blocks in this region of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 15:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

On the domain of image classification, convolutional neural\nnetworks proved the ability to learn robust features for the closed set\nproblem, as shown in many different datasets, such as MNIST FASHIONMNIST,\nCIFAR10, CIFAR100, and IMAGENET. These approaches use deep neural networks with\ndense layers with softmax activation functions in order to learn features that\ncan separate classes in a latent space. However, this traditional approach is\nnot useful for identifying classes unseen on the training set, known as the\nopen set problem. A similar problem occurs in scenarios involving learning on\nsmall data. To tackle both problems, few-shot learning has been proposed. In\nparticular, metric learning learns features that obey constraints of a metric\ndistance in the latent space in order to perform classification. However, while\nthis approach proves to be useful for the open set problem, current\nimplementation requires pair-wise training, where both positive and negative\nexamples of similar images are presented during the training phase, which\nlimits the applicability of these approaches in large data or large class\nscenarios given the combinatorial nature of the possible inputs.In this paper,\nwe present a constraint-based approach applied to the representations in the\nlatent space under the normalized softmax loss, proposed by[18].

A central scheduler selects at each time slot which sources should\nsend their updates in such a way to minimize the Mean Age of Incorrect\nInformation (MAoII). The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the\nscheduler cannot know the states of the sources before receiving the updates\nand it has then to optimally balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off.

To portray a gait, existing gait recognition methods\nutilize either a gait template which makes it difficult to preserve temporal\ninformation, or a gait sequence that maintains unnecessary sequential\nconstraints and thus loses the flexibility of gait recognition. In this paper,\nwe present a novel perspective that utilizes gait as a deep set, which means\nthat a set of gait frames are integrated by a global-local fused deep network\ninspired by the way our left- and right-hemisphere processes information to\nlearn information that can be used in identification. Based on this deep set\nperspective, our method is immune to frame permutations, and can naturally\nintegrate frames from different videos that have been acquired under different\nscenarios, such as diverse viewing angles, different clothes, or different\nitem-carrying conditions. Experiments show that under normal walking\nconditions, our single-model method achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of\n96.1% on the CASIA-B gait dataset and an accuracy of 87.9% on the OU-MVLP gait\ndataset. Under various complex scenarios, our model also exhibits a high level\nof robustness.

A quantum computer capable of simulating\nthe electronic structures of complex molecules would be a game changer for the\ndesign of new drugs and materials. Given the potential implications of this\ntechnology, there is a need within the chemistry community to keep abreast with\nthe latest developments as well as becoming involved in experimentation with\nquantum prototypes. To facilitate this, here we review the types of quantum\ncomputing hardware that have been made available to the public through cloud\nservices. We focus on three architectures, namely superconductors, trapped ions\nand semiconductors. For each one we summarise the basic physical operations,\nrequirements and performance.

This study assesses the contributions of forenames in\nauthor name disambiguation using multiple labeled datasets under varying ratios\nand lengths of full forenames, reflecting real-world scenarios in which an\nauthor is represented by forename variants (synonym) and some authors share the\nsame forenames (homonym).

Performance gains by algorithmic\ndisambiguation are pronounced when many forenames are initialized or homonym is\nprevalent.

Using a small portion\nof forename strings does not reduce much the performances of both heuristic and\nalgorithmic disambiguation compared to using full-length strings.

When the thermal effect is acting via the second or\nthird component of the laminated Timoshenko beam (rotation angle displacement\nor dynamic of the slip), we obtain that both systems, Timoshenko-Fourier and\nTimoshenko-Cattaneo systems, satisfy the same polynomial stability estimates in\nthe L2 -norm of the solution and its higher order derivatives with respect of\nthe space variable. The decay rate depends on the regularity of the initial\ndata. In addition, the presence and absence of the regularity-loss type\nproperty are determined by some relations between the parameters of systems.\nHowever, when the thermal effect is acting via the first comoponent of the\nsystem (transversal displacement), a new stability condition is introduced for\nboth TimoshenkoFourier and Timoshenko-Cattaneo systems. This stability\ncondition is in the form of threshold between polynomial stability and\nconvergence to zero. To prove our results, we use the energy method in Fourier\nspace combined with judicious choices of weight functions to build appropriate\nLyapunov functionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 14:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

The system configuration considered is a segmented structure\nhaving non-linear stiffness characteristics. It is proposed here that such a\nfrequency-shifting mechanism could complement metamaterial concepts for\nmass-efficient sound barriers. The acoustical behavior of the material system\nwas studied through a representative two-dimensional model consisting of a\nsegmented plate with a contact interface. Multiple harmonic peaks were observed\nin response to a purely single frequency excitation, and the strength of the\nresponse was found to depend on the degree of non-linearity introduced. The\nlower and closer an excitation frequency was to the characteristic resonance\nfrequencies of the base system, the stronger was the predicted higher harmonic\nresponse. The broadband sound transmission loss of these systems has also been\ncalculated and the low frequency sound transmission loss was found to increase\nas the level of the broadband incident sound field increased. The present\nfindings support the feasibility of designing material systems that transfer\nenergy from lower frequency bands, where a sound barrier is less efficient, to\nhigher bands where energy is more readily dissipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 14:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}
