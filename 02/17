We present an explicit version of this property which is directly\namenable to typical applications, prove it in a self-contained manner that\nclarifies the role of some parameters, and give two applications.\n  A $(K, \\epsilon)$ lossless expander is a bipartite graph such that any subset\n$S$ of size at most $K$ of nodes on the left side of the bipartition has at\nleast $(1-\\epsilon) D |S|$ neighbors, where $D$ is the left degree.The main\nresult is that any such graph, after a slight modification, admits\n$(1-O(\\epsilon)D, 1)$ online matching up to size $K$. This means that for any\nsequence $S=(x_1, \\ldots, x_K)$ of nodes on the left side of the bipartition,\none can assign in an online manner to each node $x_i$ in $S$ a set $A_i$\nconsisting of $(1-O(\\epsilon))$ fraction of its neighbors so that the sets\n$A_1, \\ldots, A_K$ are pairwise disjoint. \"Online manner\" refers to the fact\nthat, for every $i$, the set of nodes assigned to $x_i$ only depends on the\nnodes assigned to $x_1, \\ldots, x_{i-1}$.\n  The first application concerns storage schemes for representing a set $S$, so\nthat a membership query \"Is $x \\in S$?\" can be answered probabilistically by\nreading a single bit. All the previous one-probe storage schemes were for a\nstatic set $S$. We show that a lossless expander can be used to construct a\none-probe storage scheme for dynamic sets, i.e., sets in which elements can be\ninserted and deleted without affecting the representation of other elements.\nThe second application is about non-blocking networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 16:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

The conventional\nprobabilistic localization approaches rely on the three-dimensional (3D)\nGaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based representation of a 3D map. A GMM model with\nhundreds of mixture functions is typically needed to adequately learn and\nrepresent the intricacies of the map. Meanwhile, localization using complex GMM\nmap models is computationally intensive. Since insect-scale drones operate\nunder extremely limited area/power budget, continuous localization using GMM\nmodels entails much higher operating energy -- thereby, limiting flying\nduration and/or size of the drone due to a larger battery. Addressing the\ncomputational challenges of localization in an insect-scale drone using a CIM\napproach, we propose a novel framework of 3D map representation using a\nharmonic mean of \"Gaussian-like\" mixture (HMGM) model. The likelihood function\nuseful for drone localization can be efficiently implemented by connecting many\nmulti-input inverters in parallel, each programmed with the parameters of the\n3D map model represented as HMGM. When the depth measurements are projected to\nthe input of the implementation, the summed current of the inverters emulates\nthe likelihood of the measurement. We have characterized our approach on an\nRGB-D indoor localization dataset. The average localization error in our\napproach is $\\sim$0.1125 m which is only slightly degraded than software-based\nevaluation ($\\sim$0.08 m).

The flame initiation\nprocess subject to central heating can be approximately decomposed into four\nstages, i.e., the fast establishment of the ignition kernel, the\nignition-energy-supported flame kernel propagation, unsteady transition of the\nflame kernel, and quasi-steady spherical flame propagation. Comparison between\npresent transient theory and previous quasi-steady theory indicates that the\nunsteady effects directly lead to the appearance of flame kernel establishing\nstage and considerably affect the subsequent flame kernel development by\nlowering the flame propagation speed. Time scale analysis is conducted, and it\nis found that the transient formulation completely degenerates to the\nquasi-steady theory either in the neighborhood of stationary flame ball or as\napproaching the planar flame. Previous quasi-steady theory shows that the\ncritical heating power for successful ignition is proportional to the cube of\nthe critical flame radius. However, the critical heating power predicted by the\npresent transient formulation deviates this scaling law, which can be\nattributed to the unsteady thermal conduction from heating center to the flame\nfront. Furthermore, in the transient formulation the central heating with\nfinite duration is considered and the minimum ignition energy is obtained. For\nthe first time, the memory effect that persistently drives flame propagation\nsubsequent to central heating switching-off is examined. It is found that as\nthe heating power grows, the memory effect becomes increasingly important and\nit can greatly reduce the minimum ignition energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 16:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

We present a\nreproducible, interactive, and iterative framework for record linkage called\nVIEW (Visual Interactive Entity-resolution Workbench). We implemented and\nevaluated VIEW by integrating two commonly used hospital databases, the\nAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals and the Medicare\nCost Reports for Hospitals from CMS. Results: Using VIEW to iteratively\nstandardize and clean the data, we linked all Texas hospitals common in both\ndatabases with 100% precision by confirming 78 approximate linkages using HITs\nand manually linking 28 hospitals using HITs. Discussion: Similarities in\nhospital names and addresses and the dynamic nature of hospital attributes over\ntime make it impossible to build a fully automated linkage system for hospitals\nthat can be maintained over time. VIEW is a software that supports a\nreproducible semi-automated process that can generate and track HITs to be\nreviewed and linked manually for messy data elements such as hospitals that\nhave been merged.

A~good embedding should capture the graph topology, node-to-node\nrelationship, and other relevant information about the graph, its subgraphs,\nand nodes. If these objectives are achieved, an embedding is a meaningful,\nunderstandable, compressed representations of a network that can be used for\nother machine learning tools such as node classification, community detection,\nor link prediction. The main challenge is that one needs to make sure that\nembeddings describe the properties of the graphs well. As a result, selecting\nthe best embedding is a challenging task and very often requires domain\nexperts. In this paper, we do a series of extensive experiments with selected\ngraph embedding algorithms, both on real-world networks as well as artificially\ngenerated ones. Based on those experiments we formulate two general\nconclusions. First, if one needs to pick one embedding algorithm before running\nthe experiments, then node2vec is the best choice as it performed best in our\ntests. Having said that, there is no single winner in all tests and,\nadditionally, most embedding algorithms have hyperparameters that should be\ntuned and are randomized. Therefore, our main recommendation for practitioners\nis, if possible, to generate several embeddings for a problem at hand and then\nuse a general framework that provides a tool for an unsupervised graph\nembedding comparison.

As most droplets in a common situation are immersed in external\nflows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow\nprofiles namely, shear flow, Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the\ntransport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5$\\mu$m to 100 $\\mu $m,\nwhich are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing\nprocesses. The dynamics we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An\norder-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve the M-R equation to leading\norder analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset\nmemory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order\nindicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5\\mu m$\nradius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of\n$1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in\nthe air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also\ncalculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a\nsmall difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it\ndepends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets\nof radius $5\\mu m$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is\nseen to be around $2m$. In general, higher order terms are observed to slightly\nenhance droplets' dispersion and their flying time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 16:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

This is found to be even more critical for molecules like\nC$_2$H, CN or HCN that are commonly used to infer changes in the elemental disk\nC/O and N/O ratios, with implications for planetesimal formation and the\ncomposition of exoplanet atmospheres.

The number of interactions is limited\nby resource constraints such as on computation, storage, and network\ncommunication. We can increase scalability by implementing the system as a\ndistributed task-allocation system, sharing tasks across many agents. However,\nthis also increases the resource cost of communications and synchronisation,\nand is difficult to scale.\n  In this paper we present four algorithms to solve these problems. The\ncombination of these algorithms enable each agent to improve their task\nallocation strategy through reinforcement learning, while changing how much\nthey explore the system in response to how optimal they believe their current\nstrategy is, given their past experience. We focus on distributed agent systems\nwhere the agents' behaviours are constrained by resource usage limits, limiting\nagents to local rather than system-wide knowledge. We evaluate these algorithms\nin a simulated environment where agents are given a task composed of multiple\nsubtasks that must be allocated to other agents with differing capabilities, to\nthen carry out those tasks. We also simulate real-life system effects such as\nnetworking instability. Our solution is shown to solve the task allocation\nproblem to 6.7% of the theoretical optimal within the system configurations\nconsidered.

Ice mass loss via calving of the glaciers into the\nocean has increased over the last few decades. Information on the temporal\nvariability of the calving front position provides fundamental information on\nthe state of the glacier and ice stream, which can be exploited as calibration\nand validation data to enhance ice dynamics modeling. To identify the calving\nfront position automatically, deep neural network-based semantic segmentation\npipelines can be used to delineate the acquired SAR imagery. However, the\nextreme class imbalance is highly challenging for the accurate calving front\nsegmentation in these images. Therefore, we propose the use of the Mathews\ncorrelation coefficient (MCC) as an early stopping criterion because of its\nsymmetrical properties and its invariance towards class imbalance. Moreover, we\npropose an improvement to the distance map-based binary cross-entropy (BCE)\nloss function. The distance map adds context to the loss function about the\nimportant regions for segmentation and helps accounting for the imbalanced\ndata. Using Mathews correlation coefficient as early stopping demonstrates an\naverage 15% dice coefficient improvement compared to the commonly used BCE. The\nmodified distance map loss further improves the segmentation performance by\nanother 2%.

The multi-group resource allocation optimisation (MG-RAO) algorithm we\npresent uses multiple function approximations of resource demand over time,\nalongside reinforcement learning techniques, to develop a novel method of\noptimising resource allocation in these multi-agent systems. This method is\napplicable where there are competing demands for shared resources, or in task\nprioritisation problems.

It serves as a language-specific signal for the Transformer to\ncapture contextual representations across languages. In this paper, we revisit\nthe use of language embedding and identify several problems in the existing\nformulations.

In such a way, XLP achieves the purpose of\nappropriately encoding \"language\" in a multilingual Transformer model.\nExperimental results show that XLP can freely and significantly boost the model\nperformance on extensive multilingual benchmark datasets.

The case when $p\\to 0$ was however completely left open\nwith one expecting the dense behavior to hold only until the average degree is\nlogarithmic in $n$. In this article we focus on the case of constant average\ndegree i.e., $p=\\frac{d}{n}$.

This paper introduces a\nlearning-based approach called ArCode to help novice programmers correctly use\nframeworks' APIs to implement architectural tactics and patterns. ArCode has\nseveral novel components: a graph-based approach for learning specification of\na framework from a limited number of training software, a program analysis\nalgorithm to eliminate erroneous training data, and a recommender module to\nhelp programmers use APIs correctly and identify API misuses in their programs.\nWe evaluated our technique across two popular frameworks: JAAS security\nframework used for authentication and authorization tactic and Java RMI\nframework used to enable remote method invocation between client and server and\nother object-oriented patterns. Our evaluation results show (i) the feasibility\nof using ArCode to learn the specification of a framework; (ii) ArCode\ngenerates accurate recommendations for finding the next API call to implement\nan architectural tactic/pattern based on the context of the programmer's code;\n(iii) it accurately detects API misuses in the code that implements a\ntactic/pattern and provides fix recommendations.

Although they are widely adopted beyond research, it has\nbeen a longstanding open problem to understand mathematically the feature\nextraction mechanism that trained nonlinear autoencoders provide.\n  In this work, we make progress in this problem by analyzing a class of\ntwo-layer weight-tied nonlinear autoencoders in the mean field framework. Upon\na suitable scaling, in the regime of a large number of neurons, the models\ntrained with stochastic gradient descent are shown to admit a mean field\nlimiting dynamics. This limiting description reveals an asymptotically precise\npicture of feature learning by these models: their training dynamics exhibit\ndifferent phases that correspond to the learning of different principal\nsubspaces of the data, with varying degrees of nonlinear shrinkage dependent on\nthe $\\ell_{2}$-regularization and stopping time. While we prove these results\nunder an idealized assumption of (correlated) Gaussian data, experiments on\nreal-life data demonstrate an interesting match with the theory.\n  The autoencoder setup of interests poses a nontrivial mathematical challenge\nto proving these results. In this setup, the \"Lipschitz\" constants of the\nmodels grow with the data dimension $d$. Consequently an adaptation of previous\nanalyses requires a number of neurons $N$ that is at least exponential in $d$.\nOur main technical contribution is a new argument which proves that the\nrequired $N$ is only polynomial in $d$.

In 2020, LAMOST-J024048.51+195226.9 (J0240) was identified as a\ncandidate eclipsing AE Aqr object, and we present three epochs of time-series\nspectroscopy that strongly support this hypothesis.

This is, however, consistent with the high-velocity emission seen in\nflares from AE Aqr. Additionally, we confirm beyond doubt that J0240 is a\ndeeply eclipsing system. The flaring continuum, HeI and much of the Balmer\nemission likely originate close to the WD because they disappear during the\neclipse that is centered on inferior conjunction of the secondary star. The\nfraction of the Balmer emission remaining visible during eclipse has a steep\ndecrement and it is likely produced in the extended outflow.

We vary\nthe torus mass, BH mass and spin, and examine the impact of rest-mass and\nweak-magnetism corrections in the neutrino rates. We also test the dependence\non the angular-momentum transport treatment by comparing axisymmetric models\nusing the standard alpha-viscosity with viscous models assuming constant\nviscous length scales (l_t) and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations. Finally, we discuss the nucleosynthesis yields and basic kilonova\nproperties. We find that absorption pushes Y_e towards ~0.5 outside the torus,\nwhile inside increasing the equilibrium value Y_e^eq by ~0.05-0.2.\nCorrespondingly, a substantial ejecta fraction is pushed above Y_e=0.25,\nleading to a reduced lanthanide fraction and a brighter, earlier, and bluer\nkilonova than without absorption.

When the bar slows down,\nresonance sweeps radially outwards through the galactic disc while growing in\nvolume, thereby sequentially capturing new stars at its surface/separatrix.\nSince trapped stars conserve their action of libration, which measures the\nrelative distance to the resonance centre, the order of capturing is preserved:\nthe surface of the resonance is dominated by stars captured recently at large\nradius, while the core of the resonance is occupied by stars trapped early at\nsmall radius. The slow-down of the bar thus results in a rising mean\nmetallicity of trapped stars from the surface towards the centre of the\nresonance as the Galaxy's metallicity declines towards large radii. This\nargument, when applied to Solar neighbourhood stars, allows a novel precision\nmeasurement of the bar's current pattern speed $\\Omega_p = 35.5 \\pm 0.8$\nkm/s/kpc, placing the corotation radius at $R_{CR} = 6.6 \\pm 0.2$ kpc. With\nthis pattern speed, the corotation resonance precisely fits the Hercules stream\nin agreement with kinematics. Beyond corroborating the slow bar theory, this\nmeasurement manifests the deceleration of the bar of more than 24% since its\nformation and thus the angular momentum transfer to the dark halo by dynamical\nfriction. The measurement therefore supports the existence of a standard\ndark-matter halo rather than alternative models of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 03:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

This is\npartly due to the fact that most fairness metrics of interest depend on both\nthe sensitive attribute information and label information of the data points.\nIn many scenarios it is not possible to collect large datasets with such\ninformation. An alternate approach that is commonly used is to separately train\nan attribute classifier on data with sensitive attribute information, and then\nuse it later in the ML pipeline to evaluate the bias of a given classifier.\nWhile such decoupling helps alleviate the problem of demographic scarcity, it\nraises several natural questions such as: how should the attribute classifier\nbe trained?, and how should one use a given attribute classifier for accurate\nbias estimation? In this work we study this question from both theoretical and\nempirical perspectives.\n  We first experimentally demonstrate that the test accuracy of the attribute\nclassifier is not always correlated with its effectiveness in bias estimation\nfor a downstream model. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, we\nanalyze an idealized theoretical model and characterize the structure of the\noptimal classifier.

How the underlying\nneuronal machinery can yield robust behaviour in a variety of environments\nremains unclear. In the fly brain, motion-sensitive neurons indicate the\npresence of nearby objects and directional cues are integrated within an area\nknown as the central complex. Such neuronal machinery, in contrast with the\ntraditional stream-based approach to signal processing, uses an event-based\napproach, with events occurring when changes are sensed by the animal. Contrary\nto von Neumann computing architectures, event-based neuromorphic hardware is\ndesigned to process information in an asynchronous and distributed manner.\nInspired by the fly brain, we model, for the first time, a neuromorphic\nclosed-loop system mimicking essential behaviours observed in flying insects,\nsuch as meandering in clutter and gap crossing, which are highly relevant for\nautonomous vehicles. We implemented our system both in software and on\nneuromorphic hardware. While moving through an environment, our agent perceives\nchanges in its surroundings and uses this information for collision avoidance.\nThe agent's manoeuvres result from a closed action-perception loop implementing\nprobabilistic decision-making processes. This loop-closure is thought to have\ndriven the development of neural circuitry in biological agents since the\nCambrian explosion. In the fundamental quest to understand neural computation\nin artificial agents, we come closer to understanding and modelling biological\nintelligence by closing the loop also in neuromorphic systems. As a closed-loop\nsystem, our system deepens our understanding of processing in neural networks\nand computations in biological and artificial systems. With these\ninvestigations, we aim to set the foundations for neuromorphic intelligence in\nthe future, moving towards leveraging the full potential of neuromorphic\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 19:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Since ethics\nguidelines on this topic are kept rather general for now, we aim to provide\nmore hands-on guidance with this document. Therefore, we first structure the\ncomplex landscape of existing fairness metrics and explain the different\noptions by example. Furthermore, we propose the \"Fairness Compass\", a tool\nwhich formalises the selection process and makes identifying the most\nappropriate fairness definition for a given system a simple, straightforward\nprocedure. Because this process also allows to document the reasoning behind\nthe respective decisions, we argue that this approach can help to build trust\nfrom the user through explaining and justifying the implemented fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 21:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 10:21:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 14:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 10:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 20:15:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 08:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Informally, given a collection of demographic groups of interest,\nminimax fairness asks that the error of the group with the highest error be\nminimized. Lexifairness goes further and asks that amongst all minimax fair\nsolutions, the error of the group with the second highest error should be\nminimized, and amongst all of those solutions, the error of the group with the\nthird highest error should be minimized, and so on. Despite its naturalness,\ncorrectly defining lexifairness is considerably more subtle than minimax\nfairness, because of inherent sensitivity to approximation error. We give a\nnotion of approximate lexifairness that avoids this issue, and then derive\noracle-efficient algorithms for finding approximately lexifair solutions in a\nvery general setting. When the underlying empirical risk minimization problem\nabsent fairness constraints is convex (as it is, for example, with linear and\nlogistic regression), our algorithms are provably efficient even in the worst\ncase. Finally, we show generalization bounds -- approximate lexifairness on the\ntraining sample implies approximate lexifairness on the true distribution with\nhigh probability. Our ability to prove generalization bounds depends on our\nchoosing definitions that avoid the instability of naive definitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 21:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Analyses of magnetic properties on umbrae boundaries led to the\nJurcak criterion, which states that umbra-penumbra boundaries in stable\nsunspots are equally defined by a constant value of the vertical magnetic\nfield, Bver_crit, and by 0.5 continuum intensity of the quiet Sun, Iqs. Umbrae\nwith vertical magnetic fields stronger than Bver_crit are stable, whereas\numbrae with vertical magnetic fields weaker than Bver_crit are unstable and\nprone to vanishing. Aims. To investigate the existence of a critical value of\nthe vertical magnetic field on a pore boundary and its role in the evolution of\nthe magnetic structure. Methods. We analysed SDO/HMI vector field maps\ncorrected for scattered light with a temporal cadence of 12 min during a\n26.5-hour period. An intensity threshold (Ic = 0.55 Iqs) is used to define the\npore boundary and temporal evolutions of the magnetic properties are studied\nthere. Results. We observe stages in the pore evolution: (1)during an initial\nformation phase, total magnetic field strength (B) and vertical magnetic field\n(Bver) increase to their maximum values of ~1920 G and ~1730 G, respectively;\n(2)then the pore reaches a stable phase; (3)in a second formation phase, the\npore undergoes a rapid growth in size, along with a decrease in B and Bver on\nits boundary. In the newly formed area, Bver remains mostly below 1731 G and B\nremains everywhere below 1921 G; (4)ultimately, pore decay starts. We find\noverall that pore areas with Bver<1731 G, or equivalently B<1921 G,\ndisintegrate faster than regions that fulfil this criteria. Conclusions. The\nmost stable regions of the pore, similarly to the case of umbral boundaries,\nare defined by a critical value of Bver that is comparable to that found in\nstable sunspots. In addition, in this case study, the same pore areas can be\nsimilarly well-defined by a critical value of the total magnetic field\nstrength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 21:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Among 31 quadruply lensed quasars systems with\nstatistically significant decompositions, 15 are either reliably ($2\\sigma$) or\nprovisionally ($1\\sigma$) shear-dominated and 11 are either reliably or\nprovisionally ellipticity-dominated. For the remaining 8, the two effects make\nroughly equal contributions to the combined cross section (newly derived here)\nfor quadruple lensing. This observational result is strongly at variance with\nthe ellipticity-dominated forecast of Oguri & Marshall (2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 22:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 03:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The second\napproach focuses on filtering irrelevant frames using a lightweight model and\nprocessing the filtered frames using a heavyweight model. These techniques\nsuffer from two limitations. With the first approach, the specialized model is\nunable to provide accurate results for hard-to-detect events. With the second\napproach, the system is unable to accelerate queries focusing on frequently\noccurring events as the filter is unable to eliminate a significant fraction of\nframes in the video.\n  In this paper, we present THIA, a video analytics system for tackling these\nlimitations.

First,\ninstead of using a cascade of models, it uses a single object detection model\nwith multiple exit points for short-circuiting the inference. This early\ninference technique allows it to support a range of throughput-accuracy\ntradeoffs. Second, it adopts a fine-grained approach to planning and processes\ndifferent chunks of the video using different exit points to meet the user's\nrequirements.

Like\nsource code, API documentation is itself a software product. Several research\nresults show that bad design in API documentation can make the reuse of API\nfeatures difficult. Indeed, similar to code smells or code antipatterns, poorly\ndesigned API documentation can also exhibit 'smells'. Such documentation smells\ncan be described as bad documentation styles that do not necessarily produce an\nincorrect documentation but nevertheless make the documentation difficult to\nproperly understand and to use. Recent research on API documentation has\nfocused on finding content inaccuracies in API documentation and to complement\nAPI documentation with external resources (e.g., crowd-shared code examples).\nWe are aware of no research that focused on the automatic detection of API\ndocumentation smells. This paper makes two contributions. First, we produce a\ncatalog of five API documentation smells by consulting literature on API\ndocumentation presentation problems. We create a benchmark dataset of 1,000 API\ndocumentation units by exhaustively and manually validating the presence of the\nfive smells in Java official API reference and instruction documentation.\nSecond, we conduct a survey of 21 professional software developers to validate\nthe catalog. The developers agreed that they frequently encounter all five\nsmells in API official documentation and 95.2% of them reported that the\npresence of the documentation smells negatively affects their productivity.

Surveys like MUSCLES, HAZMAT, and FUMES have collected\nmultiwavelength spectra across the spectral type's range of Teff and activity,\nbut the extreme ultraviolet flux (EUV, 100 to 912 Angstroms) of most of these\nstars remains unobserved because of obscuration by the interstellar medium\ncompounded with limited detector sensitivity. While targets with observable EUV\nflux exist, there is no currently operational facility observing between 150\nand 912 Angstroms. Inferring the spectra of exoplanet hosts in this regime is\ncritical to studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres because the EUV\nheats the top of the thermosphere and drives atmospheric escape. This paper\npresents our implementation of the differential emission measure technique to\nreconstruct the EUV spectra of cool dwarfs.

Rapid deployment of eight\ntemporary seismic stations enables detailed analysis of its productive and\nslowly decaying aftershock sequence (p=0.8) which included ~18,000 autodetected\nevents in 3.5 months. Double-difference, waveform-based relative relocation of\n16,714 earthquakes reveals a complex network of faults, many of which cross the\ninferred 35-km long east-northeast-striking, left-lateral mainshock rupture.\nSeismicity aligns with left-lateral, right-lateral, and normal mechanism moment\ntensors of 128 of the largest earthquakes. The mainshock occurred near the\nmiddle of the aftershock zone at the intersection of two distinct zones of\nseismicity. In the western section, numerous subparallel, shallow,\nnorth-northeast-striking faults form a broad flower-structure-like fault mesh\nthat coalesces at depth into a near-vertical, left-lateral fault. We infer the\nnear-vertical fault to be a region of significant slip in the mainshock and an\neastward extension of the left-lateral Candelaria fault.

One, through\nobject oriented and traditional verification techniques determine how higher\nresolution soil moisture initial conditions influences the prediction of the\nlocation and timing of convective initiation (CI) within a convective\npermitting, operational NWP model over South Africa. Two, to study the modelled\nCI-soil moisture relationship during real afternoon thunderstorm events. The\nstudy reports the results from 66 Unified Model simulations (at 4.4km grid\nresolution) for nine summer afternoon CI events during synoptically benign\nconditions over South Africa. The higher resolution soil moisture conditions\nreduce centroid distance between observed and forecast storms on average by 7km\n(9 percent improvement), with the most decrease in centroid distance occurring\nat the shortest lead times, by 12km. Most improvement in location error occurs\nin the zonal directional. However, little to no difference is found in the\ntiming of CI, most likely attributable to the dominant effect of model grid\nsize on CI timing, overshadowing the influence from soil moisture anomalies.\nProbability of CI is highest over dry and moderate soils and areas along\ndistinct soil moisture gradients.

In order to make up for the deficiency of the handcrafted feature\nengineering caused by ATC challenges, a speech representation learning (SRL)\nnetwork is proposed to capture robust and discriminative speech representations\nfrom the raw wave. The self-supervised training strategy is adopted to optimize\nthe SRL network from unlabeled data, and further to predict the speech\nfeatures, i.e., wave-to-feature. An end-to-end architecture is improved to\ncomplete the ASR task, in which a grapheme-based modeling unit is applied to\naddress the multilingual ASR issue. Facing the problem of small transcribed\nsamples in the ATC domain, an unsupervised approach with mask prediction is\napplied to pre-train the backbone network of the ASR model on unlabeled data by\na feature-to-feature process. Finally, by integrating the SRL with ASR, an\nend-to-end multilingual ASR framework is formulated in a supervised manner,\nwhich is able to translate the raw wave into text in one model, i.e.,\nwave-to-text.

In this\npaper, we address these shortcomings by proposing a separated\nproportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. Taking a control\nperspective, we first interpret the penalty method and the Lagrangian method as\nproportional feedback and integral feedback control, respectively. Then, a\nproportional-integral Lagrangian method is proposed to steady learning process\nwhile improving safety. To prevent integral overshooting and reduce\nconservatism, we introduce the integral separation technique inspired by PID\ncontrol. Finally, an analytical gradient of the chance constraint is utilized\nfor model-based policy optimization. The effectiveness of SPIL is demonstrated\nby a narrow car-following task. Experiments indicate that compared with\nprevious methods, SPIL improves the performance while guaranteeing safety, with\na steady learning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 02:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Although, finding the most energy efficient approximation for various\napplications with minimal effort is the main challenge. To address this issue,\nwe propose NEAT: a pin tool that helps users automatically explore the\naccuracy-energy tradeoff space induced by various floating point\nimplementations. NEAT helps programmers explore the effects of simultaneously\nusing multiple floating point implementations to achieve the lowest energy\nconsumption for an accuracy constraint or vice versa. NEAT accepts one or more\nuser-defined floating point implementations and programmable placement rules\nfor where/when to apply them.

To promote discovery, collected genomic data is\noften de-identified and shared, either in public repositories, such as OpenSNP,\nor with researchers through access-controlled repositories. However, recent\nstudies have suggested that genomic data can be effectively matched to\nhigh-resolution three-dimensional face images, which raises a concern that the\nincreasingly ubiquitous public face images can be linked to shared genomic\ndata, thereby re-identifying individuals in the genomic data. While these\ninvestigations illustrate the possibility of such an attack, they assume that\nthose performing the linkage have access to extremely well-curated data. Given\nthat this is unlikely to be the case in practice, it calls into question the\npragmatic nature of the attack. As such, we systematically study this\nre-identification risk from two perspectives: first, we investigate how\nsuccessful such linkage attacks can be when real face images are used, and\nsecond, we consider how we can empower individuals to have better control over\nthe associated re-identification risk. We observe that the true risk of\nre-identification is likely substantially smaller for most individuals than\nprior literature suggests. In addition, we demonstrate that the addition of a\nsmall amount of carefully crafted noise to images can enable a controlled\ntrade-off between re-identification success and the quality of shared images,\nwith risk typically significantly lowered even with noise that is imperceptible\nto humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 03:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

We show that exactly six tangles are stringable; these guarantee EF\nconnected allocations for any number of agents, and their associated\ntopological classes contain only Hamiltonian graphs. Any non-stringable tangle\nhas a finite upper bound r on the number of agents for which EF allocations of\nconnected shares are guaranteed. Most graphs in the associated non-stringable\ntopological class are not Hamiltonian, and a negative transfer theorem shows\nthat for each $k \\geq 1$ most of these graphs fail to guarantee EFk$_{outer}$\nallocations of vertices for r + 1 or more agents.

The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an accumulation of\nsuper-Earth sized planets close to their host stars in compact systems. When an\ninward disc-driven migration scenario is assumed for their formation, these\nplanets could have been stopped and might have been parked at an inner edge of\nthe disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This\ntopic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical\nsimulations, we investigate the possibility that the inner planets in a\nresonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We\nperformed hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded\nin their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc was represented in two\ndifferent ways, resembling either a dead zone inner edge (DZ) or a disc inner\nboundary (IB). The main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density\nprofile. The innermost planet always has a mass of 10 M Earth , with additional\nouter planets of equal or higher mass. A steeper profile is able to stop a\nchain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final\nconfigurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB\ncounterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show\nthat the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in\nthinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for over-stable\nlibrations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems.\nWe also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number\nof planets in the disc inner cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 07:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 07:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Among them, different\nflavors of echo state networks have attracted many stares through time, mainly\ndue to the simplicity and computational efficiency of their learning algorithm.\nHowever, these advantages do not compensate for the fact that echo state\nnetworks remain as black-box models whose decisions cannot be easily explained\nto the general audience. This work addresses this issue by conducting an\nexplainability study of Echo State Networks when applied to learning tasks with\ntime series, image and video data. Specifically, the study proposes three\ndifferent techniques capable of eliciting understandable information about the\nknowledge grasped by these recurrent models, namely, potential memory, temporal\npatterns and pixel absence effect. Potential memory addresses questions related\nto the effect of the reservoir size in the capability of the model to store\ntemporal information, whereas temporal patterns unveils the recurrent\nrelationships captured by the model over time. Finally, pixel absence effect\nattempts at evaluating the effect of the absence of a given pixel when the echo\nstate network model is used for image and video classification. We showcase the\nbenefits of our proposed suite of techniques over three different domains of\napplicability: time series modeling, image and, for the first time in the\nrelated literature, video classification. Our results reveal that the proposed\ntechniques not only allow for a informed understanding of the way these models\nwork, but also serve as diagnostic tools capable of detecting issues inherited\nfrom data (e.g. presence of hidden bias).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Specifically, by using polynomial codes, computed results\nfrom only a subset of edge servers can be used to reconstruct the final result.\nHowever, incentive issues have not been studied systematically for the edge\nservers to complete the CDC tasks. In this paper, we propose a tractable\ntwo-level game-theoretic approach to incentivize the edge servers to complete\nthe CDC tasks. Specifically, in the lower level, a hedonic coalition formation\ngame is formulated where the edge servers share their resources within their\ncoalitions. By forming coalitions, the edge servers have more Central\nProcessing Unit (CPU) power to complete the computation tasks. In the upper\nlevel, given the CPU power of the coalitions of edge servers, an all-pay\nauction is designed to incentivize the edge servers to participate in the CDC\ntasks. In the all-pay auction, the bids of the edge servers are represented by\nthe allocation of their CPU power to the CDC tasks. The all-pay auction is\ndesigned to maximize the utility of the cloud server by determining the\nallocation of rewards to the winners. Simulation results show that the edge\nservers are incentivized to allocate more CPU power when multiple rewards are\noffered, i.e., there are multiple winners, instead of rewarding only the edge\nserver with the largest CPU power allocation. Besides, the utility of the cloud\nserver is maximized when it offers multiple homogeneous rewards, instead of\nheterogeneous rewards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 10:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

This alteration came in the form of melting through impacts, as well\nas the belated addition of volatiles and the highly siderophile elements\n(HSEs). Current debate centres on whether the lunar HSE record is\nrepresentative of its whole late accretion history or alternatively that these\nwere only retained in the mantle and crust after a particular time, and if so,\nwhen. Here we employ improved Monte Carlo impact simulations of late accretion\nonto the Moon and Mars and present an updated chronology based on new dynamical\nsimulations of leftover planetesimals and the E-belt. We take into account the\ninefficient retention of colliding material. We compute the crater and basin\ndensities on the Moon and Mars, the largest objects to strike these planets and\nthe amount of material they accreted. Outputs are used to infer the mass in\nleftover planetesimals at a particular time period, which is then compared to\nthe lunar HSE abundance. From this estimate we calculate a preferred lunar HSE\nretention age of ca. 4450 Ma which means that the modelled lunar mantle HSE\nabundances trace almost all of lunar late accretion. Based on our results, the\nsurface ages of the lunar highlands are at least 4370 Ma. We find that the mass\nof leftover planetesimals with diameters Di<300 km at 4500 Ma that best fits\nthe crater chronology is approximately 2x10^{-3} Earth mass (ME) while the mass\nof the E-belt was fixed at 4.5x10^{-4} ME. We also find that a leftover\nplanetesimal mass in excess of 0.01 ME results in a lunar HSE retention age\nyounger than major episodes of lunar differentiation and crust formation, which\nin turn violates geochemical constraints for the timing and intensity of late\naccretion to the Earth (Mojzsis et al., 2019).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 10:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Methods: A set of 23 quiet-Sun and\nweak-plage regions were observed in the Mg II k and h lines with the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). The deposited acoustic-energy flux was\nderived from Doppler velocities observed at two different geometrical heights\ncorresponding to the middle and upper chromosphere. A set of scaled nonlocal\nthermodynamic equilibrium 1D hydrostatic semi-empirical models (obtained by\nfitting synthetic to observed line profiles) was applied to compute the\nradiative losses. The characteristics of observed waves were studied by means\nof a wavelet analysis. Results: Observed waves propagate upward at supersonic\nspeed. In the quiet chromosphere, the deposited acoustic flux is sufficient to\nbalance the radiative losses and maintain the semi-empirical temperatures in\nthe layers under study. In the active-region chromosphere, the comparison shows\nthat the contribution of acoustic-energy flux to the radiative losses is only\n10 - 30 %. Conclusions: Acoustic and magnetoacoustic waves play an important\nrole in the chromospheric heating, depositing a main part of their energy in\nthe chromosphere. Acoustic waves compensate for a substantial fraction of the\nchromospheric radiative losses in quiet regions. In active regions, their\ncontribution is too small to balance the radiative losses and the chromosphere\nhas to be heated by other mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 10:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

In this\npaper we devise an all-sky sample of such luminous OBA-type stars, designed to\nbe quite complete rather than very pure, to serve as targets for spectroscopic\nfollow-up with the SDSS-V survey. We estimate \"astro-kinematic\" distances by\ncombining parallaxes and proper motions with a model for the expected velocity\nand density distribution of young stars; we show that this adds useful\nconstraints on the stars' distances, and hence luminosities. With these\ndistances we map the spatial distribution of a more stringently selected\nsub-sample across the Galactic disc, and find it to be highly structured, with\ndistinct over- and under-densities.

The geometry of the MPOs comprises a square\npacked array of microscopic pores with a square cross-section, arranged over a\nspherical surface with a radius of curvature twice the focal length of the\noptic. Working in the photon energy range 0.3-5 keV, the optimum $L/d$ ratio\n(length of pore $L$ and pore width $d$) is upwards of 50 and is constant across\nthe whole optic aperture for the SXI. The performance goal for the SXI modules\nis an angular resolution of 4.5 arcmin, localisation accuracy of $\\sim$1 arcmin\nand employing an $L/d$ of 60. During the Phase A study, we are investigating\nmethods to improve the current performance and consistency of the MPOs, in\ncooperation with the manufacturer Photonis France SAS. We present the optics\ndesign of the THESEUS SXI modules and the programme of work designed to improve\nthe MPOs performance and the results from the study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 11:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

In\nparticular, the low cost and high-bandwidth properties of laser sources such as\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) make them attractive for\nfuture indoor optical wireless communications. In order to be integrated into\nfuture indoor networks, such lasers should conform to eye safety regulations\ndetermined by the international electrotechnical commission (IEC) standards for\nlaser safety. In this paper, we provide a detailed study of beam propagation to\nevaluate the received power of various laser sources, based on which as well as\nthe maximum permissible exposure (MPE) defined by the IEC 60825-1:2014\nstandard, we establish a comprehensive framework for eye safety analyses. This\nframework allows us to calculate the maximum allowable transmit power, which is\ncrucial in the design of a reliable and safe laser-based wireless communication\nsystem. Initially, we consider a single-mode Gaussian beam and calculate the\nmaximum permissible transmit power. Subsequently, we generalize this approach\nfor higher-mode beams. It is shown that the M-squared-based approach for\nanalysis of multimode lasers ensures the IEC eye safety limits, however, in\nsome scenarios, it can be too conservative compared to the precise beam\ndecomposition method. Laser safety analyses with consideration of optical\nelements such as lens and diffuser, as well as for VCSEL array have been also\npresented.

Detecting the plasmodium parasite requires a\nskilled examiner and may take up to 10 to 15 minutes to completely go through\nthe whole slide. Due to a lack of skilled medical professionals in the\nunderdeveloped or resource deficient regions, many cases go misdiagnosed;\nresulting in unavoidable complications and/or undue medication. We propose to\ncomplement the medical professionals by creating a deep learning-based method\nto automatically detect (localize) the plasmodium parasites in the photograph\nof stained film. To handle the unbalanced nature of the dataset, we adopt a\ntwo-stage approach. Where the first stage is trained to detect blood cells and\nclassify them into just healthy or infected. The second stage is trained to\nclassify each detected cell further into the life-cycle stage. To facilitate\nthe research in machine learning-based malaria microscopy, we introduce a new\nlarge scale microscopic image malaria dataset. Thirty-eight thousand cells are\ntagged from the 345 microscopic images of different Giemsa-stained slides of\nblood samples. Extensive experimentation is performed using different CNN\nbackbones including VGG, DenseNet, and ResNet on this dataset. Our experiments\nand analysis reveal that the two-stage approach works better than the one-stage\napproach for malaria detection. To ensure the usability of our approach, we\nhave also developed a mobile app that will be used by local hospitals for\ninvestigation and educational purposes. The dataset, its annotations, and\nimplementation codes will be released upon publication of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 11:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

The ability to dynamically grow and shrink the number\nof nodes has paved the way for customised elastic computing both for High\nPerformance Computing and High Throughput Computing workloads. However,\nelasticity is typically restricted to a single cloud site, thus hindering the\nability to provision computational resources from multiple geographically\ndistributed cloud sites. To this aim, this paper introduces an architecture of\nopen-source components that coherently deploy a virtual elastic cluster across\nmultiple cloud sites to perform large-scale computing. These hybrid virtual\nelastic clusters are automatically deployed and configured using an\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) approach on a distributed hybrid testbed that\nspans different organizations, including on-premises and public clouds,\nsupporting automated tunneling of communications across the cluster nodes with\nadvanced VPN topologies. The results indicate that cluster-based computing of\nembarrassingly parallel jobs can benefit from hybrid virtual clusters that\naggregate computing resources from multiple cloud back-ends and bring them\ntogether into a dedicated, albeit virtual network.\n  The work presented in this article has been partially funded by the European\nUnion's (EU) Horizon 2020 research project DEEP Hybrid-DataCloud (grant\nagreement No 777435).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 11:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

We use it to train\nmodels that predict the probability distribution of incident durations,\nutilising both time-invariant and time-varying features of the data. The latter\nallow predictions to be updated as an incident progresses, and more information\nbecomes available. For dynamic predictions, time-series features are fed into\nthe Match-Net algorithm, a temporal convolutional hitting-time network,\nrecently developed for dynamical survival analysis in clinical applications.\nThe predictions are benchmarked against static regression models for survival\nanalysis and against an established dynamic technique known as landmarking and\nfound to perform favourably by several standard comparison measures. To provide\ninterpretability, we utilise the concept of Shapley values from the domain of\ninterpretable artificial intelligence to rank the features most relevant to the\nmodel predictions at different time horizons. For example, the time of day is\nalways a significantly influential time-invariant feature, whereas the\ntime-series features strongly influence predictions at 5 and 60-minute\nhorizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 12:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

At the core of the technique, the depth of a target is measured by\nconstructing a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and\ndetected photon arrivals. A major data processing bottleneck arises on the\ndevice when either the number of photons per pixel is large or the resolution\nof the time stamp is fine, as both the space requirement and the complexity of\nthe image reconstruction algorithms scale with these parameters. We solve this\nlimiting bottleneck of existing lidar techniques by sampling the characteristic\nfunction of the time of flight (ToF) model to build a compressive statistic, a\nso-called sketch of the time delay distribution, which is sufficient to infer\nthe spatial distance and intensity of the object. The size of the sketch scales\nwith the degrees of freedom of the ToF model (number of objects) and not,\nfundamentally, with the number of photons or the time stamp resolution.\nMoreover, the sketch is highly amenable for on-chip online processing. We show\ntheoretically that the loss of information for compression is controlled and\nthe mean squared error of the inference quickly converges towards the optimal\nCram\\'er-Rao bound (i.e. no loss of information) for modest sketch sizes.

By minimizing the\ncross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its\nvisual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the\nsole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these\nmodels tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their\nsource domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the\nknowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that\nsupervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The\nauxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective\nconcepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector\nrepresentation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,\nKG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according\nto the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN\non visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet\ndataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from\nGermany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a\nknowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in\nall experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases.

In optics, various photonic topological circuits\nhave been developed, which were based on classical emulation of either quantum\nspin Hall effect or quantum valley Hall effect. On the other hand, the\ncombination of both the valley and spin degrees of freedom can lead to a new\nkind of topological transport phenomenon, dubbed quantum spin valley Hall\neffect (QSVH), which can further expand the number of topologically protected\nedge channels and would be useful for information multiplexing. However, it is\nchallenging to realize QSVH in most known material platforms, due to the\nrequirement of breaking both the (pseudo-)fermionic time-reversal (T) and\nparity symmetries (P) individually, but leaving the combined symmetry S=TP\nintact. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible platform to realize QSVH\nfor light, based on coupled ring resonators mediated by optical Kerr\nnonlinearity. Thanks to the inherent flexibility of cross-mode modulation\n(XMM), the coupling between the probe light can be engineered in a controllable\nway such that spin-dependent staggered sublattice potential emerges in the\neffective Hamiltonian. With delicate yet experimentally feasible pump\nconditions, we show the existence of spin valley Hall induced topological edge\nstates.

To estimate causal effects from the passively observed log data, we\ncontrol confounds in a matched quasi-experimental design: we identify focal\nusers who at first do not have any regular eating partners but then start\neating with a fixed partner regularly, and we match focal users into comparison\npairs such that paired users are nearly identical with respect to covariates\nmeasured before acquiring the partner, where the two focal users' new eating\npartners diverge in the healthiness of their respective food choice. A\ndifference-in-differences analysis of the paired data yields clear evidence of\nsocial influence: focal users acquiring a healthy-eating partner change their\nhabits significantly more toward healthy foods than focal users acquiring an\nunhealthy-eating partner. We further identify foods whose purchase frequency is\nimpacted significantly by the eating partner's healthiness of food choice.\nBeyond the main results, the work demonstrates the utility of passively sensed\nfood purchase logs for deriving insights, with the potential of informing the\ndesign of public health interventions and food offerings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Indeed most\nprediction methods require careful calibration of hyperparameters usually\ncarried out on a hold-out \\textit{validation} dataset to achieve\ngeneralization. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a novel approach to\nachieve generalization without any data splitting, which is based on a new risk\nmeasure which directly quantifies a model's tendency to overfit. To fully\nunderstand the intuition and advantages of this new approach, we illustrate it\nin the simple linear regression model ($Y=X\\beta+\\xi$) where we develop a new\ncriterion. We highlight how this criterion is a good proxy for the true\ngeneralization risk. Next, we derive different procedures which tackle several\nstructures simultaneously (correlation, sparsity,...). Noticeably, these\nprocedures \\textbf{concomitantly} train the model and calibrate the\nhyperparameters. In addition, these procedures can be implemented via classical\ngradient descent methods when the criterion is differentiable w.r.t. the\nhyperparameters. Our numerical experiments reveal that our procedures are\ncomputationally feasible and compare favorably to the popular approach (Ridge,\nLASSO and Elastic-Net combined with grid-search cross-validation) in term of\ngeneralization. They also outperform the baseline on two additional tasks:\nestimation and support recovery of $\\beta$. Moreover, our procedures do not\nrequire any expertise for the calibration of the initial parameters which\nremain the same for all the datasets we experimented on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

However, the behaviour of statistical relational\nrepresentations across variable domain sizes is complex, and scaling inference\nand learning to large domains remains a significant challenge. In recent years,\nconnections have emerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and\nlearning from sampled subpopulations. The asymptotic behaviour of statistical\nrelational representations has come under scrutiny, and projectivity was\ninvestigated as the strongest form of domain-size dependence, in which query\nmarginals are completely independent of the domain size.\n  In this contribution we show that every probabilistic logic program under the\ndistribution semantics is asymptotically equivalent to an acyclic probabilistic\nlogic program consisting only of determinate clauses over probabilistic facts.\nWe conclude that every probabilistic logic program inducing a projective family\nof distributions is in fact everywhere equivalent to a program from this\nfragment, and we investigate the consequences for the projective families of\ndistributions expressible by probabilistic logic programs.\n  To facilitate the application of classical results from finite model theory,\nwe introduce the abstract distribution semantics, defined as an arbitrary\nlogical theory over probabilistic facts. This bridges the gap to the\ndistribution semantics underlying probabilistic logic programming.

By predicative and constructive, we respectively mean that we do\nnot assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms or excluded middle. Our\nwork complements existing work on predicative mathematics by exploring what\ncannot be done predicatively in univalent foundations. Our first main result is\nthat nontrivial (directed or bounded) complete posets are necessarily large.\nThat is, if such a nontrivial poset is small, then weak propositional resizing\nholds. It is possible to derive full propositional resizing if we strengthen\nnontriviality to positivity. The distinction between nontriviality and\npositivity is analogous to the distinction between nonemptiness and\ninhabitedness. We prove our results for a general class of posets, which\nincludes directed complete posets, bounded complete posets and sup-lattices,\nusing a technical notion of a $\\delta_{\\mathcal V}$-complete poset.

Moreover, if we assume positivity instead of\nnontriviality, then we can derive full excluded middle. Secondly, we show that\neach of Zorn's lemma, Tarski's greatest fixed point theorem and Pataraia's\nlemma implies propositional resizing. Hence, these principles are inherently\nimpredicative and a predicative development of order theory must therefore do\nwithout them.

However, the communication between the agents involves two major\nchallenges: the limited bandwidth, and the shared communication medium between\nthe agents, which restricts the number of agents that can simultaneously\nexchange information. While both of these issues need to be addressed in\npractice, the impact of the latter problem on the performance of the\nmulti-agent systems has often been neglected. This becomes even more important\nwhen the agents' information or observations have different importance, in\nwhich case the agents require different priorities for accessing the medium and\nsharing their information. Representing the agents' priorities by fairness\nweights and normalizing each agent's share by the assigned fairness weight, the\ngoal can be expressed as equalizing the agents' normalized shares of the\ncommunication medium. To achieve this goal, we adopt a queueing theoretic\napproach and propose a distributed fair scheduling algorithm for providing\nweighted fairness in single-hop networks. Our proposed algorithm guarantees an\nupper-bound on the normalized share disparity among any pair of agents. This\ncan particularly improve the short-term fairness, which is important in\nreal-time applications. Moreover, our scheduling algorithm adjusts itself\ndynamically to achieve a high throughput at the same time. The simulation\nresults validate our claims and comparisons with the existing methods show our\nalgorithm's superiority in providing short-term fairness, while achieving a\nhigh throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 15:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Here, we investigate the\nplanet-metallicity correlation for rocky planets in single and multi-planet\nsystems around Kepler M-dwarf and late K-dwarf stars. Due to molecular\nblanketing and the dim nature of these low mass stars, it is difficult to make\ndirect elemental abundance measurements via spectroscopy. We instead use a\ncombination of accurate and uniformly measured parallaxes and photometry to\nobtain relative metallicities and validate this method with a subsample of\nspectroscopically determined metallicities.

These so-called\nr/s-stars raise the need for an intermediate neutron capture process\n(i-process), which is thought to result from the ingestion of protons in a\nconvective helium-burning region, but whose astrophysical site is still largely\ndebated. We investigate whether an i-process during the asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) phase of low-metallicity low-mass stars can develop and whether it can\nexplain the abundances of observed r/s-stars. At the beginning of the AGB\nphase, during the third thermal pulse, the helium driven convection zone is\nable to penetrate the hydrogen-rich layers. The subsequent proton ingestion\nleads to a strong neutron burst with neutron densities of $\\approx 4.3 \\times\n10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the origin of the synthesis of i-process elements. The\nnuclear energy released by proton burning in the helium-burning convective\nshell strongly affects the internal structure: the thermal pulse splits and\nafter approximately ten years the upper part of the convection zone merges with\nthe convective envelope. The surface carbon abundance is enhanced by more than\n3 dex. This leads to an increase in the opacity, which triggers a strong mass\nloss and prevents any further thermal pulse. We show that specific isotopic\nratios of Ba, Nd, Sm, and Eu can represent good tracers of i-process\nnucleosynthesis. Finally, an extended comparison with 14 selected r/s-stars\nshow that the observed composition patterns can be well reproduced by our\ni-process AGB model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 15:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 17:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 12:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

On one\nhand, the proposed Table Convolutional Network model employs the attention\nmechanism to adaptively focus on the most informative intra-table cells of the\nsame row or column; and, on the other hand, it aggregates inter-table\ncontextual information from various types of implicit connections between cells\nacross different tables. Specifically, we propose three novel aggregation\nmodules for (i) cells of the same value, (ii) cells of the same schema\nposition, and (iii) cells linked to the same page topic. We further devise a\nsupervised multi-task training objective for jointly predicting column type and\npairwise column relation, as well as a table cell recovery objective for\npre-training. Experiments on real Web table datasets demonstrate our method can\noutperform competitive baselines by +4.8% of F1 for column type prediction and\nby +4.1% of F1 for pairwise column relation prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 02:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

This paper aims to shed light\non the mechanisms by which electricity consumption patterns exhibit variability\nand the different constraints that may affect demand-response (DR) flexibility.\nWe systematically evaluate the relationship between daily time-of-use patterns\nand their variability to external and internal influencing factors, including\ntime scales of interest, meteorological conditions, and household\ncharacteristics by application of an improved version of the adaptive K-means\nclustering method to profile \"household-days\" of a summer peaking utility.

The top three consumption patterns represent approximately 50%\nof usage on the highest temperature days. The variability in summer load shapes\nacross customers can be explained by the responsiveness of the households to\noutside temperature.

Any show of periodic or\nchaotic solution is many a time perceived as a shortcoming of the corresponding\ngame dynamic because (Nash) equilibrium play is supposed to be robust and\npersistent behaviour, and any other behaviour in nature is deemed transient.\nConsequently, there is a lack of attempt to connect the non-fixed point\nsolutions with the game theoretic concepts. Here we provide a way to render\ngame theoretic meaning to periodic solutions. To this end, we consider a\nreplicator map that models Darwinian selection mechanism in unstructured\ninfinite-sized population whose individuals reproduce asexually forming\nnon-overlapping generations. This is one of the simplest evolutionary game\ndynamic that exhibits periodic solutions giving way to chaotic solutions (as\nparameters related to reproductive fitness change) and also obeys the folk\ntheorems connecting fixed point solutions with Nash equilibrium. Interestingly,\nwe find that a modified Darwinian fitness -- termed heterogeneity payoff -- in\nthe corresponding population game must be put forward as (conventional) fitness\ntimes the probability that two arbitrarily chosen individuals of the population\nadopt two different strategies. The evolutionary dynamics proceeds as if the\nindividuals optimize the heterogeneity payoff to reach an evolutionarily stable\norbit, should it exist. We rigorously prove that a locally asymptotically\nstable period orbit must be heterogeneity stable orbit -- a generalization of\nevolutionarily stable state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Ensuring that medical HI systems'\ndecision-making is ethical is key. The use of Team Design Patterns (TDPs) can\nadvance this goal by describing successful and reusable configurations of\ndesign problems in which decisions have a moral component, as well as through\nfacilitating communication in multidisciplinary teams designing HI systems. For\nthis research, TDPs were developed to describe a set of solutions for two\ndesign problems in a medical HI system: (1) mitigating harmful biases in\nmachine learning algorithms and (2) sharing health and behavioral patient data\nwith healthcare professionals and system developers. The Socio-Cognitive\nEngineering methodology was employed, integrating operational demands, human\nfactors knowledge, and a technological analysis into a set of TDPs. A survey\nwas created to assess the usability of the patterns on their understandability,\neffectiveness, and generalizability. The results showed that TDPs are a useful\nmethod to unambiguously describe solutions for diverse HI design problems with\na moral component on varying abstraction levels, that are usable by a\nheterogeneous group of multidisciplinary researchers. Additionally, results\nindicated that the SCE approach and the developed questionnaire are suitable\nmethods for creating and assessing TDPs. The study concludes with a set of\nproposed improvements to TDPs, including their integration with Interaction\nDesign Patterns, the inclusion of several additional concepts, and a number of\nmethodological improvements. Finally, the thesis recommends directions for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 17:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

While this\nprovides an important opportunity for improving clinical decision-making, the\nlack of interpretability is a major barrier to the incorporation of these\nblack-box models in routine care, limiting their trustworthiness and preventing\nfurther hypothesis-testing investigations. In this study, we propose two\nmethods, namely, model distillation and variable selection, to untangle hidden\npatterns learned by an established deep learning model (BEHRT) for risk\nassociation identification. Due to the clinical importance and diversity of\nheart failure as a phenotype, it was used to showcase the merits of the\nproposed methods. A cohort with 788,880 (8.3% incident heart failure) patients\nwas considered for the study. Model distillation identified 598 and 379\ndiseases that were associated and dissociated with heart failure at the\npopulation level, respectively. While the associations were broadly consistent\nwith prior knowledge, our method also highlighted several less appreciated\nlinks that are worth further investigation. In addition to these important\npopulation-level insights, we developed an approach to individual-level\ninterpretation to take account of varying manifestation of heart failure in\nclinical practice. This was achieved through variable selection by detecting a\nminimal set of encounters that can maximally preserve the accuracy of\nprediction for individuals. Our proposed work provides a discovery-enabling\ntool to identify risk factors in both population and individual levels from a\ndata-driven perspective.
