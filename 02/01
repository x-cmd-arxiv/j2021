The\nfirst model is novel in the sense that it is divided into two phases: the first\nphase obtains a crude estimate of the optical flow and then the second phase\nrefines this estimate using additional constraints. The correctness of this\nmodel is proved using an evolutionary PDE approach. The second model achieves\nthe same refinement as the first model, but in a standard manner, using a\nsingle functional. A special feature of our models is that they permit us to\nprovide efficient numerical implementations through the first-order primal-dual\nChambolle-Pock scheme.

The simple and intuitive\nnotion of Kelly-strategyproofness has turned out to be particularly compelling\nbecause it is weak enough to still allow for positive results. For example, the\nPareto rule is strategyproof even when preferences are weak, and a number of\nattractive SCFs (such as the top cycle, the uncovered set, and the essential\nset) are strategyproof for strict preferences.

In this paper, a fully automatic change-detection algorithm on\nVHR RS images is proposed that deploys Fully Convolutional Siamese Concatenate\nnetworks (FC-Siam-Conc).

GA helps the network to\nhandle feature maps like biological visual systems. Since the GA parameters\ncannot be adjusted during network training, an attention gate layer is\nintroduced to play the role of GA with parameters that can be tuned among other\nnetwork parameters.

Knowing which\nplanning strategies would work best for people in different situations would be\nvery useful for understanding and improving human decision-making. But our\nability to compute those strategies used to be limited to very small and very\nsimple planning tasks. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we introduce\na cognitively-inspired reinforcement learning method that can overcome this\nlimitation by exploiting the hierarchical structure of human behavior. The\nbasic idea is to decompose sequential decision problems into two sub-problems:\nsetting a goal and planning how to achieve it. This hierarchical decomposition\nenables us to discover optimal strategies for human planning in larger and more\ncomplex tasks than was previously possible. The discovered strategies\noutperform existing planning algorithms and achieve a super-human level of\ncomputational efficiency. We demonstrate that teaching people to use those\nstrategies significantly improves their performance in sequential\ndecision-making tasks that require planning up to eight steps ahead. By\ncontrast, none of the previous approaches was able to improve human performance\non these problems. These findings suggest that our cognitively-informed\napproach makes it possible to leverage reinforcement learning to improve human\ndecision-making in complex sequential decision-problems.

Existing retrospective correction techniques that\ncorrect for diffusion gradient induced eddy currents do not account for eddy\ncurrent decay, which is generally effective for traditional Pulsed Gradient\nSpin Echo (PGSE) diffusion encoding. However, these techniques do not\nnecessarily apply to advanced forms of dMRI that require substantial gradient\nslewing, such as Oscillating Gradient Spin Echo (OGSE).\n  Methods: An in-house algorithm (TVEDDY), that for the first time\nretrospectively models eddy current decay, was tested on PGSE and OGSE brain\nimages acquired at 7T. Correction performance was compared to conventional\ncorrection methods by evaluating the mean-squared error (MSE) between\ndiffusion-weighted images acquired with opposite polarity diffusion gradients.\nAs a ground truth comparison, images were corrected using field dynamics up to\nthird order in space measured using a field monitoring system.\n  Results: Time-varying eddy currents were observed for OGSE, which introduced\nblurring that was not reduced using the traditional approach but was diminished\nconsiderably with TVEDDY and model-based reconstruction. No MSE difference was\nobserved between the conventional approach and TVEDDY for PGSE, but for OGSE\nTVEDDY resulted in significantly lower MSE than the conventional approach. The\nfield-monitoring-informed model-based reconstruction had the lowest MSE for\nboth PGSE and OGSE.\n  Conclusion: This work establishes that it is possible to estimate\ntime-varying eddy currents from the diffusion data itself, which provides\nsubstantial image quality improvements for gradient-intensive dMRI acquisitions\nlike OGSE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 20:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 21:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

However, it is often difficult to\nobtain a sufficient amount of coherent drug response data from patients\ndirectly for training a generalized machine learning model. Although the\nutilization of rich cell line data provides an alternative solution, it is\nchallenging to transfer the knowledge obtained from cell lines to patients due\nto various confounding factors. Few existing transfer learning methods can\nreliably disentangle common intrinsic biological signals from confounding\nfactors in the cell line and patient data. In this paper, we develop a Coherent\nDeconfounding Autoencoder (CODE-AE) that can extract both common biological\nsignals shared by incoherent samples and private representations unique to each\ndata set, transfer knowledge learned from cell line data to tissue data, and\nseparate confounding factors from them. Extensive studies on multiple data sets\ndemonstrate that CODE-AE significantly improves the accuracy and robustness\nover state-of-the-art methods in both predicting patient drug response and\nde-confounding biological signals. Thus, CODE-AE provides a useful framework to\ntake advantage of in vitro omics data for developing generalized patient\npredictive models.

We\ncalculate the deflection angle of light ray moving in a general spherically\nsymmetric metric in the presence of medium with the spherically symmetric\nrefractive index. The equation for the radius of circular light orbits is also\nderived. We discuss in detail the properties of these results and various\nspecial cases.

A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4\\%\nincrease in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse\nfunction data could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded\nHSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time\nGaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean\nabsolute error of $10.4\\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with\nsimilar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are\npotentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data\nmodels for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the\nneural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively\nidentify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent\ntreatment options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 00:25:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 23:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 11:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

Such algorithms can\nsignificantly benefit from theories of mind and learning in other disciplines.\nThis paper entertains the idea that theories such as language of thought\nhypothesis (LOTH), script theory, and Piaget's cognitive development theory\nprovide complementary approaches, which will enrich the RL field. Following\nthis line of thinking, a general computational building block is proposed for\nPiaget's schema theory that supports the notions of productivity,\nsystematicity, and inferential coherence as described by Fodor in contrast with\nthe connectionism theory. Abstraction in the proposed method is completely upon\nthe system itself and is not externally constrained by any predefined\narchitecture. The whole process matches the Neisser's perceptual cycle model.\nPerformed experiments on three typical control problems followed by behavioral\nanalysis confirm the interpretability of the proposed method and its\ncompetitiveness compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Hence, the\nproposed framework can be viewed as a step towards achieving human-like\ncognition in artificial intelligent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 00:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

These factors usually exhibit spatial and temporal correlations and\nthus make the performance of large-scale networks environment-dependent (i.e.,\ndependent on network topology, locations of the blockages, etc.). The\ncorrelation can be exploited in protocol designs (e.g., spectrum-, load-,\nlocation-, energy-aware resource allocations) to provide efficient wireless\nservices. For this, accurate system-level performance characterization and\nevaluation with spatio-temporal correlation are required. In this context,\nstochastic geometry models and random graph techniques have been used to\ndevelop analytical frameworks to capture the spatio-temporal interference\ncorrelation in large-scale wireless networks. The objective of this article is\nto provide a tutorial on the stochastic geometry analysis of large-scale\nwireless networks that captures the spatio-temporal interference correlation\n(and hence the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) correlation). We first\ndiscuss the importance of spatio-temporal performance analysis, different\nparameters affecting the spatio-temporal correlation in the SIR, and the\ndifferent performance metrics for spatio-temporal analysis. Then we describe\nthe methodologies to characterize spatio-temporal SIR correlations for\ndifferent network configurations (independent, attractive, repulsive\nconfigurations), shadowing scenarios, user locations, queueing behavior,\nrelaying, retransmission, and mobility. We conclude by outlining future\nresearch directions in the context of spatio-temporal analysis of emerging\nwireless communications scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 01:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

Our PET system, named multiple-isotope PET (MI-PET), can distinguish\nbetween different tracer nuclides using coincidence measurement of prompt\ngamma-rays, which are emitted after positron emission. In MI-PET imaging with a\npure positron emitter and prompt-gamma emitter, because of the imperfectness of\nprompt gamma-ray detection, an image for a pure positron emitter taken by\nMI-PET is superposed by a positron-{\\gamma} emitter. Therefore, in order to\nmake isolated images of the pure positron emitter, we developed image\nreconstruction methods based on data subtraction specific to MI-PET. We tested\ntwo methods, subtraction between reconstructed images and subtraction between\nsinogram data. In both methods, normalization for position dependence of the\nprompt {\\gamma}-ray sensitivity is required in addition to detector sensitivity\nnormalization. For these normalizations, we performed normalization scans using\ncylindrical phantoms of the positron-gamma emitters Sc-44m and Na-22. A long\nperiod measurement using the activity decay of Sc-44m (Half-life 58.6 hours)\nelucidated that the acquisition ratio between the prompt gamma-rays coincided\nwith PET event and pure PET event changes on the basis of object activities.\nTherefore, we developed a correction method that involves subtraction\nparameters dependent on the activities, i.e., the counting rate. From analysis\nof dual-tracer phantom images, data subtraction in the sinogram data with\nsensitivity correction gives a higher quality of isolated images for the pure\npositron emitter than those from image subtractions.

It is difficult\nfor these models to accurately describe spatiotemporal deduction processes,\nsuch as microgrid CPS attack identification, risk propagation, safety\nassessment, defense control, and cascading failure. To address this problem, a\nmodeling method for the coupling relations of microgrid CPS driven by hybrid\nspatiotemporal events is proposed in the present work. First, according to the\ntopological correlation and coupling logic of the microgrid CPS, the cyclical\nconversion mechanism of information flow and energy flow is analyzed, and a\nmicrogrid CPS architecture with multi-agents as the core is constructed. Next,\nthe spatiotemporal evolution characteristic of the CPS is described by hybrid\nautomata, and the task coordination mechanism of the multi-agent CPS terminal\nis designed. On this basis, a discrete-continuous correlation and terminal\nstructure characteristic representation method of the CPS based on\nheterogeneous multi-groups are then proposed. Finally, four spatiotemporal\nevents, namely state perception, network communication, intelligent\ndecision-making, and action control, are defined. Considering the constraints\nof the temporal conversion of information flow and energy flow, a microgrid CPS\ncoupling model is established, the effectiveness of which is verified by\nsimulating false data injection attack (FDIA) scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 03:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

However, existing explainable RS\nusually consider explanation as a side output of the recommendation model,\nwhich has two problems: (1) it is difficult to evaluate the produced\nexplanations because they are usually model-dependent, and (2) as a result, how\nthe explanations impact the recommendation performance is less investigated.\n  In this paper, explaining recommendations is formulated as a ranking task,\nand learned from data, similar to item ranking for recommendation. This makes\nit possible for standard evaluation of explanations via ranking metrics (e.g.,\nNDCG). Furthermore, this paper extends traditional item ranking to an\nitem-explanation joint-ranking formalization to study if purposely selecting\nexplanations could reach certain learning goals, e.g., improving recommendation\nperformance. A great challenge, however, is that the sparsity issue in the\nuser-item-explanation data would be inevitably severer than that in traditional\nuser-item interaction data, since not every user-item pair can be associated\nwith all explanations. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes to perform\ntwo sets of matrix factorization by considering the ternary relationship as two\ngroups of binary relationships.

The variance of the density field,\n$\\sigma^2_{\\rho/\\rho_0}$, is of particular interest for molecular clouds (MCs),\nthe birthplaces of stars in the Universe. The density variance may be used to\ninfer underlying physical processes in an MC, and parameterises the star\nformation (SF) rate of a cloud.

Nonnegative supermartingales (NSMs) are a workhorse of sequential\ninference, but we prove that they are powerless for this problem. First,\nutilizing a geometric concept called fork-convexity (a sequential analog of\nconvexity), we show that any process that is an NSM under a set of\ndistributions, is also necessarily an NSM under their \"fork-convex hull\".\nSecond, we demonstrate that the fork-convex hull of the exchangeable null\nconsists of all possible laws over binary sequences; this implies that any NSM\nunder exchangeability is necessarily nonincreasing, hence always yields a\npowerless test for any alternative. Since testing arbitrary deviations from\nexchangeability is information theoretically impossible, we focus on Markovian\nalternatives. We combine ideas from universal inference and the method of\nmixtures to derive a \"safe e-process\", which is a nonnegative process with\nexpectation at most one under the null at any stopping time, and is upper\nbounded by a martingale, but is not itself an NSM.

To compute the HR for explanatory\nvariables from the XGBoost model, the SHAP values were exponentiated and the\nratio of the means over the two subgroups calculated.

The majority of existing robotic solutions for steel bridge\ninspection requires human intervention to assist in the control and navigation.\nIn this paper, a control and navigation framework has been proposed for the\nsteel bridge inspection robot developed by the Advanced Robotics and Automation\n(ARA)to facilitate autonomous real-time navigation and minimize human\nintervention. The ARA robot is designed to work in two modes: mobile and\ninch-worm. The robot uses mobile mode when moving on a plane surface and\ninch-worm mode when jumping from one surface to the other. To allow the ARA\nrobot to switch between mobile and inch-worm modes, a switching controller is\ndeveloped with 3D point cloud data based. The surface detection algorithm is\nproposed to allow the robot to check the availability of steel surfaces (plane,\narea, and height) to determine the transformation from mobile mode to inch-worm\none. To have the robot safely navigate and visit all steel members of the\nbridge, four algorithms are developed to process the data from a depth camera,\nsegment it into clusters, estimate the boundaries, construct a graph\nrepresenting the structure, generate the shortest inspection path with any\nstarting and ending points, and determine available robot configuration for\npath planning. Experiments on steel bridge structures setup highlight the\neffective performance of the algorithms, and the potential to apply to the ARA\nrobot to run on real bridge structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 05:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

To meet the high bandwidth and stringent playback demand, one\nfeasible solution is to cache video contents on edge servers based on predicted\nvideo popularity. Traditional caching algorithms (e.g., LRU, LFU) are too\nsimple to capture the dynamics of video popularity, especially long-tailed\nvideos. Recent learning-driven caching algorithms (e.g., DeepCache) show\npromising performance, however, such black-box approaches are lack of\nexplainability and interpretability. Moreover, the parameter tuning requires a\nlarge number of historical records, which are difficult to obtain for videos\nwith low popularity. In this paper, we optimize video caching at the edge using\na white-box approach, which is highly efficient and also completely\nexplainable. To accurately capture the evolution of video popularity, we\ndevelop a mathematical model called \\emph{HRS} model, which is the combination\nof multiple point processes, including Hawkes' self-exciting, reactive and\nself-correcting processes. The key advantage of the HRS model is its\nexplainability, and much less number of model parameters. In addition, all its\nmodel parameters can be learned automatically through maximizing the\nLog-likelihood function constructed by past video request events. Next, we\nfurther design an online HRS-based video caching algorithm. To verify its\neffectiveness, we conduct a series of experiments using real video traces\ncollected from Tencent Video, one of the largest online video providers in\nChina.

How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the\nfocus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt\nan activation function, e.g. $\\operatorname{sigmoid}(\\cdot)$ or\n$\\operatorname{tanh}(\\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate\ndiscrete values. However, this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck\ninto the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We\ncall this problem \"Dead Bits Problem~(DBP)\". Besides, the existing quantization\nloss will aggravate DBP as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but\neffective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to\nalleviate DBP. Moreover, we devise an error-aware quantization loss to further\nalleviate DBP. It avoids the negative effect of quantization loss based on the\nsimilarity between two images.

The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels\nfor supervising the training of a new network. Recent studies\n\\citep{muller2019does,yuan2020revisiting} revealed an intriguing property of\nthe soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the\nstudent network. From the perspective of statistical learning, regularization\naims to reduce the variance, however how bias and variance change is not clear\nfor training with soft labels. In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance\ntradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels. Specifically, we observe\nthat during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further,\nunder the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the\ndistillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some\nspecific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples\nlead to bias increasing and variance decreasing. Nevertheless, we empirically\nfind that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates\ndistillation performance. Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel\nweighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise\nbias-variance tradeoff. Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate\nthe effectiveness of our method.

Meanwhile, there have emerged\nsome deep learning-based text editing algorithms which alter the textual\ninformation of an image . In this work, we present a document forgery algorithm\nto edit practical document images. To achieve this goal, the limitations of\nexisting text editing algorithms towards complicated characters and complex\nbackground are addressed by a set of network design strategies. First, the\nunnecessary confusion in the supervision data is avoided by disentangling the\ntextual and background information in the source images. Second, to capture the\nstructure of some complicated components, the text skeleton is provided as\nauxiliary information and the continuity in texture is considered explicitly in\nthe loss function. Third, the forgery traces induced by the text editing\noperation are mitigated by some post-processing operations which consider the\ndistortions from the print-and-scan channel. Quantitative comparisons of the\nproposed method and the exiting approach have shown the advantages of our\ndesign by reducing the about 2/3 reconstruction error measured in MSE,\nimproving reconstruction quality measured in PSNR and in SSIM by 4 dB and 0.21,\nrespectively. Qualitative experiments have confirmed that the reconstruction\nresults of the proposed method are visually better than the existing approach.\nMore importantly, we have demonstrated the performance of the proposed document\nforgery algorithm under a practical scenario where an attacker is able to alter\nthe textual information in an identity document using only one sample in the\ntarget domain. The forged-and-recaptured samples created by the proposed text\nediting attack and recapturing operation have successfully fooled some existing\ndocument authentication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 06:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

The initial impression\ndriven by our experimental results suggests that data heterogeneity is the\ndominant factor in the effectiveness of attacks and it may be a redemption for\ndefending against backdooring as it makes the attack less efficient, more\nchallenging to design effective attack strategies, and the attack result also\nbecomes less predictable.

More importantly,data heterogeneity may result in overfitting at the\nlocal training of benign clients, which can be utilized by attackers to\ndisguise themselves and fool skewed-feature based defenses. In addition,\neffective attack strategies can be made by adjusting attack data distribution.\nFinally, we discuss the potential directions of defending the curses brought by\ndata heterogeneity.

The tendency is to move from traditional buyer-seller markets\nto subscription-based on-demand \"smart\" matching platforms enabled by pervasive\nICTs. The driving force behind this lies in the fact that assets, which were\nscarce in the past, are readily abundant, approaching a regime of zero marginal\ncosts. This is also becoming a reality in electrified energy systems due to the\nsubstantial growth of distributed renewable energy sources such as solar and\nwind; the increasing number of small-scale storage units such as batteries and\nheat pumps; and the availability of flexible loads that enable demand-side\nmanagement. In this context, this article proposes a system architecture based\non a logical (cyber) association of spatially distributed (physical) elements\nas an approach to build a virtual microgrid operated as a software-defined\nenergy network (SDEN) that is enabled by packetized energy management. The\nproposed cyber-physical system presumes that electrical energy is shared among\nits members and that the energy sharing is enabled in the cyber domain by\nhandshakes inspired by resource allocation methods utilized in computer\nnetworks, wireless communications, and peer-to-peer Internet applications\n(e.g., BitTorrent). The proposal has twofold benefits: (i) reducing the\ncomplexity of current market-based solutions by removing unnecessary and costly\nmediations and (ii) guaranteeing energy access to all virtual microgrid members\naccording to their individual needs. This article concludes that the proposed\nsolution generally complies with the existing regulations but has highly\ndisruptive potential to organize a dominantly electrified energy system in the\nmid- to long-term, being a technical counterpart to the recently developed\nsocial-oriented microgrid proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 06:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 02:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

In this paper, we propose a novel rank learning\nguided no-reference quality assessment method for UIE. Our approach, termed\nTwice Mixing, is motivated by the observation that a mid-quality image can be\ngenerated by mixing a high-quality image with its low-quality version. Typical\nmixup algorithms linearly interpolate a given pair of input data. However, the\nhuman visual system is non-uniformity and non-linear in processing images.\nTherefore, instead of directly training a deep neural network based on the\nmixed images and their absolute scores calculated by linear combinations, we\npropose to train a Siamese Network to learn their quality rankings. Twice\nMixing is trained based on an elaborately formulated self-supervision\nmechanism. Specifically, before each iteration, we randomly generate two mixing\nratios which will be employed for both generating virtual images and guiding\nthe network training. In the test phase, a single branch of the network is\nextracted to predict the quality rankings of different UIE outputs. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach outperforms the previous methods\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 07:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Using newly digitized census-based\nhistorical statistics, we find evidence that men had a stronger bargaining\nposition in the marriage market and intra-household fertility decisions than\nwomen. Under relative male scarcity, while people, especially younger people,\nwere more likely to marry and divorce, widowed women were less likely to\nremarry than widowed men. We also find that women's bargaining position in the\nmarriage market might not have improved throughout the 1950s. Given the\ninstitutional changes in the abortion law after the war, marital fertility and\nstillbirth rates increased in the areas that suffered relative male scarcity.\nOur result on out-of-wedlock births indicates that the theoretical prediction\nof intra-household bargaining is considered to be robust in an economy in which\nmarital fertility is dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 08:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

This phase was followed by a change to a state with even\nlower average X-ray fluxes never seen before during the outburst but presenting\nrenewed flaring activity at different wavelengths. Nevertheless, the mean\nfluxes were still in decline. GRS 1915+105 has the longest orbital period known\namong low-mass X-ray binaries, the largest accretion disk size, and therefore\nthe largest mass supply for accretion. The high inclination of the disk allows\nthe study of geometrical effects of the accretion flow such as changes in the\nheight-to-radius ratio or the effect of accretion disk winds on the intrinsic\nemission that are expected during the outburst decay. In addition, the\ntransient jet is expected to change to a compact, self-absorbed, steady jet. We\nconducted two full polarization Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations to\nstudy the jet properties during the outburst decay by analyzing the spectral,\npolarization, and intra-epoch variability for both observation epochs.

Here we study this problem under an idealized model, where\nit is assumed that agents can sense the general tendency in the system. More\nspecifically, we consider $n$ agents, each being associated with a real-valued\nnumber. In each round, each agent receives a noisy measurement of the average\nvalue, and then updates its value, which is in turn perturbed by random drift.\nWe assume that both noises in measurements and drift follow Gaussian\ndistributions. What should be the updating policy of agents if their goal is to\nminimize the expected deviation of the agents' values from the average value?\nWe prove that a distributed weighted-average algorithm optimally minimizes this\ndeviation for each agent, and for any round. Interestingly, this optimality\nholds even in the centralized setting, where a master agent can gather all the\nagents' measurements and instruct a move to each agent.We find this result\nsurprising since it can be shown that the total measurements obtained by all\nagents contain strictly more information about the deviation of Agent $i$ from\nthe average value, than the information contained in the measurements obtained\nby Agent $i$ alone. Although this information is relevant for Agent $i$, it is\nnot processed by it when running a weighted-average algorithm. Nevertheless,\nthe weighted-average algorithm is optimal, since by running it, other agents\nmanage to fully process this information in a way that perfectly benefits Agent\n$i$.Finally, we also analyze the drift of the center of mass and show that no\ndistributed algorithm can achieve drift that is as small as the one that can be\nachieved by the best centralized algorithm. In light of this, we also show that\nthe drift associated with our weighted-average algorithm incurs a relatively\nsmall overhead over the best possible drift in the centralized setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 09:13:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 13:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 15:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Accordingly, estimation of entropy rate, an\ninformation-theoretic measure of information content, assumes primary\nsignificance. However, such estimation in the present context is challenging\nbecause, while entropy rate is traditionally defined asymptotically for long\nblocks under the assumption of stationarity, neurons are known to encode\ninformation in short intervals and the associated spike trains often exhibit\nnonstationarity. Against this backdrop, we propose an entropy rate estimator\nbased on empirical probabilities that operates within windows, short enough to\nensure approximate stationarity.

In an example Markov process, we compared\nthe performance of the proposed method with that of versions of the Lempel-Ziv\nalgorithm as well as with that of a certain stationary distribution method and\nfound the former to exhibit higher accuracy levels and faster convergence.\nAlso, in experimentally recorded calcium responses of four hippocampal neurons,\nthe proposed method showed faster convergence. Significantly, our technique\ndetected structural heterogeneity in the underlying process memory in the\nresponses of the aforementioned neurons. We believe that the proposed method\nfacilitates large-scale studies of such heterogeneity, which could in turn\nidentify signatures of various diseases in terms of entropy rate estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 09:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

The continuous interaction between these different magnetic patches\nleads to transient brightenings or bursts that might contribute to the heating\nof the solar atmosphere. However, it remains unclear whether such transients,\nwhich are mostly observed in the EUV, play a significant role in atmospheric\nheating. We revisit the open question of these bursts as a prelude to the new\nhigh-resolution EUV imagery expected from the recently launched Solar Orbiter.\nWe use EUV images recorded by the SDO/AIA to investigate statistical properties\nof the bursts. We detect the bursts in the 171 {\\AA} filter images of AIA in an\nautomated way through a pixel-wise analysis by imposing different intensity\nthresholds. By exploiting the high cadence (12 s) of the AIA observations, we\nfind that the distribution of lifetimes of these events peaks at about 120 s.\nThe sizes of the detected bursts are limited by the spatial resolution, which\nindicates that a larger number of events might be hidden in the AIA data. We\nestimate that about 100 new bursts appear per second on the whole Sun. The\ndetected bursts have nanoflare-like energies of $10^{24}$\\,erg per event. Based\non this, we estimate that at least 100 times more events of a similar nature\nwould be required to account for the energy that is required to heat the\ncorona. When AIA observations are considered alone, the EUV bursts discussed\nhere therefore play no significant role in the coronal heating of the quiet\nSun. If the coronal heating of the quiet Sun is mainly bursty, then the\nhigh-resolution EUV observations from Solar Orbiter may be able to reduce the\ndeficit in the number of EUV bursts seen with SDO/AIA at least partly by\ndetecting more such events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 09:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 10:39:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 08:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

The efficiency is achieved through two novel\nfeatures: using the recently introduced orthonormal spline bases, the so-called\n{\\it splinets} and accounting for the spline support sets in the proposed\nspline object representation. The recently-introduced orthogonal splinets are\nevaluated by {\\it dyadic orthogonalization} of the $B$-splines. The package is\nbuilt around the {\\it Splinets}-object that represents a collection of splines.\nIt treats splines as mathematical functions and contains information about the\nsupport sets and the values of the derivatives at the knots that uniquely\ndefine these functions. Algebra and calculus of splines utilize the Taylor\nexpansions at the knots within the support sets. Several orthonormalization\nprocedures of the $B$-splines are implemented including the recommended dyadic\nmethod leading to the splinets. The method bases on a dyadic algorithm that can\nbe also viewed as the efficient method of diagonalizing a band matrix. The\nlocality of the $B$-splines in terms of the support sets is, to a great extend,\npreserved in the corresponding splinet. This together with implemented\nalgorithms utilizing locality of the supports provides a valuable computational\ntool for functional data analysis. The benefits are particularly evident when\nthe sparsity in the data plays an important role. Various diagnostic tools are\nprovided allowing to maintain the stability of the computations. Finally, the\nprojection operation to the space of splines is implemented that facilitates\nfunctional data analysis. An example of a simple functional analysis of the\ndata using the tools in the package is presented. The functionality of the\npackage extends beyond the splines to piecewise polynomial functions, although\nthe splines are its focus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 09:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

This makes it possible to utilize the\nmeasurement error mitigation framework to mitigate the errors caused by the\ngeneralized Pauli channels. We use this result to mitigate noise on the probe\nstates and recover the scaling of the noiseless probes, except with a noise\nstrength-dependent constant factor. This method of modeling Pauli channel as\nmeasurement noise can also be of independent interest in other NISQ tasks,\ne.g., state tomography problems, variational quantum algorithms, and other\nchannel estimation problems where Pauli measurements have the central role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 10:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 02:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

For high\nresolution 3D UST, it holds three key challenges: Firstly, its central building\nblock, the computation of the gradient for a single US measurement, has a\nrestrictively large memory footprint.

Dynamic twisting of a magnetic null point can generate a\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) within its fan plane and, under continued\ntwisting, can instigate spine-fan reconnection and an associated collapse of\nthe null point.\n  Aim: This article aims to compare the effects of isotropic and anisotropic\nviscosity in simulations of the KHI and collapse in a dynamically twisted\nmagnetic null point.\n  Methods: Simulations were performed using the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code\nLare3d with a custom anisotropic viscosity module. A pair of high resolution\nsimulations was performed, one using isotropic viscosity and another using\nanisotropic viscosity, keeping all other factors identical, and the results\nanalysed in detail.

Over all studied\nparameters, anisotropic viscosity allows a faster growing instability, while\nisotropic viscosity damps the instability to the extent of stabilisation in\nsome cases. Although the viscous heating associated with anisotropic viscosity\nis generally smaller, the ohmic heating dominates and is enhanced by the\ncurrent sheets generated by the instability, leading to a greater overall\nheating rate when using anisotropic viscosity. The collapse of the null point\noccurs significantly sooner when anisotropic viscosity is employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 10:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

It is\ndirectly based upon the coarse-graining of a well-defined molecular model, such\nthat all degrees of freedom have a clear and unambiguous molecular\ninterpretation. The considerations are based upon a free-energy functional, and\nthe dynamics is split into a conservative and a dissipative part, where the\nlatter satisfies the Onsager relations and the Second Law of thermodynamics.\nThe model is therefore fully consistent with both equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics. The derivation proceeds in two steps: Firstly,\nwe derive an extended model comprising two scalar and four vector fields, such\nthat inertial dynamics of the macromolecules and of the relative motion of the\ntwo fluids is taken into account. In the second step, we eliminate these\ninertial contributions and, as a replacement, introduce phenomenological\ndissipative terms, which can be modeled easily by taking into account the\nprinciples of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

We study\ngravito-turbulence and its associated spiral structure in thin gaseous disks\nsubject to a prescribed cooling law. We characterize the morphology, coherence,\nand propagation of the spirals and examine when the flow deviates from viscous\ndisk models. We used the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of\nself-gravitating hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas\nwas cooled over longer-than-orbital timescales to trigger the gravitational\ninstability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for various disk masses and\ncooling rates.

The dissipation of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density\nwakes, heating the disk back to a marginally stable thermal equilibrium.

Two sets of simulations with an\nincreasing spatial resolution (d$x=3.9$ pc to d$x=0.06$ pc) are used to\ninvestigate the convergence of the synthetic CO emission, which is computed by\npost-processing the simulation data with the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code.\nTo determine the excitation conditions, it is necessary to include atomic\nhydrogen and helium alongside H$_2$, which increases the resulting CO emission\nby ~7-26 per cent.

However, because these methodes include the forward model\nin the architecture, their applicability is often restricted to either\nrelatively small reconstruction problems or to problems with operators which\nare computationally cheap to compute. As a consequence, they have so far not\nbeen applied to dynamic non-Cartesian multi-coil reconstruction problems.\nMethods: In this work, we propose a CNN-architecture for image reconstruction\nof accelerated 2D radial cine MRI with multiple receiver coils. The network is\nbased on a computationally light CNN-component and a subsequent conjugate\ngradient (CG) method which can be jointly trained end-to-end using an efficient\ntraining strategy. We investigate the proposed training-strategy and compare\nour method to other well-known reconstruction techniques with learned and\nnon-learned regularization methods. Results: Our proposed method outperforms\nall other methods based on non-learned regularization. Further, it performs\nsimilar or better than a CNN-based method employing a 3D U-Net and a method\nusing adaptive dictionary learning. In addition, we empirically demonstrate\nthat even by training the network with only iteration, it is possible to\nincrease the length of the network at test time and further improve the\nresults. Conclusions: End-to-end training allows to highly reduce the number of\ntrainable parameters of and stabilize the reconstruction network. Further,\nbecause it is possible to change the length of the network at test time, the\nneed to find a compromise between the complexity of the CNN-block and the\nnumber of iterations in each CG-block becomes irrelevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 11:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

We consider the CCs at a fixed density and different temperatures where\nit remains in the FCC structure, and the diffusion timescales of particles vary\ndepending on the temperature. We choose the range of shear rates, which covers\ntimescales higher and much lower than the equilibrium diffusion timescales at\nhigh temperatures. For the considered range of shear rates and temperatures,\nboth the macro and microscopic responses of CCs to the shear suggest that the\nyielding scenario remains independent of the diffusion of particles. It\ninvolves the plastic deformation of the underlying crystalline structure. The\naveraged local bond order parameters and local angle measurements demonstrate\nthe structural changes and cooperative movement of the center of masses of the\nclusters close to the yield point. A comparison with the soft-sphere (SS) FCC\ncrystal reveals the similarities in the yielding behavior of both systems.\nNonetheless, diffusion of particles influences certain features, such as a less\nprominent increase in the local bond order parameters and local angles close to\nthe yield point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 12:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

As is well-known, the\nchoice of variable ordering while computing CAD has a great effect on the time\nand memory use of the computation as well as the number of sample points\ncomputed. In this paper, we indicate that typical CAD algorithms, if executed\nwith respect to a special kind of variable orderings (called \"the perfect\nelimination orderings\"), naturally preserve chordality, which is an important\nproperty on sparsity of variables. Experimentation suggests that if the\nassociated graph of the polynomial system in question is chordal (\\emph{resp.},\nis nearly chordal), then a perfect elimination ordering of the associated graph\n(\\emph{resp.}, of a minimal chordal completion of the associated graph) can be\na good variable ordering for the CAD computation. That is, by using the perfect\nelimination orderings, the CAD computation may produce a much smaller full set\nof projection polynomials than by using other naive variable orderings. More\nimportantly, for the complexity analysis of the CAD computation via a perfect\nelimination ordering, a so-called $(m,d)$-property of the full set of\nprojection polynomials obtained via such an ordering is given, through which\nthe \"size\" of this set is characterized. This property indicates that when the\ncorresponding perfect elimination tree has a lower height, the full set of\nprojection polynomials also tends to have a smaller \"size\". This is well\nconsistent with the experimental results, hence the perfect elimination\norderings with lower elimination tree height are further recommended to be used\nin the CAD projection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 13:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 16:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

In contrast to the prior\nmethods, the continuous feedback from decoded words enables the SGN to\ndynamically update the video representation that adapts to the partially\ndecoded caption.

The\ncenter of the basic unit of the muscle, the sarcomeric M-band, is perfectly\nplaced to sense the different types of load to which the muscle is subjected.\nIn particular, the kinase domain (TK) of titin located at the M-band is a known\ncandidate for mechanical signaling. Here, we develop the quantitative\nmathematical model that describes the kinetics of TK-based mechanosensitive\nsignaling, and predicts trophic changes in response to exercise and\nrehabilitation regimes. First, we build the kinetic model for TK conformational\nchanges under force: opening, phosphorylation, signaling and autoinhibition. We\nfind that TK opens as a metastable mechanosensitive switch, which naturally\nproduces a much greater signal after high-load resistance exercise than an\nequally energetically costly endurance effort. Next, in order for the model to\nbe stable, give coherent predictions, in particular the lag following the onset\nof an exercise regime, we have to account for the associated kinetics of\nphosphate (carried by ATP), and for the non-linear dependence of protein\nsynthesis rates on muscle fibre size.

Using segments of charge voltage and current\ncurves, the pipeline engineers 30 features, performs automatic feature\nselection and calibrates the algorithms. When deployed on cells operated under\nthe fast-charging protocol, the best model achieves a root mean squared percent\nerror of 0.45\\%. This work provides insights into the design of scalable\ndata-driven models for battery SOH estimation, emphasising the value of\nconfidence bounds around the prediction. The pipeline methodology combines\nexperimental data with machine learning modelling and can be generalized to\nother critical components that require real-time estimation of SOH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 13:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

The performance of our F-RouND framework was\ncarried out with simulations using OMNET++ and SUMO simulators.

As a result, there is ambiguity left on questions such as\n\"how much data is enough?\" and how representative are the samples of the\nbroader population being studied in online social networks. In this paper, I\npropose a focused back-and-forth crawl approach and a validated seed choice\nmethod for collecting network-level data from Twitter.

However, challenges\nhave persisted in their deployment ability and effectiveness due to inherent\nstrong assumptions on traveler behavior and availability of network-level\nreal-time traffic information, and the high computational burden associated\nwith computing network-wide flows in real-time. This study proposes an\nincentive-based decentralized routing strategy to nudge the network performance\ncloser to the system optimum for the context where all vehicles are connected\nand autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The strategy consists of three stages. The\nfirst stage incorporates a decentralized local route switching dynamical system\nto approximate the system optimal route flow in a local area based on vehicles'\nknowledge of local traffic information. The second stage optimizes the route\nfor each CAV by considering individual heterogeneity in traveler preferences\n(e.g., the value of time) to maximize the utilities of all travelers in the\nlocal area. Constraints are also incorporated to ensure that these routes can\nachieve the approximated local system optimal flow of the first stage. The\nthird stage leverages an expected envy-free incentive mechanism to ensure that\ntravelers in the local area can accept the optimal routes determined in the\nsecond stage. The study analytically discusses the convergence of the local\nroute switching dynamical system. We also show that the proposed incentive\nmechanism is expected individual rational and budget-balanced, which ensures\nthat travelers are willing to participate and guarantee the balance between\npayments and compensations, respectively. Further, the conditions for the\nexpected incentive compatibility of the incentive mechanism are analyzed and\nproved, ensuring behavioral honesty in disclosing information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 14:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

With this study we shed light on\nthe generic mechanism which produces the coexistence of two different types of\nGr domains, whose proportion can be carefully controlled by tuning the H2 flow\nrate. For the first time, we show that the growth of Gr using CVD under H2/Ar\nflow rate proceeds in two stages. Firstly, the nucleation of free-standing\nepitaxial graphene on hydrogen (H-Gr) occurs, then H-atoms eventually desorb\nfrom either step edges or defects. This gives rise, for H2 flow rate below a\ncritical value, to the formation of (6x6)Gr domains on 6H-SiC(0001). The front\nof H-desorption progresses proportionally to the reduction of H2. Using a\nrobust and generic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we\nrealistically quantify the proportions of H-Gr and (6x6)Gr domains of a Gr film\nsynthetized in any experimental conditions. Scanning tunnelling microscopy\nsupports the XPS measurements. From these results we can deduce that the H-\nassisted CVD growth of Gr developed here is a unique method to grow fully\nfree-standing H-Gr on the contrary to the method consisting of H-intercalation\nbelow epitaxial Gr on buffer layer. These results are of crucial importance for\nfuture applications of Gr/SiC(0001) in nanoelectronics, providing the\ngroundwork for the use of Gr as an optimal template layer for Van der Waals\nhomo- and hetero-epitaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 15:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

For this purpose,\nthe data center assigns a subset of input datasets to each server, and each\nserver computes some coded packets on the assigned datasets, which are then\nsent to the user. The user should recover the task function from the answers of\na subset of servers, such the effect of stragglers could be tolerated. In this\npaper, we formulate a novel secure framework for this distributed linearly\nseparable computation, where we aim to let the user only retrieve the desired\ntask function without obtaining any other information about the input datasets,\neven if it receives the answers of all servers. In order to preserve the\nsecurity of the input datasets, some common randomness variable independent of\nthe datasets should be introduced into the transmission. We show that any\nnon-secure linear-coding based computing scheme for the original distributed\nlinearly separable computation problem, can be made secure without increasing\nthe communication cost.

Stable models of gravastar have been studied in\nmany of the alternative gravity theories besides standard General Relativity\n(GR). The Rastall theory of gravity is a popular alternative to GR, specially\nin the cosmological and astrophysical context. Here, we propose a stellar model\nunder the Rastall gravity following Mazur-Mottola's \\cite{Mazur2001,Mazur2004}\nconjecture. The gravastar consists of three regions, viz., ($I$) Interior\nregion, ($II$) Intermediate shell region, and ($III$) Exterior region. The\npressure within the interior core region is assumed with a constant negative\nmatter-energy density which provides a repulsive force over the entire thin\nshell region. The shell is assumed to be made up of fluid of ultrarelativistic\nplasma which follows the Zel'dovich's conjecture of stiff fluid\n\\cite{Zeldo1962,Zel'dovich1972}. It is also assumed that the pressure is\nproportional to the matter-energy density according to Zel'dovich's conjecture,\nwhich cancel the repulsive force exerted by the interior region. The exterior\nregion is completely vacuum which is described by the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nsolution. Under all these specifications we obtain a set of exact and\nsingularity-free solutions of the gravastar model presenting several physically\nvalid features within the framework of Rastall gravity. The physical properties\nof the shell region namely, the energy density, proper length, total energy and\nentropy are explored. The stability of the gravastar model is investigated\nusing the surface redshift against the shell thickness and maximizing the\nentropy of the shell within the framework of Rastall gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 07:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

A unified framework to study the coevolution of\ngrain boundaries with bulk plasticity has recently been developed by Admal et\nal. (2018), which is based on modeling grain boundaries as continuum\ndislocations governed by an energy based on the Kobayashi--Warren--Carter (KWC)\nmodel (Kobayashi et al., 1998, 2000). While the resulting unified model\ndemonstrates coupled grain boundary motion and polygonization (seen in\nrecrystallization), it is restricted to grain boundary energies of the\nRead--Shockley type, which applies only to small misorientation angles. In\naddition, the implementation of the unified model using finite elements\ninherits the computational challenges of the KWC model that originate from the\nsingular diffusive nature of its governing equations. The main goal of this\nstudy is to generalize the KWC functional to grain boundary energies beyond the\nRead--Shockley-type that respect the bicrystallography of grain boundaries.

A\ncritical challenge compared with general training is that the term and format\nof governing equations is not known as a prior. In addition, significant\nmeasurement noise and complex algorithm hyperparameter tuning usually reduces\nthe robustness of existing methods. A robust data-driven method is proposed in\nthis study for identifying the governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)\nof a given system from noisy data. The proposed method is based on the concept\nof Progressive Sparse Identification of PDEs (PSI-PDE or $\\psi$-PDE). Special\nfocus is on the handling of data with huge uncertainties (e.g., 50$\\%$ noise\nlevel). Neural Network modeling and fast Fourier transform (FFT) are\nimplemented to reduce the influence of noise in sparse regression. Following\nthis, candidate terms from the prescribed library are progressively selected\nand added to the learned PDEs, which automatically promotes parsimony with\nrespect to the number of terms in PDEs as well as their complexity. Next, the\nsignificance of each learned terms is further evaluated and the coefficients of\nPDE terms are optimized by minimizing the L2 residuals. Results of numerical\ncase studies indicate that the governing PDEs of many canonical dynamical\nsystems can be correctly identified using the proposed $\\psi$-PDE method with\nhighly noisy data. One great benefit of proposed algorithm is that it avoids\ncomplex algorithm modification and hyperparameter tuning in most existing\nmethods. Limitations of the proposed method and major findings are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 19:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

First of all,\nprinted documents are often associated with criminal activities, such as\nterrorist plans, child pornography pictures, and even fake packages.\nAdditionally, printing and scanning can be used to hide the traces of image\nmanipulation or the synthetic nature of images, since the artifacts commonly\nfound in manipulated and synthetic images are gone after the images are printed\nand scanned. A problem hindering research in this area is the lack of large\nscale reference datasets to be used for algorithm development and benchmarking.\nMotivated by this issue, we present a new dataset composed of a large number of\nsynthetic and natural printed face images. To highlight the difficulties\nassociated with the analysis of the images of the dataset, we carried out an\nextensive set of experiments comparing several printer attribution methods. We\nalso verified that state-of-the-art methods to distinguish natural and\nsynthetic face images fail when applied to print and scanned images. We\nenvision that the availability of the new dataset and the preliminary\nexperiments we carried out will motivate and facilitate further research in\nthis area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 13:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}
