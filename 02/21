In this\npaper, we introduce a self-supervised video representation learning method\nbased on the multi-transformation classification to efficiently classify human\nactions. Self-supervised learning on various transformations not only provides\nricher contextual information but also enables the visual representation more\nrobust to the transforms. The spatio-temporal representation of the video is\nlearned in a self-supervised manner by classifying seven different\ntransformations i.e. rotation, clip inversion, permutation, split, join\ntransformation, color switch, frame replacement, noise addition. First, seven\ndifferent video transformations are applied to video clips. Then the 3D\nconvolutional neural networks are utilized to extract features for clips and\nthese features are processed to classify the pseudo-labels. We use the learned\nmodels in pretext tasks as the pre-trained models and fine-tune them to\nrecognize human actions in the downstream task. We have conducted the\nexperiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets together with C3D and 3D Resnet-18 as\nbackbone networks. The experimental results have shown that our proposed\nframework is outperformed other SOTA self-supervised action recognition\napproaches.

The regulator aims\nto maximize social welfare via implementing regulations, policies, plans,\ntransit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize profit by adjusting its\nservice designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes and\nroutes. The travelers' decisions depend on the regulator and MSP's decisions\nwhile the MSP decisions themselves depend on the regulator's decisions. To\nsolve the tri-level mathematical program, the study employs Bayesian\noptimization (BO) within a simulation-optimization solution approach.

This paper\nproposes a semi-supervised graph learning method for cases when there are no\ngraphs available. This method learns a graph as a convex combination of the\nunsupervised kNN graph and a supervised label-affinity graph. The\nlabel-affinity graph directly captures all the nodes' label-affinity with the\nlabeled nodes, i.e., how likely a node has the same label as the labeled nodes.\nThis affinity measure contrasts with the kNN graph where the metric measures\ncloseness in the feature space.

These factors act in conjunction to impose the regime of laser\noperation, in particular their competition determines the appropriate laser\noperation regime. In this work a theoretical study is proposed to explore the\neffects of the competition between multiphoton absorption, plasma ionization\nand electron-hole radiative recombination processes, on the laser dynamics in\ntransparent materials with Kerr nonlinearity. The study rests on a model\nconsisting of a K-order nonlinear complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, coupled to\na first-order equation describing time variation of the electron plasma\ndensity.

To achieve\nsecure software, developers need to be aware of secure coding guidelines and\nsecure coding best practices. This work presents a platform geared towards\nsoftware developers in the industry that aims to increase awareness of secure\nsoftware development. The authors also introduce an interactive game component,\na virtual coach, which implements a simple artificial intelligence engine based\non the laddering technique for interviews. Through a survey, a preliminary\nevaluation of the implemented artifact with real-world players (from academia\nand industry) shows a positive acceptance of the developed platform.\nFurthermore, the players agree that the platform is adequate for training their\nsecure coding skills. The impact of our work is to introduce a new automatic\nchallenge evaluation method together with a virtual coach to improve existing\ncybersecurity awareness training programs.

First, a novel method for extracting\nquaternary PUF responses is proposed to increase the entropy of a PUF response,\nin which a 2-bit response is extracted from evaluating a single PUF cell\nmultiple times. The probability masses of the responses can be adjusted by\nsetting parameters appropriately. Then, a chosen secret model based fuzzy\nextractor (FE) is designed to extract secret keys from the quaternary PUF\nresponses. To improve the security of this FE, it is modeled as a wiretap\nchannel system, and wiretap polar coding is adopted to reduce secrecy leakage.\nAn upper bound of secrecy leakage is also given in this paper, and it suggests\nthat an arbitrarily small (even zero) leakage can be achieved by properly\nchoosing parameters of the quaternary PUF responses generation.

However, diagnosis of mental health disorders is a challenging\nproblem that often relies on self-reporting by patients about their behavioral\npatterns. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis of mental\nhealth problems. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a\nplethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and deep\nneural networks (DNNs) points towards a possible solution. However, disease\ndiagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, remains\na challenging problem. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep that\nutilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three\nimportant mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and\nbipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors\nintegrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited available data,\nMHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with\nsynthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the\nsynthetic dataset to pre-train the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the\nweights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both the\narchitecture and weights during the training process. We use three different\ndata partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from\n74 individuals. We conduct data instance level and patient level evaluations.\nMHDeep achieves an average test accuracy of 90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%,\nrespectively, for classifications between healthy instances and schizoaffective\ndisorder instances, major depressive disorder instances, and bipolar disorder\ninstances. At the patient level, MHDeep DNNs achieve an accuracy of 100%, 100%,\nand 90.0% for the three mental health disorders, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 20:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Discovering distinctive linguistic phenomena from data is\nnot an easy task. For instance, lexical ambiguity is a fundamental feature of\nlanguage which is challenging to learn. Even more prominently, inferring the\nmeaning of rare and unseen lexical units is difficult with neural networks.\nMeaning is often determined from context. With context, languages allow meaning\nto be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader.\nTo model this learning process, a system has to learn from a few instances in\ncontext and be able to generalize well to unseen cases. The learning process is\nhindered when training data is scarce for a task. Even with sufficient data,\nlearning patterns for the long tail of the lexical distribution is challenging.\nIn this thesis, we focus on understanding certain potentials of contexts in\nneural models and design augmentation models to benefit from them. We focus on\nmachine translation as an important instance of the more general language\nunderstanding problem. To translate from a source language to a target\nlanguage, a neural model has to understand the meaning of constituents in the\nprovided context and generate constituents with the same meanings in the target\nlanguage. This task accentuates the value of capturing nuances of language and\nthe necessity of generalization from few observations. The main problem we\nstudy in this thesis is what neural machine translation models learn from data\nand how we can devise more focused contexts to enhance this learning. Looking\nmore in-depth into the role of context and the impact of data on learning\nmodels is essential to advance the NLP field. Moreover, it helps highlight the\nvulnerabilities of current neural networks and provides insights into designing\nmore robust models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 20:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Here we present a\nmathematical theory of co-evolution between immune systems and viruses in a\nfinite-dimensional antigenic space, which describes the cross-reactivity of\nviral strains and immune systems primed by previous infections.

The effect of the length of delay differentially affected\nperformance on the focal, non-focal, and time-based tasks and was proportional\nto the PM cue focality (i.e., semantic relationship with the intended action).\nThis study also highlighted methodological considerations such as the\ndifferentiation between functioning and ability, distinction of cue attributes,\nand the necessity of ecological validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 21:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Despite the\ngeneralization power of the meta-model, it remains elusive that how adversarial\nrobustness can be maintained by MAML in few-shot learning. In addition to\ngeneralization, robustness is also desired for a meta-model to defend\nadversarial examples (attacks). Toward promoting adversarial robustness in\nMAML, we first study WHEN a robustness-promoting regularization should be\nincorporated, given the fact that MAML adopts a bi-level (fine-tuning vs.\nmeta-update) learning procedure. We show that robustifying the meta-update\nstage is sufficient to make robustness adapted to the task-specific fine-tuning\nstage even if the latter uses a standard training protocol.

Skyrmions can be\nset into motion under various types of driving, and the combination of their\nsize, stability, and dynamics makes them ideal candidates for numerous\napplications. Skyrmions represent a new class of system in which the energy\nscales of the skyrmion-skyrmion interactions, sample disorder, temperature, and\ndrive can compete.

Methods such\nas $n:m$ phase locking value and bi-phase locking value have previously been\nproposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. $f$,\n$2f/3$) and across three frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_1+f_2$),\nrespectively.

To address the gap, this paper\nproposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for\nthe quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase\ncoupling.

This has been shown for several special cases: $k=2$,\n$(k+1)$-point metrics, $(k+2)$-point metrics, the line metric, weighted star\nmetrics, and $k=3$ in the Manhattan plane.\n  The known proofs of these results are based on potential functions tied to\neach particular special case, thus requiring six different potential functions\nfor the six cases.

Our goal is to address this question within a\ncausal inference framework in the context of time series data. A key challenge\nis that causal inference methods require the overlap assumption to hold: each\nunit (i.e., a day) must have a positive probability of receiving the treatment\n(i.e., issuing a heat alert on that day). In our motivating example, the\noverlap assumption is often violated: the probability of issuing a heat alert\non a cooler day is zero. To overcome this challenge, we propose a stochastic\nintervention for time series data which is implemented via an incremental\ntime-varying propensity score (ItvPS). The ItvPS intervention is executed by\nmultiplying the probability of issuing a heat alert on day $t$ -- conditional\non past information up to day $t$ -- by an odds ratio $\\delta_t$. First, we\nintroduce a new class of causal estimands that relies on the ItvPS\nintervention. We provide theoretical results to show that these causal\nestimands can be identified and estimated under a weaker version of the overlap\nassumption.

Recent predictor-based NAS approaches attempt to alleviate such\nheavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some\narchitecture-performance pairs and fitting a proxy accuracy predictor. Given\nlimited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top\narchitectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This\npaper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find\nthe best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We\npropose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one\nstrong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the\nhigh-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key\nproperty of the weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling better\narchitectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed\narchitectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new\nbetter weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework, dubbed WeakNAS,\nproduces coarse-to-fine iteration to gradually refine the ranking of sampling\nspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WeakNAS costs fewer samples to\nfind top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201.

By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration\nratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and\nrelaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched\nmicellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR\ndiffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the\nmechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low\nsalt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are\nlinear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared\ndisplacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 ~ Tdiff 0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion\ntime. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 ~\nTdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in\nbranched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of\ndifferentiating various types of micellar microstructure. In addition, the\nself-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched\nmicelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing to the existing\nrestricted diffusion models, and shown to be much slower than the diffusion of\nproton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched\nwormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is\nthrough the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour\nlength of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second\nviscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination\nof micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 02:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Such shape\nmodels are expected to represent consistent anatomical features across the\npopulation for population-specific shape statistics. Early approaches for\ncorrespondence placement rely on nearest neighbor search for simpler anatomies.\nCoordinate transformations for shape correspondence hold promise to address the\nincreasing anatomical complexities. Nonetheless, due to the inherent\nshape-level geometric complexity and population-level shape variation, the\ncoordinate-wise correspondence often does not translate to the anatomical\ncorrespondence. An alternative, group-wise approach for correspondence\nplacement explicitly models the trade-off between geometric description and the\npopulation's statistical compactness. However, these models achieve limited\nsuccess in resolving nonlinear shape correspondence. Recent works have\naddressed this limitation by adopting an application-specific notion of\ncorrespondence through lifting positional data to a higher dimensional feature\nspace. However, they heavily rely on manual expertise to create domain-specific\nfeatures and consistent landmarks. This paper proposes an automated feature\nlearning approach, using deep convolutional neural networks to extract\ncorrespondence-friendly features from shape ensembles. Further, an unsupervised\ndomain adaptation scheme is introduced to augment the pretrained geometric\nfeatures with new anatomies. Results on anatomical datasets of human scapula,\nfemur, and pelvis bones demonstrate that features learned in supervised fashion\nshow improved performance for correspondence estimation compared to the manual\nfeatures.

We propose to use adaptive Huffman coding for anomaly detection in\naudio with concept drift. Compared with the existing method of adaptive\nGaussian mixture modeling (AGMM), adaptive Huffman coding does not require a\npriori information about the clusters and can adjust the number of clusters\ndynamically depending on the amount of variation in the audio. To control the\nsize of the Huffman tree, we propose to merge clusters that are close to each\nother instead of replacing rare clusters with new data.

Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions\nto slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social\ndistancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in\nintra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating\ncoronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to\nconsider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by\nincorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel\nmetapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth\npatterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to\npolicy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple\nMobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of\nmodel-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban\n\"superspreading\", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary\ninfections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and\nheightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can\nfacilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively\nmitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate\nour model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that\ninforms the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 07:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

To discover the factors and learn disentangled representation,\nprevious methods typically leverage an extra regularization term when learning\nto generate realistic images. However, the term usually results in a trade-off\nbetween disentanglement and generation quality. For the generative models\npretrained without any disentanglement term, the generated images show\nsemantically meaningful variations when traversing along different directions\nin the latent space. Based on this observation, we argue that it is possible to\nmitigate the trade-off by $(i)$ leveraging the pretrained generative models\nwith high generation quality, $(ii)$ focusing on discovering the traversal\ndirections as factors for disentangled representation learning. To achieve\nthis, we propose Disentaglement via Contrast (DisCo) as a framework to model\nthe variations based on the target disentangled representations, and contrast\nthe variations to jointly discover disentangled directions and learn\ndisentangled representations.

In the symmetric system, with the HO\ntrap acting in both components, we consider Josephson oscillations (JO)\ninitiated by an input in the form of the HO's ground state (GS) or dipole mode\n(DM), placed in one component. With the increase of the strength of the\nself-focusing nonlinearity, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) between the\ncomponents takes place in the dynamical JO state. Under still stronger\nnonlinearity, the regular JO initiated by the GS input carry over into a\nchaotic dynamical state. For the DM input, the chaotization happens at smaller\npowers than for the GS, which is followed by SSB at a slightly stronger\nnonlinearity. In the system with the defocusing nonlinearity, SSB does not take\nplace, and dynamical chaos occurs in a small area of the parameter space. In\nthe asymmetric half-trapped system, with the HO potential applied to a single\ncomponent, we first focus on the spectrum of confined binary modes in the\nlinearized system. The spectrum is found analytically in the limits of weak and\nstrong inter-component coupling, and numerically in the general case. Under the\naction of the coupling, the existence region of the confined modes shrinks for\nGSs and expands for DMs. In the full nonlinear system, the existence region for\nconfined modes is identified in the numerical form. They are constructed too by\nmeans of the Thomas-Fermi approximation, in the case of the defocusing\nnonlinearity. Lastly, particular (non-generic) exact analytical solutions for\nconfined modes, including vortices, in one- and two-dimensional asymmetric\nlinearized systems are found.

One of the reasons is the policy changes of agents during the\nlearning process. Some existing works have discussed various consequences\ncaused by non-stationarity with several kinds of measurement indicators. This\nmakes the objectives or goals of existing algorithms are inevitably\ninconsistent and disparate. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion, the\n$\\delta$-measurement, to explicitly measure the non-stationarity of a policy\nsequence, which can be further proved to be bounded by the KL-divergence of\nconsecutive joint policies. A straightforward but highly non-trivial way is to\ncontrol the joint policies' divergence, which is difficult to estimate\naccurately by imposing the trust-region constraint on the joint policy.\nAlthough it has lower computational complexity to decompose the joint policy\nand impose trust-region constraints on the factorized policies, simple policy\nfactorization like mean-field approximation will lead to more considerable\npolicy divergence, which can be considered as the trust-region decomposition\ndilemma. We model the joint policy as a pairwise Markov random field and\npropose a trust-region decomposition network (TRD-Net) based on message passing\nto estimate the joint policy divergence more accurately. The Multi-Agent Mirror\ndescent policy algorithm with Trust region decomposition, called MAMT, is\nestablished by adjusting the trust-region of the local policies adaptively in\nan end-to-end manner. MAMT can approximately constrain the consecutive joint\npolicies' divergence to satisfy $\\delta$-stationarity and alleviate the\nnon-stationarity problem.

In\nthis paper, we consider nested array-based spatially coupled low-density\nparity-check (SC-LDPC) codes and propose a line-counting based optimization\nscheme for minimizing the number of dominant absorbing sets in order to improve\nits performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Since the\nparity-check matrices of different nested sub-codes partially overlap, the\noptimization of one nested sub-code imposes constraints on the optimization of\nthe other sub-codes. To tackle these constraints, a multi-step optimization\nprocess is applied first to one of the nested codes, then sequential\noptimization of the remaining nested codes is carried out based on the\nconstraints imposed by the previously optimized sub-codes. Results show that\nthe order of optimization has a significant impact on the number of dominant\nabsorbing sets in the Tanner graph of the code, resulting in a tradeoff between\nthe performance of a nested code structure and its optimization sequence: the\ncode which is optimized without constraints has fewer harmful structures than\nthe code which is optimized with constraints. We also show that for certain\ncode parameters, dominant absorbing sets in the Tanner graphs of all nested\ncodes are completely removed using our proposed optimization strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 14:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Using simulated transients placed in the well-studied COSMOS\nfield, we consider several agnostic and physically motivated priors and offset\ndistributions to explore the method sensitivity. We then apply the methodology\nto the set of 13~fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized with an uncertainty of\nseveral arcseconds.

It is indisputable that ICTs, and the\nInternet in particular, have revolutionalised the way we communicate today.\nFurthermore, the penetration of ICTs to other spheres of our daily lives is\nevidence enough that the impacts thereof go beyond mere communicative facets of\nour lives.

One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling\nconfounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among\ntreatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential\nignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often\nunverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential\nignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy\nstrategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously\nuncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate\nthe causal effects.

Then we check the compliance of privacy policy's text with the\ncorresponding text of the law using NLP techniques.

Not\nto miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True\nPositive Rates (TPRs) by setting a higher threshold, but this comes at the cost\nof very high False Positive Rates (FPRs) for problems with class imbalance.\nExisting methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this\ninto account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by\nemphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of\nthe positive, i.e. critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To\nthis end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a\nconstrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be\nused with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR.

This paper proposes generative models as a complement\nto optimization algorithms to improve performance in problems with high\ndimensionality. To demonstrate this method, a conditional generative\nadversarial network (C-GAN) is used to augment the solutions produced by a\ngenetic algorithm (GA) for a 311-dimensional nonconvex multi-objective\nmixed-integer nonlinear optimization. The C-GAN, composed of two networks with\nthree fully connected hidden layers, is trained on solutions generated by GA,\nand then given sets of desired labels (i.e., objective function values),\ngenerates complementary solutions corresponding to those labels. Six\nexperiments are conducted to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed method.\nThe generated complementary solutions are compared to the original solutions in\nterms of optimality and diversity. The generative model generates solutions\nwith objective functions up to 100% better, and with hypervolumes up to 100%\nhigher, than the original solutions. These findings show that a C-GAN with even\na simple training approach and architecture can, with a much shorter runtime,\nhighly improve the diversity and optimality of solutions found by an\noptimization algorithm for a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem.\n[Link to GitHub repository: https://github.com/PouyaREZ/GAN_GA]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 18:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 04:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

In the last few decades, the field of network optimization has\nwitnessed an upsurge of interest among researchers and practitioners. The\nnetwork models considered in this thesis are broadly classified into four types\nincluding transportation problem, shortest path problem, minimum spanning tree\nproblem and maximum flow problem. Quite often, we come across situations, when\nthe decision parameters of network optimization problems are not precise and\ncharacterized by various forms of uncertainties arising from the factors, like\ninsufficient or incomplete data, lack of evidence, inappropriate judgements and\nrandomness. Considering the deterministic environment, there exist several\nstudies on network optimization problems. However, in the literature, not many\ninvestigations on single and multi objective network optimization problems are\nobserved under diverse uncertain frameworks. This thesis proposes seven\ndifferent network models under different uncertain paradigms. Here, the\nuncertain programming techniques used to formulate the uncertain network models\nare (i) expected value model, (ii) chance constrained model and (iii) dependent\nchance constrained model. Subsequently, the corresponding crisp equivalents of\nthe uncertain network models are solved using different solution methodologies.\nThe solution methodologies used in this thesis can be broadly categorized as\nclassical methods and evolutionary algorithms. The classical methods, used in\nthis thesis, are Dijkstra and Kruskal algorithms, modified rough Dijkstra\nalgorithm, global criterion method, epsilon constraint method and fuzzy\nprogramming method. Whereas, among the evolutionary algorithms, we have\nproposed the varying population genetic algorithm with indeterminate crossover\nand considered two multi objective evolutionary algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 13:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Next to sanctioning, social influence\nand social structure, it is possible that strategic solutions can exist for\nthese social dilemmas. However, the existence of strategies that enable a\nplayer to exert control in the long-run outcomes can be difficult to show and\ndifferent situations allow for different levels of strategic influence. Here,\nwe investigate the effect of threshold nonlinearities on the possibilities of\nexerting unilateral control in finitely repeated n-player public goods games\nand snowdrift games. These models can describe situations in which a collective\neffort is necessary in order for a benefit to be created. We identify\nconditions in terms of a cooperator threshold for the existence of generous,\nextortionate and equalizing zero-determinant (ZD) strategies. Our results show\nthat, for both games, the thresholds prevent equalizing ZD strategies from\nexisting. In the snowdrift game, introducing a cooperator threshold has no\neffect on the region of feasible extortionate ZD strategies. For extortionate\nstrategies in the public goods game, the threshold only restricts the region of\nenforceable strategies for small values of the public goods multiplier.\nGenerous ZD strategies exist for both games, but introducing a cooperator\nthreshold forces the slope more towards the value of a fair strategy, where the\nplayer has approximately the same payoff as the average payoff of his\nopponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 09:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}
