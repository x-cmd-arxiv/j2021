To date, three-dimensional (3D) General\nCirculation Models (GCMs) are the best available tools to investigate the\nproperties of the exo-atmospheres, waiting for the next generation of space and\ngroundbased telescopes. In this work, we use the PlanetSimulator (PlaSim), an\nintermediate complexity 3D GCM, a flexible and fast model, suited to handle all\nthe orbital and physical parameters of a planet and to study the dynamics of\nits atmosphere. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere and a 1:1 spin/orbit\nconfiguration (tidal locking), our simulations of Proxima b are consistent with\na day-side open ocean planet with a superrotating atmosphere. Moreover, because\nof the limited representation of the radiative transfer in PlaSim, we compute\nthe spectrum of the exoplanet with an offline Radiative Transfer Code with a\nspectral resolution of 1 nm. This spectrum is used to derive the thermal phase\ncurves for different orbital inclination angles. In combination with\ninstrumental detection sensitivities, the different thermal phase curves are\nused to evaluate observation conditions at ground level (e.g., ELT) or in space\n(e.g., JWST). We estimated the exposure time to detect Proxima b (assuming an\nEarth-like atmosphere) thermal phase curve in the FIR with JWST with\nsignal-to-noise ratio $\\simeq$1. Under the hypothesis of total noise dominated\nby shot noise, neglecting other possible extra contribution producing a noise\nfloor, the exposure time is equal to 5 hours for each orbital epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 16:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

The\nresults show that cross-talk between the activity-induced deformations of the\nviscoelastic surroundings with the time-dependent response of the active medium\nto these deformations can lead to the reversal of spontaneously generated\nactive flows. We explain the mechanism behind this phenomenon based on the\ninteraction between the active flow and the viscoelastic medium.

We thus secondly\npresent an evidential road mapping algorithm, that fuses consecutive road\ndetection results. We benefitted from a reinterpretation of logistic\nclassifiers, which can be seen as generating a collection of simple evidential\nmass functions. An evidential grid map that depicts the road can then be\nobtained, by projecting the classification results from RoadSeg into grid\ncells, and by handling moving objects via conflict analysis. The system was\ntrained and evaluated on real-life data. A python implementation maintains a 10\nHz framerate. Since road labels were needed for training, a soft labelling\nprocedure, relying lane-level HD maps, was used to generate coarse training and\nvalidation sets. An additional test set was manually labelled for evaluation\npurposes. So as to reach satisfactory results, the system fuses road detection\nresults obtained from three variants of RoadSeg, processing different LIDAR\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 18:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

Our results pave the way for\nground-state cooling of micron-scale particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 18:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 15:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

With the rapid growth of the problem scale, it will\nbe extremely difficult to sustain the recovery accuracy and the computational\ncost. In this work, we propose a new Sparsity Low-Rank Recovery (SLRR) model\nand its Schur Complement Based semi-proximal Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (SCB-spADMM) solver. Our approach distinguishes itself mainly for\nthe following two aspects. First, we fully exploit the spatial low-rank\nproperty and the sparsity of traffic data, which are barely considered in the\nliterature. Our model can be divided into a series of subproblems, which only\nrelate to the traffics in a certain individual time interval. Thus, the model\nscale is significantly reduced. Second, we establish a globally convergent\nADMM-type algorithm inspired by [Li et al., Math. Program., 155(2016)] to solve\nthe SLRR model. In each iteration, all the intermediate variables' optimums can\nbe calculated analytically, which makes the algorithm fast and accurate.\nBesides, due to the separability of the SLRR model, it is possible to design a\nparallel algorithm to further reduce computational time. According to the\nnumerical results on the classic datasets Abilene and GEANT, our method\nachieves the best accuracy with a low computational cost. Moreover, in our\nnewly released large-scale Huawei Origin-Destination (HOD) network traffics,\nour method perfectly reaches the seconds-level feedback, which meets the\nessential requirement for practical scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 18:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

We modified the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi\nmethod to account for the large-scale flow and the turbulent field. Results\nshow that the observed magnetic fields arise from the combination of a\nlarge-scale ordered potential field associated with the outflow and a\nsmall-scale turbulent field associated with bow-shock-like features. Within the\ncentral $900$ pc radius, the large-scale field accounts for $53\\pm4$% of the\nobserved turbulent magnetic energy with a median field strength of $305\\pm15$\n$\\mu$G, while small-scale turbulent magnetic fields account for the remaining\n$40\\pm5$% with a median field strength of $222\\pm19$ $\\mu$G.

The combination of extreme gravity with the enormous electromagnetic\n(EM) fields gives rise to spectacular phenomena like those observed on August\n2017 with the merger of a binary neutron star (NSNS) system, an event that\ngenerated a gravitational wave (GW) signal, a short $\\gamma$-ray burst (sGRB),\nand a kilonova. This event serves as the highlight so far of the era of\nmultimessenger astronomy. In this review, we present the current state of our\ntheoretical understanding of compact binary mergers containing NSs as gleaned\nfrom the latest general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Such\nmergers can lead to events like the one on August 2017, GW170817, and its EM\ncounterparts, GRB 170817 and AT 2017gfo. In addition to exploring the GW\nemission from binary black hole-neutron star and NSNS mergers, we also focus on\ntheir counterpart EM signals. In particular, we are interested in identifying\nthe conditions under which a relativistic jet can be launched following these\nmergers. Such a jet is an essential feature of most sGRB models and provides\nthe main conduit of energy from the central object to the outer radiation\nregions. Jet properties, including their lifetimes and Poynting luminosities,\nthe effects of the initial B-field geometries and spins of the coalescing NSs,\nas well as their governing equation of state, are discussed.

The time delay between the star formation and the\nproduction of r-process elements is the key to distinguish these scenarios with\nthe caveat that the diffusion of r-process elements in the interstellar medium\nmay induce the delay in r-process enrichment because r-process events are rare.\nHere we study the observed Ba abundance data of very metal-poor stars as the\ntracer of the early enrichment history of r-process elements.

Using\nthe FIRE-2 suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW/M31-mass galaxies,\nwe investigate the prevalence and origin of prograde metal-poor stars.

The typical\nprograde-to-retrograde ratio is ~2:1, which depends weakly on stellar\nmetallicity at Fe/H] < -1. These trends predicted by our simulations agree well\nwith MW observations. Prograde metal-poor stars originate largely from a single\nLMC/SMC-mass gas-rich merger 7 - 12.5 Gyr ago, which deposited existing\nmetal-poor stars and significant gas on an orbital vector that sparked the\nformation of and/or shaped the orientation of a long-lived stellar disk, giving\nrise to a prograde bias for all low-metallicity stars.

Since PRWB is\nnumerically very challenging to solve, we further propose a relaxed PRWB\n(RPRWB) model, which is more tractable.

A situation is supposed in which the\ncentral black hole tends to move by the gravitational attractions from the\nnearby molecular clouds in a nuclear bulge but is braked via the dynamical\nfrictions by the ambient stars there. We estimate the approximate kinetic\nenergy of the black hole in an equilibrium between the energy gain rate through\nthe gravitational attractions and the energy loss rate through the dynamical\nfrictions, in a nuclear bulge composed of a nuclear stellar disk and a nuclear\nstellar cluster as observed from our Galaxy. The wandering distance of the\nblack hole in the gravitational potential of the nuclear bulge is evaluated to\nget as large as several 10 pc, when the black hole mass is relatively small.\nThe distance, however, shrinks as the black hole mass increases and the\nequilibrium solution between the energy gain and loss disappears when the black\nhole mass exceeds an upper limit. As a result, we can expect the following\nscenario for the evolution of the black hole mass: When the black hole mass is\nsmaller than the upper limit, mass accretion of the interstellar matter in the\ncircum-nuclear region, causing the AGN activities, makes the black hole mass\nlarger. However, when the mass gets to the upper limit, the black hole loses\nthe balancing force against the dynamical friction and starts spiraling\ndownward to the gravity center. From simple parameter scaling, the upper mass\nlimit of the black hole is found to be proportional to the bulge mass and this\ncould explain the observed correlation of the black hole mass with the bulge\nmass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 02:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

A recent\nadversarial training (AT) study showed that the number of projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) steps to successfully attack a point (i.e., find an adversarial\nexample in its proximity) is an effective measure of the robustness of this\npoint. Given that natural data are clean, this measure reveals an intrinsic\ngeometric property -- how far a point is from its class boundary. Based on this\nbreakthrough, in this paper, we figure out how AT would interact with NL.\nFirstly, we find if a point is too close to its noisy-class boundary (e.g., one\nstep is enough to attack it), this point is likely to be mislabeled, which\nsuggests to adopt the number of PGD steps as a new criterion for sample\nselection for correcting NL. Secondly, we confirm AT with strong smoothing\neffects suffers less from NL (without NL corrections) than standard training\n(ST), which suggests AT itself is an NL correction.

To comprehensively evaluate the\nperformance of CAVs, it is of necessity to test the CAVs in safety-critical\nscenarios, which rarely happen in naturalistic driving environment. Therefore,\nhow to purposely and systematically generate these corner cases becomes an\nimportant problem. Most existing studies focus on generating adversarial\nexamples for perception systems of CAVs, whereas limited efforts have been put\non the decision-making systems, which is the highlight of this paper. As the\nCAVs need to interact with numerous background vehicles (BVs) for a long\nduration, variables that define the corner cases are usually high dimensional,\nwhich makes the generation a challenging problem. In this paper, a unified\nframework is proposed to generate corner cases for the decision-making systems.\nTo address the challenge brought by high dimensionality, the driving\nenvironment is formulated based on Markov Decision Process, and the deep\nreinforcement learning techniques are applied to learn the behavior policy of\nBVs. With the learned policy, BVs will behave and interact with the CAVs more\naggressively, resulting in more corner cases. To further analyze the generated\ncorner cases, the techniques of feature extraction and clustering are utilized.\nBy selecting representative cases of each cluster and outliers, the valuable\ncorner cases can be identified from all generated corner cases.

Here an experiment demonstrating entanglement swapping\nfrom two independent multimode time-frequency entangled sources is presented,\nresulting in multiple heralded temporal-mode Bell states. Entanglement in the\nheralded states is verified by measuring conditional anti-correlated joint\nspectra as well as quantum beating in two-photon interference. Our\nproof-of-concept experiment is able to distinguish up to five orthogonal Bell\npairs within the same setup, limited in principle only by the entanglement of\nthe sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 02:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-agent RL-based system for PM (MSPM). MSPM involves two types of\nasynchronously-updated modules: Evolving Agent Module (EAM) and Strategic Agent\nModule (SAM). An EAM is an information-generating module with a DQN agent, and\nit receives heterogeneous data and generates signal-comprised information for a\nparticular asset. An SAM is a decision-making module with a PPO agent for\nportfolio optimization, and it connects to EAMs to reallocate the assets in a\nportfolio. Trained EAMs can be connected to any SAM at will. With its\nmodularized architecture, the multi-step condensation of volatile market\ninformation, and the reusable design of EAM, MSPM simultaneously addresses the\ntwo challenges in RL-based PM: scalability and reusability. Experiments on\n8-year U.S. stock market data prove the effectiveness of MSPM in profit\naccumulation by its outperformance over five baselines in terms of accumulated\nrate of return (ARR), daily rate of return, and Sortino ratio. MSPM improves\nARR by at least 186.5% compared to CRP, a widely-used PM strategy. To validate\nthe indispensability of EAM, we back-test and compare MSPMs on four portfolios.\nEAM-enabled MSPMs improve ARR by at least 1341.8% compared to EAM-disabled\nMSPMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 04:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 16:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 03:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Automatic delineation of ECG\nfiducial points, in particular the R-peak, serves as the basis for ECG\nprocessing and analysis. This study proposes a new method of ECG signal\nanalysis by introducing a new class of graphical models based on optimal\nchangepoint detection models, named the graph-constrained changepoint detection\n(GCCD) model. The GCCD model treats fiducial points delineation in the\nnon-stationary ECG signal as a changepoint detection problem. The proposed\nmodel exploits the sparsity of changepoints to detect abrupt changes within the\nECG signal; thereby, the R-peak detection task can be relaxed from any\npreprocessing step. In this novel approach, prior biological knowledge about\nthe expected sequence of changes is incorporated into the model using the\nconstraint graph, which can be defined manually or automatically. First, we\ndefine the constraint graph manually; then, we present a graph learning\nalgorithm that can search for an optimal graph in a greedy scheme. Finally, we\ncompare the manually defined graphs and learned graphs in terms of graph\nstructure and detection accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm\nusing the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Solutions of many hard problems\nhave been reported by numerically integrating the ODEs of DMMs, showing\nsubstantial advantages over state-of-the-art solvers. To investigate the\nreasons behind the robustness and effectiveness of this method, we employ three\nexplicit integration schemes (forward Euler, trapezoid and Runge-Kutta 4th\norder) with a constant time step, to solve 3-SAT instances with planted\nsolutions. We show that, (i) even if most of the trajectories in the phase\nspace are destroyed by numerical noise, the solution can still be achieved;\n(ii) the forward Euler method, although having the largest numerical error,\nsolves the instances in the least amount of function evaluations; and (iii)\nwhen increasing the integration time step, the system undergoes a\n\"solvable-unsolvable transition\" at a critical threshold, which needs to decay\nat most as a power law with the problem size, to control the numerical errors.\nTo explain these results, we model the dynamical behavior of DMMs as directed\npercolation of the state trajectory in the phase space in the presence of\nnoise.

A reinforcement learning algorithm, named policy gradient, is applied\nto learn an agent (i.e. parameter controller) that can provide the control\nparameters of a proposed differential evolution adaptively during the search\nprocedure. The differential evolution algorithm based on the learned agent is\ncompared against nine well-known evolutionary algorithms on the CEC'13 and\nCEC'17 test suites.

Understanding the neurophysiological difference between \"voluntary\nstopping\" and \"involuntary stopping\" caused by FOG is vital for the detection\nand potential intervention of FOG in the daily lives of patients. This study\ncharacterised the electroencephalographic (EEG) signature associated with FOG\nin contrast to voluntary stopping. The protocol consisted of a timed up-and-go\n(TUG) task and an additional TUG task with a voluntary stopping component,\nwhere participants reacted to verbal \"stop\" and \"walk\" instructions by\nvoluntarily stopping or walking. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP)\nanalysis was used to study the dynamics of the EEG spectra induced by different\nwalking phases, which included normal walking, voluntary stopping and episodes\nof involuntary stopping (FOG), as well as the transition windows between normal\nwalking and voluntary stopping or FOG. These results demonstrate for the first\ntime that the EEG signal during the transition from walking to voluntary\nstopping is distinguishable from that of the transition to involuntary stopping\ncaused by FOG. The EEG signature of voluntary stopping exhibits a significantly\ndecreased power spectrum compared to that of FOG episodes, with distinctly\ndifferent patterns in the delta and low-beta power in the central area. These\nfindings suggest the possibility of a practical EEG-based treatment strategy\nthat can accurately predict FOG episodes, excluding the potential confound of\nvoluntary stopping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 12:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

A key observation, motivating this line of research, is the\nawareness that human learners are amazingly fast and effective at adapting to\nunfamiliar environments and incorporating upcoming knowledge: this is an\nintriguing behaviour for cognitive sciences as well as an important challenge\nfor Machine Learning. The target problem considered is active learning in a\nblack-box optimization task and more specifically how the\nexploration/exploitation dilemma can be modelled within Gaussian Process based\nBayesian Optimization framework, which is in turn based on uncertainty\nquantification. The main contribution is to analyse humans' decisions with\nrespect to Pareto rationality where the two objectives are improvement expected\nand uncertainty quantification. According to this Pareto rationality model, if\na decision set contains a Pareto efficient (dominant) strategy, a rational\ndecision maker should always select the dominant strategy over its dominated\nalternatives. The distance from the Pareto frontier determines whether a choice\nis (Pareto) rational (i.e., lays on the frontier) or is associated to\n\"exasperate\" exploration.

The\nmutual shape is here defined as a consensus shape estimated from a set of\ndifferent segmentations of the same object. In an original manner, such a shape\nis defined as the minimum of a criterion that benefits from both the mutual\ninformation and the joint entropy of the input segmentations. This energy\ncriterion is justified using similarities between information theory quantities\nand area measures, and presented in a continuous variational framework. In\norder to solve this shape optimization problem, shape derivatives are computed\nfor each term of the criterion and interpreted as an evolution equation of an\nactive contour. A mutual shape is then estimated together with the sensitivity\nand specificity of each segmentation. Some synthetic examples allow us to cast\nthe light on the difference between the mutual shape and an average shape. The\napplicability of our framework has also been tested for segmentation evaluation\nand fusion of different types of real images (natural color images, old\nmanuscripts, medical images).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 18:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Although\nresearchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis\nand treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning needs\nto aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness\nneeds to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms\nclinical application. To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of\npatients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and\ndiagnose depression. First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning\nframework using multi-source data, which can extend any traditional machine\nlearning model to support federated learning across different institutions or\nparties. Secondly, we adopt late fusion methods to solve the problem of\ninconsistent time series of multi-view data.

Drawing primarily on the\nwritings of sociologist Robert K. Merton, the thinkers of the Vienna Circle,\nand Charles Sanders Peirce, I make some of these assumptions explicit by\ntelling a longer story about the evolution of social thinking about the\nnormative structure of science from Merton's articulation of his well-known\nnorms (those of universalism, communism, organized skepticism, and\ndisinterestedness) to the present. I show that while Merton's norms and his\nintertwinement of these with the underlying mechanisms of democratic order\nprovide us with an especially good starting point to explore and clarify the\ncommitments and values of science, Leonelli's broader, more context-responsive,\nand more holistic vision of the epistemic integrity of data scientific\nunderstanding, and her discernment of the global and biospheric scope of its\nmoral-practical reach, move beyond Merton's schema in ways that effectively\ndraw upon important critiques. Stepping past Merton, I argue that a combination\nof situated universalism, methodological pluralism, strong objectivity, and\nunbounded communalism must guide the responsible and sustainable data work of\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 13:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

However, the use of\ndistributed controllers introduces a new and important Request Dispatching (RD)\nproblem with the goal for every SDN switch to properly dispatch their requests\namong all controllers so as to optimize network performance. This goal can be\nfulfilled by designing an RD policy to guide distribution of requests at each\nswitch. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(MA-DRL) approach to automatically design RD policies with high adaptability\nand performance. This is achieved through a new problem formulation in the form\nof a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MA-MDP), a new adaptive RD policy\ndesign and a new MA-DRL algorithm called MA-PPO.
