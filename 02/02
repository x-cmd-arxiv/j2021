A successful approach is\nmeta-learning, or \"learning to learn\" a distribution of tasks, where \"learning\"\nis represented by an outer loop, and \"to learn\" by an inner loop of gradient\ndescent. However, a number of recent empirical studies argue that the inner\nloop is unnecessary and more simple models work equally well or even better.

Counterfactual\nexplanations of already trained neural networks can be generated by perturbing\ninput features and attributing importance according to the change in the\nclassifier's outcome after perturbation. Perturbation can be done by replacing\nfeatures using heuristic or generative in-filling methods. The choice of\nin-filling function significantly impacts the number of artifacts, i.e.,\nfalse-positive attributions. Heuristic methods result in false-positive\nartifacts because the image after the perturbation is far from the original\ndata distribution. Generative in-filling methods reduce artifacts by producing\nin-filling values that respect the original data distribution. However, current\ngenerative in-filling methods may also increase false-negatives due to the high\ncorrelation of in-filling values with the original data. In this paper, we\npropose to alleviate this by generating in-fillings with the\nstatistically-grounded Knockoffs framework, which was developed by Barber and\nCand\\`es in 2015 as a tool for variable selection with controllable false\ndiscovery rate. Knockoffs are statistically null-variables as decorrelated as\npossible from the original data, which can be swapped with the originals\nwithout changing the underlying data distribution. A comparison of different\nin-filling methods indicates that in-filling with knockoffs can reveal\nexplanations in a more causal sense while still maintaining the compactness of\nthe explanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 16:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Drone missions will increasingly rely on drone collaboration, which\nrequires the drones to reduce communication complexity and be controlled in a\ndecentralized fashion. Blockchain technology becomes a must in industrial\napplications because it provides decentralized data, accessibility,\nimmutability, and irreversibility. Therefore, Blockchain makes data public for\nall drones and enables drones to log information concerning world states, time,\nlocation, resources, delivery data, and drone relation to all neighbors drones.\nThis paper introduces decentralized independent multi-drones to accomplish the\ntask collaboratively. Improving blockchain with a consensus algorithm can\nimprove network partitioning and scalability in order to combat COVID-19. The\nmulti-drones task is to combat COVID-19 via monitoring and detecting, social\ndistancing, sanitization, data analysis, delivering goods and medical supplies,\nand announcement while avoiding collisions with one another. We discuss End to\nEnd (E2E) delivery application of combination blockchain and multi-drone in\ncombating COVID-19 and beyond future pandemics. Furthermore, the challenges and\nopportunities of our proposed framework are highlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 16:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

In this study, a superposed-epoch analysis was performed on\n~8500 flares greater than B1 class to determine the contribution that flares\nmake to changes in the solar EUV irradiance. Using the peak of the 1-8A X-ray\nemission as a fiducial time, the corresponding time series of 3123 B- and 4972\nC-class flares observed in Lya emission by the EUV Sensor on GOES-15 were\naveraged to reduce background fluctuations and improve the flare signal. The\nsummation of these weaker events showed that they produced a 0.1-0.3%\nenhancement to the solar Lya irradiance. For comparison on average, the same\ntechnique was applied to 453 M- and 31 X-class flares, which resulted in a 1-4%\nincrease in Lya emission. Flares were also averaged with respect to their\nheliographic angle to investigate any potential center-to-limb variation. For\neach GOES class, the relative enhancement in Lya at the flare peak was found to\ndiminish for flares that occurred closer to the solar limb due to the opacity\nof the line, and/or foreshortening of the footpoints. One modest event included\nin the study, a C6.6 flare, exhibited an unusually high increase in Lya of 7%\nthat may have been attributed to a failed filament eruption. Increases of this\nmagnitude have hitherto only been associated with a small number of X-class\nflares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 16:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

In the 3D MHD model horizontal (convective) motions near the surface\ninduce currents in the coronal magnetic field that are dissipated and heat the\nplasma. This self-consistently creates a corona with a temperature of 1 MK. We\nrun a series of models that differ in terms of the (unsigned) magnetic flux at\nthe surface by changing the (peak) magnetic field strength while keeping all\nother parameters fixed. In the 3D MHD models we find that the energy input into\nthe corona, characterized by either the Poynting flux or the total volumetric\nheating, scales roughly quadratically with the unsigned surface flux $\\Phi$.\nThis is expected from heating through field-line braiding. Our central result\nis the nonlinear scaling of the X-ray emission as $L_{\\rm{X}}\\propto\n\\Phi^{3.44}$. This scaling is slightly steeper than found in recent\nobservations that give power-law indices of up to only 2 or 3. Assuming that on\na real star, not only the peak magnetic field strength in the active regions\nchanges but also their number (or surface filling factor), our results are\nconsistent with observations.

This necessitates the use of mixed numerologies\nto accommodate different quality of service (QoS) requirements. Non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) techniques can potentially be used to accommodate users\nwith different numerologies while also gaining the performance benefits\nassociated with NOMA. To achieve the full performance benefits of a mixed\nnumerology NOMA (MN-NOMA) system, resource allocation among the users is\nparamount. However, the coexistence of mixed numerologies changes the nature of\nthe interference that each user experiences. This means that techniques used in\nsingle-numerology NOMA (SN-NOMA) are no longer sufficient. In light of this, we\napproach the problem of optimizing subcarrier and power allocation for\nmaximizing the spectral efficiency of MN-NOMA while considering a minimum rate\nconstraint for each user. In this letter, we propose a two-stage sub-optimal\napproach to solve the problem.

This results in high\ninter-observer variability between physicians. This variability has been\nconsidered an issue, but the absence of multiple physician CTV contours for\neach patient and the significant amount of time required for dose planning have\nmade it impractical to study its dosimetric consequences. In this study, we\nanalyze the impact that variations in physician style have on dose to\norgans-at-risk(OAR) by simulating the clinical workflow via deep learning. For\na given patient previously treated by one physician, we use deep learning-based\ntools to simulate how other physicians would contour the CTV and how the\ncorresponding dose distributions would look for this patient. To simulate\nmultiple physician styles, we use a previously developed in-house CTV\nsegmentation model that can produce physician style-aware segmentations. The\ncorresponding dose distribution is predicted using another in-house deep\nlearning tool, which, can predict dose within 3% of the prescription dose, on\naverage, on the test data. For every test patient, four different physician\nstyle CTVs are considered, and four different dose distributions are analyzed.\nOAR dose metrics are compared, showing that even though physician style\nvariations result in organs getting different doses, all the important dose\nmetrics except Maximum Dose point are within the clinically acceptable limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 17:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 17:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 16:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

We will assume that\ninflation is driven by a single scalar field, called the inflaton. When the\nshape of the potential energy is flat, the inflaton can enter a phase of\n\"ultra-slow-roll inflation\". We study the stability of such a period of\ninflation, and find that it can be stable and long-lived, although it has a\ndependence on the initial velocity of the inflaton field. This is different to\nthe slow-roll regime of inflation, which is always stable, but has no\ndependence on the initial velocity. In the second part of this thesis, we use\nthe stochastic formalism for inflation in order to take account of the\nnon-perturbative backreaction of quantum fluctuations during inflation. We use\nthis formalism to study curvature fluctuations during inflation, and we derive\nfull probability distributions of these fluctuations. This allows us to study\nthe statistics of large fluctuations that can lead to the formation of rare\nobjects, such as primordial black holes.

Structure modifications to the index, which result in\nchanging the size of revisions, happen through (lock-free) skip list node split\nand merge operations that are carefully coordinated with the update operations.\nDespite rich semantics, Jiffy offers highly scalable performance, which is\ncomparable or exceeds the performance of the state-of-the-art lock-free ordered\nindices that feature linearizable range scan operations. Compared to its\n(lock-based) rivals that also support batch updates, Jiffy can execute large\nbatch updates up to 7.4x more efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 18:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

This approach must face the challenge posed by gravitational\nlensing of the CMB, which obscures the signal of interest. Fortunately, the\nlensing effects can be partially removed by combining high-resolution $E$-mode\nmeasurements with an estimate of the projected matter distribution. For\nnear-future experiments, the best estimate of the latter will arise from\nco-adding internal reconstructions (derived from the CMB itself) with external\ntracers such as the cosmic infrared background (CIB). In this work, we\ncharacterise how foregrounds impact the delensing procedure when CIB intensity,\n$I$, is used as the matter tracer. We find that higher-point functions of the\nCIB and Galactic dust such as $\\langle BEI \\rangle_{c}$ and $\\langle EIEI\n\\rangle_{c}$ can, in principle, bias the power spectrum of delensed $B$-modes.\nTo quantify these, we first estimate the dust residuals in currently-available\nCIB maps and upcoming, foreground-cleaned Simons Observatory CMB data. Then,\nusing non-Gaussian simulations of Galactic dust -- extrapolated to the relevant\nfrequencies, assuming the spectral index of polarised dust emission to be fixed\nat the value determined by Planck -- we show that the bias to any primordial\nsignal is small compared to statistical errors for ground-based experiments,\nbut might be significant for space-based experiments probing very large angular\nscales. However, mitigation techniques based on multi-frequency cleaning appear\nto be very effective. We also show, by means of an analytic model, that the\nbias arising from the higher-point functions of the CIB itself ought to be\nnegligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 18:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 16:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Within less than half GPU day, Zen-NAS is able\nto directly search high performance architectures in a data-free style.\nComparing with previous NAS methods, the proposed Zen-NAS is magnitude times\nfaster on multiple server-side and mobile-side GPU platforms with\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet.

Unfortunately, under important conditions (i.e., large\nvocabulary, high instance counts) the default implementation of AP is neither\ncategory independent, nor does it directly reward properly calibrated\ndetectors. In fact, we show that on LVIS the default implementation produces a\ngameable metric, where a simple, un-intuitive re-ranking policy can improve AP\nby a large margin. To address these limitations, we introduce two complementary\nmetrics. First, we present a simple fix to the default AP implementation,\nensuring that it is independent across categories as originally intended. We\nbenchmark recent LVIS detection advances and find that many reported gains do\nnot translate to improvements under our new evaluation, suggesting recent\nimprovements may arise from difficult to interpret changes to cross-category\nrankings.

An enticing explanation\nfor this pattern is tidal realignment of the cool host stars, although this\nexplanation assumes that obliquity damping occurs faster than orbital decay, an\nassumption that needs further exploration. Here we revisit this tidal\nrealignment problem, building on previous work identifying a low-frequency\ncomponent of the time-variable tidal potential that affects the obliquity but\nnot the orbital separation. We adopt a recent empirically-based model for the\nstellar tidal quality factor and its sharp increase with forcing frequency.\nThis leads to enhanced dissipation at low frequencies, and efficient obliquity\ndamping. We model the tidal evolution of 46 observed hot Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars. A key parameter is the stellar age, which we determine in a homogeneous\nmanner for the sample, taking advantage of Gaia DR2 data. We explore a variety\nof tidal histories and futures for each system, finding in most cases that the\nstellar obliquity is successfully damped before the planet is destroyed.

We developed new algorithms to identify\nthese structures and applied them to a set of non-radiative cosmological\nsimulations of galaxy clusters at high resolution. We find that in those\nsimulated clusters, the density and temperature of clumps are independent of\nthe mass of the cluster where they reside. We detected a positive correlation\nbetween the filament temperature and the host cluster mass. The density and\ntemperature of clumps and filaments also tended to correlate. Both the\ntemperature and density decrease moving outward. We observed that clumps are\nhotter, more massive, and more luminous if identified closer to the cluster\ncenter. Especially in the outermost cluster regions (~3*R500,c or beyond),\nX-ray observations might already have the potential to locate cosmic filaments\nbased on the distribution of clumps and to allow one to study the\nthermodynamics of diffuse baryons before they are processed by the intracluster\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 19:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 11:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The application of machine learning techniques\nto medical toxicology is challenging because initial treatment decisions are\noften based on a few pieces of textual data and rely heavily on prior\nknowledge. ML techniques often do not represent knowledge in a way that is\ntransparent for the physician, raising barriers to usability.

Constraining properties of\nthe progenitor and the explosion requires coupling the observations with a\ntheoretical model of the explosion. Here, we begin with the CCSN simulations of\nCouch et al 2020 ApJ 890 127, which use a non-parametric treatment of the\nneutrino transport while also accounting for turbulence and convection. In this\nwork we use the SuperNova Explosion Code to evolve the CCSN hydrodynamics to\nlater times and compute bolometric light curves. Focusing on SNe IIP, we then\n(1) directly compare the theoretical STIR explosions to observations and (2)\nassess how properties of the progenitor's core can be estimated from optical\nphotometry in the plateau phase alone. First, the distribution of plateau\nluminosities (L$_{50}$) and ejecta velocities achieved by our simulations is\nsimilar to the observed distributions. Second, we fit our models to the light\ncurves and velocity evolution of some well-observed SNe. Third, we recover\nwell-known correlations, as well as the difficulty of connecting any one SN\nproperty to zero-age main sequence mass. Finally, we show that there is a\nusable, linear correlation between iron core mass and L$_{50}$ such that\noptical photometry alone of SNe IIP can give us insights into the cores of\nmassive stars. Illustrating this by application to a few SNe, we find iron core\nmasses of 1.3-1.5 solar masses with typical errors of ~0.05 solar masses.

This study seeks to provide a generalizable empirical benchmark by\ncomparing hundreds of ML and DCM classifiers in a highly structured manner. The\nexperiments evaluate both prediction accuracy and computational cost by\nspanning four hyper-dimensions, including 105 ML and DCM classifiers from 12\nmodel families, 3 datasets, 3 sample sizes, and 3 outputs. This experimental\ndesign leads to an immense number of 6,970 experiments, which are corroborated\nwith a meta dataset of 136 experiment points from 35 previous studies. This\nstudy is hitherto the most comprehensive and almost exhaustive comparison of\nthe classifiers for travel behavioral prediction. We found that the ensemble\nmethods and deep neural networks achieve the highest predictive performance,\nbut at a relatively high computational cost. Random forests are the most\ncomputationally efficient, balancing between prediction and computation. While\ndiscrete choice models offer accuracy with only 3-4 percentage points lower\nthan the top ML classifiers, they have much longer computational time and\nbecome computationally impossible with large sample size, high input\ndimensions, or simulation-based estimation. The relative ranking of the ML and\nDCM classifiers is highly stable, while the absolute values of the prediction\naccuracy and computational time have large variations. Overall, this paper\nsuggests using deep neural networks, model ensembles, and random forests as\nbaseline models for future travel behavior prediction. For choice modeling, the\nDCM community should switch more attention from fitting models to improving\ncomputational efficiency, so that the DCMs can be widely adopted in the big\ndata context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 19:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Empirical and semiempirical corrections\nbased on the DFT+U method can reduce these errors, but the parameterization and\nvalidation of the correction terms remains an on-going challenge. We develop a\nsystematic methodology to determine the parameters and to statistically assess\nthe results by considering thermochemical data across a set of transition metal\ncompounds.

The parameterization is expressed as a unified\noptimization problem. We demonstrate this approach for 3d transition metal\noxides, considering a target set of binary and ternary oxides.

In\nthis paper we introduce a novel framework that we call Deep Musical Information\nDynamics, which combines two parallel streams - a low rate latent\nrepresentation stream that is assumed to capture the dynamics of a thought\nprocess contrasted with a higher rate information dynamics derived from the\nmusical data itself. Motivated by rate-distortion theories of human cognition\nwe propose a framework for exploring possible relations between imaginary\nanticipations existing in the listener's mind and information dynamics of the\nmusical surface itself. This model is demonstrated for the case of symbolic\n(MIDI) data, as accounting for acoustic surface would require many more layers\nto capture instrument properties and performance expressive inflections. The\nmathematical framework is based on variational encoding that first establishes\na high rate representation of the musical observations, which is then reduced\nusing a bit-allocation method into a parallel low rate data stream. The\ncombined loss considered here includes both the information rate in terms of\ntime evolution for each stream, and the fidelity of encoding measured in terms\nof mutual information between the high and low rate representations. In the\nsimulations presented in the paper we are able to juxtapose aspects of\nlatent/imaginary surprisal versus surprisal of the music surface in a manner\nthat is quantifiable and computationally tractable.

A challenge in the risk\nprediction for COVID-19 patients lies in the great variability and irregular\nsampling of patient's vitals and labs observed in the clinical setting.\nExisting methods have strong limitations in handling time-dependent features'\ncomplex dynamics, either oversimplifying temporal data with summary statistics\nthat lose information or over-engineering features that lead to less robust\noutcomes. We propose a novel in-time risk trajectory predictive model to handle\nthe irregular sampling rate in the data, which follows the dynamics of risk of\nperforming mechanical ventilation for individual patients. The model\nincorporates the Multi-task Gaussian Process using observed values to learn the\nposterior joint multi-variant conditional probability and infer the missing\nvalues on a unified time grid. The temporal imputed data is fed into a\nmulti-objective self-attention network for the prediction task. A novel\npositional encoding layer is proposed and added to the network for producing\nin-time predictions. The positional layer outputs a risk score at each\nuser-defined time point during the entire hospital stay of an inpatient. We\nframe the prediction task into a multi-objective learning framework, and the\nrisk scores at all time points are optimized altogether, which adds robustness\nand consistency to the risk score trajectory prediction. Our experimental\nevaluation on a large database with nationwide in-hospital patients with\nCOVID-19 also demonstrates that it improved the state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) and AUPRC\n(Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) performance metrics, especially at\nearly times after hospital admission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 20:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Water photoelectrolysis has\nbeen proposed as a viable approach for generating hydrogen, provided that\nstable and inexpensive photocatalysts with conversion efficiencies over 10% can\nbe discovered, synthesized at scale, and successfully deployed (Pinaud et al.,\nEnergy Environ. Sci., 2013, 6, 1983). While a number of first-principles\nstudies have focused on the data-driven discovery of photocatalysts, in the\nabsence of systematic experimental validation, the success rate of these\npredictions may be limited. We address this problem by developing a screening\nprocedure with co-validation between experiment and theory to expedite the\nsynthesis, characterization, and testing of the computationally predicted, most\ndesirable materials. Starting with 70,150 compounds in the Materials Project\ndatabase, the proposed protocol yielded 71 candidate photocatalysts, 11 of\nwhich were synthesized as single-phase materials. Experiments confirmed\nhydrogen generation and favorable band alignment for 6 of the 11 compounds,\nwith the most promising ones belonging to the families of alkali and\nalkaline-earth indates and orthoplumbates.

In infectious\ndisease studies, one person's treatment may affect another individual's\noutcome, i.e., there may be interference between units. For example, use of bed\nnets to prevent malaria by one individual may have an indirect or spillover\neffect to other individuals living in close proximity. In some settings,\nindividuals may form groups or clusters where interference only occurs within\ngroups, i.e., there is partial interference. Inverse probability weighted\nestimators have previously been developed for observational studies with\npartial interference. Unfortunately, these estimators are not well suited for\nstudies with large clusters. Therefore, in this paper, the parametric g-formula\nis extended to allow for partial interference. G-formula estimators are\nproposed of overall effects, spillover effects when treated, and spillover\neffects when untreated. The proposed estimators can accommodate large clusters\nand do not suffer from the g-null paradox that may occur in the absence of\ninterference. The large sample properties of the proposed estimators are\nderived, and simulation studies are presented demonstrating the finite-sample\nperformance of the proposed estimators. The Demographic and Health Survey from\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is then analyzed using the proposed\ng-formula estimators to assess the overall and spillover effects of bed net use\non malaria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 20:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Finally, we demonstrate how the nearest neighbor\ncross-correlations can robustly detect cross correlations between sparse\nsamples -- the same regime where the two-point cross-correlation measurements\nare dominated by noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 21:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The\nsurvey has a resolution of 67''x95'' and 6.6 km$s^{-1}$ with a 3$\\sigma$\nsensitivity of N(HI)~2x10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ and MHI 2x10$^7$ M$_\\odot$.\n  We detect 16 galaxies out of 200 spectroscopically confirmed Fornax cluster\nmembers. The detections cover ~3 orders of magnitude in HI mass, from 8x10$^6$\nto 1.5x10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$. They avoid the central, virialised region of the\ncluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing that they are\nrecent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, ~2 Gyr.\nHalf of these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several\ncases of asymmetries, tails, offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case\nof a truncated HI disc suggesting that they have been interacting within or on\ntheir way to Fornax. Our HI detections are HI-poorer and form stars at a lower\nrate than non-cluster galaxies in the same $M_\\star$ range. Low mass galaxies\nare more strongly affected throughout their infall towards the cluster. The\nMHI/$M_\\star$ ratio of Fornax galaxies is comparable to that in the Virgo\ncluster. At fixed $M_\\star$, our HI detections follow the non-cluster relation\nbetween MHI and the star formation rate, and we argue that this implies that so\nfar they have lost their HI on a timescale $\\gtrsim$1-2 Gyr. Deeper inside the\ncluster HI removal is likely to proceed faster, as confirmed by a population of\nHI-undetected but H$_2$-detected star-forming galaxies. Based on ALMA data, we\nfind a large scatter in H$_2$-to-HI mass ratio, with several galaxies showing\nan unusually high ratio that is probably caused by faster HI removal.\n  We identify an HI-rich subgroup of possible interacting galaxies dominated by\nNGC 1365, where pre-processing is likey to have taken place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 21:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

The population of\nintermediate-mass red giants presenting a surprisingly low-amplitude of their\nmixed modes could also arise from the effect of an internal magnetic field.\nIndeed, stars more massive than about 1.1Ms are known to develop a convective\ncore during their main sequence, which could relax into a strong fossil\nmagnetic field trapped inside the core of the star for the rest of its\nevolution. The observations of mixed modes can constitute an excellent probe of\nthe deepest layers of evolved solar-like stars. The magnetic perturbation on\nmixed modes may thus be visible in asteroseismic data. To unravel which\nconstraints can be obtained from observations, we theoretically investigate the\neffects of a plausible mixed axisymmetric magnetic field with various\namplitudes on the mixed-mode frequencies of evolved solar-like stars. The\nfirst-order frequency perturbations are computed for dipolar and quadrupolar\nmixed modes. These computations are carried out for a range of stellar ages,\nmasses, and metallicities. We show that typical fossil-field strengths of 0.1-1\nMG, consistent with the presence of a dynamo in the convective core during the\nmain sequence, provoke significant asymmetries on mixed-mode frequency\nmultiplets during the red-giant branch. We show that these signatures may be\ndetectable in asteroseismic data for field amplitudes small enough for the\namplitude of the modes not to be affected by the conversion of gravity into\nAlfven waves inside the magnetised interior. Finally, we infer an upper limit\nfor the strength of the field, and the associated lower limit for the timescale\nof its action, to redistribute angular momentum in stellar interiors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 22:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The underlying idea of the proposed distance is to\ninterpret the gene expression array of a single cell as a discrete probability\nmeasure. The distance between two cells is hence computed by solving an Optimal\nTransport problem between the two corresponding discrete measures. In the\nOptimal Transport model, we use two types of cost function for measuring the\ndistance between a pair of genes. The first cost function exploits a gene\nembedding, called gene2vec, which is used to map each gene to a high\ndimensional vector: the cost of moving a unit of mass of gene expression from a\ngene to another is set to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding\nembedded vectors. The second cost function is based on a Pearson distance among\npairs of genes. In both cost functions, the more two genes are correlated, the\nlower is their distance. We exploit the Gene Mover's Distance to solve two\nclassification problems: the classification of cells according to their\ncondition and according to their type. To assess the impact of our new metric,\nwe compare the performances of a $k$-Nearest Neighbor classifier using\ndifferent distances.

The main use of Fanpy is to quickly prototype new methods by\nmaking it easier to transfer the mathematical conception of a new wavefunction\nans\\\"{a}tze to a working implementation. Fanpy uses the framework of our\nrecently introduced Flexible Ansatz for N-electron Configuration Interaction\n(FANCI), where multideterminant wavefunctions are represented by their overlaps\nwith Slater determinants of orthonormal spin-orbitals. In the simplest case, a\nnew wavefunction ansatz can be implemented by simply writing a function for\nevaluating its overlap with an arbitrary Slater determinant. Fanpy is modular\nin both implementation and theory: the wavefunction model, the system's\nHamiltonian, and the choice of objective function are all independent modules.\nThis modular structure makes it easy for users to mix and match different\nmethods and for developers to quickly try new ideas. Fanpy is written purely in\nPython with standard dependencies, making it accessible for most operating\nsystems; it adheres to principles of modern software development, including\ncomprehensive documentation, extensive testing, and continuous integration and\ndelivery protocols.

When normalized by\nmetal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between\nradial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the\ncosmic web. The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in\nlocal spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies.

As one example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency faced overwhelming, temporally scattered, a\npriori uncertain, and correlated demands for medical supplies from different\nstates. In such contexts, social planners aim to maximize the minimum fill rate\nacross sequentially arriving agents, where each agent's fill rate is determined\nby an irrevocable, one-time allocation. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence\nof demands, we establish upper bounds on the expected minimum fill rate\n(ex-post fairness) and the minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness)\nachievable by any policy. Our upper bounds are parameterized by the number of\nagents and the expected demand-to-supply ratio, yet we design a simple adaptive\npolicy called projected proportional allocation (PPA) that simultaneously\nachieves matching lower bounds for both objectives (ex-post and ex-ante\nfairness), for any set of parameters. Our PPA policy is transparent and easy to\nimplement, as it does not rely on distributional information beyond the first\nconditional moments.

In such a setting, our PPA policy significantly outperforms its\ntheoretical guarantee as well as the optimal target-fill-rate policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 00:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 21:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Most existing methods prefer to first sample sufficient candidate\nmoments with various temporal lengths, and then match them with the given query\nto determine the target moment. However, candidate moments generated with a\nfixed temporal granularity may be suboptimal to handle the large variation in\nmoment lengths. To this end, we propose a novel multi-stage Progressive\nLocalization Network (PLN) which progressively localizes the target moment in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, each stage of PLN has a localization\nbranch, and focuses on candidate moments that are generated with a specific\ntemporal granularity. The temporal granularities of candidate moments are\ndifferent across the stages. Moreover, we devise a conditional feature\nmanipulation module and an upsampling connection to bridge the multiple\nlocalization branches. In this fashion, the later stages are able to absorb the\npreviously learned information, thus facilitating the more fine-grained\nlocalization.

The two\nparameters, slit width ratio S/D (slit width/diameter) and slit angle (measured\nwith respect to the incoming flow direction), play an essential role in\ndetermining the trend of critical Reynolds number (Rec). Most of the analysis\ninvokes flow visualization and saturation amplitude methods to obtain the\ncritical Reynolds number (indicative of the onset of vortex shedding) for\ndifferent cases. Further, Hopf bifurcation analysis using Stuart-Landau\nequation and global stability analysis confirm the accuracy and consistency in\nthe predicted solutions.

The critical Reynolds number\nincreases with S/D of the modified cylinder at 0 deg slit angle (as an\nadditional amount of flow grows with S/D). The critical Reynolds number shows\nan increasing trend with the slit angle in the range of S/D (0.05-0.15) as the\nfluctuation intensity reduces with slit angle in this range.

Extending the analytical work of Waelbroeck et al [33]\nand Throumoulopoulos et al [34] in the sub-Alfv\\'enic flow shear regime for\nFadeev equilibrium, the super-Alfv\\'enic regime is studied for the first time\nnumerically. A wide range of values of shear flow amplitudes and shear scale\nlengths have been considered to understand the effect of sub-Alfv\\'enic and\nsuper-Alfv\\'enic flows on the coalescence instability and its nonlinear fate.\nWe find that for flow shear length scales greater than the magnetic island\nsize, the maximum reconnection rate decreases monotonically from sub-Alfv\\'enic\nto super- Alfv\\'enic flow speeds. For scale lengths smaller than the island\nsize, the reconnection rate decreases upto a critical value $v_{0c}$, beyond\nwhich, the shear flow is found to destabilize the islands. The value of v0c\ndecreases with decrease in the value of shear flow length scale. Interestingly,\nfor our range of parameters, we find suppression of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability in super-Alfv\\'enic flows even when the shear scale length is\nsmaller than the island width. Observation of velocity streamlines shows that\nthe plasma circulation inside the islands has a stabilizing influence in strong\nshear flow cases. Plasma circulation is also found to be responsible for\ndecrease in upstream velocity, causing less pile-up of magnetic flux on both\nsides of the reconnection sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 05:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

While point-based\ndetection networks achieve superior results on dental images, it is still a\nchallenging task to distinguish adjacent teeth because of their similar\ntopologies and proximate nature. In this study, we propose a point-based tooth\nlocalization network that effectively disentangles each individual tooth based\non a Gaussian disentanglement objective function. The proposed network first\nperforms heatmap regression accompanied by box regression for all the\nanatomical teeth. A novel Gaussian disentanglement penalty is employed by\nminimizing the sum of the pixel-wise multiplication of the heatmaps for all\nadjacent teeth pairs. Subsequently, individual tooth segmentation is performed\nby converting a pixel-wise labeling task to a distance map regression task to\nminimize false positives in adjacent regions of the teeth. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\nby increasing the average precision of detection by 9.1%, which results in a\nhigh performance in terms of individual tooth segmentation.

In this\npaper, we present a Smoothness-Inducing Sequential Variational Auto-Encoder\n(SISVAE) model for robust estimation and anomaly detection of multi-dimensional\ntime series. Our model is based on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and its\nbackbone is fulfilled by a Recurrent Neural Network to capture latent temporal\nstructures of time series for both generative model and inference model.\nSpecifically, our model parameterizes mean and variance for each time-stamp\nwith flexible neural networks, resulting in a non-stationary model that can\nwork without the assumption of constant noise as commonly made by existing\nMarkov models. However, such a flexibility may cause the model fragile to\nanomalies. To achieve robust density estimation which can also benefit\ndetection tasks, we propose a smoothness-inducing prior over possible\nestimations. The proposed prior works as a regularizer that places penalty at\nnon-smooth reconstructions. Our model is learned efficiently with a novel\nstochastic gradient variational Bayes estimator. In particular, we study two\ndecision criteria for anomaly detection: reconstruction probability and\nreconstruction error. We show the effectiveness of our model on both synthetic\ndatasets and public real-world benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 06:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The fabrication of such doubly\ninhomogeneous waveplates (d-plates) is more complex, compared to that of singly\ninhomogeneous waveplates (s-plates) having uniform retardance, which can be\neasily fabricated by different means such as photoalignment of liquid crystals,\nmetasurfaces etc. Here, exploiting the SU(2) formalism, we establish\nanalytically that any d-plate can be equivalently implemented using a pair of\nquarter-wave s-plates and a half-wave s-plate. An important advantage of this\nmethod is that it gives the flexibility to realize a whole family of distinct\nd-plates using the same triplet of s-plates. To underline the scope of this\nmethod, we propose novel d-plates for spatially tailoring the phase and complex\namplitudes of light beams. Towards complex amplitude shaping, we present a\ngeneric method for carving out higher-order eigenmodes of light using a d-plate\nin conjugation with a polarizer.

For these two\nillustrations, the corresponding three-s-plate gadget is constructed, and its\nfunctioning is validated with extensive numerical simulations.

Graph coarsening is one popular technique to reduce the size of a\ngraph while maintaining essential properties. Despite rich graph coarsening\nliterature, there is only limited exploration of data-driven methods in the\nfield. In this work, we leverage the recent progress of deep learning on graphs\nfor graph coarsening. We first propose a framework for measuring the quality of\ncoarsening algorithm and show that depending on the goal, we need to carefully\nchoose the Laplace operator on the coarse graph and associated projection/lift\noperators. Motivated by the observation that the current choice of edge weight\nfor the coarse graph may be sub-optimal, we parametrize the weight assignment\nmap with graph neural networks and train it to improve the coarsening quality\nin an unsupervised way. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal networks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves common\ngraph coarsening methods under various metrics, reduction ratios, graph sizes,\nand graph types. It generalizes to graphs of larger size ($25\\times$ of\ntraining graphs), is adaptive to different losses (differentiable and\nnon-differentiable), and scales to much larger graphs than previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 06:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Often, these criteria may not\nbe readily compared and sometimes lie in competition with each other. Simply\napplying standard multi-objective search algorithms to multi-agent path finding\nmay prove to be inefficient because the size of the space of possible\nsolutions, i.e., the Pareto-optimal set, can grow exponentially with the number\nof agents (the dimension of the search space).

The time-dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface is\nused to calculate the fluxes for the updating the cell-averaged flow variables\nand to evaluate the time accurate cell-averaged flow variables as well for\nevolving the cell-averaged gradients of flow variables. With the accurate\nevolution model for both flow variables and their slopes, the quality of the\nscheme depends closely on the accuracy and reliability of the initial\nreconstruction of flow variables. The reconstruction scheme becomes more\nchallenge on tetrahedral mesh, where the conventional second-order unlimited\nleast-square reconstruction can make the scheme be linearly unstable when using\ncell-averaged conservative variables alone with von Neumann neighbors.\nBenefiting from the evolved cell-averaged slopes, on tetrahedral mesh the GKS\nis linearly stable from a compact third-order smooth reconstruction with a\nlarge CFL number. In order to further increase the robustness of the high-order\ncompact GKS for capturing discontinuous solution, a new two-step\nmulti-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction\nwill be proposed. The novelty of the reconstruction includes the following.\nFirstly, it releases the stability issue from a second-order compact\nreconstruction through the introduction of a pre-reconstruction step. Secondly,\nin the third-order non-linear reconstruction, only one more large stencil is\nadded beside those in the second-order one, which significantly simplifies the\nhigh-order reconstruction. The proposed third-order scheme shows good\nrobustness in high speed flow computation and favorable mesh adaptability in\ncases with complex geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 07:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

While prior\nwork proposes limiting the number of layers that are fine-tuned, e.g., freezing\nall layers but the last layer, we find that such static approaches lead to\nreduced accuracy. We propose, AutoFreeze, a system that uses an adaptive\napproach to choose which layers are trained and show how this can accelerate\nmodel fine-tuning while preserving accuracy. We also develop mechanisms to\nenable efficient caching of intermediate activations which can reduce the\nforward computation time when performing fine-tuning.

Our evaluation on ten NLP tasks shows that\nAutoFreeze, with caching enabled, can improve fine-tuning on a single GPU by up\nto 2.55x.

If the qualitative synthesis problem is not solvable or the\nsynthesized solution is too restrictive, then we further investigate the\nquantitative synthesis problem so that the secret is revealed (if unavoidable)\nas late as possible. Effective algorithms are provided to solve both the\nqualitative and quantitative synthesis problems. Specifically, by building\nsuitable information structures that involve information delays, we show that\nthe optimal qualitative synthesis problem can be solved as a safety-game. The\noptimal quantitative synthesis problem can also be solved as an optimal\ntotal-cost control problem over an augmented information structure. Our work\nprovides a complete solution to the standard infinite-step opacity control\nproblem, which has not been solved without assumption on the relationship\nbetween controllable events and observable events. Furthermore, we generalize\nthe opacity enforcement problem to the numerical setting by introducing the\nsecret-revelation-time as a new quantitative measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 09:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Second, the technical requirements of\n6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in\na quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and\nactivities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a\ntentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation\nis projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce\ntheir principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally,\nthe conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of \"What 6G may look like?\". This\nsurvey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and\nfurther investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G\ncommunications systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 10:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

The special cases of $\\alpha = 0.5$ and $\\alpha = 1$ have\nalready been investigated thoroughly. In this work $\\alpha$ is generalized to\nany real number in the interval $]0,1[$. For $\\alpha=0.5$, this term appears in\nthe solution of distributed diffusion systems, which will serve as a source of\ninspiration for this work. Both frequency and time domain are investigated.\nHowever, regarding the latter, no closed-form expression of the inverse Laplace\ntransform of the FDD can be found for all $\\alpha$, so numerical tools are used\nto obtain an impulse response of the FDD. To establish the algorithm, several\nproperties of the FDD term have been proven: firstly, existence of the term,\nsecondly, invariance of the time integral of the impulse response, and thirdly,\ndependency of the impulse response's energy on $\\alpha$. To conclude, the\nFOPFDD model is fitted to several delay-dominant, diffusive-like\nresistors-capacitors (RC) circuits to show the increased modeling accuracy\ncompared to other state-of-the-art models found in literature.

Considering that magnesia undergoes hydration when exposed to water\nand the generated hydrated phase needs to be properly accommodated in the\nresulting microstructure to inhibit the generation of cracks, it is very\nimportant to find out alternatives to control the MgO hydration reaction rate.\nThis research investigated the use of aluminum lactate (AL) as a likely\nadditive to change the hydration and drying behavior of vibratable castables\nbonded with different MgO sources (dead burnt, caustic or fumed one). Firstly,\nXRD, TG and DSC measurements of magnesia-based aqueous suspensions were\nevaluated to identify the AL effect on changing the hydration reaction products\nduring the curing and drying steps. After that, Al2O3-MgO refractories were\nprepared and their flowability, curing behavior, cold flexural strength,\napparent porosity, permeability and explosion resistance were evaluated. The\nresults indicated that, instead of Mg(OH)2, Mg6Al2(OH)16(OH)2.4.5H2O/\nMg6Al2(OH)16(CO3).4H2O was the main hydrated phase identified in the\nAL-containing compositions. Due to this change in the hydration behavior of the\nrefractories, the mixtures prepared with dead-burnt or magnesia fumes plus\norganic salt presented a longer setting time. Besides that, crack-free samples\nwith improved permeability and green mechanical strength could be obtained when\nadding 0.5 wt.% or 1.0 wt.% of aluminum lactate to the tested castable\ncompositions. Consequently, 1.0 wt.% of the selected additive favored the\ndesign of refractories with enhanced properties and greater spalling\nresistance, as no explosion could be observed even when subjecting the prepared\nsamples to severe heating conditions (20C/min).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 11:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The existence of such global properties incompatible\nwith all local properties constitutes what I call \"mereological holism\"--the\ndistinctive holism of Quantum Theory. Mereological holism has the dramatic\nconceptual consequence of making untenable the usual understanding of the\n\"quantum system\" as being a \"physical object\", since composed objects have\nproperties compatible with those of its parts. The notion of \"property\" can be\nextended in a unique way to the whole class of operational probabilistic\ntheories (shortly OPTs), of which the most relevant cases are Quantum Theory\nand Classical Theory. Whereas Classical Theory is not mereologically holistic,\nwe can now search for other OPTs that are so. Within the OPT framework the role\nof the \"system\" is that of an input-output connection between two objective\nevents. In non holistic theories, such as Classical Theory, the system can\nstill be regarded as an \"object\". On the contrary, in holistic theories\ninterpreting \"system\" as \"object\" constitutes an hypostatization of a\ntheoretical notion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 11:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Joint models and landmark models have been\nproposed to compute individual dynamic predictions from repeated measures to\none or two markers. However, they hardly extend to the case where the complete\npatient history includes much more repeated markers possibly. Our objective was\nthus to propose a solution for the dynamic prediction of a health event that\nmay exploit repeated measures of a possibly large number of markers. We\ncombined a landmark approach extended to endogenous markers history with\nmachine learning methods adapted to survival data. Each marker trajectory is\nmodeled using the information collected up to landmark time, and summary\nvariables that best capture the individual trajectories are derived. These\nsummaries and additional covariates are then included in different prediction\nmethods. To handle a possibly large dimensional history, we rely on machine\nlearning methods adapted to survival data, namely regularized regressions and\nrandom survival forests, to predict the event from the landmark time, and we\nshow how they can be combined into a superlearner. Then, the performances are\nevaluated by cross-validation using estimators of Brier Score and the area\nunder the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve adapted to censored data. We\ndemonstrate in a simulation study the benefits of machine learning survival\nmethods over standard survival models, especially in the case of numerous\nand/or nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the event. We then\napplied the methodology in two prediction contexts: a clinical context with the\nprediction of death for patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a public\nhealth context with the prediction of death in the general elderly population\nat different ages. Our methodology, implemented in R, enables the prediction of\nan event using the entire longitudinal patient history, even when the number of\nrepeated markers is large. Although introduced with mixed models for the\nrepeated markers and methods for a single right censored time-to-event, our\nmethod can be used with any other appropriate modeling technique for the\nmarkers and can be easily extended to competing risks setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 12:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 08:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

In the first part of this thesis,\nafter a review of the reduction of couplings method and the properties of\nfiniteness, four models are analysed: a reduced version of the minimal $N=1$\n$SU(5)$, a finite $N=1$ $SU(5)$, a two-loop finite $N=1$ $SU(3)^3$ and a\nreduced version of the MSSM. An update in the phenomenological evaluation is\nthe improved light Higgs-boson mass prediction as provided by the FeynHiggs\ncode. The first three models predict heavy SUSY spectra (produced using the\nFeynHiggs and SPheno codes) that start just above the TeV scale, consistent\nwith the non-observation LHC results, while the reduced MSSM results in a\npseudoscalar Higgs boson mass $M_A$ that is ruled out by recent results of the\nATLAS experiment.

In software\nengineering, PMC formulae can be used during design, e.g., to analyse the\nsensitivity of different system architectures to parametric variability, or to\nfind optimal system configurations. They can also be used at runtime, e.g., to\ncheck if non-functional requirements are still satisfied after environmental\nchanges, or to select new configurations after such changes. However, current\nPMC techniques do not scale well to systems with complex behaviour and more\nthan a few parameters.

To this end, fPMC partitions the\nMarkov models that PMC operates with into \\emph{fragments} whose reachability\nproperties are analysed independently, and obtains PMC reachability formulae by\ncombining the results of these fragment analyses. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of fPMC, we show how our fPMC tool can analyse three systems\n(taken from the research literature, and belonging to different application\ndomains) with which current PMC techniques and tools struggle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 13:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We do this by including non-Hermitian bilinear terms into the 3+1\ndimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Two possible bilinear\nmodifications give rise to $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric theories; this happens when\nthe standard NJL model is extended either by a pseudovector background field\n$ig \\bar\\psi\\gamma_5 B_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu \\psi$ or by an antisymmetric-tensor\nbackground field $g \\bar\\psi F_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu \\psi$. The three\nremaining bilinears are {\\it anti}-$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric in nature, $ig\n\\bar\\psi B_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu \\psi, ig\\bar\\psi \\gamma_5 \\psi$ and $ig\\bar\\psi\n{1}\\psi$, so that the Hamiltonian then has no overall symmetry. The\npseudovector $ig \\bar\\psi\\gamma_5 B_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu \\psi$ and the vector $ig\n\\bar\\psi B_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu \\psi$ combinations, are, in addition, chirally\nsymmetric. Thus, within this framework we are able to examine the effects that\nthe various combinations of non-Hermiticity, $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, chiral\nsymmetry and the two-body interactions of the NJL model have on the existence\nand dynamical generation of a real effective fermion mass (a feature which is\nabsent in the corresponding modified massless free Dirac models) as well as on\nthe masses of the composite particles, the pseudoscalar and scalar mesonic\nmodes ($\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ mesons). Our findings demonstrate that $\\mathcal{PT}$\nsymmetry is not necessary for real fermion mass solutions to exist, rather the\ntwo-body interactions of the NJL model supersede the non-Hermitian bilinear\neffects. The effects of chiral symmetry are evident most clearly in the meson\nmodes, the pseudoscalar of which will always be Goldstone in nature if the\nsystem is chirally symmetric. Second solutions of the mesonic equations are\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 13:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Thus, their study provides a great means to test and\nconstrain model predictions in relation to the distributions of heavy elements\nor the neutron star kicks, both of which are key to better understanding the\nexplosion mechanisms in core-collapse supernovae. The use of a novel blind\nsource separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the\nwell-known Cassiopeia A SNR has revealed maps of the distribution of the ejecta\nendowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clearly separated from\ncontinuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional view of the\nejecta by disentangling the red- and blue-shifted spectral components and\nassociated images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe, providing insights into the\nmorphology of the ejecta distribution in Cassiopeia A. These mappings allow us\nto thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the heavy elements distribution\nand probe simulation predictions about the neutron star kicks and the relative\nasymmetries between the different elements. We find in our study that most of\nthe ejecta X-ray flux stems from the red-shifted component, suggesting an\nasymmetry in the explosion. In addition, the red-shifted ejecta can physically\nbe described as a broad, relatively symmetric plume, whereas the blue-shifted\nejecta is more similar to a dense knot. The neutron star also moves directly\nopposite to the red-shifted parts of the ejecta similar to what is seen with\n44Ti. Regarding the morphological asymmetries, it appears that heavier elements\nhave more asymmetrical distributions, which confirms predictions made by\nsimulations.

Further, our technique permits\nelegant recovery and generalizations of the key results on permute-and-add\nnetwork codes known in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 14:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 06:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 10:32:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 00:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

We acknowledge and address two\nrecurring issues in the field of computational catalyst discovery. First,\ncalculating macro-scale catalyst properties is not straight-forward when using\nensembles of atomic-scale calculations (e.g., density functional theory). We\nattempt to address this issue by creating a multiscale model that estimates\nbulk catalyst activity using adsorption energy predictions from both density\nfunctional theory and machine learning models. The second issue is that many\ncatalyst discovery efforts seek to optimize catalyst properties, but\noptimization is an inherently exploitative objective that is in tension with\nthe explorative nature of early-stage discovery projects. In other words: why\ninvest so much time finding a \"best\" catalyst when it is likely to fail for\nsome other, unforeseen problem? We address this issue by relaxing the catalyst\ndiscovery goal into a classification problem: \"What is the set of catalysts\nthat is worth testing experimentally?\" Here we present a catalyst discovery\nmethod called myopic multiscale sampling, which combines multiscale modeling\nwith automated selection of density functional theory calculations. It is an\nactive classification strategy that seeks to classify catalysts as \"worth\ninvestigating\" or \"not worth investigating\" experimentally.

An integer valued\nsequence $(a_n)_{n\\ge 0}$ is called a pseudo-polynomial when it satisfies these\ncongruences. Hall characterized pseudo-polynomials and proved that they are not\nnecessarily polynomials. A long standing conjecture of Ruzsa says that a\npseudo-polynomial $a_n$ is a polynomial as soon as $\\limsup_n \\vert\na_n\\vert^{1/n}<e$. Under this growth assumption, Perelli and Zannier proved\nthat the generating series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^n$ is a $G$-function.

In addition, we observed a hysteresis behavior upon temperature\ncycling, i.e. a different evolution in microgel size and shape depending on\nwhether the microgel was initially adsorbed to the interface in expanded or\ncollapsed state. Here, we model the volume phase transition of such microgels\nat an air/water interface by monomer-resolved Brownian dynamics simulations and\ncompare the observed behavior with experiments. We reproduce the experimentally\nobserved hysteresis in the microgel dimensions upon temperature variation. Our\nsimulations did not observe any hysteresis for microgels dispersed in the bulk\nliquid, suggesting that it results from the distinct interfacial morphology of\nthe microgel adsorbed at the liquid interface. An initially collapsed microgel\nbrought to the interface and subjected to subsequent swelling and collapsing\n(resp. cooling and heating) will end up in a larger size than it had in the\noriginal collapsed state. Further temperature cycling, however, only shows a\nmuch reduced hysteresis, in agreement with our experimental observations. We\nattribute the hysteretic behavior to a kinetically trapped initial collapsed\nconfiguration, which relaxes upon expanding in the swollen state. We find a\nsimilar behavior for linear PNiPAm chains adsorbed to an interface. Our\ncombined experimental - simulation investigation provides new insights into the\nvolume phase transition of PNiPAm materials adsorbed to liquid interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 15:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Given an unweighted graph, this problem\nasks for a maximum cardinality set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. Some of\nthe most successful algorithms for this problem are based on the\nbranch-and-bound or branch-and-reduce paradigms. In particular,\nbranch-and-reduce algorithms, which combine branch-and-bound with reduction\nrules, achieved substantial results, solving many previously infeasible\ninstances. These results were to a large part achieved by developing new, more\npractical reduction rules. However, other components that have been shown to\nhave an impact on the performance of these algorithms have not received as much\nattention. One of these is the branching strategy, which determines what vertex\nis included or excluded in a potential solution. The most commonly used\nstrategy selects vertices based on their degree and does not take into account\nother factors that contribute to the performance. In this work, we develop and\nevaluate several novel branching strategies for both branch-and-bound and\nbranch-and-reduce algorithms. Our strategies are based on one of two\napproaches. They either (1) aim to decompose the graph into two or more\nconnected components which can then be solved independently, or (2) try to\nremove vertices that hinder the application of a reduction rule. Our\nexperiments on a large set of real-world instances indicate that our strategies\nare able to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art branch-and-reduce\nalgorithms. To be more specific, our reduction-based packing branching rule is\nable to outperform the default branching strategy of selecting a vertex of\nhighest degree on 65% of all instances tested. Furthermore, our\ndecomposition-based strategy based on edge cuts is able to achieve a speedup of\n2.29 on sparse networks (1.22 on all instances).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 15:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

The variational parameters evolve deterministically\naccording to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact\nimaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance. Rather\nthan working with a fixed variational ansatz, where the McLachlan distance is\nconstrained by the quality of the ansatz, the AVQITE method iteratively expands\nthe ansatz along the dynamical path to keep the McLachlan distance below a\nchosen threshold.

Aiming at ultra-fast\ndynamic loads, the spall failure of a liquid under tension is approximated as\nan instantaneous decomposition of metastable states upon reaching the spinodal\nstability limit of an appropriate two-phase liquid-gas equation of state. The\nspall energy dissipation occurs as entropy jumps in two types of discontinuous\nsolutions, namely, in hypersonic spall fronts and in pull-back compression\nshocks. Practical application of the proposed model is illustrated with\nnumerical simulations and a detailed analysis of a particular problem of\nsymmetric plate impact. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement\nwith the previously published molecular-dynamics simulations. Also, new\napproximate nonlinear formulae are derived for evaluation of the strain rate,\nfractured mass, and spall strength in terms of the observed variation of the\nfree-surface velocity. The new formula for the spall strength clarifies complex\ninterplay of the three first-order nonlinear correction terms and establishes a\nuniversal value of the correction factor for attenuation of the spall pulse,\nwhich in the limit of weak initial loads is independent of the equation of\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 15:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

However, there is still a controversy on the main epoch of\nformation of BCGs, since some authors believe they have already formed before\nredshift z=2, while others still find them to evolve at more recent epochs. We\naim to analyse the physical properties of a large sample of BCGs covering a\nwide redshift range up to z=1.8 and analysed in a homogeneous way, to see if\ntheir characteristics vary with redshift. As a first step, we also present a\nnew tool to define for each cluster which galaxy is the BCG. For a sample of\n137 clusters with HST images in the optical and/or infrared, we analyse the BCG\nproperties by applying GALFIT with one or two Sersic components. For each BCG,\nwe compute the Sersic index, effective radius, major axis position angle,\nsurface brightness. We then search for correlations of these quantities with\nredshift. We find that BCGs follow the Kormendy relation (between the effective\nradius and the mean surface brightness), with a slope that remains constant\nwith redshift, but with a variation with redshift of the ordinate at the\norigin. Although the trends are faint, we find that both the absolute\nmagnitudes and effective radii tend to become respectively brighter and bigger\nwith decreasing redshift. On the other hand, we find no significant correlation\nof the mean surface brightnesses or Sersic indices with redshift.

The gauges potentially support IS scholars for\nan objective evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of token governance\nand for fast iteration in design-driven governance mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 09:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 12:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

We used this\nhistory-dependence of the dynamic behavior of the device to uniquely retrieve\ninformation pre-coded in the charging waveform pattern.

In the expression for the energy\ndensity, the rest mass density along with the kinetic energy density of the\nfluid constituents due to their random motion, which contributes to the\npressure as well, are already included. However, in a fluid with a bulk motion,\nthere are, in addition, a couple of explicit, pressure-dependent terms in the\nenergy-momentum densities, whose presence to an extent, is shrouded in mystery,\nespecially from a physical perspective. We show here that one such\npressure-dependent term appearing in the energy density, represents the work\ndone by the fluid pressure against the Lorentz contraction during transition\nfrom the rest frame of the fluid to another frame in which the fluid has a bulk\nmotion. This applies equally to the electromagnetic energy density of\nelectrically charged systems in motion and explains in a natural manner an\napparently paradoxical result that the field energy of a charged capacitor\nsystem decreases with an increase in the system velocity. The momentum density\nincludes another pressure-dependent term, that represents an energy flow across\nthe system, due to the opposite signs of work being done by pressure on two\nopposite sides of the moving fluid. From Maxwell's stress tensor we demonstrate\nthat in the expression for electromagnetic momentum of an electric charged\nparticle, it is the presence of a similar pressure term, arising from\nelectrical self-repulsion forces in the charged sphere, that yields a natural\nsolution for the notorious, more than a century old but thought by many as\nstill unresolved, 4/3 problem in the electromagnetic momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 15:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}
