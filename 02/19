Nevertheless, researchers\nhave argued that the lack of clearly defined practices led to limited adoption\nof experimentation. In this regard, the first step is to define the hypotheses\nbased on which teams will create experiments. Objective: We aim to develop a\nsystematic technique to identify hypotheses for early-stage software startups.\nMethods: We followed a Design Science approach consisted of three cycles in the\nconstruction phase, that involved seven startups in total, and an evaluation of\nthe final artifact within three startups. Results: We developed the HyMap, a\nhypotheses elicitation technique based on cognitive mapping. It consists of a\nvisual language to depict a cognitive map representing the founder's\nunderstanding of the product, and a process to elicit this map consisted of a\nseries of questions the founder must answer. Our evaluation showed that the\nartifacts are clear, easy to use, and useful leading to hypotheses and\nfacilitating founders to visualize their idea. Conclusion: Our study\ncontributes to both descriptive and prescriptive bodies of knowledge. Regarding\nthe first, it provides a better understanding of the guidance founders use to\ndevelop their startups and, for the latter, a technique to identify hypotheses\nin early-stage software startups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:29:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 13:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Motivated by this, we present a theory of localisation in\nquasiperiodic chains with nearest-neighbour hoppings, based on the convergence\nof local propagators; exploiting the fact that the imaginary part of the\nassociated self-energy acts as a probabilistic order parameter for localisation\ntransitions and, importantly, admits a continued-fraction representation.\nAnalysing the convergence of these continued fractions, localisation or its\nabsence can be determined, yielding in turn the critical points and mobility\nedges. Interestingly, we find anomalous scalings of the order parameter with\nsystem size at the critical points, consistent with the fractal character of\ncritical eigenstates. Self-consistent theories at high orders are also\nconsidered, shown to be conceptually connected to the theory based on continued\nfractions, and found in practice to converge to the same result. Results are\nexemplified by analysing the theory for three quasiperiodic models covering a\nrange of behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 19:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Prediction explanation is important,\nespecially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of\ndeploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care.\nThus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model\nexplainability and introspection. Specific problem: A new approach is to\ntransform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the\nprediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are\nmonolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our approach:\nGiven an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient\nupdate (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a\nspecific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction.\nWe use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their\nperformance.

Despite the promise of formal\nverification in ensuring the reliability of neural networks, progress in the\ndirection of probabilistic specifications has been limited. In this direction,\nwe first introduce a general formulation of probabilistic specifications for\nneural networks, which captures both probabilistic networks (e.g., Bayesian\nneural networks, MC-Dropout networks) and uncertain inputs (distributions over\ninputs arising from sensor noise or other perturbations). We then propose a\ngeneral technique to verify such specifications by generalizing the notion of\nLagrangian duality, replacing standard Lagrangian multipliers with \"functional\nmultipliers\" that can be arbitrary functions of the activations at a given\nlayer. We show that an optimal choice of functional multipliers leads to exact\nverification (i.e., sound and complete verification), and for specific forms of\nmultipliers, we develop tractable practical verification algorithms.\n  We empirically validate our algorithms by applying them to Bayesian Neural\nNetworks (BNNs) and MC Dropout Networks, and certifying properties such as\nadversarial robustness and robust detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\nOn these tasks we are able to provide significantly stronger guarantees when\ncompared to prior work -- for instance, for a VGG-64 MC-Dropout CNN trained on\nCIFAR-10, we improve the certified AUC (a verified lower bound on the true AUC)\nfor robust OOD detection (on CIFAR-100) from $0\\% \\rightarrow 29\\%$.

Consequently, for each hard-scatter interaction only\none such presampled event needs to be added as part of the simulation chain.\nFor the Run 2 simulation chain, with an average of 35 interactions per bunch\ncrossing, this new method provides a substantial reduction in MC production CPU\nneeds of around 20%, while reproducing the properties of the reconstructed\nquantities relevant for physics analyses with good accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 10:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The\nspin period of the neutron star was determined to be $3.61398\\pm 0.00002$ s at\nMJD 57978. We measured the period variability and extract the orbital elements\nof the binary system. The angle of periastron evolved with a rate of\n$0.048\\pm0.003$ $yr^{-1}$. The light curves are folded to sketch the pulse\nprofiles in different energy ranges. A multi-peak structure in 1-10 keV is\nclearly illustrated. We introduced wavelet analysis into our data analysis\nprocedures to study QPO signals and perform a detailed wavelet analysis in many\ndifferent energy ranges. Through the wavelet spectra, we report the discovery\nof a QPO at the frequency $\\sim 10$ mHz. In addition, the X-ray light curves\nshowed multiple QPOs in the period of $\\sim 16-32 $ s and $\\sim 67- 200 $ s. We\nfound that the $\\sim100$ s QPO was significant in most of the observations and\nenergies. There exist positive relations between X-ray luminosity and their\nQ-factors and S-factors, while the QPO periods have no correlation with X-ray\nluminosity. In wavelet phase maps, we found that the pulse phase of $\\sim 67-\n200 $ s QPO drifting frequently while the $\\sim 16-32 $ s QPO scarcely\ndrifting. The dissipation of oscillations from high energy to low energy was\nalso observed. These features of QPOs in 4U 0115+63 provide new challenge to\nour understanding of their physical origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

One\nof the recent additions to this experimental toolbox is the Floquet\nengineering, where periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian allows the creation\nof effective potentials that do not exist otherwise. When subject to external\nmodulations, however, generic interacting many-body systems absorb energy, thus\nposing a heating problem that may impair the usefulness of this method. For\ndiscrete systems with bounded local energy, an exponentially suppressed heating\nrate with the driving frequency has been observed previously, leaving the\nsystem in a prethermal state for exceedingly long durations. But for systems in\ncontinuous space, the situation remains unclear. Here we show that Floquet\nengineering can be employed to a strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gas held\nin a flat box-like potential without inducing excessive heating on\nexperimentally relevant timescales. The driving eliminates the effect of a\nspin-dependent potential originating from a simultaneous magnetic levitation of\ntwo different spin states. We calculate the heating rate and obtain a power-law\nsuppression with the drive frequency. To further test the many-body behavior of\nthe driven gas, we measure both the pair-condensation fraction at unitarity and\nthe contact parameter across the BEC-BCS crossover. At low driving frequencies,\nthe condensate fraction is reduced by the time-dependent force, but at higher\nfrequencies, it revives and attains an even higher value than without driving.\nOur results are promising for future exploration of exotic many-body phases of\na bulk strongly-interacting Fermi gas with dynamically engineered Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 16:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

Here we analyze optical forces acting on a high refractive index\nsilicon sphere in a focused Gaussian beam and reveal new regimes of particles\nanti-trapping. Multipolar analysis allows separating an optical force into\ninterception and recoil components, which have a completely different physical\nnature resulting in different mechanical actions. In particular, interplaying\ninterception radial forces and multipolar resonances within a particle can lead\nto either trapping or anti-trapping scenarios, depending of the overall system\nparameters. At the same time, the recoil force generates a significant\nazimuthal component along with an angular-dependent radial force. Those\ncontribution enable enhancing either trapping or anti-trapping regimes and also\nintroduce bending reactions. These effects are linked to the far-field\nmultipole interference resulting and, specifically, to its asymmetric\nscattering diagrams. The later approach is extremely useful, as it allows\nassessing the nature of optomechanical motion by observing far-field patterns.\nMultipolar engineering of optical forces, being quite general approach, is not\nnecessarily linked to simple spherical shapes and paves a way to new\npossibilities in microfluidic applications, including sorting and micro\nassembly of nontrivial volumetric geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

Since these networks\nmainly rely on line-of-sight (LOS) links, sudden link blockages highly threaten\nthe reliability of the networks. Further, when the LOS link is blocked, the\nnetwork typically needs to hand off the user to another LOS basestation, which\nmay incur critical time latency, especially if a search over a large codebook\nof narrow beams is needed. A promising way to tackle the reliability and\nlatency challenges lies in enabling proaction in wireless networks. Proaction\nbasically allows the network to anticipate blockages, especially dynamic\nblockages, and initiate user hand-off beforehand. This paper presents a\ncomplete machine learning framework for enabling proaction in wireless networks\nrelying on visual data captured, for example, by RGB cameras deployed at the\nbase stations. In particular, the paper proposes a vision-aided wireless\ncommunication solution that utilizes bimodal machine learning to perform\nproactive blockage prediction and user hand-off. The bedrock of this solution\nis a deep learning algorithm that learns from visual and wireless data how to\npredict incoming blockages. The predictions of this algorithm are used by the\nwireless network to proactively initiate hand-off decisions and avoid any\nunnecessary latency. The algorithm is developed on a vision-wireless dataset\ngenerated using the ViWi data-generation framework. Experimental results on two\nbasestations with different cameras indicate that the algorithm is capable of\naccurately detecting incoming blockages more than $\\sim 90\\%$ of the time. Such\nblockage prediction ability is directly reflected in the accuracy of proactive\nhand-off, which also approaches $87\\%$. This highlights a promising direction\nfor enabling high reliability and low latency in future wireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 18:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 00:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

To circumvent this problem, we propose to automate the creation\nof a realistic training dataset by exploiting techniques stemming from special\neffects and harnessing them to target training performance rather than visual\nappeal.

Taking full-disc observations from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examined the intensity contrast of network\nand faculae in the continuum and core of the Fe I 6173 {\\AA} line and 1700\n{\\AA}, including the variation with magnetic flux density, distance from disc\ncentre, nearby magnetic fields, and time. The brightness of network and faculae\nis believed to be suppressed by nearby magnetic fields from its effect on\nconvection. The difference in intensity contrast between the quiet-Sun network\nand active region faculae, noted by various studies, arises because active\nregions are more magnetically crowded and is not due to any fundamental\nphysical differences between network and faculae. These results highlight that\nsolar irradiance models need to include the effect of nearby magnetic fields on\nnetwork and faculae brightness. We found evidence that suggests that departures\nfrom local thermal equilibrium (LTE) might have limited effect on intensity\ncontrast. This could explain why solar irradiance models that are based on the\nintensity contrast of solar surface magnetic features calculated assuming LTE\nreproduce the observed spectral variability even where the LTE assumption\nbreaks down. Certain models of solar irradiance employ chromospheric indices as\ndirect indications of the effect of network and faculae on solar irradiance.\nBased on past studies of the Ca II K line and on the intensity contrast\nmeasurements derived here, we show that the fluctuations in chromospheric\nemission from network and faculae are a reasonable estimate of the emission\nfluctuations in the middle photosphere, but not of those in the lower\nphotosphere.

The correlator is re-expressed as a sum over a\ntwo dimensional lattice that is valid for all $N$ and all values of the complex\nYang-Mills coupling $\\tau$. In this form it is manifestly invariant under\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ Montonen-Olive duality.

Under belief space planning (BSP), in a partially observable\nsetting, it involves calculating the expected accumulated belief-dependent\nreward, where the expectation is with respect to all future measurements. Since\nsolving this general un-approximated problem quickly becomes intractable, state\nof the art approaches turn to approximations while still calculating planning\nsessions from scratch. In this work we propose a novel paradigm, Incremental\nBSP (iX-BSP), based on the key insight that calculations across planning\nsessions are similar in nature and can be appropriately re-used. We calculate\nthe expectation incrementally by utilizing Multiple Importance Sampling\ntechniques for selective re-sampling and re-use of measurement from previous\nplanning sessions. The formulation of our approach considers general\ndistributions and accounts for data association aspects.

The field-induced metallic regime of YbB$_{12}$ is characterised\nby more Fermi surface sheets of heavy quasiparticle effective mass that emerge\nin addition to the heavy Fermi surface sheets yielding multiple quantum\noscillation frequencies below 1000 T observed in both insulating and metallic\nregimes. We thus observe a heavy multi-component Fermi surface in which\n$f$-electron hybridisation persists from the unconventional insulating to the\nfield-induced metallic regime of YbB$_{12}$, which is in distinct contrast to\nthe unhybridised conduction electron Fermi surface observed in the case of the\nunconventional insulator SmB$_6$. Our findings require a different theoretical\nmodel of neutral in-gap low energy excitations in which the $f$-electron\nhybridisation is retained in the case of the unconventional insulator\nYbB$_{12}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 18:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 15:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

One\nopen question is the geometry of accretion and how material arrives and mixes\nin the white dwarf surface layers.

We couple newly derived horizontal diffusion coefficients\nwith previously published vertical diffusion coefficients to provide\ntheoretical constraints on surface spreading of metals in white dwarfs. Our\ngrid of 3D simulations probes the vast majority of the parameter space of\nconvective white dwarfs, with pure-hydrogen atmospheres in the effective\ntemperature range 6000-18000 K and pure-helium atmospheres in the range\n12000-34000 K.

If the extinction curve was truly universal, the strength of the\nrelationship and the linearity would naturally be maintained for extinction at\nany wavelength, and also for N(H) vs. E(B-V). However, extinction curves vary\nwithin the Milky Way, and there is no reason why, except by chance, either\nE(B-V) or A(V) would be the most physical measure of dust column density. In\nthis paper, we utilize for the first time full extinction curves to 41 MW\nsightlines and find that the scatter between N(H) and extinction is minimized\n-- and the relation becomes linear -- for extinction at 2900 +/- 160 A.

We find the ortho-to-para ratio of $\\rm C_3H_2$ is consistent\nwith 3 throughout extent of the emission, and the total abundance of both $\\rm\nC_3H_2$ isomers is $(7.5-10)\\times10^{-11}$ per H atom, or $1-10$% of the\npreviously published $\\rm C_2H$ abundance in the same source. We find $\\rm\nC_3H_2$ comes from a layer near the surface that extends no deeper than\n$z/r=0.25$. Our observations are consistent with substantial radial variation\nin gas-phase C/O in TW Hya, with a sharp increase outside $\\sim30$ au. Even if\nwe are not directly tracing the midplane, if planets accrete from the surface\nvia, e.g., meridonial flows, then such a change should be imprinted on forming\nplanets. Perhaps interestingly, the HR 8799 planetary system also shows an\nincreasing gradient in its giant planets' atmospheric C/O ratios. While these\nstars are quite different, hydrocarbon rings in disks are common, and therefore\nour results are consistent with the young planets of HR 8799 still bearing the\nimprint of their parent disk's volatile chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The\nmicrostructure is considered as a population of subgrains and grains whose\nsizes and boundary properties determine their growth rates. The model input\nparameters are measured directly on orientation maps maps of the deformed\nmicrostructure measured by electron backscattered diffraction. The anisotropy\nin subgrain properties then drives a competitive growth giving rise to the\nrecrystallization texture development. The method is illustrated by a\nsimulation of the static recrystallization texture development in a hot rolled\nferritic stainless steel. The model predictions are found to be in good\nagreement with the experimental measurements, and allow for an in-depth\ninvestigation of the formation sequence of the recrystallization texture. A\ndistinction is established between the texture components which develop due to\nfavorable growth conditions and those developing due to their predominance in\nthe prior deformed state. The high fraction of alpha fibre orientations in the\nrecrystallized state is shown to be a consequence of their predominance in the\ndeformed microstructure rather than a preferred growth mechanism. A close\ncontrol of the fraction of these orientations before annealing is thus required\nto minimize their presence in the recrystallized state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 20:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

When trained on these datasets, models\ntend to memorize the actors' faces and labels instead of learning fake\nfeatures. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple data augmentation\nmethod termed Face-Cutout. Our method dynamically cuts out regions of an image\nusing the face landmark information. It helps the model selectively attend to\nonly the relevant regions of the input. Our evaluation experiments show that\nFace-Cutout can successfully improve the data variation and alleviate the\nproblem of overfitting.

This study aims to examine the severity of this problem by\nevaluating deep learning (DL) classification models trained to identify\nCOVID-19-positive patients on 3D computed tomography (CT) datasets from\ndifferent countries. We collected one dataset at UT Southwestern (UTSW), and\nthree external datasets from different countries: CC-CCII Dataset (China),\nCOVID-CTset (Iran), and MosMedData (Russia). We divided the data into 2\nclasses: COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. We trained nine\nidentical DL-based classification models by using combinations of the datasets\nwith a 72% train, 8% validation, and 20% test data split. The models trained on\na single dataset achieved accuracy/area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristics curve (AUC) values of 0.87/0.826 (UTSW), 0.97/0.988 (CC-CCCI),\nand 0.86/0.873 (COVID-CTset) when evaluated on their own dataset.

To\nmodel the finite mass transfer rate in cavitation phenomena, we employ the\nhomogenous mixture-based approach via phenomenological scalar transport\ndifferential equations. Stable linearizations of the finite mass transfer terms\nfor the mass continuity equation and the scalar transport equations are derived\nfor robust and accurate implementation. The linearized matrices for the\ncavitation equation are imparted a positivity-preserving property to address\nnumerical oscillations arising from high-density gradients typical of two-phase\ncavitating flows. The proposed formulation is strongly coupled in a partitioned\nmanner with an incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes finite element solver, and the\nunsteady problem is advanced in time using a fully-implicit\ngeneralized-$\\alpha$ time integration scheme. We first verify the\nimplementation on the benchmark case of Rayleigh bubble collapse.

The deviations of these distributions can be further enhanced by\nplasma processes, such as shocks, turbulence, and magnetic reconnection. Such\ndistributions can be unstable to a wide variety of kinetic plasma\ninstabilities, which in turn modify the electron distributions. In this paper\nthe deviations of the observed electron distributions from a bi-Maxwellian\ndistribution function is calculated and quantified using data from the\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft. A statistical study from tens of\nmillions of electron distributions shows that the primary source of the\nobserved non-Maxwellianity are electron distributions consisting of distinct\nhot and cold components in Earth's low-density magnetosphere.

Most existing SSE schemes leak\nwhich documents are accessed per query, i.e., the so-called access pattern, and\nthus are vulnerable to attacks that can recover the database or the queried\nkeywords. Current techniques that fully hide access patterns, such as ORAM or\nPIR, suffer from heavy communication or computational costs, and are not\ndesigned with search capabilities in mind. Recently, Chen et al. (INFOCOM'18)\nproposed an obfuscation framework for SSE that protects the access pattern in a\ndifferentially private way with a reasonable utility cost. However, this scheme\nleaks the so-called search pattern, i.e., how many times a certain query is\nperformed. This leakage makes the proposal vulnerable to certain database and\nquery recovery attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose OSSE (Obfuscated SSE), an SSE scheme that\nobfuscates the access pattern independently for each query performed. This in\nturn hides the search pattern and makes our scheme resistant against attacks\nthat rely on this leakage. Under certain reasonable assumptions, our scheme has\nsmaller communication overhead than ORAM-based SSE.

From a theoretical perspective, two possible explanations have been\nproposed: (i) the loss function has connected sublevel sets, and (ii) the\nsolutions found by stochastic gradient descent are dropout stable. While these\nexplanations provide insights into the phenomenon, their assumptions are not\nalways satisfied in practice. In particular, the first approach requires the\nnetwork to have one layer with order of $N$ neurons ($N$ being the number of\ntraining samples), while the second one requires the loss to be almost\ninvariant after removing half of the neurons at each layer (up to some\nrescaling of the remaining ones). In this work, we improve both conditions by\nexploiting the quality of the features at every intermediate layer together\nwith a milder over-parameterization condition. More specifically, we show that:\n(i) under generic assumptions on the features of intermediate layers, it\nsuffices that the last two hidden layers have order of $\\sqrt{N}$ neurons, and\n(ii) if subsets of features at each layer are linearly separable, then no\nover-parameterization is needed to show the connectivity. Our experiments\nconfirm that the proposed condition ensures the connectivity of solutions found\nby stochastic gradient descent, even in settings where the previous\nrequirements do not hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 23:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

The primary\nagenda of such systems is to maximize performance by efficiently supporting\nmulti-tenancy of diverse workloads. However, this could be particularly\nchallenging to achieve in practice, because modern workloads exhibit dynamic\nphase behaviour, which causes their cache requirements & sensitivities to vary\nat finer granularities during execution. Unfortunately, existing systems are\noblivious to the application phase behavior, and are unable to detect and react\nquickly enough to these rapidly changing cache requirements, often incurring\nsignificant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Com-CAS, a new\napportioning system that provides dynamic cache allocations for co-executing\napplications. Com-CAS differs from the existing cache partitioning systems by\nadapting to the dynamic cache requirements of applications just-in-time, as\nopposed to reacting, without any hardware modifications.

Any hostile cyber operation, suspending control\nover a space asset, severely impacts both NATO missions and allied Member\nStates national security. This threat is exacerbated by NATOs mostly\nunregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this thesis answers a twofold research question:\na) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs global SASC; and b) How can\nNATO and its allied Member States gain greater control over such gaps to\nsafeguard the supply of NATO mission-critical information? An ontological field\nstudy is carried out by conducting nineteen semi-structured interviews with\nhigh-level representatives from relevant public, private and academic\norganizations. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the NATO\nCooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia.\nThis thesis concludes that current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs SASC are\ncaused by cyber vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use of\nCommercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology. Inadequate cyber SASC management is\ncaused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels and significant\nunderstaffing. On this basis, NATO should consider two major collaboration\ninitiatives: a) Raising Awareness throughout the whole of the NATO system, and\nb) Pushing forward the creation of regulation through a standardized security\nframework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing so would enable NATO and its Member\nStates to recognise cyberthreats to mission-critical data early on along its\ncyber SASC, and thus increase transparency, responsibility, and liability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 23:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

These dynamics are governed by the harmonic\nresolvent operator, which is a linear operator in the frequency domain whose\nsingular value decomposition sheds light on the dominant input-output\nstructures of the flow. Although the harmonic resolvent is a mathematically\nwell-defined operator, the numerical computation of its singular value\ndecomposition requires inverting a matrix that becomes exactly singular as the\nperiodic orbit approaches an exact solution of the nonlinear governing\nequations. The very poor condition properties of this matrix hinder the\nconvergence of classical Krylov solvers, even in the presence of\npreconditioners, thereby increasing the computational cost required to perform\nthe harmonic resolvent analysis. In this paper we show that a suitable\naugmentation of the (nearly) singular matrix removes the singularity, and we\nprovide a lower bound for the smallest singular value of the augmented matrix.\nWe also show that the desired decomposition of the harmonic resolvent can be\ncomputed using the augmented matrix, whose improved condition properties lead\nto a significant speedup in the convergence of classical iterative solvers.

To aid this, defect prediction models have been\nproposed to generate insights as the most important factors that are associated\nwith software quality. Such insights that are derived from traditional defect\nmodels are far from actionable-i.e., practitioners still do not know what they\nshould do or avoid to decrease the risk of having defects, and what is the risk\nthreshold for each metric. A lack of actionable guidance and risk threshold can\nlead to inefficient and ineffective SQA planning processes. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the practitioners' perceptions of current SQA planning activities,\ncurrent challenges of such SQA planning activities, and propose four types of\nguidance to support SQA planning. We then propose and evaluate our AI-Driven\nSQAPlanner approach, a novel approach for generating four types of guidance and\ntheir associated risk thresholds in the form of rule-based explanations for the\npredictions of defect prediction models. Finally, we develop and evaluate an\ninformation visualization for our SQAPlanner approach. Through the use of\nqualitative survey and empirical evaluation, our results lead us to conclude\nthat SQAPlanner is needed, effective, stable, and practically applicable. We\nalso find that 80% of our survey respondents perceived that our visualization\nis more actionable. Thus, our SQAPlanner paves a way for novel research in\nactionable software analytics-i.e., generating actionable guidance on what\nshould practitioners do and not do to decrease the risk of having defects to\nsupport SQA planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 06:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

For $n$ large, the implicitly\nrestarted Arnoldi (IRA) and refined Arnoldi (IRRA) algorithms are well suited\nfor this eigenproblem. For a reasonable comparison of overall efficiency of the\nalgorithms for solving TRS directly and eigenvalue-based algorithms, a vital\npremise is that the two kinds of algorithms must compute the approximate\nsolutions of TRS with (almost) the same accuracy, but such premise has been\nignored in the literature.

In this problem, a set of nodes arrive over time, each\nwith a message it intends to send. In each time slot, each node may attempt to\nbroadcast its message or remain idle. If a single node broadcasts in a slot,\nthe message is received by all nodes; otherwise, if multiple nodes broadcast\nsimultaneously, a collision occurs and none succeeds. If collision detection is\navailable, nodes can differentiate collision and silence (i.e., no nodes\nbroadcast). Performance of contention resolution algorithms is often measured\nby throughput -- the number of successful transmissions within a period of\ntime; whereas robustness is often measured by jamming resistance -- a jammed\nslot always generates a collision. Previous work has shown, with collision\ndetection, optimal constant throughput can be attained, even if a constant\nfraction of all slots are jammed. The situation when collision detection is not\navailable, however, remains unclear.\n  In a recent breakthrough paper [Bender et al., STOC '20], a crucial case is\nresolved: constant throughput is possible without collision detection, but only\nif there is no jamming. Nonetheless, the exact trade-off between the best\npossible throughput and the severity of jamming remains unknown. In this paper,\nwe address this open question. Specifically, for any level of jamming ranging\nfrom none to constant fraction, we prove an upper bound on the best possible\nthroughput, along with an algorithm attaining that bound. An immediate and\ninteresting implication of our result is, when a constant fraction of all slots\nare jammed, which is the worst-case scenario, there still exists an algorithm\nachieving a decent throughput: $\\Theta(t/\\log{t})$ messages could be\nsuccessfully transmitted within $t$ slots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

It has recently found applications in various learning\ntasks driven by networked data. However, it is computational demanding and hard\nto interpret using simple structural patterns. Due to the close relation\nbetween Lapalcian spectrum and degree sequence, we conjecture that the\nstructural information, defined as the Shannon entropy of the normalized degree\nsequence, might be a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that\nis both scalable and interpretable.\n  In this work, we thereby study the difference between the structural\ninformation and von Neumann graph entropy named as {\\em entropy gap}.

This approach leads to a simple relation $S = \\ln N $ between\nthe average number $N$ of color-singlet dipoles in the proton wave function and\nthe entropy of the produced hadronic state $S$. At small $x$, the multiplicity\nof dipoles is given by the gluon structure function, $N = x G(x,Q^2)$.\nRecently, the H1 Collaboration analyzed the entropy of the produced hadronic\nstate in DIS, and studied its relation to the gluon structure function; poor\nagreement with the predicted relation was found.

Although prior work has made important observations\nabout admitted technical debt in source code, little is known about SATD in\nbuild systems. In this paper, we set out to better understand the\ncharacteristics of SATD in build systems. To do so, through a qualitative\nanalysis of 500 SATD comments in the Maven build system of 291 projects, we\ncharacterize SATD by location and rationale (reason and purpose). Our results\nshow that limitations in tools and libraries, and complexities of dependency\nmanagement are the most frequent causes, accounting for 50% and 24% of the\ncomments.

As a first step towards the automatic detection of SATD rationale,\nwe train classifiers to detect the two most frequently occurring reasons and\nthe four most frequently occurring purposes of SATD in the content of comments\nin Maven build systems. The classifier performance is promising, achieving an\nF1-score of 0.71-0.79. Finally, within 16 identified 'ready-to-be-addressed'\nSATD instances, the three SATD submitted by pull requests and the five SATD\nsubmitted by issue reports were resolved after developers were made aware.

Based on the atmospheric scattering model, a\nnovel model is designed to directly generate the haze-free image. The main\nchallenge of image dehazing is that the atmospheric scattering model has two\nparameters, i.e., transmission map and atmospheric light. When they are\nestimated respectively, the errors will be accumulated to compromise the\ndehazing quality. Considering this reason and various image sizes, a novel\ninput-size flexibility conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is\nproposed for single image dehazing, which is input-size flexibility at both\ntraining and test stages for image-to-image translation with cGAN framework.

Methods: In the preprocessing phase of\nthis approach, a suitable initial s-box which has some basic security\nproperties is generated by adopting a fast algorithm.

Deep nets typically\noperate in serial stages wherein each layer completes its computation before\nprocessing begins in subsequent layers. In contrast, biological systems have\ncascaded dynamics: information propagates from neurons at all layers in\nparallel but transmission occurs gradually over time, leading to speed-accuracy\ntrade offs even in feedforward architectures. We explore the consequences of\nbiologically inspired parallel hardware by constructing cascaded ResNets in\nwhich each residual block has propagation delays but all blocks update in\nparallel in a stateful manner. Because information transmitted through skip\nconnections avoids delays, the functional depth of the architecture increases\nover time, yielding anytime predictions that improve with internal-processing\ntime.

This paper refers to a\nrelatively new concept of sending encrypted speech as pseudo-speech in the\naudio domain over digital voice communication infrastructures, like 3G cellular\nnetwork and VoIP.\n  This work presents a novel distortion-tolerant speech encryption scheme for\nsecure voice communications over voice channels that combines the robustness of\nanalog speech scrambling and elevated security offered by digital ciphers like\nAES-CTR. The system scrambles vocal parameters of a speech signal (loudness,\npitch, timbre) using distance-preserving pseudo-random translations and\nrotations on a hypersphere of parameters. Next, scrambled parameters are\nencoded to a pseudo-speech signal adapted to transmission over digital voice\nchannels equipped with voice activity detection. Upon reception of this\npseudo-speech signal, the legitimate receiver restores distorted copies of the\ninitial vocal parameters. Despite some deciphering errors, an integrated\nneural-based vocoder based on the LPCNet architecture reconstructs an\nintelligible speech.\n  The experimental implementation of this speech encryption scheme has been\ntested by simulations and sending an encrypted signal over FaceTime between two\niPhones 6 connected to the same WiFi network. Moreover, speech excerpts\nrestored from encrypted signals were evaluated by a speech quality assessment\non a group of about 40 participants.

Operating systems set\ndefault limits on the stack space which are much lower than the available\nmemory. If a program runs out of stack space, they get the dreaded \"Stack\nOverflow\" exception -- they crash. As a result, OCaml programmers have to be\ncareful, when they write recursive functions, to remain in the so-called\n_tail-recursive_ fragment, using _tail_ calls that do not consume stack space.\n  This discipline is a source of difficulties for both beginners and experts.\nBeginners have to be taught recursion, and then tail-recursion. Experts\ndisagree on the \"right\" way to write `List.map`. The direct version is\nbeautiful but not tail-recursive, so it crashes on larger inputs. The naive\ntail-recursive transformation is (slightly) slower than the direct version, and\nexperts may want to avoid that cost. Some libraries propose horrible\nimplementations, unrolling code by hand, to compensate for this performance\nloss. In general, tail-recursion requires the programmer to manually perform\nsophisticated program transformations.\n  In this work we propose an implementation of \"Tail Modulo Cons\" (TMC) for\nOCaml. TMC is a program transformation for a fragment of non-tail-recursive\nfunctions, that rewrites them in _destination-passing style_. The supported\nfragment is smaller than other approaches such as continuation-passing-style,\nbut the performance of the transformed code is on par with the direct,\nnon-tail-recursive version. Many useful functions that traverse a recursive\ndatastructure and rebuild another recursive structure are in the TMC fragment,\nin particular `List.map` (and `List.filter`, `List.append`, etc.). Finally\nthose functions can be written in a way that is beautiful, correct on all\ninputs, and efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 09:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

It has been found only in the past decade that non-Hermiticity\nenables unprecedented effects such as exceptional points, spectral\nsingularities and bulk Fermi arcs. Recent studies further show that\nnon-Hermiticity can fundamentally change the topological band theory, leading\nto the non-Hermitian band topology and non-Hermitian skin effect, as confirmed\nin one-dimensional (1D) systems. However, in higher dimensions, these\nnon-Hermitian effects remain unexplored in experiments. Here, we demonstrate\nthe spin-polarized, higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect in two-dimensional\n(2D) acoustic metamaterials. Using a lattice of coupled whisper-gallery\nacoustic resonators, we realize a spinful 2D higher-order topological insulator\n(HOTI) where the spin-up and spin-down states are emulated by the\nanti-clockwise and clockwise modes, respectively. We find that the\nnon-Hermiticity drives wave localizations toward opposite edge boundaries\ndepending on the spin polarizations. More interestingly, for finite systems\nwith both edge and corner boundaries, the higher-order non-Hermitian skin\neffect leads to wave localizations toward two corner boundaries for the bulk,\nedge and corner states in a spin-dependent manner. We further show that such a\nnon-Hermitian skin effect enables rich wave manipulation through the loss\nconfiguration in each unit-cell. The reported spin-dependent, higher-order\nnon-Hermitian skin effect reveals the interplay between higher-order topology\nand non-Hermiticity, which is further enriched by the spin degrees of freedom.\nThis unveils a new horizon in the study of non-Hermitian physics and the design\nof non-Hermitian metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 09:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

We present a novel method of impact evaluation which integrates\ngraffiti walls into the experience both before and after the main drop-in\nactivity. The activity in question was a soundscape exhibit, where young\nfamilies experienced the usually inaudible sounds of near-Earth space in an\nimmersive and accessible way. We apply two analysis techniques to the captured\nbefore and after data - quantitative linguistics and thematic analysis. These\nanalyses reveal significant changes in participants' responses after the\nactivity compared to before, namely an increased diversity in language used to\ndescribe space and altered conceptions of what space is like. The results\ndemonstrate that the soundscape was surprisingly effective at innately\ncommunicating key aspects of the underlying science simply through the act of\nlistening. The impacts also highlight the power of sonification in stimulating\npublic engagement, which, through reflection, can lead to altered associations,\nperceptions, and understanding. Therefore, we show that this novel approach to\ndrop-in activity evaluation, using graffiti walls both before and after the\nactivity and applying rigorous analysis to this data, has the power to capture\nchange and, thus, have a short-term impact.

Stokes drift can contribute to the\ntransport of floating marine litter, including plastic. Previously, marine\nlitter objects have been considered to be perfect Lagrangian tracers,\ntravelling with the Stokes drift of the waves. However, floating marine litter\nobjects have large ranges of sizes and densities, which potentially result in\ndifferent rates of transport by waves due to the non-Lagrangian behaviour of\nthe objects. Through a combination of theory and experiments for idealised\nspherical objects in deep-water waves, we show that different objects are\ntransported at different rates depending on their size and density, and that\nlarger buoyant objects can have increased drift compared with Lagrangian\ntracers. We show that the mechanism for the increased drift observed in our\nexperiments comprises the variable submergence and the corresponding dynamic\nbuoyancy force components in a direction perpendicular to the local water\nsurface. This leads to an amplification of the drift of these objects compared\nto the Stokes drift when averaged over the wave cycle.

However, little is known about the response of TiW to\nhigh temperature events or its behaviour when exposed to air. Here, a combined\nsoft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterisation approach\nis used to study the influence of post-deposition annealing and titanium\nconcentration on the oxidation behaviour of a 300~nm-thick TiW film. The\ncombination of both XPS techniques allows for the assessment of the chemical\nstate and elemental composition across the surface and bulk of the TiW layer.\nThe findings show that in response to high-temperature annealing, titanium\nsegregates out of the mixed metal system and upwardly migrates, accumulating at\nthe TiW/air interface. Titanium shows remarkably rapid diffusion under\nrelatively short annealing timescales and the extent of titanium surface\nenrichment is increased through longer annealing periods or by increasing the\nprecursor titanium concentration. Surface titanium enrichment enhances the\nextent of oxidation both at the surface and in the bulk of the alloy due to the\nstrong gettering ability of titanium. Quantification of the soft X-ray\nphotoelectron spectra highlights the formation of three tungsten oxidation\nenvironments, attributed to WO$_2$, WO$_3$ and a WO$_3$ oxide coordinated with\na titanium environment. This combinatorial characterisation approach provides\nvaluable insights into the thermal and oxidation stability of TiW alloys from\ntwo depth perspectives, aiding the development of future device technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 10:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

In the presence of dissipation, most of the quasi-periodic solutions\ndisappear and one expects, at most, only a few of them to survive together with\nthe periodic attractors. However, to prove that a quasi-periodic solution\nreally exists, usually one assumes that the frequencies still satisfy a\nDiophantine condition and, furthermore, that some external parameters of the\nsystem are suitably tuned with them. In this paper we consider a class of\nsystems on the one-dimensional torus, subject to a periodic perturbation and in\nthe presence of dissipation, and show that, however small the dissipation, if\nthe perturbation is a trigonometric polynomial in the angles and the\nunperturbed frequencies satisfy a non-resonance condition of finite order,\ndepending on the size of the dissipation, then a quasi-periodic solution exists\nwith slightly perturbed frequencies provided the size of the perturbation is\nsmall enough.

To avoid over-reducing the variance\nof gradient by SVRG, a hyper-parameter $\\lambda$ is introduced in VCSG that is\nable to control the reduced variance of SVRG. Theory shows that the\noptimization method can converge by using an unbiased gradient estimator, but\nin practice, biased gradient estimation can allow more efficient convergence to\nthe vicinity since an unbiased approach is computationally more expensive.\n$\\lambda$ also has the effect of balancing the trade-off between unbiased and\nbiased estimations. Secondly, to minimize the number of full gradient\ncalculations in SVRG, a variance-bounded batch is introduced to reduce the\nnumber of gradient calculations required in each iteration. For smooth\nnon-convex functions, the proposed algorithm converges to an approximate\nfirst-order stationary point (i.e.\n$\\mathbb{E}\\|\\nabla{f}(x)\\|^{2}\\leq\\epsilon$) within\n$\\mathcal{O}(min\\{1/\\epsilon^{3/2},n^{1/4}/\\epsilon\\})$ number of stochastic\ngradient evaluations, which improves the leading gradient complexity of\nstochastic gradient-based method SCS\n$(\\mathcal{O}(min\\{1/\\epsilon^{5/3},n^{2/3}/\\epsilon\\})$.

Our results are the first to establish the convergence of\napproximately optimal shapes of (exact) size $\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0$ to a\nlimit generalized shape represented by a (possibly diffuse) probability\nmeasure.

Ultra-dense networks, however, require pervasive, high-capacity\nbackhaul solutions, and deploying fiber optic to all base stations is generally\nconsidered to be too expensive for network operators. The 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) has thus introduced Integrated Access and Backhaul\n(IAB), a wireless backhaul solution in which the access and backhaul links\nshare the same hardware, protocol stack, and also spectrum. The multiplexing of\ndifferent links in the same frequency bands, however, introduces interference\nand capacity sharing issues, thus calling for the introduction of advanced\nscheduling and coordination schemes. This paper proposes a semi-centralized\nresource allocation scheme for IAB networks, designed to be flexible, with low\ncomplexity, and compliant with the 3GPP IAB specifications. We develop a\nversion of the Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) problem that can be applied on a\nspanning tree that represents the IAB network and whose complexity is linear in\nthe number of IAB-nodes. The proposed solution is compared with\nstate-of-the-art distributed approaches through end-to-end, full-stack\nsystem-level simulations with a 3GPP-compliant channel model, protocol stack,\nand a diverse set of user applications. The results show how that our scheme\ncan increase the throughput of cell-edge users up to 5 times, while decreasing\nthe overall network congestion with an end-to-end delay reduction of up to 25\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 13:59:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The inclusion of magnetic field may lead to the\nstabilisation of the jets. Jets and complex magnetic fields are ubiquitous in\nthe solar atmosphere, which suggests the possibility of the kink instability in\ncertain cases. The aim of the paper is to study the kink instability of\ntriangular jets sandwiched between magnetic tubes/slabs and its possible\nconnection to observed properties of the jets in the solar atmosphere. A\ndispersion equation governing the kink perturbations is obtained through\nmatching of analytical solutions at the jet boundaries. The equation is solved\nanalytically and numerically for different parameters of jets and surrounding\nplasma. The analytical solution is accompanied by a numerical simulation of\nfully nonlinear MHD equations for a particular situation of solar type II\nspicules. MHD triangular jets are unstable to the dynamic kink instability\ndepending on the Alfven Mach number (the ratio of flow to Alfven speeds) and\nthe ratio of internal and external densities. When the jet has the same density\nas the surrounding plasma, then only super Alfvenic flows are unstable.\nHowever, denser jets are unstable also in sub Alfvenic regime. Jets with an\nangle to the ambient magnetic field have much lower thresholds of instability\nthan field-aligned flows. Growth times of the kink instability are estimated as\n6-15 min for type I spicules and 5-60 s for type II spicules matching with\ntheir observed life times. Numerical simulation of full nonlinear equations\nshows that the transverse kink pulse locally destroys the jet in less than a\nminute in the conditions of type II spicules. Dynamic kink instability may lead\nto full breakdown of MHD flows and consequently to observed disappearance of\nspicules in the solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

By fully un-leashing the power of self-attention on\nlong-term dependency exception, we demonstrate the size of TransMask is more\nthan 60% smaller and the inference is more than 2 times faster than\nstate-of-the-art solutions. TransMask fully utilizes the parallelism during\ninference, and achieves nearly linear inference time within reasonable input\naudio lengths. It also outperforms existing solutions on output speech audio\nquality, achieving SDR above 16 over Librimix benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 15:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

The major ingredient that a computer needs\nis the energy to run a process, i.e., the thermodynamic cost. The analysis of\nthe thermodynamic cost of computation is one of the prime focuses of research.\nIt started back since the seminal work of Landauer where it was commented that\nthe computer spends kB T ln2 amount of energy to erase a bit of information\n(here T is the temperature of the system and kB represents the Boltzmann's\nconstant). The advancement of statistical mechanics has provided us the\nnecessary tool to understand and analyze the thermodynamic cost for the\ncomplicated processes that exist in nature, even the computation of modern\ncomputers. The advancement of physics has helped us to understand the\nconnection of the statistical mechanics (the thermodynamics cost) with\ncomputation. Another important factor that remains a matter of concern in the\nfield of computer science is the error correction of the error that occurs\nwhile transmitting the information through a communication channel. Here in\nthis article, we have reviewed the progress of the thermodynamics of\ncomputation starting from Landauer's principle to the latest model, which\nsimulates the modern complex computation mechanism. After exploring the salient\nparts of computation in computer science theory and information theory, we have\nreviewed the thermodynamic cost of computation and error correction.

Using\nsymplectic integration techniques, we present an extensive analysis of chaos in\nthe Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model of DNA. The chaoticity is quantified by\nthe maximum Lyapunov exponent (mLE) across a spectrum of temperatures, and the\neffect of base pair (BP) disorder on the dynamics is studied. In addition to\nheterogeneity due to the ratio of adenine-thymine (AT) and guanine-cytosine\n(GC) BPs, the distribution of BPs in the sequence is analysed by introducing\nthe alternation index $\\alpha$. An exact probability distribution for BP\narrangements and $\\alpha$ is derived using P\\'olya counting. The value of the\nmLE depends on the composition and arrangement of BPs in the strand, with a\ndependence on temperature. We probe regions of strong chaoticity using the\ndeviation vector distribution, studying links between strongly nonlinear\nbehaviour and the formation of bubbles. Randomly generated sequences and\nbiological promoters are both studied. Further, properties of bubbles are\nanalysed through molecular dynamics simulations. The distributions of bubble\nlifetimes and lengths are obtained, fitted with analytical expressions, and a\nphysically justified threshold for considering a BP to be open is successfully\nimplemented. In addition to DNA, we present analysis of the dynamical stability\nof a planar model of graphene, studying the mLE in bulk graphene as well as in\ngraphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The stability of the material manifests in a very\nsmall mLE, with chaos being a slow process in graphene.

Due to the inertia effect, the dynamic equilibrium cannot\nbe established without evaluating the second-order derivatives of the deep\nautoencoder network. This is beyond the capability of off-the-shelf automatic\ndifferentiation packages and algorithms, which mainly focus on the gradient\nevaluation. Solving the nonlinear force equilibrium is even more challenging if\nthe standard Newton's method is to be used.

To predict\nthe boundaries of this pandemic phase, we introduce here a modeling framework\nto couple the network spreading patterns with the intra-host evolutionary\ndynamics. For many pathogens these two processes, intra- and inter-host, are\ndriven by different selection forces. And yet here we show that even in the\nextreme case when these two forces are mutually independent, mutations can\nstill fundamentally alter the pandemic phase-diagram, whose transitions are now\nshaped, not just by $R_0$, but also by the balance between the epidemic and the\nevolutionary timescales. If mutations are too slow, the pathogen prevalence\ndecays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other hand, if\nmutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and, once\nagain, it fails to spread.

However, the volume,\nbandwidth, sensitivity, and cost (in non-visible bands) associated with panel\ncameras have hindered their utility in broader applications, especially in high\nspeed and low-cost measurements. In this work, we broke the limitations imposed\nby panel cameras by using a quadrant detector (QD) to capture the speckle\nimages. In the scheme of QD detection, speckle images are directly filtered by\nconvolution, where the kernel is equal to one quarter of a speckle pattern.\nFirst, we proposed an up-sampling algorithm to pre-process the QD data. Then a\nnew convolution neural network (CNN) based algorithm, shallow residual network\n(SRN), was proposed to train the up-sampled images. The experimental results\nshow that a resolution of 4 fm (~ 0.5 MHz) was achieved at 1550nm with an\nupdating speed of ~ 1 kHz. More importantly, the SRN shows excellent\nrobustness.

By combining wind speed data with the measured accelerations of a\ngolden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) flying in the wild, we show that the eagle's\naccelerations can be explained by a linear interaction with turbulence for\ntimescales between about 1/2 and 10 s. These timescales are comparable to those\nof typical eagle behaviors, corresponding to between about 1 and 25 wingbeats,\nand to those of turbulent gusts both larger than the eagle's wingspan and\nsmaller than large-scale atmospheric phenomena such as convection cells. The\neagle's accelerations exhibit power spectra and intermittent activity\ncharacteristic of turbulence, and increase in proportion to the turbulence\nintensity. Intermittency results in accelerations that are occasionally several\ntimes stronger than gravity, and much larger than the ones we experience while\ndriving, for instance. These imprints of turbulence on the bird's movements\nneed to be further explored to understand the energetics of birds and other\nvolant lifeforms, to improve our own methods of flying through ceaselessly\nturbulent environments, and to engage airborne wildlife as distributed probes\nof the changing conditions in the atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 15:56:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 17:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 13:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 16:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In order to achieve a cost-effective reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions and to combat climate change, the European Union (EU)\nintroduced an Emissions Trading System (ETS) where organizations can buy or\nreceive emission allowances as needed. The current ETS is a centralized one,\nconsisting of a set of complex rules. It is currently administered at the\norganizational level and is used for fixed-point sources of pollution such as\nfactories, power plants, and refineries. However, the current ETS cannot\nefficiently cope with vehicle mobility, even though vehicles are one of the\nprimary sources of CO2 and NOx emissions. In this study, we propose a new\ndistributed Blockchain-based emissions allowance trading system called B-ETS.\nThis system enables transparent and trustworthy data exchange as well as\ntrading of allowances among vehicles, relying on vehicle-to-vehicle\ncommunication. In addition, we introduce an economic incentive-based mechanism\nthat appeals to individual drivers and leads them to modify their driving\nbehavior in order to reduce emissions. The efficiency of the proposed system is\nstudied through extensive simulations, showing how increased vehicle\nconnectivity can lead to a reduction of the emissions generated from those\nvehicles. We demonstrate that our method can be used for full life-cycle\nmonitoring and fuel economy reporting. This leads us to conjecture that the\nproposed system could lead to important behavioral changes among the drivers\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 01:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

This secondary bifurcation stops active phase separation in its\nnonlinear regime.

The\ntransition from phase separation to extended spatially periodic patterns is\nhysteretic. We show that the resulting patterns are multistable, as they show\nstability beyond the bifurcation for different wavenumbers belonging to a\nwavenumber band. The transition from active phase separation to the hybrid\nstates is continuous. Both transition scenarios are systems-spanning phenomena\nin particle conserving systems. They are predicted with a generic dissipative\nmodel introduced in this work. Candidates for specific systems, in which these\ngeneric secondary transitions are likely to occur, are, for example,\ngeneralized models for motility-induced phase separation in active Brownian\nparticles, models for cell division or chemotactic systems with conserved\nparticle dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}
