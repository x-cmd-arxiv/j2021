In recent\nyears, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns\nof neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have\nfocused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31\nparticipants, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the\nneural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled,\ncontrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of\nreading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization\ntask). Our primary result is that all three tasks -- coding, prose reading, and\nmental rotation -- are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those\ntasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose\nand coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally\nfind more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and\ntask difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with\nmore expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a\nneural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later.\nWhile preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g.,\nrelating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also\nprovide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice\nprogramming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 16:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 00:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

Solar magnetic pores are, due to their concentrated magnetic fields,\nsuitable guides for magnetoacoustic waves. Recent observations have shown that\npropagating energy flux in pores is subject to strong damping with height;\nhowever, the reason is still unclear. Aims. We investigate possible damping\nmechanisms numerically to explain the observations. Methods. We performed 2D\nnumerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, starting from an equilibrium\nmodel of a single pore inspired by the observed properties. Energy was inserted\ninto the bottom of the domain via different vertical drivers with a period of\n30s. Simulations were performed with both ideal MHD and non-ideal effects.\nResults. While the analysis of the energy flux for ideal and non-ideal MHD\nsimulations with a plane driver cannot reproduce the observed damping, the\nnumerically predicted damping for a localized driver closely corresponds with\nthe observations. The strong damping in simulations with localized driver was\ncaused by two geometric effects, geometric spreading due to diverging field\nlines and lateral wave leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 17:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

A regulator dynamically allocates emission allowances to\neach firm. Firms face idiosyncratic as well as common economic shocks on\nemissions, and have linear quadratic abatement costs. Firms can trade\nallowances so to minimise total expected costs, from abatement and trading plus\na quadratic terminal penalty. Using variational methods, we exhibit in\nclosed-form the market equilibrium in function of regulator's dynamic\nallocation. We then solve the Stackelberg game between the regulator and the\nfirms. Again, we obtain a closed-form expression of the dynamic allocation\npolicies that allow a desired expected emission reduction. Optimal policies are\nnot unique but share common properties. Surprisingly, all optimal policies\ninduce a constant abatement effort and a constant price of allowances. Dynamic\nallocations outperform static ones because of adjustment costs and uncertainty,\nin particular given the presence of common shocks.

This approach\nsuffers when delays between actions and rewards are long and when intervening\nunrelated events contribute variance to long-term returns. We propose\nstate-associative (SA) learning, where the agent learns associations between\nstates and arbitrarily distant future rewards, then propagates credit directly\nbetween the two. In this work, we use SA-learning to model the contribution of\npast states to the current reward. With this model we can predict each state's\ncontribution to the far future, a quantity we call \"synthetic returns\".\nTD-learning can then be applied to select actions that maximize these synthetic\nreturns (SRs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of augmenting agents with SRs\nacross a range of tasks on which TD-learning alone fails.

The range of applicability is extremely\nwide going, for example, from seismological studies to geotechnical\ncharacterizations and exploration geophysics. However, the inversion of the\ndispersion curves is severely ill-posed and only limited efforts have been put\ninto the development of effective regularization strategies. In particular,\nrelatively simple smoothing regularization terms are commonly used, even when\nthis is in contrast with the expected features of the investigated targets. To\ntackle this problem, stochastic approaches can be utilized, but they are too\ncomputationally expensive to be practical, at least, in the case of large\nsurveys. Instead, within a deterministic framework, we evaluate the\napplicability of a regularizer capable of providing reconstructions\ncharacterized by tunable levels of sparsity. This adjustable stabilizer is\nbased on the minimum support regularization, applied before on other kinds of\ngeophysical measurements, but never on surface wave data.

However, such data streams have questionable reliability since they\nhinge on user adherence to the app. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to\nseparate true behavior from self-tracking artifacts. By taking a machine\nlearning approach to modeling self-tracked cycle lengths, we can both make more\ninformed predictions and learn the underlying structure of the observed data.\nIn this work, we propose and evaluate a hierarchical, generative model for\npredicting next cycle length based on previously-tracked cycle lengths that\naccounts explicitly for the possibility of users skipping tracking their\nperiod. Our model offers several advantages: 1) accounting explicitly for\nself-tracking artifacts yields better prediction accuracy as likelihood of\nskipping increases; 2) because it is a generative model, predictions can be\nupdated online as a given cycle evolves, and we can gain interpretable insight\ninto how these predictions change over time; and 3) its hierarchical nature\nenables modeling of an individual's cycle length history while incorporating\npopulation-level information. Our experiments using mHealth cycle length data\nencompassing over 186,000 menstruators with over 2 million natural menstrual\ncycles show that our method yields state-of-the-art performance against neural\nnetwork-based and summary statistic-based baselines, while providing insights\non disentangling menstrual patterns from self-tracking artifacts.

We here show that flat bands can be generated from a\nhidden symmetry of the lattice unit cell, revealed as a permutation symmetry\nupon reduction of the cell over two sites governed by an effective dimer\nHamiltonian. This so-called latent symmetry is intimately connected to a\nsymmetry between possible walks of a particle along the cell sites, starting\nand ending on each of the effective dimer sites. The summed amplitudes of any\neigenstate with odd parity on the effective dimer sites vanish on special site\nsubsets called walk multiplets. We exploit this to construct flat bands by\nusing a latently symmetric unit cell coupled into a lattice via walk multiplet\ninterconnections. We demonstrate that the resulting flat bands are tunable by\ndifferent parametrizations of the lattice Hamiltonian matrix elements which\npreserve the latent symmetry.

Both\nfrequencies individually are known to correlate with certain stellar parameters\nlike radii or the tidal deformability, which we further investigate by\nconstructing fit formulae and quantifying the scatter of the data points from\nthose relations. Furthermore, we compare how individual data points deviate\nfrom the corresponding fit to all data points. Considering this point-to-point\nscatter we uncover a striking similarity between the frequency deviations of\nperturbative data for isolated NSs and of oscillation frequencies of rapidly\nrotating, hot, massive merger remnants. The correspondence of frequency\ndeviations in these very different stellar systems points to an underlying\nmechanism and EoS information being encoded in the frequency deviation. We\ntrace the frequency scatter back to deviations of the tidal Love number from an\naverage tidal Love number for a given stellar compactness. Our results thus\nindicate a possibility to break the degeneracy between NS radii, tidal\ndeformability and tidal Love number. We also relate frequency deviations to the\nderivative of the tidal deformability with respect to mass. Our findings\ngenerally highlight a possibility to improve GW asteroseismology relations\nwhere the systematic behavior of frequency deviations is employed to reduce the\nscatter in such relationships and consequently increase the measurement\naccuracy. In addition, we relate the f-mode frequency of static stars and the\ndominant GW frequency of merger remnants.

For\nrotating black holes we identify a Poynting flux-dominated jet, driven by the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism.

This shows that previously-neglected\nstrong gravity effects must play an important role near cusps, although the\nexact mechanism by which they cure the divergence is not currently understood.\nWe show that one possible resolution is for these cusps to collapse to form\nprimordial black holes (PBHs); the kink memory signal does not diverge, in\nagreement with the fact that kinks are not predicted to form PBHs. Finally, we\ninvestigate the prospects for detecting memory from cusps and kinks with GW\nobservatories.

Lungs in the pneumothorax state during surgery have a large volume\nchange from normal lungs, making it difficult to build a mechanical model. The\npurpose of this study is to develop a deformation estimation method of the 3D\nsurface of a deflated lung from a few partial observations. To estimate\ndeformations for a largely deformed lung, a kernel regression-based solution\nwas introduced. The proposed method used a few landmarks to capture the partial\ndeformation between the 3D surface mesh obtained from preoperative CT and the\nintraoperative anatomical positions. The deformation for each vertex of the\nentire mesh model was estimated per-vertex as a relative position from the\nlandmarks. The landmarks were placed in the anatomical position of the lung's\nouter contour. The method was applied on nine datasets of the left lungs of\nlive Beagle dogs. Contrast-enhanced CT images of the lungs were acquired. The\nproposed method achieved a local positional error of vertices of 2.74 mm,\nHausdorff distance of 6.11 mm, and Dice similarity coefficient of 0.94.\nMoreover, the proposed method could estimate lung deformations from a small\nnumber of training cases and a small observation area.

Results: We found LC projections to be\nbundled in a fiber tract anatomically consistent with the central tegmental\ntract (CTT) and branch from this tract into the thalamus. The older cohort\nexhibited a significant reduction in mean and radial diffusivity within CTT as\ncompared to the young cohort. We also observed a significant correlation\nbetween CTT mean, axial, and radial diffusivities and memory performance\n(delayed recall) in the older adult cohort. Discussion: These observations\nsuggest that although LC projections degrade with age, the degree of\ndegradation is associated with cognitive abilities in older adults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 19:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 06:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

While it remains unclear whether this ever becomes a\nmajor component of the total dust content, the presence of such dust, and\npotentially the substructure within, it can be used to explore a disc's\nphysical conditions. A perturbing planet produces nonaxisymmetric structures\nand gaps in the dust, regardless of its origin. The dynamics of planetesimals,\nhowever, will be very different than that of small dust grains due to weaker\ngas interactions. Therefore, planetesimal collisions could create dusty disc\nstructures that would not exist otherwise. In this work, we use N-body\nsimulations to investigate the collision rate profile of planetesimals near\nmean-motion resonances. We find that a distinct bump or dip feature is produced\nin the collision profile, the presence of which depends on the libration width\nof the resonance and the separation between the peri- and apocenter distances\nof the edges of the resonance. The presence of one of these two features\ndepends on the mass and eccentricity of the planet. Assuming that the radial\ndust emission traces the planetesimal collision profile, the presence of a bump\nor dip feature in the dust emission at the 2:1 mean-motion resonance can\nconstrain the orbital properties of the perturbing planet. This assumption is\nvalid, so long as radial drift does not play a significant role during the\ncollisional cascade process. Under this assumption, these features in the dust\nemission should be marginally observable in nearby protoplanetary disks with\nALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 20:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Vector Perturbation Precoding\n(VPP) is a non-linear variant of transmit-side channel inversion that perturbs\nuser data to achieve full diversity order. While promising, finding an optimal\nperturbation in VPP is known to be an NP-hard problem, demanding heavy\ncomputational support at the base station and limiting the feasibility of the\napproach to small MIMO systems. This work proposes a radically different\nprocessing architecture for the downlink VPP problem, one based on Quantum\nAnnealing (QA), to enable the applicability of VPP to large MIMO systems. Our\ndesign reduces VPP to a quadratic polynomial form amenable to QA, then refines\nthe problem coefficients to mitigate the adverse effects of QA hardware noise.\nWe evaluate our proposed QA based VPP (QAVP) technique on a real Quantum\nAnnealing device over a variety of design and machine parameter settings.

These assumptions are common in multi-agent settings, such as\nautonomous driving. To effectively use this data, we turn to the framework of\nsuccessor features. This allows us to disentangle shared features and dynamics\nof the environment from agent-specific rewards and policies. We propose a\nmulti-task inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm, called \\emph{inverse\ntemporal difference learning} (ITD), that learns shared state features,\nalongside per-agent successor features and preference vectors, purely from\ndemonstrations without reward labels. We further show how to seamlessly\nintegrate ITD with learning from online environment interactions, arriving at a\nnovel algorithm for reinforcement learning with demonstrations, called $\\Psi\n\\Phi$-learning (pronounced `Sci-Fi').

Objective: We set out to address this\ngap through the study of repository artifacts. Method: Artifacts from ten teams\nwere mined from the IBM Rational Jazz repository. We employed social network\nanalysis (SNA) to group practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and\nOthers, based on the numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement\nin task changes. SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used\nto study practitioners' importance in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter, we\nperformed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic\ndimensions that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality\nprofiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top\nMembers occupied critical roles in knowledge diffusion, and demonstrated more\nopenness to experience than the Others. Additionally, all personality profiles\nwere represented during teamwork, although openness to experience,\nagreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident. However, no specific\npersonality predicted members' involvement in knowledge diffusion.

For discrete-valued\nregimes, some models such as the popular Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) describe\ntime series whose state process is unknown at all time-steps. Sometimes, time\nseries are firstly labelled thanks to some annotation function. Thus, another\ncategory of models handles the case with regimes observed at all time-steps. We\npresent a novel model which addresses the intermediate case: (i) state\nprocesses associated to such time series are modelled by Partially Hidden\nMarkov Chains (PHMCs); (ii) a linear autoregressive (LAR) model drives the\ndynamics of the time series, within each regime. We describe a variant of the\nexpection maximization (EM) algorithm devoted to PHMC-LAR model learning. We\npropose a hidden state inference procedure and a forecasting function that take\ninto account the observed states when existing. We assess inference and\nprediction performances, and analyze EM convergence times for the new model,\nusing simulated data. We show the benefits of using partially observed states\nto decrease EM convergence times. A fully labelled scheme with unreliable\nlabels also speeds up EM. This offers promising prospects to enhance PHMC-LAR\nmodel selection. We also point out the robustness of PHMC-LAR to labelling\nerrors in inference task, when large training datasets and moderate labelling\nerror rates are considered. Finally, we highlight the remarkable robustness to\nerror labelling in the prediction task, over the whole range of error rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 22:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

When\ndesigning control policies, several approaches to guarantee this aspect of\nautonomy have been proposed, such as robust controllers or control barrier\nfunctions. However, these solutions strongly rely on the model of the system\nbeing available to the designer. As a parallel development, reinforcement\nlearning provides model-agnostic control solutions but in general, it lacks the\ntheoretical guarantees required for safety. Recent advances show that under\nmild conditions, control policies can be learned via reinforcement learning,\nwhich can be guaranteed to be safe by imposing these requirements as\nconstraints of an optimization problem. However, to transfer from learning\nsafety to learning safely, there are two hurdles that need to be overcome: (i)\nit has to be possible to learn the policy without having to re-initialize the\nsystem; and (ii) the rollouts of the system need to be in themselves safe. In\nthis paper, we tackle the first issue, proposing an algorithm capable of\noperating in the continuing task setting without the need of restarts.

We consider the problem of fair classification with discrete\nsensitive attributes and potentially large models and data sets, requiring\nstochastic solvers. Existing in-processing fairness algorithms are either\nimpractical in the large-scale setting because they require large batches of\ndata at each iteration or they are not guaranteed to converge. In this paper,\nwe develop the first stochastic in-processing fairness algorithm with\nguaranteed convergence. For demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal\nopportunity notions of fairness, we provide slight variations of our\nalgorithm--called FERMI--and prove that each of these variations converges in\nstochastic optimization with any batch size. Empirically, we show that FERMI is\namenable to stochastic solvers with multiple (non-binary) sensitive attributes\nand non-binary targets, performing well even with minibatch size as small as\none.

By employing our\nproposed framework on more than 11 billion mobile phone location sightings, we\nwere able to capture the evacuation decision of 807,623 smartphone users who\nwere living within the state of Florida. We studied users' evacuation\ndecisions, departure and reentry date distribution, and destination choice. In\naddition to these decisions, we empirically examined the influence of\nevacuation order and low-lying residential areas on individuals' evacuation\ndecisions. Our analysis revealed that 57.92% of people living in mandatory\nevacuation zones evacuated their residences while this ratio was 32.98% and\n33.68% for people living in areas with no evacuation order and voluntary\nevacuation order, respectively. Moreover, our analysis revealed the importance\nof the individuals' mobility behavior in modeling the evacuation decision\nchoice. Historical mobility behavior information such as number of trips taken\nby each individual and the spatial area covered by individuals' location\ntrajectory estimated significant in our choice model and improve the overall\naccuracy of the model significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

A long-standing\nchallenge in network analysis has been the relative scarcity of reasonable null\nmodels for networks; arguably the most common such model has been the\nconfiguration model, which starts with a graph $G$ and produces a random graph\nwith the same node degrees as $G$. This leads to a very weak form of null\nmodel, since fixing the node degrees does not preserve many of the crucial\nproperties of the network, including the structure of its subgraphs.\n  Guided by this challenge, we propose a new family of network null models that\noperate on the $k$-core decomposition. For a graph $G$, the $k$-core is its\nmaximal subgraph of minimum degree $k$; and the core number of a node $v$ in\n$G$ is the largest $k$ such that $v$ belongs to the $k$-core of $G$. We provide\nthe first efficient sampling algorithm to solve the following basic\ncombinatorial problem: given a graph $G$, produce a random graph sampled nearly\nuniformly from among all graphs with the same sequence of core numbers as $G$.\nThis opens the opportunity to compare observed networks $G$ with random graphs\nthat exhibit the same core numbers, a comparison that preserves aspects of the\nstructure of $G$ that are not captured by more local measures like the degree\nsequence. We illustrate the power of this core-based null model on some\nfundamental tasks in network analysis, including the enumeration of networks\nmotifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

In such applications, it is important that the forecasts, in\naddition to being reasonably accurate, are also consistent w.r.t one another.\nAlthough forecasting such hierarchical time series has been pursued by\neconomists and data scientists, the current state-of-the-art models use strong\nassumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise distribution\nbeing Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed the power\nof modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning.

As a technology which can embed\nadditional information in encrypted domain, extract the embedded information\ncorrectly and recover the original image without loss, RDHEI has been widely\npaid attention by researchers. To embed sufficient additional information in\nthe encrypted image, a high-capacity RDHEI method using adaptive encoding is\nproposed in this paper. Firstly, the occurrence frequency of different\nprediction errors of the original image is calculated and the corresponding\nadaptive Huffman coding is generated. Then, the original image is encrypted\nwith stream cipher and the encrypted pixels are marked with different Huffman\ncodewords according to the prediction errors. Finally, additional information\nis embedded in the reserved room of marked pixels by bit substitution. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract the embedded\ninformation correctly and recover the original image losslessly. Compared with\nsimilar algorithms, the proposed algorithm makes full use of the\ncharacteristics of the image itself and greatly improves the embedding rate of\nthe image. On UCID, BOSSBase, and BOWS-2 datasets, the average embedding rate\nof the proposed algorithm reaches 3.162 bpp, 3.917 bpp, and 3.775 bpp, which is\nhigher than the state-of-the-art algorithm of 0.263 bpp, 0.292 bpp, and 0.280\nbpp, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 01:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 10:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

After\nevolving weights from sensory inputs to the RNN, within the RNN, and from the\nRNN to the robot's motors, the Webots agent successfully navigated the space to\nreach all four reward arms with minimal repeats before time-out. Our current\nfindings suggest that it is the RNN dynamics that are key to performance, and\nthat performance is not dependent on any one sensory type, which suggests that\nneurons in the RNN are performing mixed selectivity and conjunctive coding.\nMoreover, the RNN activity resembles spatial information and\ntrajectory-dependent coding observed in the hippocampus. Collectively, the\nevolved RNN exhibits navigation skills, spatial memory, and working memory. Our\nmethod demonstrates how the dynamic activity in evolved RNNs can capture\ninteresting and complex cognitive behavior and may be used to create RNN\ncontrollers for robotic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 02:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

Consequently, a range of grantfree (GF) RA schemes were proposed.\nNevertheless, if the number of cellular users (devices) significantly\nincreases, both the energy and spectrum efficiency of the existing GF schemes\nstill rapidly degrade owing to the much longer preambles required. In order to\novercome this dilemma, a layered grouping strategy is proposed, where the\ncellular users are firstly divided into clusters based on their geographical\nlocations, and then the users of the same cluster autonomously join in\ndifferent groups by using optimum energy consumption (Opt-EC) based K-means\nalgorithm. With this new layered cellular architecture, the RA process is\ndivided into cluster load estimation phase and active group detection phase.\nBased on the state evolution theory of approximated message passing algorithm,\na tight lower bound on the minimum preamble length for achieving a certain\ndetection accuracy is derived. Benefiting from the cluster load estimation, a\ndynamic preamble selection (DPS) strategy is invoked in the second phase,\nresulting the required preambles with minimum length.

Thus far, high contrast ratios\nup to ~10^10, required by present petawatt (PW) class lasers, have been\naccessible in both generation and single-shot characterization. However,\nultrahigh contrast ~10^13, required by the planned 200-PW lasers, challenges\nintense laser technology and remains an open question.

The attitude changes of the navigation frame corresponding to\nthe defined inertial frame can be exactly calculated with known velocity and\nposition provided by GNSS. The attitude from body frame to the defined inertial\nframe is estimated based on the SINS mechanization in inertial frame. The\nattitude, velocity and position in inertial frame are formulated together as\nelement of the group of double direct spatial isometries.It is proven that the\ngroup state model in inertial frame satisfies a particular \"group affine\"\nproperty and the corresponding error model satisfies a \"log linear\" autonomous\ndifferential equation on the Lie algebra. Based on such striking property, the\nattitude from body frame to the defined inertial frame can be estimated based\non the linear error model with even extreme large misalignments. Two different\nerror state vectors are extracted based on right and left matrix\nmultiplications and the detailed linear state space models are derived based on\nthe right and left errors for SINS mechanization in inertial frame. With the\nderived linear state space models, the explicit initial alignment procedures\nhave been presented. Extensive simulation and field tests indicate that the\ninitial alignment based on the left error model can perform quite well within a\nwide range of initial attitude errors, although the used filter is still a type\nof linear Kalman filter.

Phase separation and chemical\ncomposition gradients in the liquids can influence the displacement rate. In\nthis work, we investigate the effects of liquid composition on the displacement\nprocess of ternary liquid mixtures in a quasi-2D microchannel where\nliquid-liquid phase separation occurs concurrently. We focused on model ternary\nmixtures containing 1-octanol, ethanol, and water. These mixtures are displaced\nwith water or with ethanol aqueous solution. The spatial distribution of\nsubphases arising from phase separation and the displacement rates of the\nsolution are impacted by the initial ternary solution composition. The boundary\nbetween the solution and displacing liquid changes from a defined interface to\na diffusive interface as the initial 1-octanol composition in the solution is\nreduced. The displacement rate also varies non-linearly with the initial\n1-octanol composition. The slowest displacement rate arises in the intermediate\n1-octanol concentration, where a stable three-zone configuration forms at the\nboundary. At very low 1-octanol concentration, the displacement rate is fast,\nassociated with droplet formation and motion driven by the chemical\nconcentration gradients formed during phase separation. The excessive energy\nprovided from phase separation may contribute to the enhanced displacement at\nintermediate to high 1-octanol concentrations, but not at the low 1-octanol\nconcentration with enhancement from induced flow in confinement.

Localization accuracy\nrequirements for specific areas of the visual map, `scene classes', vary\naccording to the context of the environment and task. State-of-the-art visual\nmapping is unable to reflect these requirements by explicitly targetting scene\nclasses for inclusion in the map. Four different scene classes, including\npedestrian crossings and stations, are identified in each of the Nordland and\nSt. Lucia datasets. Instead of re-training separate scene classifiers which\nstruggle with these overlapping scene classes we make our first contribution:\ndefining the problem of `scene retrieval'. Scene retrieval extends image\nretrieval to classification of scenes defined at test time by associating a\nsingle query image to reference images of scene classes. Our second\ncontribution is a triplet-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to address\nthis problem which increases scene classification accuracy by up to 7% against\nstate-of-the-art networks pre-trained for scene recognition.

Our study reveals that the random measurement noise of\nVGOS group delays is at the level of less than 2 ps (1 ps = 10$^{-12}$ s),\nwhile the contributions from systematic error sources, mainly source structure\nrelated, are at the level of 20 ps.

To\ninvestigate their asymptotic behaviors, they require a sub-Gaussian or finite\nhigh-order moment assumption for observed log-returns, which cannot account for\nthe heavy-tail phenomenon of stock returns. Recently, a robust estimator was\ndeveloped to handle heavy-tailed distributions with some bounded fourth-moment\nassumption. However, we often observe that log-returns have heavier tail\ndistribution than the finite fourth-moment and that the degrees of heaviness of\ntails are heterogeneous across asset and over time. In this paper, to deal with\nthe heterogeneous heavy-tailed distributions, we develop an adaptive robust\nintegrated volatility estimator that employs pre-averaging and truncation\nschemes based on jump-diffusion processes. We call this an adaptive robust\npre-averaging realized volatility (ARP) estimator. We show that the ARP\nestimator has a sub-Weibull tail concentration with only finite 2$\\alpha$-th\nmoments for any $\\alpha>1$. In addition, we establish matching upper and lower\nbounds to show that the ARP estimation procedure is optimal.

While the P2P network design intends to hide the topology of the P2P\nnetwork, information about the topology is required to understand the network\nfrom a scientific point of view. Thus, there is a natural tension between the\n'desire' for unobservability on the one hand, and for observability on the\nother hand. On a middle ground, one would at least be interested on some\nstatistical features of the Bitcoin network like the number of peers that\nparticipate in the propagation of transactions and blocks. This number is\ncomposed of the number of reachable peers that accept incoming connections and\nunreachable peers that do not accept incoming connections. While the number of\nreachable peers can be measured, it is inherently difficult to determine the\nnumber of unreachable peers. Thus, the number of unreachable peers can only be\nestimated based on some indicators. In this paper, we first define our\nunderstanding of unreachable peers and then propose the PAL (Passive\nAnnouncement Listening) method which gives an estimate of the number of\nunreachable peers by observing ADDR messages that announce active IP addresses\nin the network. The PAL method allows for detecting unreachable peers that\nindicate that they provide services useful to the P2P network. In conjunction\nwith previous methods, the PAL method can help to get a better estimate of the\nnumber of unreachable peers. We use the PAL method to analyze data from a\nlong-term measurement of the Bitcoin P2P network that gives insights into the\ndevelopment of the number of unreachable peers over five years from 2015 to\n2020.

These include multibody dynamics,\nshape analysis, data science, image registration and biophysical simulations.\nTwo important classes of intrinsic Lie group integrators are the\nRunge--Kutta--Munthe--Kaas methods and the commutator free Lie group\nintegrators.\n  We give a short introduction to these classes of methods. The Hamiltonian\nframework is attractive for many mechanical problems, and in particular we\nshall consider Lie group integrators for problems on cotangent bundles of Lie\ngroups where a number of different formulations are possible. There is a\nnatural symplectic structure on such manifolds and through variational\nprinciples one may derive symplectic Lie group integrators. We also consider\nthe practical aspects of the implementation of Lie group integrators, such as\nadaptive time stepping. The theory is illustrated by applying the methods to\ntwo nontrivial applications in mechanics.

To describe the coherence and\npolarization dynamics of excitons after ultrafast excitation in these systems,\nwe employ the Bloch equation model of a two-level system extended by a local\nfield describing the exciton-exciton interaction. We calculate four-wave mixing\nsignals and analyze the dependence of the temporal and spectral signals as a\nfunction of the delay between the exciting pulses. Exact analytical results\nobtained for the case of ultrafast ($\\delta$-shaped) pulses are compared to\nnumerical solutions obtained for finite pulse durations. If two pulses are used\nto generate the nonlinear signal, characteristic spectral line splittings are\nrestricted to short delays. When considering a three-pulse excitation the line\nsplittings, induced by the local field effect, persist for long delays. All of\nthe found features are instructively explained within the Bloch vector picture\nand we show how the exciton occupation dynamics govern the different four-wave\nmixing signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 12:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

Recent studies has\nbeen shown that knowledge regarding the OSA related snore could assist in\nidentifying the site of airway collapse. Audio signal was recorded\nsimultaneously with full-night polysomnography during sleep with a ceiling\nmicrophone. Time and frequency features of the nocturnal audio signal were\nextracted to classify the audio signal into OSA related snore, simple snore and\nother sounds. Two algorithms were developed to extract OSA related snore using\nan linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on the hypothesis that\nOSA related snoring can assist in identifying the site-of-upper airway\ncollapse. An unbiased nested leave-one patient-out cross-validation process was\nused to select a high performing feature set from the full set of features.\nResults indicated that the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 87% for\nidentifying snore events from the audio recordings and an accuracy of 72% for\nidentifying OSA related snore events from the snore events. The direct method\nto extract OSA-related snore events using a multi-class LDA classifier achieved\nan accuracy of 64% using the feature selection algorithm. Our results gives a\nclear indication that OSA-related snore events can be extracted from nocturnal\nsound recordings, and therefore could potentially be used as a new tool for\nidentifying the site of airway collapse from the nocturnal audio recordings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 11:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Explaining how they form\nnear their present orbits requires understanding the structure of the inner\nregions of protoplanetary discs. Previous studies have argued that the hot\ninner protoplanetary disc is unstable to the magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI) due to thermal ionization of potassium, and that a local gas pressure\nmaximum forms at the outer edge of this MRI-active zone. Here we present a\nsteady-state model for inner discs accreting viscously, primarily due to the\nMRI. The structure and MRI-viscosity of the inner disc are fully coupled in our\nmodel; moreover, we account for many processes omitted in previous such models,\nincluding disc heating by both accretion and stellar irradiation, vertical\nenergy transport, realistic dust opacities, dust effects on disc ionization and\nnon-thermal sources of ionization. For a disc around a solar-mass star with a\nstandard gas accretion rate ($\\dot{M}$$\\sim$$10^{-8}$M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$) and\nsmall dust grains, we find that the inner disc is optically thick, and the\naccretion heat is primarily released near the midplane. As a result, both the\ndisc midplane temperature and the location of the pressure maximum are only\nmarginally affected by stellar irradiation, and the inner disc is also\nconvectively unstable. As previously suggested, the inner disc is primarily\nionized through thermionic and potassium ion emission from dust grains, which,\nat high temperatures, counteract adsorption of free charges onto grains. Our\nresults show that the location of the pressure maximum is determined by the\nthreshold temperature above which thermionic and ion emission become efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 17:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

To understand whether and how migration shapes\nlanguage formation processes we examine the dynamics of the naming game with\nmigrating agents. (i) When all agents may migrate, the dynamics generates an\neffective surface tension, which drives the coarsening. Such a behaviour is\nvery robust and appears for a wide range of densities of agents and their\nmigration rates. (ii) However, when only multilingual agents are allowed to\nmigrate, monolingual islands are typically formed. In such a case, when the\nmigration rate is sufficiently large, the majority of agents acquire a common\nlanguage, which spontaneously emerges with no indication of the surface-tension\ndriven coarsening. A relatively slow coarsening that takes place in a dense\nstatic population is very fragile, and most likely, an arbitrarily small\nmigration rate can divert the system toward quick formation of monolingual\nislands. Our work shows that migration influences language formation processes\nbut additional details like density, or mobility of agents are needed to\nspecify more precisely this influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

To overcome this, CycleGAN-VC3, an improved variant\nof CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates an additional module called time-frequency\nadaptive normalization (TFAN), has been proposed.

This task allows the\nconverter to learn time-frequency structures in a self-supervised manner and\neliminates the need for an additional module such as TFAN.

These predictions are useful instances to sample when\nlooking for high-confidence errors because they are prone to a higher rate of\nerror than expected. Our generalization allows Adversarial Distance to be\napplied to any classifier or data domain. Experimental results show that the\ngeneralized method finds errors at rates greater than expected given the\nconfidence of the sampled predictions, and outperforms competing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

The relaxation\ntime is mainly determined by the interplay between the magnetic properties of\nthe NPs and the rheological properties of NPs environment.

Here, we show that ZnxFe3-xO4 NPs dispersed through different with\nphase transition in the temperature range of the experiment: clarified butter\noil (CBO) and paraffin. These systems show non-linear behavior of the heating\nrate within the temperature range of the MFH experiments. For CBO, a fast\nincrease at $306 K$ associated to changes in the viscosity (\\texteta(T)) and\nspecific heat (c_p(T)) of the medium below and above its melting temperature.\nThis increment in the heating rate takes place around $318 K$ for paraffin.\nMagnetic and morphological characterizations of NPs together with the observed\nagglomeration of the nanoparticles above $306 K$ indicate that the fast\nincrease in MFH curves could not be associated to a change in the magnetic\nrelaxation mechanism, with N\\'eel relaxation being dominant. In fact,\nsuccessive experiment runs performed up to temperatures below and above the CBO\nmelting point resulted in different MFH curves due to agglomeration of NPs\ndriven by magnetic field inhomogeneity during the experiments. Similar effects\nwere observed for paraffin. Our results highlight the relevance of the NPs\nmedium's thermodynamic properties for an accurate measurement of the heating\nefficiency for in vitro and in vivo environments, where the thermal properties\nare largely variable within the temperature window of MFH experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

In the case of object\nrepresentation or activity (temporal object) representation, varying object\nparts is generally unfeasible whether they be spatial and/or temporal.\nMultilinear algebra, the algebra of higher-order tensors, is a suitable and\ntransparent framework for disentangling the causal factors of data formation.\nLearning a part-based intrinsic causal factor representations in a multilinear\nframework requires applying a set of interventions on a part-based multilinear\nmodel.

This theory can be extended to the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of completely overdamped Brownian colloidal particles\ntowards so-called dynamical density functional theory (DDFT). The success of\nDDFT makes it a promising candidate for a first-principle description of active\nmatter. In this lecture, we shall first recapitulate classical DDFT for passive\ncolloidal particles typically described by Smoluchowski equation. After a basic\nderivation of DDFT from the Smoluchowski equation, we discuss orientational\ndegrees of freedom and the effect of hydrodynamic interactions for passive\nparticles. This brings us into an ideal position to generalize DDFT towards\nactive matter. In particular we distinguish between \"dry active matter\" which\nis composed of self-propelled particles that contain no hydrodynamic flow\neffects of a surrounding solvent and \"wet active matter\" where the hydrodynamic\nflow fields generated by the microswimmers are taken into account. For the\nlatter, DDFT is a tool which unifies thermal fluctuations, direct particle\ninteractions, external driving fields and hydrodynamic effects arising from\ninternal self-propulsion discriminating between \"pushers\" and \"pullers\". A\nnumber of recent applications is discussed including transient clustering of\nself-propelled rods and the spontaneous formation of a hydrodynamic pump in\nconfined microswimmers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 14:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

From a theoretical perspective, universal approximability of\nTransformer-based models is also recently proved. However, the above\nunderstanding and analysis of self-attention is based on a pre-trained model.\nTo rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance\nof different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising\nresult is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important\ncompared with other attention positions.

This solver is particularly\nsuited for simulating the interaction between short laser pulses with plasmas.\nThe fluid solver relies on two-step Lax-Wendroff split with a fourth-order\nRunge-Kutta scheme, and we use the PseudoSpectral Analytical Time-Domain\n(PSATD) method to solve Maxwell's curl equations. Overall, this method is only\nbased on finite difference schemes and fast Fourier transforms and does not\nrequire any grid staggering. The PseudoSpectral Analytical Time-Domain method\nremoves the numerical dispersion for transverse electromagnetic wave\npropagation in the absence of current that is conventionally observed for other\nMaxwell solvers. The full algorithm is validated by conservation of energy and\nmomentum when an electromagnetic pulse is launched onto a plasma ramp and by\nquantitative agreement with wave conversion of p-polarized electromagnetic wave\nonto a plasma ramp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 14:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

We demonstrate that the\ncarbon-rich dust in A30 and A78 is spatially coincident with the H-poor ejecta\nand coexists with hot X-ray-emitting gas up to distances of 50$''$ from the\ncentral stars (CSPNs). Dust forms immediately after the born-again event and\nsurvives for 1000 yr in the harsh environment around the CSPN as it is\ndestroyed and pushed away by radiation pressure and dragged by hydrodynamical\neffects. Spitzer IRS spectral maps showed that the broad spectral features at\n6.4 and 8.0 $\\mu$m, attributed to amorphous carbon formed in H-deficient\nenvironments, are associated with the disrupted disk around their CSPN,\nproviding an optimal environment for charge exchange reactions with the stellar\nwind that produces the soft X-ray emission of these sources. Nebular and dust\nproperties are modeled for A30 with Cloudy taking into account different\ncarbonaceous dust species. Our models predict dust temperatures in the 40-230 K\nrange, five times lower than predicted by previous works.

In this\nperspective, the spectral dimension plays a key role since it determines the\neffective dimension for diffusion processes on a network. Despite its\nrelevance, a theoretical understanding of which mechanisms lead to a finite\nspectral dimension, and how this can be controlled, represents nowadays still a\nchallenge and is the object of intense research.

This paper proposes a new methodology that allows tuning CPG\ncontrollers through gradient-based optimization in a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time CPGs have\nbeen trained in conjunction with a MultilayerPerceptron (MLP) network in a\nDeep-RL context.

In this\nmultimethod study, we combine a finite-temperature tensor network method,\nminimally entangled thermal typical states (METTS), with two\nGreen-function-based methods, connected-determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo\nand cellular dynamical mean-field theory, to establish several aspects of this\nmodel. We elucidate the evolution from the metallic to the insulating regime\nfrom the complementary perspectives brought by these different methods. We\ncompute the full thermodynamics of the model on a width-four cylinder using\nMETTS in the intermediate to strong coupling regime. We find that the\ninsulating state hosts a large entropy at intermediate temperatures, which\nincreases with the strength of the coupling. Correspondingly, and consistently\nwith a thermodynamic Maxwell relation, the double occupancy has a minimum as a\nfunction of temperature which is the manifestation of the Pomeranchuk effect of\nincreased localization upon heating. The intermediate coupling regime is found\nto exhibit both pronounced chiral as well as stripy antiferromagnetic spin\ncorrelations. We propose a scenario in which time-reversal symmetry-broken\nstates compete with stripy-spin states at lowest temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 14:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 15:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Our current ability to predict and analyse the\njoint effects of multiple stressors is insufficient to make the prospective\nrisk assessment of chemicals more ecologically relevant because we lack a full\nunderstanding of how organisms respond to stress factors alone and in\ncombination. Here, we describe a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) based\nbioenergetics model that predicts the potential effects of single or multiple\nnatural and chemical stressors on life history traits. We demonstrate the\nplausibility of the model using a meta-analysis of 128 existing studies on\nfreshwater invertebrates. We then validate our model by comparing its\npredictions for a combination of three stressors (i.e. chemical, temperature,\nand food availability) with new, independent experimental data on life history\ntraits in the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia. We found that the model predictions\nare in agreement with observed growth curves and reproductive traits. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of\nthree stress factors on life history traits observed in laboratory studies have\nbeen predicted successfully in invertebrates. We suggest that a re-analysis of\nexisting studies on multiple stressors within the modelling framework outlined\nhere will provide a robust null model for identifying stressor interactions,\nand expect that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will arise\nfrom these new analyses.

However, as genuine tables\ncontaining relational knowledge only account for a small proportion of tables\non the web, reliable genuine web table classification is a crucial first step\nof table extraction. Previous works usually rely on explicit feature\nconstruction from the HTML code. In contrast, we propose an approach for web\ntable classification by exploiting the full visual appearance of a table, which\nworks purely by applying a convolutional neural network on the rendered image\nof the web table. Since these visual features can be extracted automatically,\nour approach circumvents the need for explicit feature construction. A new hand\nlabeled gold standard dataset containing HTML source code and images for 13,112\ntables was generated for this task. Transfer learning techniques are applied to\nwell known VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures. The evaluation of CNN image\nclassification with fine tuned ResNet50 (F1 93.29%) shows that this approach\nachieves results comparable to previous solutions using explicitly defined HTML\ncode based features. By combining visual and explicit features, an F-measure of\n93.70% can be achieved by Random Forest classification, which beats current\nstate of the art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 07:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Sign\nlanguage recognition (SLR) is the automatic recognition of sign language, which\nrepresents a challenging problem for computers, though some progress has been\nmade recently using deep learning. Huge amounts of data are generally required\nto train deep learning models. However, corresponding datasets are missing for\nthe majority of sign languages. Transfer learning is a technique to utilize a\nrelated task with an abundance of data available to help solve a target task\nlacking sufficient data. Transfer learning has been applied highly successfully\nin computer vision and natural language processing. However, much less research\nhas been conducted in the field of SLR. This paper investigates how effectively\ntransfer learning can be applied to isolated SLR using an inflated 3D\nconvolutional neural network as the deep learning architecture. Transfer\nlearning is implemented by pre-training a network on the American Sign Language\ndataset MS-ASL and subsequently fine-tuning it separately on three different\nsizes of the German Sign Language dataset SIGNUM. The results of the\nexperiments give clear empirical evidence that transfer learning can be\neffectively applied to isolated SLR.
