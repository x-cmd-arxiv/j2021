We used Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History\n(SMASH) DR2 data sets, as well as those employed to identify these star cluster\ncandidates, to produce relatively deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of 17\nout of 20 discovered age gap star clusters with the aim of investigating them\nin detail. Our analysis relies on a thorough CMD cleaning procedure of the\nfield star contamination, which presents variations in its stellar density and\nastrophysical properties, such as luminosity and effective temperature, around\nthe star cluster fields. We built star cluster CMDs from stars with membership\nprobabilities assigned from the cleaning procedure. These CMDs and their\nrespective spatial distribution maps favor the existence of LMC star field\ndensity fluctuations rather than age gap star clusters, although a definitive\nassessment on them will be possible from further deeper photometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 16:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Recent\napproaches based on low-cost monocular or stereo cameras promise to overcome\nthese limitations but struggle in low-light or low-contrast regions as they\nrely on passive CMOS sensors. In this work, we propose a novel 3D object\ndetection modality that exploits temporal illumination cues from a low-cost\nmonocular gated imager. We propose a novel deep detector architecture, Gated3D,\nthat is tailored to temporal illumination cues from three gated images. Gated\nimages allow us to exploit mature 2D object feature extractors that guide the\n3D predictions through a frustum segment estimation. We assess the proposed\nmethod on a novel 3D detection dataset that includes gated imagery captured in\nover 10,000 km of driving data.

Spatially and temporally resolved direct numerical\nsimulation data is used to analyze the strong wall-parallel movements\nconditioned to low-speed streamwise flow. The analysis of the streaks shows\nthat there is a clear distinction between wall-attached and detached streaks,\nand that the former can be further categorized into streaks that are contained\nin the buffer layer and the ones that reach the outer region. The results\nreveal that streaks are born in the buffer layer, coalescing with each other to\ncreate larger streaks that are still attached to the wall. Once the streak\nbecomes large enough, it starts to meander due to the large\nstreamwise-to-wall-normal aspect ratio, and consequently the elongation in the\nstreamwise direction, which makes it more difficult for the streak to be\noriented strictly in the streamwise direction. While the continuous interaction\nof the streaks allows the super-structure to span extremely long temporal and\nlength scales, individual streak components are relatively small and\nshort-lived. Tall-attached streaks eventually split into wall-attached and\nwall-detached components. These wall-detached streaks have a strong wall-normal\nvelocity away from the wall, similar to ejections or bursts observed in the\nliterature. Conditionally averaging the flow fields to these split events show\nthat the detached streak has not only a larger wall-normal velocity compared to\nthe wall-attached counterpart, it also has a larger (less negative) streamwise\nvelocity, similar to the velocity field at the tip of a vortex cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 18:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 23:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The\nself-limiting nature of the chemical reactions during ALD provides excellent\ncontrol over the layer thickness. However, in contrast to idealized growth\nmodels, it is experimentally challenging to create continuous monolayers by ALD\nbecause surface inhomogeneities and precursor steric interactions result in\nisland growth during film nucleation. Thus, the ability to create pin-hole free\nmonolayers by ALD would offer new opportunities for controlling interfacial\ncharge and mass transport in semiconductor devices, as well as for tailoring\nsurface chemistry.

For DM in the interesting mass range below\n$\\sim 1$ GeV, it is well known that bounds from the CMB provide a very strong\nmodel building constraint forcing the DM annihilation cross section to be\nroughly 3 orders of magnitude below that needed to reproduce the observed relic\ndensity. Under most circumstances this removes the possibility of an $s$-wave\nannihilation process for DM in this mass range as would be the case, e.g., if\nthe DM were a Dirac fermion. In an extra-dimensional setup explored previously,\nit was found that the $s$-channel exchange of multiple gauge bosons could\nsimultaneously encompass a suppressed annihilation cross section during the CMB\nera while also producing a sufficiently large annihilation rate during\nfreeze-out to recover the DM relic density. In this paper, we analyze more\nglobally the necessary requirements for this mechanism to work successfully and\nthen realize them within the context of a simple model with two `dark' gauge\nbosons having masses of a similar magnitude and whose contributions to the\nannihilation amplitude destructively interfere. We show that if the DM mass\nthreshold lies appropriately in the saddle region of this destructive\ninterference between the two resonance humps it then becomes possible to\nsatisfy these requirements simultaneously provided several ancillary conditions\nare met.

Instead of the augmented\nLagrangian method that is widely used for mechanical contact problems, we\nprefer here the Linear Complementarity Programming (LCP) method as basic\nmethodology. It has the advantage of resulting in the much smaller dual problem\nthat is associated with the governing variational principle and that turns out\nto be beneficial for the model order reduction. Since the shape of the contact\nzone depends strongly on the acting outer forces, the LCP for the Lagrange\nmultipliers has to be solved in each time step. The model order reduction\nscheme, on the other hand, is applied to the large linear system for the\ndisplacements and computed in advance by means of an Arnoldi process. In terms\nof computational effort the reduction scheme is very appealing because the\ncontact constraints are fully satisfied while the reduction acts only on the\ndisplacements.

The input noise is Brownian motion, the output samples are\ntime-evolving paths produced by a numerical solver, and by parameterising a\ndiscriminator as a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (CDE), we obtain\nNeural SDEs as (in modern machine learning parlance) continuous-time generative\ntime series models. Unlike previous work on this problem, this is a direct\nextension of the classical approach without reference to either prespecified\nstatistics or density functions.

This provides a valuable cross-check to band-averaged polarization\nefficiency measurements determined using other approaches. We demonstrate that,\nin $\\Lambda$CDM, the combination of the TE and EE constrain polarization\ncalibration with sub-percent uncertainty with Planck data and 2% uncertainty\nwith SPTpol data.

The\nuncertainties on cosmological parameters are minimally impacted when\nmarginalizing over polarization calibration, except, as can be expected, for\nthe uncertainty on the amplitude of the primordial scalar power spectrum\n$\\ln(10^{10} A_{\\rm s})$, which increases by $20-50$%.

For current and future\nground-based experiments, SPT-3G and CMB-S4, we forecast the cosmological\nparameter uncertainties to be minimally degraded when marginalizing over\npolarization calibration parameters. In addition, CMB-S4 could constrain its\npolarization calibration at the level of $\\sim$0.2% by combining TE and EE, and\nreach $\\sim$0.06% by also including TT.

With a limited number of daily COVID-19 tests performed in\nevery country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect\nof each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in\nmanaging the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. Methods: We introduce\nCOVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that\nevaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and\nprovides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should\nbe. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a\ngeographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused\nby an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as\nenvironmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation\nmeasures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates\nthat if the policy-makers relax the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days then\nboth the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths\nincrease exponentially by an average of 5.1x, who may occupy ICU beds and\nventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model\naccurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations,\nand deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to\nmodify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental\nconditions and mitigation measures.

Charge interactions of intrinsically\ndisordered proteins (IDPs) and other biomolecules are sensitive to the aqueous\ndielectric environment. Because the relative permittivity of protein is\nsignificantly lower than that of water, the interior of an IDP condensate is a\nrelatively low-dielectric regime, which, aside from its possible functional\neffects on client molecules, should facilitate stronger electrostatic\ninteractions among the scaffold IDPs. To gain insight into this LLPS-induced\ndielectric heterogeneity, addressing in particular whether a low-dielectric\ncondensed phase entails more favorable LLPS than that posited by assuming IDP\nelectrostatic interactions are uniformly modulated by the higher dielectric\nconstant of the pure solvent, we consider a simplified multiple-chain model of\npolyampholytes immersed in explicit solvents that are either polarizable or\npossess a permanent dipole. Notably, simulated phase behaviors of these systems\nexhibit only minor to moderate differences from those obtained using\nimplicit-solvent models with a uniform relative permittivity equals to that of\npure solvent. Buttressed by theoretical treatments developed here using random\nphase approximation and polymer field-theoretic simulations, these observations\nindicate a partial compensation of effects between favorable solvent-mediated\ninteractions among the polyampholytes in the condensed phase and favorable\npolyampholyte-solvent interactions in the dilute phase, often netting only a\nminor enhancement of overall LLPS propensity from the very dielectric\nheterogeneity that arises from the LLPS itself.

Conversely, when foot-points move from the source of\nslow wind into faster wind, a Super-Parker Spiral field structure is formed:\nbelow the Alfven critical point, one-sided transverse field-aligned flows\ndevelop; above the Alfven critical point, the field structure contracts between\nadjacent solar wind flows, and the radial field component decreases in\nmagnitude with distance from the Sun, eventually reversing into a switchback.\nThe Sub-Parker and Super-Parker Spirals behave functionally as opposites.\nObservations from Parker Solar Probe confirm the paucity of switchbacks within\nrarefaction regions and immediately outside these rarefaction regions, we\nobserve numerous switchbacks in the magnetic field that are directly associated\nwith abrupt transients in solar wind speed. The radial component of the\nmagnetic field, the speed gradients, radial Alfven speed, and the ratio of the\nsound speed to the radial Alfven speed all conform to predictions based on the\nSub-Parker and Super-Parker Spirals within rarefaction regions and solar wind\nspeed enhancements (spikes or jets), respectively.

Due to the slow nature of agriculture, decisions in pruning are\ntypically made using tradition or rules of thumb rather than data-driven\nanalysis. Many existing algorithmic, simulation-based approaches rely on\nhigh-fidelity digital captures or purely computer-generated fruit trees, and\nare unable to provide specific results on an orchard scale. We present a\nframework for suggesting pruning strategies on LiDAR-scanned commercial fruit\ntrees using a scoring function with a focus on improving light distribution\nthroughout the canopy. A scoring function to assess the quality of the tree\nshape based on its light availability and size was developed for comparative\nanalysis between trees, and was validated against yield characteristics,\ndemonstrating a reasonable correlation against fruit count with an $R^2$ score\nof 0.615 for avocado and 0.506 for mango. A tool was implemented for simulating\npruning by algorithmically estimating which parts of a tree point cloud would\nbe removed given specific cut points using structural analysis of the tree,\nvalidated experimentally with an average F1 score of 0.78 across 144\nexperiments. Finally, new pruning locations were suggested and we used the\nprevious two stages to estimate the improvement of the tree given these\nsuggestions. The light distribution was improved by up to 25.15\\%,\ndemonstrating a 16\\% improvement over commercial pruning on a real tree, and\ncertain cut points were discovered which improved light distribution with a\nsmaller negative impact on tree volume. The final results suggest value in the\nframework as a decision making tool for commercial growers, or as a starting\npoint for automated pruning since the entire process can be performed with\nlittle human intervention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 02:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

Implicit\nmodels such as GANs tend to generate better samples compared to explicit models\nthat are trained on tractable data likelihood. However, GANs overlook the\nexplicit data density characteristics which leads to undesirable quantitative\nevaluations and mode collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid\ngenerative adversarial network (HGAN) for which we can enforce data density\nestimation via an autoregressive model and support both adversarial and\nlikelihood framework in a joint training manner which diversify the estimated\ndensity in order to cover different modes.

While it is clear that this practice can\nreduce sensing and compute costs, recent results indicate a further benefit. On\nmany Atari console games, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms deliver\nsubstantially better policies when run with $d > 1$ -- in fact with $d$ even as\nhigh as $180$. In this paper, we investigate the role of the parameter $d$ in\nRL; $d$ is called the \"frame-skip\" parameter, since states in the Atari domain\nare images. For evaluating a fixed policy, we observe that under standard\nconditions, frame-skipping does not affect asymptotic consistency. Depending on\nother parameters, it can possibly even benefit learning. To use $d > 1$ in the\ncontrol setting, one must first specify which $d$-step open-loop action\nsequences can be executed in between sensing steps. We focus on\n\"action-repetition\", the common restriction of this choice to $d$-length\nsequences of the same action. We define a task-dependent quantity called the\n\"price of inertia\", in terms of which we upper-bound the loss incurred by\naction-repetition.

High diversity, abundance, and limited known phages pose great\nchallenges for taxonomic analysis. In particular, alignment-based tools have\ndifficulty in classifying fast accumulating contigs assembled from metagenomic\ndata. Results: In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised learning model,\nnamed PhaGCN, to conduct taxonomic classification for phage contigs. In this\nlearning model, we construct a knowledge graph by combining the DNA sequence\nfeatures learned by convolutional neural network (CNN) and protein sequence\nsimilarity gained from gene-sharing network.

This\nposition paper elaborates on the theory of distributed systems to advance a\nclear definition of blockchain that allows us to clarify its role in the IoT.\nThis definition inextricably binds together three elements that, as a whole,\nprovide the blockchain with those unique features that distinguish it from\nother distributed ledger technologies: immutability, transparency and\nanonimity.

It leverages the formalism of the Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition technique together with the concept of balanced realization. It\nis assumed that the only information available on the system comes from input,\nstate, and output trajectories generated by numerical simulations or recorded\nand estimated during experiments, thus the approach is fully data-driven. The\ngoal is to obtain an input-output low dimensional linear model which\napproximates the system across its operating range. Since the dynamics of\naeroservoelastic systems markedly changes in operation (e.g. due to change in\nflight speed or altitude), time-varying features are retained in the\nconstructed models. This is achieved by generating a Linear Parameter-Varying\nrepresentation made of a collection of state-consistent linear time-invariant\nreduced-order models. The algorithm formulation hinges on the idea of replacing\nthe orthogonal projection onto the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition modes, used\nin Dynamic Mode Decomposition-based approaches, with a balancing oblique\nprojection constructed entirely from data. As a consequence, the input-output\ninformation captured in the lower-dimensional representation is increased\ncompared to other projections onto subspaces of same or lower size. Moreover, a\nparameter-varying projection is possible while also achieving\nstate-consistency.

Motivated by those open questions, we performed two-way\ncoupled direct numerical simulations of inertialess spheroids in turbulent\nchannel flow by an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The additional stress accounts\nfor the feedback from inertialess spheroids on the fluid phase.

One approach that has shown great promise recently is Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs). Literature, however, lacks two major things when it\ncomes to CNNs and radio galaxy morphological classification. Firstly, a proper\nanalysis of whether overfitting occurs when training CNNs to perform radio\ngalaxy morphological classification using a small curated training set is\nneeded. Secondly, a good comparative study regarding the practical\napplicability of the CNN architectures in literature is required. Both of these\nshortcomings are addressed in this paper.

The schemes are proven to preserve numerical solutions\nin a global invariant region constituted by all the known intrinsic\nconstraints: minimum entropy principle, the subluminal constraint on fluid\nvelocity, and the positivity of pressure and rest-mass density. Relativistic\neffects lead to some essential difficulties in the present study, which are not\nencountered in the non-relativistic case. Most notably, in the RHD case the\nspecific entropy is a highly nonlinear implicit function of the conservative\nvariables, and, moreover, there is also no explicit formula of the flux in\nterms of the conservative variables. In order to overcome the resulting\nchallenges, we first propose a novel equivalent form of the invariant region,\nby skillfully introducing two auxiliary variables. As a notable feature, all\nthe constraints in the novel form are explicit and linear with respect to the\nconservative variables. This provides a highly effective approach to\ntheoretically analyze the invariant-region-preserving (IRP) property of schemes\nfor RHD, without any assumption on the IRP property of the exact Riemann\nsolver.

Yet, nearly all current\nvariants of Kalman filters are formulated in the Euclidean space\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, while many real-world systems (e.g., robotic systems) are\nreally evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a method to develop\nKalman filters for such on-manifold systems. Utilizing $\\boxplus$, $\\boxminus$\noperations and further defining an oplus operation on the respective manifold,\nwe propose a canonical representation of the on-manifold system. Such a\ncanonical form enables us to separate the manifold constraints from the system\nbehaviors in each step of the Kalman filter, ultimately leading to a generic\nand symbolic Kalman filter framework that are naturally evolving on the\nmanifold. Furthermore, the on-manifold Kalman filter is implemented as a\ntoolkit in $C$++ packages which enables users to implement an on-manifold\nKalman filter just like the normal one in $\\mathbb{R}^n$: the user needs only\nto provide the system-specific descriptions, and then call the respective\nfilter steps (e.g., predict, update) without dealing with any of the manifold\nconstraints. The existing implementation supports full iterated Kalman\nfiltering for systems on any manifold composed of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $SO(3)$ and\n$\\mathbb{S}^2$, and is extendable to other types of manifold when necessary.\nThe proposed symbolic Kalman filter and the developed toolkit are verified by\nimplementing a tightly-coupled lidar-inertial navigation system.

Shrinkage is incorporated\ninto the framework by introducing an isotropic volumetric expansion/contraction\nin the kinematics of the body. We show that the parameter for shrinkage also\nappears in the systematically derived rate-type constitutive relation for the\nstress. The solidification of the melt around the glass transition temperature\nis emulated by drastically increasing the viscosity of the melt.\n  In order to illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the derived\nconstitutive relation, we consider four ribbons of polymeric melt stacked on\neach other such as those extruded using a flat nozzle: each layer laid\ninstantaneously and allowed to cool for one second before another layer is laid\non it.

This problem\nis challenging on massive graphs, e.g., with millions of nodes and billions of\nedges.

The\nmain contributions of ACMin are twofold: (i) a novel formulation of the k-AGC\nproblem based on an attributed multi-hop conductance quality measure\ncustom-made for this problem setting, which effectively captures cluster\ncoherence in terms of both topological proximities and attribute similarities,\nand (ii) a linear-time optimization solver that obtains high-quality clusters\niteratively, based on efficient matrix operations such as orthogonal\niterations, an alternative optimization approach, as well as an initialization\ntechnique that significantly speeds up the convergence of ACMin in practice.\n  Extensive experiments, comparing 11 competitors on 6 real datasets,\ndemonstrate that ACMin consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of\nresult quality measured against ground-truth labels, while being up to orders\nof magnitude faster.

Autonomous\nnavigation allows drones to visit waypoints and accomplish activities as part\nof their mission. A common activity is to hover and observe a location using\non-board cameras. Advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) allow such videos to\nbe analyzed for automated decision making. UAVs also host edge computing\ncapability for on-board inferencing by such DNNs. To this end, for a fleet of\ndrones, we propose a novel Mission Scheduling Problem (MSP) that co-schedules\nthe flight routes to visit and record video at waypoints, and their subsequent\non-board edge analytics. The proposed schedule maximizes the utility from the\nactivities while meeting activity deadlines as well as energy and computing\nconstraints. We first prove that MSP is NP-hard and then optimally solve it by\nformulating a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Next, we design\ntwo efficient heuristic algorithms, JSC and VRC, that provide fast sub-optimal\nsolutions. Evaluation of these three schedulers using real drone traces\ndemonstrate utility-runtime trade-offs under diverse workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 18:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

In this work, we tackle this issue with\nconcurrency, yet we aim to take a radically different approach by valuing\nsimplicity. We embrace the simplicity through two steps: first, we formulate a\nsimple runtime mechanism to deal with conflicts called concurrency delegation.\nThis method is much simpler and has less overhead, particularly in scenarios\nwhere conflicting transactions are relatively rare. Moreover, to further reduce\nthe number of conflicting transactions, we propose using static annotations\nattached to each transaction, provided by the programmer. These annotations are\npseudo-static: they are static with respect to the lifetime of the transaction,\nand therefore are free to use information such as the origin and parameters of\nthe transaction. We propose a distributor component that can use the output of\nthis pseudo-static annotations and use them to effectively distribute\ntransactions between threads in the least-conflicting way. We name the outcome\nof a system combining concurrency delegation and pseudo-static annotations as\nSonicChain. We evaluate SonicChain for both validation and authoring tasks\nagainst a common workload in blockchains, namely, balance transfers, and\nobserve that it performs expectedly well while introducing very little overhead\nand additional complexity to the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 19:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}
