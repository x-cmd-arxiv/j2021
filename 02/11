This\nwork addresses this problem by assuming the existence of a field theory with\nthe expected properties and constructs equivalent representations with instant\nand front form kinematic subgroups. In this construction both the light-front\nand instant-form formulations share the same vacuum and one-particle states.\nThe free field Fock space plays no role. There is no \"quantization\" of a\nclassical theory.

The traditional implementation of CST\ngenerally places the target field in the central region of laser sensing, the\nso-called Region of Interest (RoI), with uniform-size meshes. The centre of the\nRoI locates at the midpoint between the laser emitters and receivers, while the\nsize of the RoI is empirically determined by the optical layout. A too small\nRoI cannot make the most use of laser beams, while a too large one leads to\nmuch severer rank deficiency in CST. To solve the above-mentioned issues, we\nintroduce hybrid-size meshing, for the first time, by reforming the density of\nthe pixels in the entire sensing region of CST. This development alleviates the\nill-posedness of the CST inverse problem by detailing the target flow field\nwith dense pixels in the RoI and fully considering the complete physical\nabsorption model with sparse pixels out of the RoI. The proposed scheme was\nboth numerically and experimentally validated using a CST sensor with 32 laser\nbeams using a variety of computational tomographic algorithms. The images\nreconstructed using the hybrid-size meshing scheme show better accuracy and\nfiner profile of the target flow, compared with those reconstructed using the\ntraditionally uniform-size meshing. The proposed hybrid-size meshing scheme\nsignificantly facilitates the industrial application of CST towards practical\ncombustors, in which the combustion zone is bypassed by cooling air. In these\nscenarios, the proposed scheme can better characterise the combustion zone with\ndense meshes, while maintaining the integrity of the physical model by\nconsidering the absorption in the bypass air with sparse meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 14:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

According to the human perception, image\nsegmentation is the process of dividing an image into non-overlapping regions.\nThese regions, which may correspond, e.g., to different objects, are\nfundamental for the correct interpretation and classification of the scene\nrepresented by the image. The division into regions is not unique, but it\ndepends on the application, i.e., it must be driven by the final goal of the\nsegmentation and hence by the most significant features with respect to that\ngoal. Thus, image segmentation can be regarded as a strongly ill-posed problem.\nA classical approach to deal with ill posedness consists in incorporating in\nthe model a-priori information about the solution, e.g., in the form of penalty\nterms. In this work we provide a brief overview of basic computational models\nfor image segmentation, focusing on edge-based and region-based variational\nmodels, as well as on statistical and machine-learning approaches. We also\nsketch numerical methods that are applied in computing solutions to these\nmodels. In our opinion, our view can help the readers identify suitable classes\nof methods for solving their specific problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 17:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 17:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 16:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

First, we formulate the polarizations in linear\nmassive gravity (MG) with generic mass terms of non-Fierz-Pauli type by\nidentifying all the independent variables that obey Klein-Gordon-type\nequations. The dynamical degrees of freedom (dofs) in the generic MG consist of\nspin-2 and spin-0 modes, the former breaking down into two tensor (helicity-2),\ntwo vector (helicity-1) and one scalar (helicity-0) components, while the\nlatter just corresponding to a scalar. We find convenient ways of decomposing\nthe two scalar modes of each spin into distinct linear combinations of the\ntransverse and longitudinal polarizations with coefficients directly expressed\nby the mass parameters, thereby serving as a useful tool in measuring the\nmasses of GWs. Then we analyze the linear perturbations of generic\nhigher-curvature gravity (HCG) whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary polynomial of\nthe Riemann tensor. On a flat background, the linear dynamical dofs in this\ntheory are identified as massless spin-2, massive spin-2, and massive spin-0\nmodes. As its massive part encompasses the identical structure to the generic\nMG, GWs in the generic HCG provide six massive polarizations on top of the\nordinary two massless modes. In parallel to MG, we find convenient\nrepresentations for the scalar-polarization modes directly connected to the\nparameters of HCG. In this analysis, we employ two distinct methods; One takes\nfull advantage of the partial equivalence between the generic HCG and MG at the\nlinear level, whereas the other relies upon a gauge-invariant formalism. We\nconfirm that the two results agree. We also discuss methods to determine the\ntheory parameters by GW-polarization measurements. Our method does not require\nmeasuring the propagation speeds or the details of the waveforms of the GWs.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 08:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

SHAP determines consistently\nthat only the laminar profile, the streamwise vortex, and a specific streak\ninstability play a major role in the prediction. We demonstrate that the method\ncan be applied to larger fluid dynamics datasets by a SHAP evaluation on plane\nCouette flow in a minimal flow unit focussing on the relevance of streaks and\ntheir instabilities for the prediction of relaminarisation events. Here, we\nfind that the prediction is based on proxies for streak modulations\ncorresponding to linear streak instabilities within the SSP.

Attention is primarily given\nto the non-trainable weights used during inference, as they are the primary\nsource of unexpected behaviour or degradation in performance during transfer\nlearning.

However,\nexactly how source size relates to scattering due to turbulence is still\nsubject to investigation. The theoretical predictions relating source\nbroadening to propagation effects have not been fully confirmed by observations\ndue to the rarity of high spatial resolution observations of the solar corona\nat low frequencies. Here, the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) was used to observe\nthe solar corona at 120-180 MHz using baselines of up to ~3.5 km (corresponding\nto a resolution of ~1-2') during the partial solar eclipse of 2015 March 20. A\nlunar de-occultation technique was used to achieve higher spatial resolution\n(~0.6') than that attainable via standard interferometric imaging (~2.4'). This\nprovides a means of studying the contribution of scattering to apparent source\nsize broadening. It was found that the de-occultation technique reveals a more\nstructured quiet corona that is not resolved from standard imaging, implying\nscattering may be overestimated in this region when using standard imaging\ntechniques. However, an active region source was measured to be ~4' using both\nde-occultation and standard imaging. This may be explained by the increased\nscattering of radio waves by turbulent density fluctuations in active regions,\nwhich is more severe than in the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

We present a large-scale numerical study, simulating\ncircuits with up to 40 qubits and 352 parameters, that demonstrates the\npotential of the proposed approach. We evaluate quantum optimization heuristics\non the problem of detecting multiple communities in networks, for which we\nintroduce a novel qubit-frugal formulation. We numerically compare L-VQE with\nQuantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and demonstrate that QAOA\nachieves lower approximation ratios while requiring significantly deeper\ncircuits. We show that L-VQE is more robust to finite sampling errors and has a\nhigher chance of finding the solution as compared with standard VQE approaches.\nOur simulation results show that L-VQE performs well under realistic hardware\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:53:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 14:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 13:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Several PMS platforms provide multiple\nfunctions for various sensing purposes, but they are suffering from the open\nissues: limited use of their functions for a specific scenario/case and\nrequiring technical knowledge for organizers. In this paper, we propose a novel\nPMS platform named ParmoSense for easily and flexibly collecting urban\nenvironmental information. To reduce the burden on both organizers and\nparticipants, in ParmoSense, we employ two novel features: modularization of\nfunctions and scenario-based PMS system description. For modularization, we\nprovide the essential PMS functions as modules which can be easily chosen and\ncombined for sensing in different scenarios. The scenario-based description\nfeature allows organizers to easily and quickly set up a new participatory\nsensing instance and participants to easily install the corresponding scenario\nand participate in the sensing. Moreover, ParmoSense provides GUI tools as well\nfor creating and distributing PMS system easily, editing and visualizing\ncollected data quickly. It also provides multiple functions for encouraging\nparticipants' motivation for sustainable operation of the system. Through\nperformance comparison with existing PMS platforms, we confirmed ParmoSense\nshows the best cost-performance in the perspective of the workload for\npreparing PMS system and varieties of functions. In addition, to evaluate the\navailability and usability of ParmoSense, we conducted 19 case studies, which\nhave different locations, scales, and purposes, over 4 years with cooperation\nfrom ordinary citizens. Through the case studies and the questionnaire survey\nfor participants and organizers, we confirmed that ParmoSense can be easily\noperated and participated by ordinary citizens including non-technical persons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 17:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

These observatories include\nthe dedicated Beta Pictoris monitoring observatory bRing at Sutherland and\nSiding Springs, the ASTEP400 telescope at Concordia, and observations from the\nspace observatories BRITE and Hubble Space Telescope.\n  We search the combined light curves for evidence of short period transient\nevents caused by rings and for longer term photometric variability due to\ndiffuse circumplanetary material. We find no photometric event that matches\nwith the event seen in November 1981, and there is no systematic photometric\ndimming of the star as a function of the Hill sphere radius. We conclude that\nthe 1981 event was not caused by the transit of a circumplanetary disk around\nBeta Pictoris b.\n  The upper limit on the long term variability of Beta Pictoris places an upper\nlimit of $1.8\\times 10^{22}$ g of dust within the Hill sphere. Circumplanetary\nmaterial is either condensed into a non-transiting disk, is condensed into a\ndisk with moons that has a small obliquity, or is below our detection\nthreshold. This is the first time that a dedicated international campaign has\nmapped the Hill sphere transit of a gas giant extrasolar planet at 10 au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

However, special care must be taken when drawing\nphysical conclusions from such simulations to ensure that results are not\nbiased by numerical artifacts. We demonstrate how the use of improved sink\nmethods reduces some of these potential biases in vertically-integrated\nsimulations of aspect ratio 0.1 accretion disks around binaries with mass\nratios between 0.1 and 1. Specifically, we show that sink terms that do not\nreduce the angular momentum of gas relative to the accreting object: 1) reduce\nthe dependence on the sink rate of physical quantities such as the torque on\nthe binary, distribution of accretion between binary components, and evolution\nof the binary semi-major axis; 2) reduce the degree to which the sink rate\naffects the structure of the accretion disks around each binary component; 3)\nalter the inferred variability of accretion onto the binary, making it more\nregular in time. We also investigate other potential sources of systematic\nerror, such as the precise from of gravitational softening and previously\nemployed simplifications to the viscous stress tensor. Because of the strong\ndependence of the orbital evolution of the binary on both the torque and\ndistribution of mass between binary components, the sink methods employed can\nhave a significant effect on the inferred orbital evolution of the binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 19:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Motivated\nby the emergence of this plethora of 4d and 5d transition metal Kitaev\nmaterials and by the fact that some level of disorder is inevitable in real\nmaterials, here we study how the Kitaev QSL responds to various forms of\ndisorder, such as vacancies, impurities, and bond randomness. First, we argue\nthat the presence of the quenched disorder in the Kitaev QSL can lead to the\nAnderson localization of Majorana fermions and the appearance of Lifshitz\ntails. We point out that the Anderson localization of low-energy states is\nparticularly strong in the extended Kitaev model with the time reversal\nsymmetry breaking term. Second, we show that the disorder effects on the\nlow-energy Majorana fermion modes can be detected in thermal transport. Third,\nwe show that at finite temperatures the $Z_2$ fluxes become thermally excited\nand give rise to an additional disorder for the Majorana fermions. This source\nof the disorder dominates at high temperatures. Fourth, we demonstrate that\nboth the structure of the energy spectrum and the thermal transport properties\nof the disordered Kitaev QSL depend strongly on the character of disorder.\nWhile we find that both the site disorder and the bond randomness suppress the\nlongitudinal thermal conductivity, the low-energy localization is stronger in\nthe case of the site disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 19:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 18:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

We use analytic estimates validated by time-dependent\nspherically-symmetric simulations to derive expressions for the mass-loss rate,\nmomentum flux, and speed of CR-driven galactic winds, suitable for\ncosmological-scale or semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. For CR\ndiffusion coefficients $\\kappa \\gtrsim r_0 c_i$ where $r_0$ is the base radius\nof the wind and $c_i$ is the isothermal gas sound speed, the asymptotic wind\nenergy flux is comparable to that supplied to CRs, and the outflow rapidly\naccelerates to supersonic speeds.

By combining classical simulations and quantum\nmechanical calculations, we provide an insight into defect association energies\nbetween substituent cations and oxygen vacancies as well as their effects on\nthe diffusion mechanisms. Our simulations indicate that oxygen ionic\ndiffusivity of subvalent cation-substituted systems follows the order Gd>Ca>Na.\nWith the same charge, a larger size mismatch with Ce cation yields a lower\noxygen ionic diffusivity, i.e., Na>K, Ca>Ni, Gd>Al.

To address this\nissue, we propose a two-stage RL agent that first learns a latent unified state\nrepresentation (LUSR) which is consistent across multiple domains in the first\nstage, and then do RL training in one source domain based on LUSR in the second\nstage. The cross-domain consistency of LUSR allows the policy acquired from the\nsource domain to generalize to other target domains without extra training.

We then show that the\nproposed CUSUM method achieves better performance than existing methods,\nincluding the Shewhart procedure based on count data, the generalized\nlikelihood ratio (GLR) in the existing literature, and the standard score\nstatistic. We demonstrate this via a simulated example and an application to\npopulation code change-detection in neuronal networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 20:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 20:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

All the investigated algorithms are based on the\nso-called heard/not-heard (HnH) method, which allows the GDs to detect the MA\nat the border of their antenna communication radius. Despite the simplicity of\nthis method, its efficacy in terms of accuracy is poor because it relies on the\nantenna radius that continuously varies under different conditions. Usually,\nthe antenna radius declared by the manufacturer does not fully characterize the\nactual antenna radiation pattern. In this paper, the radiation pattern of the\ncommercial DecaWave DWM1001 Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) antennas is observed in a\nreal test-bed at different altitudes for collecting more information and\ninsights on the antenna radius. The compared algorithms are then tested using\nboth the observed and the manufacturer radii. The experimental accuracy is\nclose to the expected theoretical one only when the antenna pattern is actually\nomnidirectional. However, typical antennas have strong pattern irregularities\nthat decrease the accuracy. For improving the performance, we propose\nrange-based (RB) variants of the compared algorithms in which, instead of using\nthe observed or the manufacturer radii, the actual measured distances between\nthe MA and the GD are used. The localization accuracy tremendously improves\nconfirming that the knowledge of the exact antenna pattern is essential for any\nRF algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 20:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 08:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

In the special case of high squeezing, the evolved state can\nbe approximated with complexity $O(MN^{M})$. Our new algorithm is\ndifferentiable, which means we can use it in conjunction with gradient-based\noptimizers for circuit optimization tasks. We benchmark our algorithm by\noptimizing circuits to produce single photons, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states\nand NOON states, showing that it is up to one order of magnitude faster than\nthe state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 21:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

Topological structures constructed from electrical\npolarization rather than spin have recently been realized in ferroelectric\nsuperlattices, promising for ultrafast electric-field control of topological\norders. However, little is known about the dynamics of such complex extended\nnanostructures which in turn underlies their functionalities.

A previously unseen\nsoft mode, hereafter referred to as a vortexon, emerges as transient arrays of\nnanoscale circular patterns of atomic displacements, which reverse their\nvorticity on picosecond time scales. Its frequency is significantly reduced at\na critical strain, indicating a condensation of structural dynamics.\nFirst-principles-based atomistic calculations and phase-field modeling reveal\nthe microscopic atomic arrangements and frequencies of the vortex modes.

In this paper, we consider a slightly different approach to\nincorporating offline data into sequential decision-making. We aim to answer\nthe question, what unsupervised objectives applied to offline datasets are able\nto learn state representations which elevate performance on downstream tasks,\nwhether those downstream tasks be online RL, imitation learning from expert\ndemonstrations, or even offline policy optimization based on the same offline\ndataset? Through a variety of experiments utilizing standard offline RL\ndatasets, we find that the use of pretraining with unsupervised learning\nobjectives can dramatically improve the performance of policy learning\nalgorithms that otherwise yield mediocre performance on their own.

To ensure temporal inconsistency between the frames of the\nstylized video, a common approach is to estimate the optic flow of the pixels\nin the original video and make the generated pixels match the estimated optical\nflow. This is achieved by minimizing an optical flow-based (OFB) loss during\nmodel training. However, optical flow estimation is itself a challenging task,\nparticularly in complex scenes. In addition, it incurs a high computational\ncost. We propose a much simpler temporal loss called the frame difference-based\n(FDB) loss to solve the temporal inconsistency problem. It is defined as the\ndistance between the difference between the stylized frames and the difference\nbetween the original frames. The differences between the two frames are\nmeasured in both the pixel space and the feature space specified by the\nconvolutional neural networks. A set of human behavior experiments involving 62\nsubjects with 25,600 votes showed that the performance of the proposed FDB loss\nmatched that of the OFB loss. The performance was measured by subjective\nevaluation of stability and stylization quality of the generated videos on two\ntypical video stylization models. The results suggest that the proposed FDB\nloss is a strong alternative to the commonly used OFB loss for video\nstylization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 02:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

The asymptotic properties of the proposed\ntests have also been studied under the composite null hypothesis. We observed\nthat these tests have similar asymptotic properties as the likelihood ratio\ntest. Finite sample performances of the proposed tests are assessed\nnumerically. A data analysis based on real data is also reported. The proposed\ntests provide alternative to similar tests based on simple spacings (i.e.,\n$m=1$), that were proposed earlier in the literature. These tests also provide\nan alternative to likelihood ratio tests in situations where likelihood\nfunction may be unbounded and hence, likelihood ratio tests do not exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 03:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 07:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

In this paper we report a record low 3x10^-4 rad^2\nresidual phase error variance for synchronization based on independent,\nspectrally pure, ultra-high mutual coherence, photonic integrated lasers. This\nperformance is achieved with stimulated Brillouin scattering lasers that are\nstabilized to independent microcavity references, realizing sources with 30 Hz\nintegral linewidth and a fractional frequency instability less than or equal to\n2x10^-13 at 50 ms. This level of low phase noise and carrier stability enables\na new type of optical-frequency-stabilized phase-locked loop (OFS-PLL) that\noperates with a less than 800 kHz loop bandwidth, eliminating traditional power\nconsuming high bandwidth electronics and digital signal processors used to\nphase lock optical carriers. Additionally, we measure the residual phase error\ndown to a received carrier power of -34 dBm, removing the need to transmit\nin-band or out-of-band synchronized carriers. These results highlight the\npromise for a path to spectrally pure, ultra-stable, integrated lasers for\nnetwork synchronization, precision time distribution protocols, quantum-clock\nnetworks, and multiple-Terabit per second coherent DSP-free fiber-optic\ninterconnects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 04:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

However, the\ncurrent literature on data poisoning attacks is mainly focused on ad hoc\ntechniques that are only applicable to specific machine learning models.\nAdditionally, the existing data poisoning attacks in the literature are limited\nto either binary classifiers or to gradient-based algorithms. To address these\nlimitations, this paper first proposes a novel model-free label-flipping attack\nbased on the multi-modality of the data, in which the adversary targets the\nclusters of classes while constrained by a label-flipping budget. The\ncomplexity of our proposed attack algorithm is linear in time over the size of\nthe dataset. Also, the proposed attack can increase the error up to two times\nfor the same attack budget. Second, a novel defense technique based on the\nSynthetic Reduced Nearest Neighbor (SRNN) model is proposed. The defense\ntechnique can detect and exclude flipped samples on the fly during the training\nprocedure. Through extensive experimental analysis, we demonstrate that (i) the\nproposed attack technique can deteriorate the accuracy of several models\ndrastically, and (ii) under the proposed attack, the proposed defense technique\nsignificantly outperforms other conventional machine learning models in\nrecovering the accuracy of the targeted model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 06:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

In the case of thin superconducting\nfilm the emergence of the spontaneous surface currents causes the increase of\nthe superconducting critical temperature and we calculate the actual value of\nthe critical temperature shift. We also show that in the case of type-I\nsuperconducting film this phase transition can be of the first order. In the\nexternal magnetic field the critical temperature depends on the relative\norientation of the external magnetic field and the exchange field in the\nferromagnet.

One such challenge is the detection of corner cases. They are\nunexpected and unknown situations that occur while driving.

Hence, their detection is highly\nsafety-critical, and detection methods can be applied to vast amounts of\ncollected data to select suitable training data.

Requiring more stringent -- yet\nwell-motivated -- beyond General Relativity (GR) parametrizations improves the\ninference drawn from available GW data, substantially decreasing the errors on\ndeviation parameters. This implies a reduction in the number of signals needed\nto detect a deviation from GR predictions and an increase of the number of\nGR-violating coefficients that can be meaningfully constrained with a given\nnumber of signals. To this end, we apply to LIGO-Virgo observations a high-spin\nversion of the Parametrized ringdown spin expansion coefficients (ParSpec)\nformalism, encompassing large classes of modified theories of gravity. We\nconstrain the lowest-order perturbative deviation of the fundamental ringdown\nfrequency to be $\\delta\\omega^{0}_{220} = {-0.05}^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, when\nassuming adimensional beyond-GR couplings, substantially improving upon\npreviously published results.

A\nsuperconductor is stable if it does not quench. Exact determination of\nsuperconductor transient, resistive states (flux flow, Ohmic) thus is mandatory\nto safely avoid quench. This request sharp comparison of local, transient\nconductor temperature and current transport density with local values of\ncritical superconductor temperature, TCrit, and critical current density,\nJCrit, and the latter is a strong function of temperature. Numerical, Finite\nElement simulations reported previously and in this paper have provided the\nrequested, transient temperature distribution; under disturbances, this\ndistribution may strongly be non-uniform.

A multi-physics model\n(fractional parentage, Pauli selection rule, time of flight-concept with a\nmediating Boson, the Yukawa model and the uncertainty principle) provides\nrelaxation time at which TCrit, as the thermodynamic, equilibrium state,\nfinally would be obtained.

Despite the vital importance,\nespecially in areas of human well-being and health, state-of-the-art\nuncertainty estimation techniques are computationally expensive when applied to\nresource-constrained devices. We propose an efficient framework for predictive\nuncertainty estimation in NNs deployed on embedded edge systems with no need\nfor fine-tuning or re-training strategies. To meet the energy and latency\nrequirements of these embedded platforms the framework is built from the ground\nup to provide predictive uncertainty based only on one forward pass and a\nnegligible amount of additional matrix multiplications with theoretically\nproven correctness. Our aim is to enable already trained deep learning models\nto generate uncertainty estimates on resource-limited devices at inference time\nfocusing on classification tasks. This framework is founded on theoretical\ndevelopments casting dropout training as approximate inference in Bayesian NNs.\nOur layerwise distribution approximation to the convolution layer cascades\nthrough the network, providing uncertainty estimates in one single run which\nensures minimal overhead, especially compared with uncertainty techniques that\nrequire multiple forwards passes and an equal linear rise in energy and latency\nrequirements making them unsuitable in practice. We demonstrate that it yields\nbetter performance and flexibility over previous work based on multilayer\nperceptrons to obtain uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation with mobile\napplications datasets shows that our approach not only obtains robust and\naccurate uncertainty estimations but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of systems performance, reducing energy consumption (up to 28x),\nkeeping the memory overhead at a minimum while still improving accuracy (up to\n16%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 11:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

Although,\nthere was a substantial criticism concerning the algebraic construction and\nfactors assessment of UCP, it remains an efficient early size estimation\nmethod. Predicting software effort from UCP is still an ever-present challenge.\nThe earlier version of UCP method suggested using productivity as a cost\ndriver, where fixed or a few pre-defined productivity ratios have been widely\nagreed. While this approach was successful when no enough historical data is\navailable, it is no longer acceptable because software projects are different\nin terms of development aspects. Therefore, it is better to understand the\nrelationship between productivity and other UCP variables. This paper examines\nthe impact of data locality approaches on productivity and effort prediction\nfrom multiple UCP variables. The environmental factors are used as partitioning\nfactors to produce local homogeneous data either based on their influential\nlevels or using clustering algorithms. Different machine learning methods,\nincluding solo and ensemble methods, are used to construct productivity and\neffort prediction models based on the local data.

An\nimportant clue into this question can be gained by studying the earliest\nevolution of the Martian atmosphere and whether it was dense and stable to\nmaintain a warm and wet climate or tenuous and susceptible to strong\natmospheric escape. We discuss relevant aspects for the evolution and stability\nof a potential early Martian atmosphere. This contains the solar EUV flux\nevolution, the formation timescale and volatile inventory of the planet\nincluding volcanic degassing, impact delivery and removal, the loss of a\ncatastrophically outgassed steam atmosphere, atmosphere-surface interactions,\nand thermal and non-thermal escape processes affecting any secondary\natmosphere. While early non-thermal escape at Mars before 4 billion years ago\n(Ga) is poorly understood, particularly in view of its ancient intrinsic\nmagnetic field, research on thermal escape processes indicate that volatile\ndelivery and volcanic degassing cannot counterbalance the strong thermal\nescape. Therefore, a catastrophically outgassed steam atmosphere of several\nbars of CO2 and H2O, or CO and H2 for reduced conditions, could have been lost\nwithin just a few million years (Myr). Thereafter, Mars likely could not build\nup a dense secondary atmosphere during its first ~400 Myr but might only have\npossessed an atmosphere sporadically during events of strong volcanic\ndegassing, potentially also including SO2. This indicates that before ~4.1 Ga\nMars indeed might have been cold and dry. A denser CO2- or CO-dominated\natmosphere, however, might have built up afterwards but must have been lost\nlater-on due to non-thermal escape processes and sequestration into the ground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 12:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

To further increase the feasible design space, flutter-tolerant\ndesigns are currently explored, which may undergo Limit Cycle Oscillations\n(LCOs) of acceptable, yet not vanishing, level. Bounded self-excited\noscillations are a priori a nonlinear phenomenon, and can thus only be\nexplained by nonlinear interactions such as dry stick-slip friction in\nmechanical joints. The currently available simulation methods for blade flutter\naccount for nonlinear interactions, at most, in only one domain, the structure\nor the fluid, and assume the behavior in the other domain as linear. In this\nwork, we develop a fully-coupled nonlinear frequency domain method which is\ncapable of resolving nonlinear flow and structural effects. We demonstrate the\ncomputational performance of this method for a state-of-the-art aeroelastic\nmodel of a shrouded turbine blade row. Besides simulating limit cycles, we\npredict, for the first time, the phenomenon of nonlinear instability, i.e., a\nsituation where the equilibrium point is locally stable, but for sufficiently\nstrong perturbation (caused e.g. by an impact), the dry frictional dissipation\ncannot bound the flutter vibrations. This implies that linearized theory does\nnot necessary lead to a conservative design of turbine blades. We show that\nthis phenomenon is due to the nonlinear contact interactions at the tip\nshrouds, which cause a change of the vibrational deflection shape and\nfrequency, which in turn leads to a loss of aeroelastic stability. Finally, we\nextend the well-known energy method to capture these effects, and conclude that\nit provides a good approximation and is useful for initializing the\nfully-coupled solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 12:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

Recent studies demonstrate that modern DRAM chips,\nincluding chips previously marketed as RowHammer-safe, are even more vulnerable\nto RowHammer than older chips. Many works show that attackers can exploit\nRowHammer bit-flips to reliably mount system-level attacks to escalate\nprivilege and leak private data. Therefore, it is critical to ensure\nRowHammer-safe operation on all DRAM-based systems. Unfortunately,\nstate-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms face two major challenges.\nFirst, they incur increasingly higher performance and/or area overheads when\napplied to more vulnerable DRAM chips. Second, they require either proprietary\ninformation about or modifications to the DRAM chip design. In this paper, we\nshow that it is possible to efficiently and scalably prevent RowHammer\nbit-flips without knowledge of or modification to DRAM internals. We introduce\nBlockHammer, a low-cost, effective, and easy-to-adopt RowHammer mitigation\nmechanism that overcomes the two key challenges by selectively throttling\nmemory accesses that could otherwise cause RowHammer bit-flips. The key idea of\nBlockHammer is to (1) track row activation rates using area-efficient Bloom\nfilters and (2) use the tracking data to ensure that no row is ever activated\nrapidly enough to induce RowHammer bit-flips. By doing so, BlockHammer (1)\nmakes it impossible for a RowHammer bit-flip to occur and (2) greatly reduces a\nRowHammer attack's impact on the performance of co-running benign applications.\nCompared to state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms, BlockHammer\nprovides competitive performance and energy when the system is not under a\nRowHammer attack and significantly better performance and energy when the\nsystem is under attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 12:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 12:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

However, their\napplication in a real-world scenario is limited since the surfaces of\nreconstructed objects contain discontinuities, which degrades the quality of\nthe final mesh. This is mainly caused by independent processing of individual\npatches, and in this work, we postulate to mitigate this limitation by\npreserving local consistency around patch vertices. To that end, we introduce a\nLocally Conditioned Atlas (LoCondA), a framework for representing a 3D object\nhierarchically in a generative model. Firstly, the model maps a point cloud of\nan object into a sphere. Secondly, by leveraging a spherical prior, we enforce\nthe mapping to be locally consistent on the sphere and on the target object.\nThis way, we can sample a mesh quad on that sphere and project it back onto the\nobject's manifold. With LoCondA, we can produce topologically diverse objects\nwhile maintaining quads to be stitched together. We show that the proposed\napproach provides structurally coherent reconstructions while producing meshes\nof quality comparable to the competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 13:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

LTR methods based on bandit algorithms often optimize\ntabular models that memorize the optimal ranking per query. These types of\nmodel have their own advantages and disadvantages. Feature-based models provide\nvery robust performance across many queries, including those previously unseen,\nhowever, the available features often limit the rankings the model can predict.\nIn contrast, tabular models can converge on any possible ranking through\nmemorization. However, memorization is extremely prone to noise, which makes\ntabular models reliable only when large numbers of user interactions are\navailable. Can we develop a robust counterfactual LTR method that pursues\nmemorization-based optimization whenever it is safe to do? We introduce the\nGeneralization and Specialization (GENSPEC) algorithm, a robust feature-based\ncounterfactual LTR method that pursues per-query memorization when it is safe\nto do so. GENSPEC optimizes a single feature-based model for generalization:\nrobust performance across all queries, and many tabular models for\nspecialization: each optimized for high performance on a single query. GENSPEC\nuses novel relative high-confidence bounds to choose which model to deploy per\nquery. By doing so, GENSPEC enjoys the high performance of successfully\nspecialized tabular models with the robustness of a generalized feature-based\nmodel.

It is found that the\npredicted solar maximum, ascent time, and cycle length are 115.1, 4.84 yr, and\n11.06 yr, respectively, for cycle 25, and 107.3, 4.80 yr, and 10.97 yr,\nrespectively, for cycle 26. The solar activities of cycles 25 and 26 are\npredicted to be at the same level as that of cycle 24, but will not decrease\nfurther. We therefore suggest that the cycles 24$-$26 are at a minimum of\nGleissberg cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 13:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 08:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

We investigate the configuration of a complex flux rope above a\n{\\delta} sunspot region in NOAA AR 11515, and its eruptive expansion during a\nconfined M5.3-class flare.\n  Methods.

We\nuse EUV and UV images provided by SDO/AIA, and hard X-ray emission recorded by\nRHESSI to investigate the eruptive details. The coronal magnetic field is\nextrapolated with a non-linear force free field (NLFFF) method, based on which\nthe flux rope is identified by calculating the twist number Tw and squashing\nfactor Q.

A bald patch (BP) forms at the collision location, above which a\ncomplex flux rope is identified. The flux rope has multiple layers, with one\ncompact end and one bifurcated end, having Tw decreasing from the core to the\nboundary. A null point is located above the flux rope. The eruptive process\nconsists of precursor flaring at a 'v'-shaped coronal structure, rise of the\nfilament, and flaring below the filament, corresponding well with the NLFFF\ntopological structures, including the null point and the flux rope with BP and\nhyperbolic flux tube (HFT).

The features of MD in the first range were\nassociated with the metastable ice-like phase of water, in which hexagonal\nclusters with tetrahedral hydrogen bonds (HBs) predominate. Based on the ratios\nof the signs and values of the activation energies of HBs fluctuations and the\nparameters of the microstructure, it was assumed that fluctuations of HBs\ndipoles play a key role in the mechanism of resonant activation by thermal\nenergy of consistent reactions of deformation, rupture and formation of\ntetrahedral HBs in water clusters. The synergism of these reactions and the\ninteraction of the charges of the vacant acceptor and donor tetrahedral\norbitals of the oxygen atom trigger at 298 K an explosive transition of the\nmetastable ice like phase of water into the argon like phase.

Its host star possesses a common\nproper-motion companion which is likely on a bound orbit. In this paper, we\nexplore scenarios for the excitation of the eccentricity of the planet in\nbinary systems such as this, considering planet-planet scattering, Lidov-Kozai\ncycles from the binary acting on a single-planet system, or Lidov-Kozai cycles\nacting on a two-planet system that also undergoes scattering. Planet-planet\nscattering, in the absence of a binary companion, has a $2.8-7.2\\%$ probability\nof pumping eccentricities to the observed values in our simulations, depending\non the relative masses of the two planets. Lidov-Kozai cycles from the binary\nacting on an initially circular orbit can excite eccentricities to the observed\nvalue, but require very specific orbital configurations for the binary and\noverall there is a low probability of catching the orbit at the high observed\nhigh eccentricity ($0.6\\%$). The best case is provided by planet-planet\nscattering in the presence of a binary companion: here, the scattering provides\nthe surviving planet with an initial eccentricity boost that is subsequently\nfurther increased by Kozai cycles from the binary. We find a success rate of\n$14.5\\%$ for currently observing $e\\ge0.84$ in this set-up. The single-planet\nplus binary and two-planet plus binary cases are potentially distinguishable if\nthe mutual inclination of the binary and the planet can be measured, as the\nlatter permits a broader range of mutual inclinations.

Recent breakthroughs have\nintroduced methods capable of exponentially suppressing errors by preparing\nmultiple noisy copies of a state and virtually distilling a more purified\nversion. Here we present an alternative method, the Resource-Efficient Quantum\nError Suppression Technique (REQUEST), that adapts this breakthrough to much\nfewer qubits by making use of active qubit resets, a feature now available on\ncommercial platforms. Our approach exploits a space/time trade-off to achieve a\nsimilar error reduction using only $2N+1$ qubits as opposed to $MN+1$ qubits,\nfor $M$ copies of an $N$ qubit state. Additionally, we propose a method using\nnear-Clifford circuits to find the optimal number of these copies in the\npresence of realistic noise, which limits this error suppression. We perform a\nnumerical comparison between the original method and our qubit-efficient\nversion with a realistic trapped-ion noise model.

The process is of\nspecies sampling type and generates discrete distributions, which yield of the\norder $n^\\sigma$ different values (\"species\") in a random sample of size $n$,\nif the type $\\sigma$ is positive. Thus this type parameter can be set to target\ntrue distributions of various levels of discreteness, making the Pitman-Yor\nprocess an interesting prior in this case. It was previously shown that the\nresulting posterior distribution is consistent if and only if the true\ndistribution of the data is discrete. In this paper we derive the\ndistributional limit of the posterior distribution, in the form of a\n(corrected) Bernstein-von Mises theorem, which previously was known only in the\ncontinuous, inconsistent case. It turns out that the Pitman-Yor posterior\ndistribution has good behaviour if the true distribution of the data is\ndiscrete with atoms that decrease not too slowly. Credible sets derived from\nthe posterior distribution provide valid frequentist confidence sets in this\ncase. For a general discrete distribution, the posterior distribution, although\nconsistent, may contain a bias which does not converge to zero at the\n$\\sqrt{n}$ rate and invalidates posterior inference. We propose a bias\ncorrection that solves this problem. We also consider the effect of estimating\nthe type parameter from the data, both by empirical Bayes and full Bayes\nmethods.

Our results also confirm previous work that\nSN Ia host-galaxy stellar mass is strongly correlated with ejecta velocity:\nhigh-velocity SN Ia are found nearly exclusively in high-stellar-mass hosts.\nHowever, host-galaxy properties alone do not explain velocity-dependent\ndifferences in supernova colors and luminosities across samples. Measuring and\nunderstanding the connection between intrinsic explosion properties and\nsupernova environments, across cosmic time, will be important for precision\ncosmology with SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 19:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

In particular, the simulation convergence time\nscales poorly as simulation domains become tighter or more heterogeneous.\nSemi-analytical models that rely on averaged structural properties (i.e.\nporosity and tortuosity) have been proposed, but these features only summarize\nthe domain, resulting in limited applicability. On the other hand, data-driven\nmachine learning approaches have shown great promise for building more general\nmodels by virtue of accounting for the spatial arrangement of the domains solid\nboundaries. However, prior approaches building on the Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (ConvNet) literature concerning 2D image recognition problems do not\nscale well to the large 3D domains required to obtain a Representative\nElementary Volume (REV). As such, most prior work focused on homogeneous\nsamples, where a small REV entails that that the global nature of fluid flow\ncould be mostly neglected, and accordingly, the memory bottleneck of addressing\n3D domains with ConvNets was side-stepped. Therefore, important geometries such\nas fractures and vuggy domains could not be well-modeled. In this work, we\naddress this limitation with a general multiscale deep learning model that is\nable to learn from porous media simulation data. By using a coupled set of\nneural networks that view the domain on different scales, we enable the\nevaluation of large images in approximately one second on a single Graphics\nProcessing Unit.

A critical step in the further\ndeveloping optical frequency transfer is its capability to transfer a high\nspectral purity feature from ultrastable lasers or optical clocks to any remote\nlocations and, at the same time, its adaptability to incorporate the optical\nfrequency transfer technique into any existing communication networks with\ndifferent topologies. Here we for the first time report a technique that\ndelivers optical-frequency signals to multiple independent remote hubs along a\nring optical-fiber network with passive phase stabilization. The technique\nautomatically corrects optical-fiber length fluctuations of arbitrary hubs\nalong the loop by mixing and shifting optical signals. Without the help of an\nactive phase tracker and a compensator, it could significantly mitigate some\ntechnical problems such as the limited compensation speed and phase recovery\ntime, the phase jitter contamination caused by the servo bump in conventional\nphase noise cancellation. Moreover, by transmitting optical signals along both\ndirections using the same optical source, it can improve the signal-to-noise\nratio at each hub. This technique maintains the same delay-limited phase noise\ncorrection capability as in conventional techniques and, furthermore, improves\nthe phase jitter by a factor of 3, opening a way to a broad distribution of an\nultrastable frequency reference with high spectral purity and enabling a wide\nrange of applications beyond metrology over a ring fiber network with the\nnaturally impressive reliability and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 04:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}
