Several types of the cardiac disease are diagnosed by\nusing 12-lead ECGs Recently, various wearable devices have enabled immediate\naccess to the ECG without the use of wieldy equipment. However, they only\nprovide ECGs with a couple of leads. This results in an inaccurate diagnosis of\ncardiac disease due to lacking of required leads. We propose a deep generative\nmodel for ECG synthesis from two asynchronous leads to ten leads. It first\nrepresents a heart condition referring to two leads, and then generates ten\nleads based on the represented heart condition. Both the rhythm and amplitude\nof leads generated resemble those of the original ones, while the technique\nremoves noise and the baseline wander appearing in the original leads. As a\ndata augmentation method, our model improves the classification performance of\nmodels compared with models using ECGs with only one or two leads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 09:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 00:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 13:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

These models must\nbe created from measured data such as RGB-D images or 3D point clouds, whose\ncapture and consolidation involves lengthy data workflows. This strongly limits\nthe rate at which 3D models can be produced, preventing the adoption of many\ndigital services for indoor space management.

Thanks to recent advances in data-driven inertial odometry, such\nminimalistic input data can be acquired from the IMU readings of consumer-level\nsmartphones, which allows for an effortless and scalable mapping of real-world\nindoor spaces. Our work is based on learning the latent relation between an\nindoor walk trajectory and the information represented in a floor plan:\ninterior space footprint, portals, and furniture. We distinguish between\nrecovering area-related (interior footprint, furniture) and wall-related\n(doors) information and use two different neural architectures for the two\ntasks: an image-based Encoder-Decoder and a Graph Convolutional Network,\nrespectively. We train our networks using scanned 3D indoor models and apply\nthem in a cascaded fashion on an indoor walk trajectory at inference time. We\nperform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation using both simulated and\nmeasured, real-world trajectories, and compare against a baseline method for\nimage-to-image translation.

Thus it\nenables the network to learn more representative multi-phase features by\nrefining the PV features according to the channel dependencies and\nrecalibrating the ART features based on the learned interdependencies between\nphases. We propose a PA-based multi-scale fusion (MSF) architecture to embed\nthe PA blocks in the network at multiple levels along the encoding path to fuse\nmulti-scale features from multi-phase images. Moreover, a 3D boundary-enhanced\nloss (BE-loss) is proposed for training to make the network more sensitive to\nboundaries. To evaluate the performance of our proposed PA-ResSeg, we conducted\nexperiments on a multi-phase CT dataset of focal liver lesions (MPCT-FLLs).\nExperimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving\na dice per case (DPC) of 0.77.87, a dice global (DG) of 0.8682, a volumetric\noverlap error (VOE) of 0.3328 and a relative volume difference (RVD) of 0.0443\non the MPCT-FLLs. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness and robustness of\nPA-ResSeg, we conducted extra experiments on another multi-phase liver tumor\ndataset and obtained a DPC of 0.8290, a DG of 0.9132, a VOE of 0.2637 and a RVD\nof 0.0163.

We consider craters younger than 1.1 billion years in age,\ni.e. of Copernican period. The aim of this work is to improve our understanding\nof such relationships based on our new estimates of the craters's depth and\ndiameter. Previous studies considered similar relationships for much older\ncraters (up to 3.2 billion years). We calculated the depths of craters with\ndiameters from 10 to 100 km based on the altitude profiles derived from data\nobtained by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) onboard the Lunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The ratio h/D of the depth h of a crater to its\ndiameter D can diverge by up to a factor of two for craters with almost the\nsame diameters. The linear and power approximations (regressions) of the\ndependence of h/D on D were made for simple and complex Copernican craters\nselected from the data from Mazrouei et al. (2019) and Losiak et al. (2015).\nFor the separation of highland craters into two groups based only on their\ndependences of h/D on D, at D<18 km these are mostly simple craters, although\nsome complex craters can have diameters D>16 km. Depths of mare craters with\nD<14 km are greater than 0.15D. Following Pike's (1981) classification, we\ngroup mare craters of D<15 km as simple craters. Mare craters with 15<D<18 km\nfit both approximation curves for simple and complex craters. Depths of mare\ncraters with D>18 km are in a better agreement with the approximation curve of\nh/D vs. D for complex craters than for simple craters. At the same diameter,\nmare craters are deeper than highland craters at a diameter smaller than 30-40\nkm. For greater diameters, highland craters are deeper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 18:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Our analysis of 15 GHz Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) and astrometric 8 GHz VLBA data, in a time span prior and\nafter the IceCube event, reveals evidence for a radio ring structure which\ndevelops with time. Several arc-structures evolve perpendicular to the jet\nridge line. We find evidence for precession of a curved jet based on kinematic\nmodelling and a periodicity analysis. An outflowing broad line region (BLR)\nbased on the C IV line emission (Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS) is found. We\nattribute the atypical ring to an interaction of the precessing jet with the\noutflowing material.

One means to deal with unrealizability, in the context of\nGR(1), an expressive assume-guarantee fragment of LTL that enables efficient\nsynthesis, is the computation of an unrealizable core, which can be viewed as a\nfault-localization approach. Existing solutions, however, are computationally\ncostly, are limited to computing a single core, and do not correctly support\nspecifications with constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements.\n  In this work we address these limitations. First, we present QuickCore, a\nnovel algorithm that accelerates unrealizable core computations by relying on\nthe monotonicity of unrealizability, on an incremental computation, and on\nadditional properties of GR(1) specifications. Second, we present Punch, a\nnovel algorithm to efficiently compute all unrealizable cores of a\nspecification. Finally, we present means to correctly handle specifications\nthat include higher-level constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements.\n  We implemented our ideas on top of Spectra, an open-source language and\nsynthesis environment. Our evaluation over benchmarks from the literature shows\nthat QuickCore is in most cases faster than previous algorithms, and that its\nrelative advantage grows with scale. Moreover, we found that most\nspecifications include more than one core, and that Punch finds all the cores\nsignificantly faster than a competing naive algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 19:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The present study provides more\ninsight into the effects of grain-boundary sliding (GBS) on the deformation\nbehaviour of realistic polycrystalline aggregates during creep, through the\ndevelopment of a computational framework which combines: i) the use of\ninterface elements for sliding at grain boundaries, and ii) special triple\npoint (in 2D) or triple line (in 3D) elements to prevent artificial dilation at\nthese locations in the microstructure with iii) a physically-based crystal\nplasticity constitutive model for time-dependent inelastic deformation of the\nindividual grains. Experimental data at various scales is used to calibrate the\nframework and compare with model predictions. We pay particular consideration\nto effects of grain boundary sliding during creep of Type 316 stainless steel,\nwhich is used extensively in structural components of the UK fleet of Advanced\nGas Cooled Nuclear Reactors (AGRs). It is found that the anisotropic\ndeformation of the grains and the mismatch in crystallographic orientation\nbetween neighbouring grains play a significant role in determining the extent\nof sliding on a given boundary. Their effect on the development of stress\nwithin the grains, particularly at triple grain junctions, and the increase in\naxial stress along transverse boundaries are quantified. The article\ndemonstrates that the magnitude of the stress along the facets is\nhighly-dependent on the crystallographic orientations of the neighbouring\ngrains and the relative amount of sliding. Boundaries, transverse to the\napplied load tend to carry higher normal stresses of the order of 100-180 MPa,\nin cases where the neighbouring grains consist of plastically-harder\ncrystallographic orientations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 20:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

In this paper, we investigate the contribution of ultrasound\ntongue imaging for the automatic detection of speech articulation errors. Our\nsystems are trained on typically developing child speech and augmented with a\ndatabase of adult speech using audio and ultrasound. Evaluation on typically\ndeveloping speech indicates that pre-training on adult speech and jointly using\nultrasound and audio gives the best results with an accuracy of 86.9%. To\nevaluate on disordered speech, we collect pronunciation scores from experienced\nspeech and language therapists, focusing on cases of velar fronting and gliding\nof /r/.

These runaway electrons can cause significant damage to the\nplasma-facing-components due to their localized energy deposition. To mitigate\nthese effects, impurity injections of high-Z atoms have been proposed [1-3]. In\nthis paper, we use a self-consistent 0D tokamak disruption model as implemented\nin PREDICT code [6] which has been upgraded to take into account the effect of\nimpurity injections on RE dynamics as suggested in [4-5]. Dominant RE\ngeneration mechanisms such as the secondary avalanche mechanism as well as\nprimary RE-generation mechanisms namely Dreicer, hot-tail, tritium decay and\nCompton scattering (from {\\gamma}-rays emitted from activated walls) have been\ntaken into account. In these simulations, the effect of impurities is taken\ninto account considering collisions of REs with free and bound electrons as\nwell as scattering from full and partially-shielded nuclear charge. These\ncorrections were also implemented in the relativistic test particle model to\nsimulate RE-dynamics in momentum space. We show that the presence of impurities\nhas a non-uniform effect on the Runaway Electron Distribution function. We also\nshow that the combined effect of pitch-angle scattering induced by the\ncollisions with impurity ions and synchrotron emission loss results in the\nfaster dissipation of RE-energy distribution function [7]. The variation of\ndifferent RE generation mechanisms during different phases of the disruption,\nmainly before and after impurity injections is reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 21:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

In order to address the extremely high\nattenuation at THz, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna\nsystems have been proposed for THz communications to compensate propagation\nlosses. However, the cost and power associated with fully digital beamformers\nof these huge antenna arrays are prohibitive. In this paper, we develop\nwideband hybrid beamformers based on both model-based and model-free techniques\nfor a new group-of-subarrays (GoSA) ultra-massive MIMO structure in low-THz\nband. Further, driven by the recent developments to save the spectrum, we\npropose beamformers for a joint ultra-massive MIMO radar-communications system,\nwherein the base station serves multi-antenna user equipment (RX), and tracks\nradar targets by generating multiple beams toward both RX and the targets. We\nformulate the GoSA beamformer design as an optimization problem to provide a\ntrade-off between the unconstrained communications beamformers and the desired\nradar beamformers. To mitigate the beam split effect at THz band arising from\nfrequency-independent analog beamformers, we propose a phase correction\ntechnique to align the beams of multiple subcarriers toward a single physical\ndirection. To further decrease the ultra-massive MIMO computational complexity\nand enhance robustness, we also implement deep learning solutions to the\nproposed model-based hybrid beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that\nboth techniques outperform the conventional approaches in terms of spectral\nefficiency and radar beampatterns, as well as exhibiting less hardware cost and\ncomputation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 21:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

This structure is linked to the notion of independent\nmechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to\nretain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For\nexample, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based\narchitectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to\nprocess dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer\narchitecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic\nhidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the\nentire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of\ninformation together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture\nindependent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with\nIndependent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden\nrepresentation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange\ninformation through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism\nwhich encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be\nmore independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image\nTransformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically\nmeaningful specialization as well as improved performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 21:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

First, it is quite\nbandwidth inefficient as it involves a lot of message exchanges between the\naggregating server and the participating entities. This bandwidth and\ncorresponding processing costs could be prohibitive if the participating\nentities are, for example, mobile devices. Furthermore, although federated\nlearning improves privacy by not sharing data, recent attacks have shown that\nit still leaks information about the training data. This paper presents a novel\nprivacy-preserving federated learning scheme. The proposed scheme provides\ntheoretical privacy guarantees, as it is based on Differential Privacy.\nFurthermore, it optimizes the model accuracy by constraining the model learning\nphase on few selected weights. Finally, as shown experimentally, it reduces the\nupstream and downstream bandwidth by up to 99.9% compared to standard federated\nlearning, making it practical for mobile systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 22:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

These bars extend beyond the corotation\nradius and challenge our understanding of the orbital structure of barred\ngalaxies. Most of them are found in spiral galaxies, rather than in lenticular\nones. We analysed the properties of the ultrafast bars detected in the CALIFA\nSurvey to investigate whether they are an artefact resulting from an\noverestimation of the bar radius and/or an underestimation of the corotation\nradius or a new class of bars, whose orbital structure has not yet been\nunderstood. We revised the available measurements of the bar radius based on\nellipse fitting and Fourier analysis and of the bar pattern speed from the\nTremaine-Weinberg method. In addition, we measured the bar radius from the\nanalysis of the maps tracing the transverse-to-radial force ratio, which we\nobtained from the deprojected i-band images of the galaxies retrieved from the\nSDSS Survey. We found that nearly all the sample galaxies are spirals with an\ninner ring or pseudo-ring circling the bar and/or strong spiral arms, which\nhamper the measurement of the bar radius from the ellipse fitting and Fourier\nanalysis. According to these methods, the bar ends overlap the ring or the\nspiral arms making the adopted bar radius unreliable. On the contrary, the bar\nradius from the ratio maps are shorter than the corotation radius. This is in\nagreement with the theoretical predictions and findings of numerical\nsimulations about the extension and stability of the stellar orbits supporting\nthe bars. We conclude that ultrafast bars are no longer observed when the\ncorrect measurement of the bar radius is adopted. Deriving the bar radius in\ngalaxies with rings and strong spiral arms is not straightforward and a solid\nmeasurement method based on both photometric and kinematic data is still\nmissing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 22:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Two natural and competing notions of\nfairness might be to a) charge each individual the same price or b) charge each\nindividual according to the cost that they bring to the pool. In the insurance\nliterature, these general approaches are referred to as \"solidarity\" and\n\"actuarial fairness\" and are commonly viewed as opposites. However, in\ninsurance (and many other natural settings), the cost-sharing game also\nexhibits \"externalities of size\": all else being equal, larger groups have\nlower average cost. In the insurance case, we analyze a model with\nexternalities of size due to a reduction in the variability of losses. We\nexplore how this complicates traditional understandings of fairness, drawing on\nliterature in cooperative game theory.\n  First, we explore solidarity: we show that it is possible for both groups\n(high and low risk) to strictly benefit by joining an insurance pool where\ncosts are evenly split, as opposed to being in separate risk pools. We build on\nthis by producing a pricing scheme that maximally subsidizes the high risk\ngroup, while maintaining an incentive for lower risk people to stay in the\ninsurance pool. Next, we demonstrate that with this new model, the price\ncharged to each individual has to depend on the risk of other participants,\nmaking naive actuarial fairness inefficient. Furthermore, we prove that stable\npricing schemes must be ones where players have the anti-social incentive of\ndesiring riskier partners, contradicting motivations for using actuarial\nfairness. Finally, we describe how these results relate to debates about\nfairness in machine learning and potential avenues for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 22:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 17:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

Online\nadaptation, where the neural network trains while deployed, with\nself-supervised learning provides a convenient solution as the network can\nlearn from the scene where it is deployed without external supervision.\nHowever, online adaptation causes a neural network to forget the past. Thus,\npast training is wasted and the network is not able to provide good results if\nit observes past scenes. This work deals with practical online-adaptation where\nthe input is online and temporally-correlated, and training is completely\nself-supervised. Regularization and replay-based methods without task\nboundaries are proposed to avoid catastrophic forgetting while adapting to\nonline data.

Using daily, weekly, and monthly closing\nprices and log-returns data going from September 2014 to January 2021, we find\nthat Bitcoin is a prime example of an asset for which the two conceptions of\nvolatility diverge. We show that, historically, Bitcoin allies both high\nvolatility (high Standard Deviation) and high predictability (low Approximate\nEntropy), relative to Gold and S&P 500.\n  Moreover, using tools from Extreme Value Theory, we analyze the convergence\nof moments, and the mean excess functions of both the closing prices and the\nlog-returns of the three assets. We find that the closing price of Bitcoin is\nconsistent with a generalized Pareto distribution, when the closing prices of\nthe two other assets (Gold and S&P 500) present thin-tailed distributions.\nHowever, returns for all three assets are heavy tailed and second moments\n(variance, standard deviation) non-convergent. In the case of Bitcoin, lower\nsampling frequencies (monthly vs weekly, weekly vs daily) drastically reduce\nthe Kurtosis of log-returns and increase the convergence of empirical moments\nto their true value. The opposite effect is observed for Gold and S&P 500.\nThese properties suggest that Bitcoin's volatility is essentially an intra-day\nand intra-week phenomenon that is strongly attenuated on a weekly time-scale,\nand make it an attractive store of value to investors and speculators, but its\nhigh standard deviation excludes its use a currency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 04:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The contribution to the renormalization constant\nof the non-local operator $\\bar{q}(z)_\\beta [z,0]b(0)_\\alpha$ is considered up\nto one-loop order in QCD.

Of particular interest is the 30 degree twisted\nbilayer honeycomb lattice system, which possesses an incommensurate moire\npattern and uncommon electronic behaviors may appear due to the absence of\nphase coherence. Such system is extremely sensitive to further twist and many\nintriguing phenomena will occur. In this work, based on first-principles\ncalculations we show that, for further twist near 30 degree, there could induce\ndramatically different dielectric behaviors of electron between left and right\ntwisted cases. Specifically, it is found that the left and right twists show\nsuppressed and amplified dielectric response under vertical electric field,\nrespectively. Further analysis demonstrate that such exotic dielectric property\ncan be attributed to the stacking dependent charge redistribution due to twist,\nwhich forms twist-dependent pseudospin textures. We will show that such\npseudospin textures are robust under small electric field. As a result, for the\nright twisted case, there is almost no electric dipole formation exceeding the\nmonolayer thickness when the electric field is applied. Whereas for the left\ncase, the system could even demonstrate negative susceptibility, i.e. the\ninduced polarization is opposite to the applied field, which is very rare in\nthe nature. Such findings not only enrich our understanding on moire systems\nbut also open an appealing route toward functional 2D materials design for\nelectronic, optical and even energy storage devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 08:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

However, how to efficiently decide the\ncaching contents for edge servers is still an open problem, which refers to the\ncache capacity of edge servers, the popularity of each content, and the\nwireless channel quality during transmission. In this paper, we discuss the\ninfluence of unknown user density and popularity of content on the cache\nplacement solution at the edge server. Specifically, towards the implementation\nof the cache placement solution in the practical network, there are two\nproblems needing to be solved. First, the estimation of unknown users'\npreference needs a huge amount of records of users' previous requests. Second,\nthe overlapping serving regions among edge servers cause the wrong estimation\nof users' preference, which hinders the individual decision of caching\nplacement. To address the first issue, we propose a learning-based solution to\nadaptively optimize the cache placement policy. We develop the extended\nmulti-armed bandit (Extended MAB), which combines the generalized global bandit\n(GGB) and Standard Multi-armed bandit (MAB). For the second problem, a\nmulti-agent Extended MAB-based solution is presented to avoid the\nmis-estimation of parameters and achieve the decentralized cache placement\npolicy. The proposed solution determines the primary time slot and secondary\ntime slot for each edge server. The proposed strategies are proven to achieve\nthe bounded regret according to the mathematical analysis. Extensive\nsimulations verify the optimality of the proposed strategies when comparing\nwith baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 08:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The objective of this work is to maximize the\nachievable hybrid rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power, controlling\nthe receive scalar, and designing the phase shifts. Since the concurrent\ntransmissions of all computation and communication signals are aided by the\ndiscrete phase shifts at the RIS, the considered problem (P0) is a challenging\nmixed integer programming problem. To tackle this intractable issue, we\ndecompose the original problem (P0) into a non-convex problem (P1) and a\ncombinatorial problem (P2), which are characterized by the continuous and\ndiscrete variables, respectively. For the transceiver design problem (P1), the\npower allocation subproblem is first solved by invoking the\ndifference-of-convex programming, and then the receive control subproblem is\naddressed by using the successive convex approximation, where the closed-form\nexpressions of simplified cases are derived to obtain deep insights. For the\nreflection design problem (P2), the relaxation-then-quantization method is\nadopted to find a suboptimal solution for striking a trade-off between\ncomplexity and performance.

Building on previous results established in the bipartite\ncase, we present a scheme to implement genuine nonlocal measurements of N-qubit\nsystems with variable strength, using GHZ-like entangled qubit meters. This\nmethod can be applied to the joint measurement of commuting product\nobservables, enabling us to distinguish between orthogonal nonlocal states,\nsuch as Bell states, with minimal disturbance and arbitrary resolution. An\nexplicit relation between the overall measurement strength and the meter\nentanglement as quantified by the $n$-tangle is derived, opening the door to a\nnew interpretation of the $n$-tangle as a resource for nonlocal measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 10:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

For example, in the target-object\nnavigation setting, the policies learnt by traditional methods often fail to\ncomplete the task, even when the target is clearly within reach from a human\nperspective. In order to address this issue, we propose to learn to imagine a\nlatent representation of the successful (sub-)goal state. To do so, we have\ndeveloped a module which we call Foresight Imagination (ForeSIT). ForeSIT is\ntrained to imagine the recurrent latent representation of a future state that\nleads to success, e.g. either a sub-goal state that is important to reach\nbefore the target, or the goal state itself. By conditioning the policy on the\ngenerated imagination during training, our agent learns how to use this\nimagination to achieve its goal robustly. Our agent is able to imagine what the\n(sub-)goal state may look like (in the latent space) and can learn to navigate\ntowards that state. We develop an efficient learning algorithm to train ForeSIT\nin an on-policy manner and integrate it into our RL objective. The integration\nis not trivial due to the constantly evolving state representation shared\nbetween both the imagination and the policy. We, empirically, observe that our\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the\ncommonly accepted benchmark AI2THOR environment. Our method can be readily\nintegrated or added to other model-free RL navigation frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 10:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Instead of planning each problem\nfrom scratch, it is preferable to leverage previously computed motion plans,\ni.e., experiences, to ease the planning. Different approaches have been\nproposed to exploit prior information on novel task instances. These methods,\nhowever, rely on a vast repertoire of experiences and fail when none relates\nclosely to the current problem. Thus, an open challenge is the ability to\ngeneralise prior experiences to task instances that do not necessarily resemble\nthe prior. This work tackles the above challenge with the proposition that\nexperiences are \"decomposable\" and \"malleable\", i.e., parts of an experience\nare suitable to relevantly explore the connectivity of the robot-task space\neven in non-experienced regions. Two new planners result from this insight:\nexperience-driven random trees (ERT) and its bi-directional version ERTConnect.\nThese planners adopt a tree sampling-based strategy that incrementally extracts\nand modulates parts of a single path experience to compose a valid motion plan.\nWe demonstrate our method on task instances that significantly differ from the\nprior experiences, and compare with related state-of-the-art experience-based\nplanners. While their repairing strategies fail to generalise priors of tens of\nexperiences, our planner, with a single experience, significantly outperforms\nthem in both success rate and planning time. Our planners are implemented and\nfreely available in the Open Motion Planning Library.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 10:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

To solve the MSLCP, an optimization framework based on\nLogic-Based Benders' Decomposition (LBBD) is proposed by combining two models,\nthe Maintenance Location Choice Problem (MLCP) and the Activity Planning\nProblem (APP), to assess the capacity of a MLCP solution.

As an illustrative example, the best CNN (in the considered set\nof simple architectures for enhancement of the retinal signal) reproduces the\nCSFs with an RMSE error of 11\\% of the maximum sensitivity.\n  As a second contribution, we provide experimental evidence of the fact that,\nfor some functional goals (at low abstraction level), deeper CNNs that are\nbetter in reaching the quantitative goal are actually worse in replicating\nhuman-like phenomena (such as the CSFs). This low-level result (for the\nexplored networks) is not necessarily in contradiction with other works that\nreport advantages of deeper nets in modeling higher-level vision goals.\nHowever, in line with a growing body of literature, our results suggests\nanother word of caution about CNNs in vision science since the use of\nsimplified units or unrealistic architectures in goal optimization may be a\nlimitation for the modeling and understanding of human vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 12:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 14:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:49:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 14:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 05:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

The advantage of these channels is that they cannot be\nblocked easily as they do not modify header content but instead mimic typical\nnetwork behavior such as TCP segments that arrive in a different order than\nthey were sent.\n  Contribution: In this paper, we show a protocol-independent approach to\ndetect message ordering channels. Our approach is based on a modified\ncompressibility score. We analyze the detectability of message ordering\nchannels and whether several types of message ordering channels differ in their\ndetectability.\n  Results: Our results show that the detection of message ordering channels\ndepends on their number of utilized PDUs.

The recent empirical success of\nlarge-scale models has motivated several theoretical studies to investigate a\nscenario wherein both the number of samples, $n$, and parameters, $p$, diverge\nto infinity and derive an asymptotic risk at the limit. However, these theorems\nare only valid for linear-in-feature models, such as generalized linear\nregression, kernel regression, and shallow neural networks. Hence, it is\ndifficult to investigate a wider class of nonlinear models, including deep\nneural networks with three or more layers. In this study, we consider a\nlikelihood maximization problem without the model constraints and analyze the\nupper bound of an asymptotic risk of an estimator with penalization.\nTechnically, we combine a property of the Fisher information matrix with an\nextended Marchenko-Pastur law and associate the combination with empirical\nprocess techniques. The derived bound is general, as it describes both the\ndouble descent and the regularized risk curves, depending on the penalization.\nOur results are valid without the linear-in-feature constraints on models and\nallow us to derive the general spectral distributions of a Fisher information\nmatrix from the likelihood. We demonstrate that several explicit models, such\nas parallel deep neural networks, ensemble learning, and residual networks, are\nin agreement with our theory. This result indicates that even large and deep\nmodels have a small asymptotic risk if they exhibit a specific structure, such\nas divisibility. To verify this finding, we conduct a real-data experiment with\nparallel deep neural networks. Our results expand the applicability of the\nasymptotic risk analysis, and may also contribute to the understanding and\napplication of deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 13:02:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 08:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

The principal feature\nof the studied interaction is that both the solitary wave and the large-scale\nmean flow -- a rarefaction wave or a dispersive shock wave (undular bore) --\nare described by the same dispersive hydrodynamic equation. A recent\ntheoretical and experimental study of this new type of dynamic soliton-mean\nflow interaction has revealed two main scenarios when the solitary wave either\ntunnels through the varying mean flow that connects two constant asymptotic\nstates, or remains trapped inside it. While the previous work considered convex\nsystems, in this paper it is demonstrated that the presence of a nonconvex\nhydrodynamic flux introduces significant modifications to the scenarios for\ntransmission and trapping. A reduced set of Whitham modulation equations,\ntermed the solitonic modulation system, is used to formulate a general,\napproximate mathematical framework for solitary wave-mean flow interaction with\nnonconvex flux. Solitary wave trapping is conveniently stated in terms of\ncrossing characteristics for the solitonic system. Numerical simulations of the\nmKdV equation agree with the predictions of modulation theory.

This is attributed to local resonances of embedded or branching\nsubstructures. In branched configurations, such as a pillared plate, waves\npropagating in the base medium-e.g., the plate portion-experience attenuation\nat band-gap frequencies. Considering a simplified lumped-parameter model for a\nbranched medium, we present a theoretical treatment for a periodic unit cell\ncomprising a base mass-spring chain with a multi-degree-of-freedom,\nmono-coupled branch. Bloch's theorem is applied, combined with a\nsub-structuring approach where the resonating branch is modelled separately and\ncondensed into its effective dynamic stiffness. Thus, the treatment is\ngenerally applicable to an arbitrary branch regardless of its size and\nproperties. We provide an analysis-with guiding graphical illustrations-that\nyields an identification of fundamental bounds for the band-gap edges as\ndictated by the dynamical characteristics of the branch. Analytical sensitivity\nfunctions are also derived for the dependence of these bounds on the degree of\ncoupling between the base and the branch. The sensitivity analysis reveals\nfurther novel findings including the role of the frequency derivative of the\nbranch dynamic stiffness in providing a direct relation between the band-gap\nedge locations and variation in the coupling parameters-the mass and stiffness\nratios between the base chain and the branch root. In additional analysis,\nsub-Bragg bounds of an exact model comprising a one-dimensional (1D) continuous\nbase-modelled as a rod-and a discrete branch are derived and shown to be\ntighter than those of the all-discrete model. Finally, the applicability of the\nderived bounds and sensitivity functions are shown to be valid for a\ncorresponding full 2D finite-element model of a pillared waveguide admitting\nout-of-plane shear waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 02:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

The\ncurrent statistical methods used for learning this behaviour try to infer\ngenerally valid behaviour, but can only learn from one type of study at a time.\nFurthermore, only data from carefully designed studies can be used, as the\nphenomenon of interest has to be isolated and confounding factors accounted\nfor. These restrictions limit the robustness and accuracy of insights that can\nbe gained from social/economic systems. Here we present the online platform\nTreeOfKnowledge which implements a new methodology specifically designed for\nlearning complex behaviours from complex systems: agent-based behaviour\nlearning. With agent-based behaviour learning it is possible to gain more\naccurate and robust insights as it does not have the restriction of\nconventional statistics. It learns agent behaviour from many heterogenous\ndatasets and can learn from these datasets even if the phenomenon of interest\nis not directly observed, but appears deep within complex systems. This new\nmethodology shows how the internet and advances in computational power allow\nfor more accurate and powerful mathematical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 19:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}
