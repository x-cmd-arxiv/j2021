Moreover, the\ncognitive states are established by verbal explanations of experience which is\nshaped by both the verbal and cultural contexts. There are a number of verbal\ncontexts where expression of emotions constitutes the pivotal component of the\nmessage. This is particularly true for User-Generated Content (UGC) which can\nbe in the form of a review of a product or a service, a tweet, or a social\nmedia post. Recently, it has become common practice for multilingual websites\nsuch as Twitter to provide an automatic translation of UGC to reach out to\ntheir linguistically diverse users. In such scenarios, the process of\ntranslating the user's emotion is entirely automatic with no human\nintervention, neither for post-editing nor for accuracy checking. In this\nresearch, we assess whether automatic translation tools can be a successful\nreal-life utility in transferring emotion in user-generated multilingual data\nsuch as tweets. We show that there are linguistic phenomena specific of Twitter\ndata that pose a challenge in translation of emotions in different languages.\nWe summarise these challenges in a list of linguistic features and show how\nfrequent these features are in different language pairs.

Our core hard family of functions, which are well-approximated by\none-layer neural networks, take the general form of a univariate periodic\nfunction applied to an affine projection of the data.

To\naddress the common challenge of discovery in a new space where data is limited,\nwe introduce a transfer learning approach in which we seed models trained on a\nlarge amount of data from one row of the periodic table with a small number of\ndata points from the additional row. We demonstrate the synergistic value of\nthe eRACs alongside this transfer learning strategy to consistently improve\nmodel performance. Analysis of these models highlights how the approach\nsucceeds by reordering the distances between complexes to be more consistent\nwith the periodic table, a property we expect to be broadly useful for other\nmaterials domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 22:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

We call the framework\nextended constant-roll framework. Accordingly we calculate the inflationary\nindices and the corresponding observational indices of inflation. In order to\ndemonstrate the inflationary viability, we choose three potentials that are\nproblematic in the context of slow-roll dynamics, namely chaotic, linear\npower-law and exponential inflation, and by choosing a simple power-law form\nfor the smooth function $\\alpha (\\phi)$, we show that in the extended\nconstant-roll framework, the models are compatible with the latest 2018 Planck\nconstraints on inflation.

The energy loss is evaluated from an expectation value\nof the time derivative of the time-dependent projectile potential and avoids\nthe problem of identifying the excited and ionized many-electron contributions\nin the many-electron wavefunction.

However, these\napproaches require many labeled examples, in the form of matching and\nnon-matching pairs, which are expensive and time-consuming to label. In this\npaper, we introduce Panda, a weakly supervised system specifically designed for\nEM. Panda uses the same labeling function abstraction as Snorkel, where\nlabeling functions (LF) are user-provided programs that can generate large\namounts of (somewhat noisy) labels quickly and cheaply, which can then be\ncombined via a labeling model to generate accurate final predictions. To\nsupport users developing LFs for EM, Panda provides an integrated development\nenvironment (IDE) that lives in a modern browser architecture. Panda's IDE\nfacilitates the development, debugging, and life-cycle management of LFs in the\ncontext of EM tasks, similar to how IDEs such as Visual Studio or Eclipse excel\nin general-purpose programming. Panda's IDE includes many novel features\npurpose-built for EM, such as smart data sampling, a builtin library of EM\nutility functions, automatically generated LFs, visual debugging of LFs, and\nfinally, an EM-specific labeling model.

This is a well studied concept because it provides\na fertile ground for interactions between commutative algebra, graph theory and\nalgebraic topology. One of the line of research pursued by many authors is to\ndetermine the graph classes for which the associated independence complex is\nCohen-Macaulay. For example, it is known that when $G$ is a chordal graph the\ncomplex $\\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ is in fact vertex decomposable, the strongest\ncondition in the Cohen-Macaulay ladder.\n  In this article we consider a generalization of independence complex. Given\n$r\\geq 1$, a subset of the vertex set is called $r$-independent if the\nconnected components of the induced subgraph have cardinality at most $r$. The\ncollection of all $r$-independent subsets of $G$ form a simplicial complex\ncalled the $r$-independence complex and is denoted by $\\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$. It\nis known that when $G$ is a chordal graph the complex $\\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$ has\nthe homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. Hence it is natural to ask which of\nthese complexes are shellable or even vertex decomposable. We prove, using\nWoodroofe's chordal hypergraph notion, that these complexes are always\nshellable when the underlying chordal graph is a tree. Further, using the\nnotion of vertex splittable ideals we show that for caterpillar graphs the\nassociated $r$-independence complex is vertex decomposable for all values of\n$r$. We also construct chordal graphs on $2r+2$ vertices such that their\n$r$-independence complexes are not sequentially Cohen-Macaulay for any $r \\ge\n2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 05:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 17:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 13:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

The shortened Bernoulli\nequation allows us to introduce the concept of the source deactivation factor\nand phenomenologically describe the nonstationarity of the geological\nenvironment in the earthquake source, \"cooling down\" after the main shock. The\nVerhulst logistic equation makes it possible to take into account the\ntransition of the aftershock flow to the background seismicity mode. The\nKolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov nonlinear diffusion equation is convenient for\nmodeling the spatio-temporal evolution of aftershocks. This paper focuses on\nthe phase portrait of a dynamical system that simulates the evolution of\naftershocks. The phase portrait allows us to understand why the Omori\nhyperbolic law is most clearly manifested after strong earthquakes. It is noted\nthat the Omori epoch, during which the deactivation coefficient is constant,\ndoes not immediately end with a transition to the background mode. In the\nexperience after the end of the Omori epoch, the deactivation coefficient\nchanges over time in a rather complex way, and can even becomes negative.

Using\nquantum dot lasers directly grown on silicon, we achieved FWM conversion\nefficiency sufficient to demonstrate self-mode-locking in a single-section\nlaser diode, with sub-ps mode-locked pulse duration and kHz frequency-comb\nlinewidth. A comparison with first-principles based multimode laser theory\nindicates measured FWM conversion efficiencies that are close to the\ntheoretical limit. An advantage over earlier studies and crucial to confidence\nin the results are the quality and reproducibility of state-of-the-art quantum\ndot lasers. They make possible the detailed study of conversion efficiency over\na broad parameter space, and the identification of the importance of p-doping.\nSystematic improvement based on our understanding of underlying physics will\nlead to transform limited performance and effective compensation of intrinsic\nand extrinsic effects, such as linewidth enhancement and background dispersion.\nThe integration of FWM with lasing impacts numerous optoelectronic components\nused in telecom and datacom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 06:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Key properties a\nreal-valued function on $X$ may possess include $T_1$-measurability and\nintegrability. These properties are generalisations of corresponding properties\nof real-valued functions on a (countably additive) measure space.

These characterisations are convenient for analytic purposes; for\nexample, they facilitate simple proofs that $T_1$-measurability is equivalent\nto conventional measurability and integrability is equivalent to Lebesgue\nintegrability, if $(X,\\mathcal{A},\\mu)$ is a complete measure space.\n  Several additional contributions to the theory of bounded charges are also\npresented. New characterisations of equality almost everywhere of two\nreal-valued functions on a bounded charge space are provided. Necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the function space $L_1(X,\\mathcal{A},\\mu)$ to be a\nBanach space are determined.

Such phases are abstractly characterized by their non-vanishing chiral\ncentral charge $c$, a topological invariant which appears as the coefficient of\na gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) action in bulk, and of corresponding\ngravitational anomalies at boundaries. The chiral central charge is of\nparticular importance in chiral superfluids and superconductors (CSF/Cs), where\n$U(1)$ particle-number symmetry is broken, and $c$ is, in some cases, the only\ntopological invariant characterizing the system. However, as opposed to\ninvariants which can be probed by gauge fields in place of gravity, the\nconcrete physical implications of $c$ in the context of condensed matter\nphysics is quite subtle, and has been the subject of ongoing research and\ncontroversy. The first two parts of this thesis are devoted to the physical\ninterpretation of the gCS action and gravitational anomalies in the context of\nCSF/Cs, where they are of particular importance, but have nevertheless remained\npoorly understood. We then turn to a seemingly unrelated aspect of chiral\ntopological phases - their computational complexity. The infamous $sign\\\nproblem$ leads to an exponential complexity in Monte Carlo simulations of\ngeneric many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, many phases of matter are\nknown to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing an efficient\nclassical simulation. The possibility of $intrinsic$ sign problems, where a\nphase of matter admits no sign-problem-free representative, was recently raised\nbut remains largely unexplored.

However, until now, the\nadoption of robotics in formal education has remained relatively scarce. Among\nother causes, this is due to the difficulty of determining the alignment of\neducational robotic learning activities with the learning outcomes envisioned\nby the curriculum, as well as their integration with traditional, non-robotics\nlearning activities that are well established in teachers' practices. This work\ninvestigates the integration of ER into formal mathematics education, through a\nquasi-experimental study employing the Thymio robot and Scratch programming to\nteach geometry to two classes of 15-year-old students, for a total of 26\nparticipants. Three research questions were addressed: (1) Should an ER-based\ntheoretical lecture precede, succeed or replace a traditional theoretical\nlecture? (2) What is the students' perception of and engagement in the ER-based\nlecture and exercises? (3) Do the findings differ according to students' prior\nappreciation of mathematics? The results suggest that ER activities are as\nvalid as traditional ones in helping students grasp the relevant theoretical\nconcepts. Robotics activities seem particularly beneficial during exercise\nsessions: students freely chose to do exercises that included the robot, rated\nthem as significantly more interesting and useful than their traditional\ncounterparts, and expressed their interest in introducing ER in other\nmathematics lectures. Finally, results were generally consistent between the\nstudents that like and did not like mathematics, suggesting the use of robotics\nas a means to broaden the number of students engaged in the discipline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 08:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

In the first stage, a linear time-varying (LTV) realization that is\ntopologically equivalent to the true SLS is derived from the Markov parameters\nassuming that the submodels have a common MacMillan degree and a mild condition\non their dwell times holds. In the second stage, zero sets of LTV Hankel\nmatrices where the realized system has a linear time-invariant (LTI) pulse\nresponse matching that of the original SLS are exploited to extract the\nsubmodels, up to arbitrary similarity transformations, by a clustering\nalgorithm using a statistics that is invariant to similarity transformations.\nRecovery is shown to be complete if the dwell times are sufficiently long and\nsome mild identifiability conditions are met. In the third stage, the switching\nsequence is estimated by three schemes. The first scheme is based on\nforward/backward corrections and works on the short segments. The second scheme\nmatches Markov parameter estimates to the true parameters for LTV systems and\nworks on the medium-to-long segments. The third scheme also matches Markov\nparameters, but for LTI systems only and works on the very short segments.

While it was recently reported that\nthree-dimensional growth is promoted by topological defects of winding number\n$+1/2$ in populations of motile bacteria, how cellular alignment plays a role\nin non-motile cases is largely unknown. Here, we investigate the relevance of\ntopological defects in colony formation processes of non-motile E. coli\npopulations, and found that both $\\pm 1/2$ topological defects contribute to\nthe three-dimensional growth. Analyzing the cell flow in the bottom layer of\nthe colony, we observe that $+1/2$ defects attract cells and $-1/2$ defects\nrepel cells, in agreement with previous studies on motile cells, in the initial\nstage of the colony growth. However, later, cells gradually flow toward $-1/2$\ndefects as well, exhibiting a sharp contrast to the existing knowledge. By\ninvestigating three-dimensional cell orientations by confocal microscopy, we\nfind strong vertical tilting of cells near the defects. Crucially, this leads\nto the emergence of a polar order in the otherwise nematic two-dimensional cell\norientation. We extend the theory of active nematics by incorporating this\npolar order and the vertical tilting, which successfully explains the influx\ntoward $-1/2$ defects in terms of a polarity-induced force.

In VQAs, the classical optimizers such as gradient-based\noptimizers are utilized to adjust the parameters of the quantum circuit so that\nthe objective function is minimized. However, they often suffer from the\nso-called vanishing gradient or barren plateau issue. On the other hand, the\nnormalized gradient descent (NGD) method, which employs the normalized gradient\nvector to update the parameters, has been successfully utilized in several\noptimization problems. Here, we study the performance of the NGD methods in the\noptimization of VQAs for the first time. Our goal is two-fold. The first is to\nexamine the effectiveness of NGD and its variants for overcoming the vanishing\ngradient problems. The second is to propose a new NGD that can attain the\nfaster convergence than the ordinary NGD. We performed numerical simulations of\nthese gradient-based optimizers in the context of quantum chemistry where VQAs\nare used to find the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The results show the\neffective convergence property of the NGD methods in VQAs, compared to the\nrelevant optimizers without normalization. Moreover, we make use of some\nnormalized gradient vectors at the past iteration steps to propose the novel\nhistorical NGD that has a theoretical guarantee to accelerate the convergence\nspeed, which is observed in the numerical experiments as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 11:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Soon after, a number of papers have been published about the\nrelation between online disinformation and offline violence, among other\nrelated relations.

This paper thus evaluates such effects with a time series\ncross-sectional sample of 125 countries in a period between 2000 and 2019. The\nresults are mixed.

Agents exhibiting sunk-cost bias\ntake into account the effort they have already spent on an endeavor when they\nevaluate whether to continue or abandon it. We model planning tasks in which an\nagent with this type of bias tries to reach a designated goal. Our model\nstructures this problem as a type of Markov decision process: loosely speaking,\nthe agent traverses a directed acyclic graph with probabilistic transitions,\npaying costs for its actions as it tries to reach a target node containing a\nspecified reward. The agent's sunk cost bias is modeled by a cost that it\nincurs for abandoning the traversal: if the agent decides to stop traversing\nthe graph, it incurs a cost of $\\lambda \\cdot C_{sunk}$, where ${\\lambda \\geq\n0}$ is a parameter that captures the extent of the bias and $C_{sunk}$ is the\nsum of costs already invested.\n  We analyze the behavior of two types of agents: naive agents that are unaware\nof their bias, and sophisticated agents that are aware of it. Since optimal\n(bias-free) behavior in this problem can involve abandoning the traversal\nbefore reaching the goal, the bias exhibited by these types of agents can\nresult in sub-optimal behavior by shifting their decisions about abandonment.\nWe show that in contrast to optimal agents, it is computationally hard to\ncompute the optimal policy for a sophisticated agent. Our main results quantify\nthe loss exhibited by these two types of agents with respect to an optimal\nagent.

The bottom layer goes through an aging\nprocess in which its viscosity increases due to the formation of internal\nstructure, which is represented by a Coussot-type relationship. The resultant\nflow dynamics is the consequence of the competition between structuration and\ndestructuration, as characterized by the dimensionless timescale for\nstructuration (tau) and the dimensionless material property (beta) of the\nbottom fluid. The development of Kelvin-Helmholtz type instabilities (roll-up\nstructures) observed in the Newtonian constant viscosity case was found to be\nsuppressed as the viscosity of the bottom layer increased over time.

However, if the\nviscosity is small, such that the warp propagates as a wave, then steady-state\nsolutions to the linearised fluid equations exhibit an oscillatory radial\nprofile of the disc tilt angle close to the black hole. Here we show, for the\nfirst time, that these solutions are in good agreement with three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations, in which the viscosity is isotropic and measured to\nbe small compared to the disc angular semi-thickness, and in the case that the\ndisc tilt -- and thus the warp amplitude -- remains small. We show using both\nthe linearised fluid equations and hydrodynamical simulations that the inner\ndisc tilt can be more than several times larger than the original disc tilt,\nand we provide physical reasoning for this effect. We explore the transition in\ndisc behaviour as the misalignment angle is increased, finding increased\ndissipation associated with regions of strong warping. For large enough\nmisalignments the disc becomes unstable to disc tearing and breaks into\ndiscrete planes. For the simulations we present here, we show that the total\n(physical and numerical) viscosity at the time the disc breaks is small enough\nthat the disc tearing occurs in the wave-like regime, substantiating that disc\ntearing is possible in this region of parameter space. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that high spatial resolution, and thus low numerical viscosity, is\nrequired to accurately model the warp dynamics in this regime. Finally, we\ndiscuss the observational implications of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 13:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 15:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, it is unclear how these $I_c$\nmeasurements are correlated with previous estimates of the spectral gap taken\nfrom differential conductance measurements. In particular, recent such\nexperiments on an iron-based superconductor found almost no correlation between\n$I_c$ and the spectral gap obtained from differential conductance $g=dI/dV$\nspectra, reporting instead a more significant correlation between $I_c$ and the\nthe coherence-peak height. Here we point out that the correlation--or the lack\nthereof--between these various quantities can be naturally explained by the\neffect of disorder on unconventional superconductivity. Using large scale\nnumerical simulations of a BCS $d$-wave pair Hamiltonian with many-impurity\npotentials, we observe that \"substitutional\" disorder models with weak\npointlike impurities lead to a situation in which the true superconducting\norder parameter and $I_c$ are both uncorrelated with the spectral gap from\n$dI/dV$ measurements and highly correlated with the coherence-peak heights. The\nunderlying mechanism appears to be the disorder-induced transfer of spectral\nweight away from the coherence peaks. On the other hand, smooth impurity\npotentials with a length scale larger than the lattice constant lead to a large\npositive correlation between the true superconducting order parameter and the\nspectral gap, in addition to a large correlation between the order parameter\nand the coherence-peak height.

After obtaining new spectropolarimetric observations and combining them\nwith previous literature data, we have checked the population of about 152\nwhite dwarfs within 20 pc from the Sun for the presence of magnetic fields,\nwith a sensitivity that ranges from better than 1 kG for most of the stars of\nspectral class DA, to 1 MG for some of the featureless white dwarfs. We find\nthat 33 white dwarfs of the local 20 pc volume are magnetic. Statistically the\ndata are consistent with the possibility that the frequency of the magnetic\nfield occurrence is similar in stars of all spectral classes, except that in\nthe local 20 pc volume, either DQ stars are more frequently magnetic, or host\nmuch stronger fields than average. The distribution of the observed field\nstrength ranges from 40 kG to 300 MG and is uniform per decade, in striking\ncontrast to the field frequency distribution resulting from spectroscopic\nsurveys. No fields weaker than 40 kG are found. We confirm that magnetic fields\nare more frequent in white dwarfs with higher than average mass. We find a\nmarked deficiency of magnetic white dwarfs younger than 0.5 Gyr, and that the\nfrequency of the occurrence of the magnetic field is significantly higher in\nwhite dwarfs that have undergone the process of core crystallisation than in\nwhite dwarfs with fully liquid core. There is no obvious evidence of field\nstrength decay with time. We discuss the implications of our findings in\nrelation to some of the proposals that have been put forward to explain the\norigin and evolution of magnetic fields in degenerate stars, in particular\nthose that predict the presence of a dynamo acting during the crystallisation\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 13:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Multilevel Monte\nCarlo (MLMC) methods significantly reduce the computational cost by\ndistributing the sampling across a hierarchy of discretizations and allocating\nmost samples to the coarser grids. For time dependent problems, spatial\ncoarsening typically entails an increased time-step. Geometric constraints,\nhowever, may impede uniform coarsening thereby forcing some elements to remain\nsmall across all levels. If explicit time-stepping is used, the time-step will\nthen be dictated by the smallest element on each level for numerical stability.\nHence, the increasingly stringent CFL condition on the time-step on coarser\nlevels significantly reduces the advantages of the multilevel approach. To\novercome that bottleneck we propose to combine the multilevel approach of MLMC\nwith local time-stepping (LTS). By adapting the time-step to the locally\nrefined elements on each level, the efficiency of MLMC methods is restored even\nin the presence of complex geometry without sacrificing the explicitness and\ninherent parallelism. In a careful cost comparison, we quantify the reduction\nin computational cost for local refinement either inside a small fixed region\nor towards a reentrant corner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 13:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 06:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In this case, directly\ntraining a GNN classifier with raw data would under-represent samples from\nthose minority classes and result in sub-optimal performance. This paper\npresents GraphMixup, a novel mixup-based framework for improving\nclass-imbalanced node classification on graphs. However, directly performing\nmixup in the input space or embedding space may produce out-of-domain samples\ndue to the extreme sparsity of minority classes; hence we construct semantic\nrelation spaces that allows the Feature Mixup to be performed at the semantic\nlevel. Moreover, we apply two context-based self-supervised techniques to\ncapture both local and global information in the graph structure and then\npropose Edge Mixup specifically for graph data. Finally, we develop a\n\\emph{Reinforcement Mixup} mechanism to adaptively determine how many samples\nare to be generated by mixup for those minority classes.

To this end, we design a face parsing-based\nnetwork to learn semantic information at different scales and a novel face\nparsing attention module to leverage these semantic features for age\nestimation.

The proposal requires that one starts off with the\nentire Penrose diagram for the eternal black hole as the background metric,\nafter which a procedure was proposed to identify the two asymptotic domains of\nthis metric, such that they both refer to the same outside world. In this paper\nwe focus on the need to include time reversal in applying this identification.\nThis forces us to postulate the existence of an 'anti-vacuum' state in our\nworld, which is the state where energy density reaches a maximal value. We find\nthat this squares well with the deterministic interpretation of quantum\nmechanics, according to which quantum Hilbert space is to be regarded as the\n'vector representation' of a real world.\n  One has to understand how to deal with gravity in such considerations. The\nnon-perturbative component of the gravitational force seems to involve\ncut-and-paste procedures as dynamical features of space and time, of which the\nre-arrangement of space-time into two connected domains in the Penrose diagram\nis a primary example.

The main\ncontribution of this chapter is to extend the spectral graph matching methods\nto very large graphs by combining spectral graph matching with Laplacian\nembedding. Since the embedded representation of a graph is obtained by\ndimensionality reduction we claim that the existing spectral-based methods are\nnot easily applicable. We discuss solutions for the exact and inexact graph\nisomorphism problems and recall the main spectral properties of the\ncombinatorial graph Laplacian; We provide a novel analysis of the commute-time\nembedding that allows us to interpret the latter in terms of the PCA of a\ngraph, and to select the appropriate dimension of the associated embedded\nmetric space; We derive a unit hyper-sphere normalization for the commute-time\nembedding that allows us to register two shapes with different samplings; We\npropose a novel method to find the eigenvalue-eigenvector ordering and the\neigenvector signs using the eigensignature (histogram) which is invariant to\nthe isometric shape deformations and fits well in the spectral graph matching\nframework, and we present a probabilistic shape matching formulation using an\nexpectation maximization point registration algorithm which alternates between\naligning the eigenbases and finding a vertex-to-vertex assignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Although numerous studies are conducted\nfor the automatic detection of fake news, the majority tend to utilize deep\nneural networks to learn event-specific features for superior detection\nperformance on specific datasets. However, the trained models heavily rely on\nthe training datasets and are infeasible to apply to upcoming events due to the\ndiscrepancy between event distributions. Inspired by domain adaptation\ntheories, we propose an end-to-end adversarial adaptation network, dubbed as\nMetaDetector, to transfer meta knowledge (event-shared features) between\ndifferent events. Specifically, MetaDetector pushes the feature extractor and\nevent discriminator to eliminate event-specific features and preserve required\nevent-shared features by adversarial training. Furthermore, the pseudo-event\ndiscriminator is utilized to evaluate the importance of historical event posts\nto obtain partial shared features that are discriminative for detecting fake\nnews. Under the coordinated optimization among the four submodules,\nMetaDetector accurately transfers the meta-knowledge of historical events to\nthe upcoming event for fact checking. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that MetaDetector outperforms the state-of-the-art methods,\nespecially when the distribution shift between events is significant.\nFurthermore, we find that MetaDetector is able to learn the event-shared\nfeatures, and alleviate the negative transfer caused by the large distribution\nshift between events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Based on our holographic formulation, we then calculate the time\nevolution of entanglement entropy in various moving mirror models. In doing so,\nwe mainly focus on three different setups: escaping mirror, which models\nconstant Hawking radiation emanating from an eternal black hole; kink mirror,\nwhich models an evaporating black hole formed from collapse; and the double\nescaping mirror, which models two constantly radiating eternal black holes. In\nparticular, by computing the holographic entanglement entropy, we show that the\nkink mirror gives rise to an ideal Page curve. We also find that an interesting\nphase transition arises in the case of the double escaping mirror.

Challenges relate to, e.g.,\ndevelopment teams not being aware of the high-level requirement and dealing\nwith flexibility of writing user stories. We found that strategies for\novercoming most of these challenges are still lacking and thus call for more\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

In R, this is elegantly implemented via lm() and\nits related functions. However, the statistical inference output from this\nsuite of functions is based on the assumption that the model is well specified.\nThis assumption is often unrealistic and at best satisfied approximately. In\nthe statistics and econometrics literature, this has long been recognized and a\nlarge body of work provides inference for OLS under more practical assumptions.\nThis can be seen as model-free inference. In this paper, we introduce our\npackage maars (\"models as approximations\") that aims at bringing research on\nmodel-free inference to R via a comprehensive workflow. The maars package\ndiffers from other packages that also implement variance estimation, such as\nsandwich, in three key ways. First, all functions in maars follow a consistent\ngrammar and return output in tidy format, with minimal deviation from the\ntypical lm() workflow. Second, maars contains several tools for inference\nincluding empirical, multiplier, residual bootstrap, and subsampling, for easy\ncomparison. Third, maars is developed with pedagogy in mind. For this, most of\nits functions explicitly return the assumptions under which the output is\nvalid. This key innovation makes maars useful in teaching inference under\nmisspecification and also a powerful tool for applied researchers. We hope our\ndefault feature of explicitly presenting assumptions will become a de facto\nstandard for most statistical modeling in R.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

The PP is mapped with each resource block (RB) to achieve\ndistributed power control (DPC).

In this paper, we propose a novel\niterative network pruning with uncertainty regularization method for lifelong\nsentiment classification (IPRLS), which leverages the principles of network\npruning and weight regularization. By performing network pruning with\nuncertainty regularization in an iterative manner, IPRLS can adapta single BERT\nmodel to work with continuously arriving data from multiple domains while\navoiding catastrophic forgetting and interference. Specifically, we leverage an\niterative pruning method to remove redundant parameters in large deep networks\nso that the freed-up space can then be employed to learn new tasks, tackling\nthe catastrophic forgetting problem. Instead of keeping the old-tasks fixed\nwhen learning new tasks, we also use an uncertainty regularization based on the\nBayesian online learning framework to constrain the update of old tasks weights\nin BERT, which enables positive backward transfer, i.e. learning new tasks\nimproves performance on past tasks while protecting old knowledge from being\nlost. In addition, we propose a task-specific low-dimensional residual function\nin parallel to each layer of BERT, which makes IPRLS less prone to losing the\nknowledge saved in the base BERT network when learning a new task. Extensive\nexperiments on 16 popular review corpora demonstrate that the proposed IPRLS\nmethod sig-nificantly outperforms the strong baselines for lifelong sentiment\nclassification.

When combined with recent observations uncovering an abundance of\ntemperate, rocky planets around these diminutive stars, we're faced with an\napparent logical contradiction - why don't we see a red dwarf in our sky? To\naddress this \"Red Sky paradox\", we formulate a Bayesian probability function\nconcerning the odds of finding oneself around a F/G/K-spectral type (Sun-like)\nstar. If the development of intelligent life from prebiotic chemistry is a\nuniversally rapid and ensured process, the temporal advantage of red dwarfs\ndissolves softening the Red Sky paradox, but exacerbating the classic Fermi\nparadox. Otherwise, we find that humanity appears to be a 1-in-100 outlier.\nWhilst this could be random chance (resolution I), we outline three other\nnon-mutually exclusive resolutions (II-IV) that broadly act as filters to\nattenuate the suitability of red dwarfs for complex life. Future observations\nmay be able to provide support for some of these.

The primary cause of these\nproblems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits, which are\nmanageable using interactive mHealth apps. However, traditional dietary\nmonitoring systems using manual food logging suffer from imprecision,\nunderreporting, time consumption, and low adherence. Recent dietary monitoring\nsystems tackle these challenges by automatic assessment of dietary intake\nthrough machine learning methods. This survey discusses the most performing\nmethodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food recognition\nand volume estimation. First, we will present the rationale of visual-based\nmethods for food recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation,\ndiscussion and evaluation of these methods on popular food image databases.\nFollowing that, we discussed the mobile applications that are implementing\nthese methods.

However, $R_{max}$ is\nnoisy to observe directly and is poorly resolved in reanalyses and climate\nmodels. In contrast, outer wind radii are much less sensitive to such issues.\nHere we present a simple empirical model for predicting $R_{max}$ from the\nradius of 34-kt wind ($R_{17.5ms}$) that only requires as input quantities that\nare routinely estimated operationally: maximum wind speed, $R_{17.5ms}$, and\nlatitude. The form of the empirical model takes advantage of our physical\nunderstanding of hurricane radial structure and is trained on the Extended Best\nTrack database from the North Atlantic; results are similar for the TC-OBS\ndatabase. The physics reduces the relationship between the two radii to a\ndependence on two physical parameters, while the observational data enables an\noptimal estimate of the quantitative dependence on those parameters. The model\nperforms substantially better than existing operational methods for estimating\n$R_{max}$. The model reproduces the observed statistical increase in $R_{max}$\nwith latitude and demonstrates that this increase is driven by the increase in\n$R_{17.5ms}$ with latitude.

We apply a zero-shot learning method to machine learning (ML) by\nleveraging explanations for predictions of anomalies generated by a ML model.\nThis approach has huge potential to auto detect alarm labels generated in SIEM\nand associate them with specific attack types. In this approach, without any\nprior knowledge of attack, we try to identify it, decipher the features that\ncontribute to classification and try to bucketize the attack in a specific\ncategory - using explainable AI. Explanations give us measurable factors as to\nwhat features influence the prediction of a cyber-attack and to what degree.\nThese explanations generated based on game-theory are used to allocate credit\nto specific features based on their influence on a specific prediction. Using\nthis allocation of credit, we propose a novel zero-shot approach to categorize\nnovel attacks into specific new classes based on feature influence. The\nresulting system demonstrated will get good at separating attack traffic from\nnormal flow and auto-generate a label for attacks based on features that\ncontribute to the attack. These auto-generated labels can be presented to SIEM\nanalyst and are intuitive enough to figure out the nature of attack. We apply\nthis approach to a network flow dataset and demonstrate results for specific\nattack types like ip sweep, denial of service, remote to local, etc.\n  Paper was presented at the first Conference on Deployable AI at IIT-Madras in\nJune 2021.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 06:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

The limited forest canopy penetration of\nC-band SAR sensors along with the sparseness of available ground truth restrict\ntheir usefulness in traditional AGB regression models. Therefore, we propose to\nuse AGB predictions based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as a surrogate\nresponse variable for SAR data. This dramatically increases the available\ntraining data and opens for flexible regression models that capture fine-scale\nAGB dynamics. This becomes a sequential modelling approach, where the first\nregression stage has linked in situ data to ALS data and produced the AGB\nprediction map; We perform the subsequent stage, where this map is related to\nSentinel-1 data. We develop a traditional, parametric regression model and\nalternative non-parametric models for this stage. The latter uses a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network (cGAN) to translate Sentinel-1 images into\nALS-based AGB prediction maps. The convolution filters in the neural networks\nmake them contextual. We compare the sequential models to traditional,\nnon-sequential regression models, all trained on limited AGB ground reference\ndata. Results show that our newly proposed non-sequential Sentinel-1-based\nregression model performs better quantitatively than the sequential models, but\nachieves less sensitivity to fine-scale AGB dynamics. The contextual cGAN-based\nsequential models best reproduce the distribution of ALS-based AGB predictions.\nThey also reach a lower RMSE against in situ AGB data than the parametric\nsequential model, indicating a potential for further development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 12:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Existing fusion-based methods, however, may not achieve\npromising performance due to the vast difference between the two modalities. In\nthis work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called perception-aware\nmulti-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information from two\nmodalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and spatio-depth\ninformation from point clouds. To this end, we first project point clouds to\nthe camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB images.\nThen, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two\nmodalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based\nfusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to\nmeasure the perceptual difference between the two modalities.
