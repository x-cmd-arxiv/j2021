To this end, we study semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG),\nwhich aims to learn a domain-generalizable model using multi-source,\npartially-labeled training data. We design two benchmarks that cover\nstate-of-the-art methods developed in two related fields, i.e., domain\ngeneralization (DG) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). We find that the DG\nmethods, which by design are unable to handle unlabeled data, perform poorly\nwith limited labels in SSDG; the SSL methods, especially FixMatch, obtain much\nbetter results but are still far away from the basic vanilla model trained\nusing full labels. We propose StyleMatch, a simple approach that extends\nFixMatch with a couple of new ingredients tailored for SSDG: 1) stochastic\nmodeling for reducing overfitting in scarce labels, and 2) multi-view\nconsistency learning for enhancing domain generalization. Despite the concise\ndesigns, StyleMatch achieves significant improvements in SSDG. We hope our\napproach and the comprehensive benchmarks can pave the way for future research\non generalizable and data-efficient learning systems.

However, depending on the\napplication context, different definitions of fairness might need to be\nemployed. As a result, new algorithms and analysis need to be proposed for each\ncombination of clustering algorithm and fairness definition. Additionally, each\nnew algorithm would need to be reimplemented for deployment in a real-world\nsystem. Hence, we propose an alternate approach to group-level fairness in\ncenter-based clustering inspired by research on data poisoning attacks. We seek\nto augment the original dataset with a small number of data points, called\nantidote data. When clustering is undertaken on this new dataset, the output is\nfair, for the chosen clustering algorithm and fairness definition. We formulate\nthis as a general bi-level optimization problem which can accommodate any\ncenter-based clustering algorithms and fairness notions.

Here we\npresent a study of axisymmetric models of isolated magnetised neutron stars,\nfor various realistic equations of state considered viable by observations and\nnuclear physics constraints. We show that it is possible to find simple\nrelations between the magnetic deformation of a neutron star, its Komar mass\nand its circumferential radius. Such relations are quasi-universal, meaning\nthat they are mostly independent on the equation of state of the neutron star\nand only slightly dependent on the magnetic field configuration.

While this is generally not\nconsistent with rational utility maximization, it does reflect two strong\nempirical regularities that are central to the behavioral science of human\ndecision-making: a tendency to evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point\ndetermined by context (in this case the original purchase price), and the\nphenomenon of loss aversion in which people are particularly prone to avoid\noutcomes below the reference point. Here we explore the implications of\nreference points and loss aversion in optimal stopping problems, where people\nevaluate a sequence of options in one pass, either accepting the option and\nstopping the search or giving up on the option forever. The best option seen so\nfar sets a reference point that shifts as the search progresses, and a biased\ndecision-maker's utility incurs an additional penalty when they accept a later\noption that is below this reference point.\n  We formulate and study a behaviorally well-motivated version of the optimal\nstopping problem that incorporates these notions of reference dependence and\nloss aversion. We obtain tight bounds on the performance of a biased agent in\nthis model relative to the best option obtainable in retrospect (a type of\nprophet inequality for biased agents), as well as tight bounds on the ratio\nbetween the performance of a biased agent and the performance of a rational\none. We further establish basic monotonicity results, and show an exponential\ngap between the performance of a biased agent in a stopping problem with\nrespect to a worst-case versus a random order. As part of this, we establish\nfundamental differences between optimal stopping problems for rational versus\nbiased agents, and these differences inform our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 16:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The summary obtained\nfrom the automatic text summarization often faces the issues of diversity and\ninformation coverage. Promising results are obtained for automatic text\nsummarization by the introduction of new techniques based on graph ranking of\nsentences, clustering, and optimization. This research work proposes CoRank, a\ntwo-stage sentence selection model involving clustering and then ranking of\nsentences. The initial stage involves clustering of sentences using a novel\nclustering algorithm, and later selection of salient sentences using CoRank\nalgorithm. The approach aims to cover two objectives: maximum coverage and\ndiversity, which is achieved by the extraction of main topics and sub-topics\nfrom the original text. The performance of the CoRank is validated on DUC2001\nand DUC 2002 data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 16:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Each autonomous agent learns based on the feedback from the\ndestination and its own energy levels whether to remain active and forward the\nmessage, or become passive for that transmission phase. We evaluate the\napproach by comparing with the centralized approach, and observe that with\nlesser number of MFRAs, our approach is able to ensure reliable delivery of\ndata and reduce overall energy cost by 56.76\\% -- 88.03\\%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 17:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The photon ring closely tracks a theoretical curve\non the image plane corresponding to light rays that asymptote to unstably bound\nphoton orbits around the black hole. This critical curve has a size and shape\nthat are purely governed by the Kerr geometry; in contrast, the size, shape,\nand depth of the observed brightness depression all depend on the details of\nthe emission region. For instance, images of spherical accretion models display\na distinctive dark region -- the \"black hole shadow\" -- that completely fills\nthe photon ring. By contrast, in models of equatorial disks extending to the\nblack hole's event horizon, the darkest region in the image is restricted to a\nmuch smaller area -- an inner shadow -- whose edge lies near the direct lensed\nimage of the equatorial horizon. Using both semi-analytic models and general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we demonstrate that the\nphoton ring and inner shadow may be simultaneously visible in submillimeter\nimages of M87*, where magnetically arrested disk (MAD) simulations predict that\nthe emission arises in a thin region near the equatorial plane.

The\ntimescale of each phase is derived by comparing the results of the models with\nthe properties of the sources of the ATLASGAL-TOP100 sample, taking into\naccount the mass and luminosity of the clumps, and the column densities of\nmethyl acetylene (CH$_3$CCH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), formaldehyde (H$_2$CO)\nand methanol (CH$_3$OH).

We succeed in reproducing\nthe observed column densities of CH$_3$CCH and CH$_3$CN, while H$_2$CO and\nCH$_3$OH show a poorer agreement with the observed values.

The interplay between functional robustness and behavioral\nvariability is exemplified at the organellar level by the beating of cilia and\nflagella. The complex bending patterns of cilia emerge from the coordinated\nactivities of hundreds of different proteins. Cilia are motile despite wide\ngenetic diversity between and within species, large differences in\nintracellular concentrations of ATP and calcium, and considerable environment\nfluctuations in temperature and viscosity. At the same time, these\nperturbations result in a variety of spatio-temporal patterns that span a rich,\nand as of yet uncharted, behavioral space. To investigate this behavioral space\nwe analyzed the dynamics of isolated cilia from the unicellular algae\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii in thirty four different environmental and genetic\nconditions.

We find that shock-cloud interactions provide a viable\nexplanation for the spatial correlation between the X-rays and ISM. In these\ninteractions, the supernova shocks hit the typically pc-scale dense cores,\ngenerating a highly turbulent velocity field that amplifies the magnetic field\nup to 0.1-1 mG. This amplification leads to enhanced nonthermal synchrotron\nemission around the clumps, whereas the cosmic-ray electrons do not penetrate\nthe clumps. Accordingly, the nonthermal X-rays exhibit a spatial distribution\nsimilar to that of the ISM on the pc scale, while they are anticorrelated at\nsub-pc scales.

We first formulate the recruitment as an Integer Linear Program\n(ILP) that optimally forms teams according to four fuzzy-logic-based criteria:\nlevel of expertise, social relationship strength, recruitment cost, and\nrecruiter's confidence level. To cope with NP-hardness, we design a novel\nlow-complexity CMCS recruitment approach relying on Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs), specifically graph embedding and clustering techniques, to shrink the\nworkers' search space and afterwards, exploiting a meta-heuristic genetic\nalgorithm to select appropriate workers.

Here, we demonstrate\nmulti-axis coherent control of the SnV spin qubit via an all-optical stimulated\nRaman drive between the ground and excited states. We use coherent population\ntrapping and optically driven electronic spin resonance to confirm coherent\naccess to the qubit at 1.7 K, and obtain spin Rabi oscillations at a rate of\n$\\Omega/2\\pi$=3.6(1) MHz. All-optical Ramsey interferometry reveals a spin\ndephasing time of $T_2^*$=1.3(3)$\\mu$s and two-pulse dynamical decoupling\nalready extends the spin coherence time to $T_2$=0.33(14) ms.

A robust mapping of the\nconformational landscape underlying mini-proteins and peptides often requires\nlow-dimensional projection of the conformational ensemble along optimized\ncollective variables. However, the traditional choice for the collective\nvariable (CV) is often limited by user-intuition and prior knowledge about the\nsystem, which lacks a rigorous assessment of their optimality over other\ncandidate CVs. To address this issue, we propose a generic approach in which we\nfirst choose the possible combinations of inter-residue Calpha-distances within\na given macromolecule as a set of input CVs. Subsequently we derive a\nnon-linear combination of latent-space embedded collective variables via\nauto-encoding the unbiased MD simulation trajectories within the framework of\nfeed-forward neural network. We demonstrate the ability of the derived latent\nspace variables in elucidating the conformational landscape in three\nhierarchically complex systems. When the conformational dynamics is resolved\nalong the latent space CVs, it identifies key metastable states of a\nbead-in-a-spring polymer. The combination of the adopted dimensionally\nreduction technique with a Markov state model, built on the derived latent\nspace, efficiently projects the free energy landscape of GB1 beta-hairpin,\nrevealing multiple spatially well-resolved and kinetically well-separated\nmetastable conformations. A quantitative comparison based on variational\napproach to Markov Process of the auto encoder-derived latent-space CVs with\nthe ones obtained PCA or TICA confirms the optimality of the former. Finally,\nas a practical application, we demonstrate that the auto-encoder derived CVs\nsuccessfully predict the reinforced folding of Trp-cage mini-protein in an\naqueous osmolyte solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 18:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

For example,\nturbulence in hot accretion flows may be driven solenoidally by the\nmagnetorotational instability or compressively by spiral shock waves. It is\nimportant to understand the role of the driving mechanism on kinetic turbulence\nand the associated particle energization. In this work, we compare\nparticle-in-cell simulations of solenoidally driven turbulence with similar\nsimulations of compressively driven turbulence. We focus on plasma that has an\ninitial beta of unity, relativistically hot electrons, and varying ion\ntemperature. Apart from strong large-scale density fluctuations in the\ncompressive case, the turbulence statistics are similar for both drives, and\nthe bulk plasma is described reasonably well by an isothermal equation of\nstate. We find that nonthermal particle acceleration is more efficient when\nturbulence is driven compressively. In the case of relativistically hot ions,\nboth driving mechanisms ultimately lead to similar power-law particle energy\ndistributions, but over a different duration. In the case of non-relativistic\nions, there is significant nonthermal particle acceleration only for\ncompressive driving. Additionally, we find that the electron-to-ion heating\nratio is less than unity for both drives, but takes a smaller value for\ncompressive driving. We demonstrate that this additional ion energization is\nassociated with the collisionless damping of large-scale compressive modes via\nperpendicular electric fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 19:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 14:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Errors\nalso result from decoherence, which is often regarded as more crucial in the\nsense that it is inherent to the quantum system, being fundamentally a\nconsequence of the coupling to the external environment.\n  Grouping small collections of qubits into clusters with symmetries can\nprotect parts of the calculation from decoherence.

Total variation (TV) regularization is\nadopted in many image processing applications to preserve the local smoothness.\nHowever, TV prior is prone to oversmoothness, staircasing effect, and contrast\nlosses. Nonlocal TV (NLTV) mitigates the contrast losses by adaptively\nweighting the smoothness based on the similarity measure of image patches.\nAlthough it suppresses the noise effectively in the flat regions, it might\nleave residual noise surrounding the edges especially when the image is not\noversmoothed. To address this problem, we propose the bilateral spectrum\nweighted total variation (BSWTV). Specially, we apply a locally adaptive shrink\ncoefficient to the image gradients and employ the eigenvalues of the covariance\nmatrix of the weighted image gradients to effectively refine the weighting map\nand suppress the residual noise. In conjunction with the data fidelity term\nderived from a mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise model, the objective function is\ndecomposed and solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)\nalgorithm.

With\nbroken time-reversal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and excitonic effects\nincluded through the full-spinor $GW$ and $GW$ plus Bethe-Salpeter equation\n($GW$-BSE) methods, we compute the frequency-dependent layer polarizability\ntensor and dielectric function tensor that govern the optical and\nmagneto-optical properties. In addition, we provide a detailed theoretical\nformalism for simulating magnetic circular dichroism, magneto-optical Kerr\neffect, and Faraday effect, demonstrating the approach with monolayer CrBr$_3$.\nDue to reduced dielectric screening in 2D and the localized nature of the Cr\n$d$ orbitals, we find strong self-energy effects on the quasiparticle band\nstructure of monolayer CrBr$_3$ that give a 3.8 eV indirect band gap. Also,\nexcitonic effects dominate the low-energy optical and magneto-optical responses\nin monolayer CrBr$_3$ where a large exciton binding energy of 2.3 eV is found\nfor the lowest bright exciton state with excitation energy at 1.5 eV. We\nfurther find that the magneto-optical signals demonstrate strong dependence on\nthe excitation frequency and substrate refractive index. Our theoretical\nframework for modeling optical and magneto-optical effects could serve as a\npowerful theoretical tool for future study of optoelectronic and spintronics\ndevices consisting of van der Waals 2D magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 20:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 01:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Features that\nare relevant for accurate decisions may however lead to either explicit or\nimplicit forms of discrimination against unprivileged groups, such as those of\ncertain race or gender. This happens due to existing biases in the training\ndata, which are often replicated or even exacerbated by the learning algorithm.\nIdentifying and measuring these biases at the data level is a challenging\nproblem due to the interdependence among the features, and the decision\noutcome. In this work, we develop a framework for fairness-aware feature\nselection which takes into account the correlation among the features and the\ndecision outcome, and is based on information theoretic measures for the\naccuracy and discriminatory impacts of features. In particular, we first\npropose information theoretic measures which quantify the impact of different\nsubsets of features on the accuracy and discrimination of the decision\noutcomes.

We consider a nonstandard optimal\ncontrol problem in which the goal is to minimize the CVaR of a maximum random\ncost subject to a Borel-space Markov decision process. The objective represents\nthe maximum departure from a desired operating region averaged over a given\nfraction of the worst cases. This problem provides a safety criterion for a\nstochastic system that is informed by both the probability and severity of the\npotential consequences of the system's behavior. In contrast, existing safety\nanalysis frameworks apply stage-wise risk constraints or assess the probability\nof constraint violation without quantifying the potential severity of the\nviolation. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of interest has not been\nsolved. To solve the problem, we propose and study a family of stochastic\ndynamic programs on an augmented state space. We prove that the optimal CVaR of\na maximum random cost enjoys an equivalent representation in terms of the\nsolutions to these dynamic programs under appropriate assumptions. For each\ndynamic program, we show the existence of an optimal policy that depends on the\ndynamics of an augmented state under the assumptions.

Historically the \"Lithium test\", a search for the presence and\nstrength of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object has a\nsubstellar mass with stellar-like spectral energy distribution (e.g., a\nlate-type M dwarf). While the Li test could in principle also be used to\ndistinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no longer\nfound as an atomic gas, but rather a molecular species such as LiH, LiF, LiOH,\nand LiCl in their cooler atmospheres.

For example, in the\nstandard Sufficiency metric, only the top-k most important tokens are kept. In\nthis paper, we study several under-explored dimensions of FI explanations,\nproviding conceptual and empirical improvements for this form of explanation.\nFirst, we advance a new argument for why it can be problematic to remove\nfeatures from an input when creating or evaluating explanations: the fact that\nthese counterfactual inputs are out-of-distribution (OOD) to models implies\nthat the resulting explanations are socially misaligned. The crux of the\nproblem is that the model prior and random weight initialization influence the\nexplanations (and explanation metrics) in unintended ways. To resolve this\nissue, we propose a simple alteration to the model training process, which\nresults in more socially aligned explanations and metrics. Second, we compare\namong five approaches for removing features from model inputs. We find that\nsome methods produce more OOD counterfactuals than others, and we make\nrecommendations for selecting a feature-replacement function. Finally, we\nintroduce four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations and compare\nthem to strong baselines, including LIME, Anchors, and Integrated Gradients.\nThrough experiments with six diverse text classification datasets, we find that\nthe only method that consistently outperforms random search is a Parallel Local\nSearch (PLS) that we introduce.

In many cases the dynamics of the interface\ndetermines the behavior of the flow. In a coarse, or reduced order model, it\nmay therefore be important to retain a sharp interface for the resolved scales.\nHere, a process to coarsen or filter fully resolved numerical solutions for\nincompressible multiphase flows while retaining a sharp interface is examined.\nThe different phases are identified by an index function that takes different\nvalues in each phase and is coarsened by solving a constant coefficient\ndiffusion equation, while tracking the interface contour. Small flows scales of\none phase, left behind when the interface is moved, are embedded in the other\nphase by solving another diffusion equation with a modified diffusion\ncoefficient that is zero at the interface location to prevent diffusion across\nthe interface, plus a pressure like equation to enforce incompressibility of\nthe coarse velocity field. Examples of different levels of coarsening are\nshown. A simulation of a coarse model, where small scales are treated as a\nhomogeneous mixture, results in a solution that is similar to the filtered\nfully resolved field for the early time Rayleigh-Taylor instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 20:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

In the neural state space, different objects with\nstimulus variabilities are represented as different manifolds. In this\ngeometrical perspective, object recognition becomes the problem of linearly\nseparating different object manifolds. In feedforward visual hierarchy, it has\nbeen suggested that the object manifold representations are reformatted across\nthe layers, to become more linearly separable. Thus, a complete theory of\nperception requires characterizing the ability of linear readout networks to\nclassify object manifolds from variable neural responses.\n  A theory of the perceptron of isolated points was pioneered by E. Gardner who\nformulated it as a statistical mechanics problem and analyzed it using replica\ntheory. In this thesis, we generalize Gardner's analysis and establish a theory\nof linear classification of manifolds synthesizing statistical and geometric\nproperties of high dimensional signals. [..] Next, we generalize our theory\nfurther to linear classification of general perceptual manifolds, such as point\nclouds. We identify that the capacity of a manifold is determined that\neffective radius, R_M, and effective dimension, D_M. Finally, we show\nextensions relevant for applications to real data, incorporating correlated\nmanifolds, heterogenous manifold geometries, sparse labels and nonlinear\nclassifications. Then, we demonstrate how object-based manifolds transform in\nstandard deep networks.\n  This thesis lays the groundwork for a computational theory of neuronal\nprocessing of objects, providing quantitative measures for linear separability\nof object manifolds. We hope this theory will provide new insights into the\ncomputational principles underlying processing of sensory representations in\nbiological and artificial neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 20:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

In many real-world systems, however, the mechanisms are subject\nto shifts across environments which may invalidate the static environment\nassumption. In this paper, we take a step toward tackling the problem of\nenvironmental shifts considering the framework of offline contextual bandits.\nWe view the environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and\npropose multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the\nunderlying mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality\nliterature and introduce the notion of policy invariance.

Here, we\nsimulate an active microrheology experiment, in which a spherical colloid is\npulled with a constant external force through a fluid, creating\nnear-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium systems. We characterize the\nstructural and dynamical properties of these systems, and reconstruct an\neffective generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the colloid dynamics.\nSpecifically, we test the validity of two FDTs: The first FDT relates the\nnon-equilibrium response of a system to equilibrium correlation functions, and\nthe second FDT relates the memory friction kernel in the GLE to the stochastic\nforce. We find that the validity of the first FDT depends strongly on the\nstrength of the external driving: it is fulfilled close to equilibrium and\nbreaks down far from it.

We provide a mathematical argument why this generally holds for\nmemory kernels reconstructed from a deterministic Volterra equation for\ncorrelation functions, even for non-stationary non-equilibrium systems.\n  Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, we therefore suggest to impose an\northogonality constraint on the stochastic force, which is in fact equivalent\nto the validity of this Volterra equation.

All the links of the network\ngenerate bipartite Bell-state entangled states in each time-slot with certain\nprobabilities, and each end node stores one qubit of the entanglement generated\nby the link. To create shared entanglements for a set of users, measurement\noperations are performed on qubits of link-level entanglements on a set of\nrelated links, and these operations are probabilistic in nature and are\nsuccessful with certain probabilities. Requests arrive to the system seeking\nshared entanglements for different sets of users. Each request is for the\ncreation of shared entanglements for a fixed set of users using link-level\nentanglements on a fixed set of links. Requests are processed according to\nFirst-Come-First-Served service discipline and unserved requests are stored in\nbuffers. Once a request is selected for service, measurement operations are\nperformed on qubits of link-level entanglements on related links to create a\nshared entanglement. For given set of request arrival rates and link-level\nentanglement generation rates, we obtain necessary conditions for the stability\nof queues of requests.

The main objective of research in the area is to achieve one of\ntwo goals: fairness or efficiency. On the fairness side, envy-freeness is the\ncentral fairness criterion in economics, but envy-free allocations typically do\nnot exist when the goods are indivisible. A recent line of research shows that\nenvy-freeness can be achieved if a small quantity of a homogeneous divisible\ngood (money) is introduced into the system, or equivalently, if transfer\npayments are allowed between the agents. A natural question to explore, then,\nis whether transfer payments can be used to provide high welfare in addition to\nenvy-freeness, and if so, how much money is needed to be transferred.\n  We show that for general monotone valuations, there always exists an\nallocation with transfers that is envy-free and whose Nash social welfare (NSW)\nis at least an $e^{-1/e}$-fraction of the optimal Nash social welfare.\nAdditionally, when the agents have additive valuations, an envy-free allocation\nwith negligible transfers and whose NSW is within a constant factor of optimal\ncan be found in polynomial time. Consequently, we demonstrate that the\nseemingly incompatible objectives of fairness and high welfare can be achieved\nsimultaneously via transfer payments, even for general valuations, when the\nwelfare objective is NSW. On the other hand, we show that a similar result is\nimpossible for utilitarian social welfare: any envy-freeable allocation that\nachieves a constant fraction of the optimal welfare requires non-negligible\ntransfers.

The recent mixture invariant training (MixIT)\nmethod enables training on in-the-wild data; however, it suffers from two\noutstanding problems. First, it produces models which tend to over-separate,\nproducing more output sources than are present in the input. Second, the\nexponential computational complexity of the MixIT loss limits the number of\nfeasible output sources. In this paper we address both issues. To combat\nover-separation we introduce new losses: sparsity losses that favor fewer\noutput sources and a covariance loss that discourages correlated outputs.

To handle larger numbers of sources, we introduce an\nefficient approximation using a fast least-squares solution, projected onto the\nMixIT constraint set.

Recently, a growing\nbody of work shows that voice biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing through\nreplay attacks, where an adversary tries to spoof voice authentication systems\nby using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a genuine user. To this\nend, we propose VoiceGesture, a liveness detection solution for voice\nauthentication on smart devices such as smartphones and smart speakers.\nVoiceGesture detects a live user by leveraging both the unique articulatory\ngesture of the user when speaking a passphrase and the audio hardware advances\non these smart devices. Specifically, our system re-uses a pair of built-in\nspeaker and microphone on a smart device as a Doppler radar, which transmits a\nhigh-frequency acoustic sound from the speaker and listens to the reflections\nat the microphone when a user speaks a passphrase.

We use a core set of 500 words belonging to 59 neurobiologically\nmotivated semantic categories in 29 languages and analyze three word embedding\nmodels per language (FastText, MUSE, and subs2vec). We find moderate to strong\npositive correlations between categorical modularity and performance on the\nmonolingual tasks of sentiment analysis and word similarity calculation and on\nthe cross-lingual task of bilingual lexicon induction both to and from English.\nOverall, we suggest that categorical modularity provides non-trivial predictive\ninformation about downstream task performance, with breakdowns of correlations\nby model suggesting some meta-predictive properties about semantic information\nloss as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 01:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

To this end, we propose a model called\nGlobal Context enhanced Document-level NER (GCDoc) to leverage global\ncontextual information from two levels, i.e., both word and sentence. At\nword-level, a document graph is constructed to model a wider range of\ndependencies between words, then obtain an enriched contextual representation\nfor each word via graph neural networks (GNN). To avoid the interference of\nnoise information, we further propose two strategies.

Then a selective auxiliary\nclassifier is proposed to effectively learn the weight of edges in document\ngraph and reduce the importance of noisy neighbour nodes.

A popular control\nintervention is to restrict the entering rate during peak hours by setting up\nout-of-station queueing with crowd control barriers. The \\textit{out-of-station\nwaiting} can make up a substantial proportion of total travel time but is not\nwell-studied in the literature. Accurate quantification of out-of-station\nwaiting time is important to evaluating the social benefit and cost of service\nscheduling/optimization plans; however, out-of-station waiting time is\ndifficult to estimate because it is not a part of smart card transactions. In\nthis study, we propose an innovative method to estimate the out-of-station\nwaiting time by leveraging the information from a small group of transfer\npassengers -- those who transfer from nearby bus routes to the metro station.\nBased on the estimated transfer time for this small group, we first infer the\nout-of-station waiting time for all passengers by developing a Gaussian Process\nregression with a Student-$t$ likelihood and then use the estimated\nout-of-station waiting time to build queueing diagrams. We apply our method to\nthe Tiantongyuan North station of Beijing metro as a case study; our results\nshow that the maximum out-of-station waiting time can reach 15 minutes, and the\nmaximum queue length can be over 3000 passengers.

We study this problem\nnumerically through the generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect\ndistribution in the simplest ferromagnetic one-dimensional transverse-field\nIsing model with and without coupling to the environment. We find that,in the\nabsence of coupling to the environment, simulated quantum annealing correctly\ndescribes the annealing-time dependence of the average number of defects, but a\ndetailed analysis of the defect distribution shows clear deviations from the\ntheoretical prediction. When the system is open (coupled to the environment),\nthe average number of defects does not follow the theoretical prediction but is\nqualitatively compatible with the numerical result by the infinite\ntime-evolving block decimation combined with the quasi-adiabatic propagator\npath integral, which is valid in a very short time region.

However, in particular when using a large number of agents,\nconstructing a least-restrictive collision avoidance policy is of utmost\nimportance for both classical and learning-based methods. In this paper, we\npropose a Least-Restrictive Collision Avoidance Module (LR-CAM) that evaluates\nthe safety of multi-agent systems and takes over control only when needed to\nprevent collisions. The LR-CAM is a single policy that can be wrapped around\npolicies of all agents in a multi-agent system. It allows each agent to pursue\nany objective as long as it is safe to do so. The benefit of the proposed\nleast-restrictive policy is to only interrupt and overrule the default\ncontroller in case of an upcoming inevitable danger. We use a Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to enable the LR-CAM to\naccount for a varying number of agents in the environment. Moreover, we propose\nan off-policy meta-reinforcement learning framework with a novel reward\nfunction based on a Hamilton-Jacobi value function to train the LR-CAM. The\nproposed method is fully meta-trained through a ROS based simulation and tested\non real multi-agent system.

In addition, we show that\neven if a subset of agents in a multi-agent system use LR-CAM, the success rate\nof all agents will increase significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 04:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

In\nthis paper, we suggest a novel verification tech nique that is based on\ninduction on userdefined rank of program states as an alternative to\nloopinvariants. Our technique, dubbed inductive rank reduction, works in two\nsteps. Firstly, we simplify the verification problem and prove that the program\nis correct when the input state con tains an input array of length B or less,\nusing the length of the array as the rank of the state. Secondly, we employ a\nsqueezing function g which converts a program state sigma with an array of\nlength > B to a state g(sigma) containing an array of length minus 1 or less.\nWe prove that when g satisfies certain natural conditions then if the program\nviolates its specification on sigma then it does so also on g(sigma). The\ncorrectness of the program on inputs with arrays of arbitrary lengths follows\nby induction. We make our technique automatic for array programs whose length\nof execution is proportional to the length of the input arrays by (i) perform\ning the first step using symbolic execution, (ii) verifying the conditions\nrequired of g using Z3, and (iii) providing a heuristic procedure for syn\nthesizing g.

First, we show the omnipresent speed variability\nobserved in different species of live fish and artificial agents (RoboFish).\nBased on theoretical considerations accounting for inertia and rotational\nfriction, we derive a functional dependence of the turning response of\nindividuals on their instantaneous speed (confirmed by experimental data). We\ninvestigate how the interplay of variable speed and speed-dependent turning\naffects self-organized collective behavior by implementing an agent-based model\nwhich accounts for both effects.

We find that the local coupling\nbetween group polarization and individual speed is strongest at the\norder-disorder transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a decrease in\npolarization with group size for groups of individuals with variable speed, and\na sudden decrease in mean individual speed at a critical group size (N=4 for\nVoronoi interactions) linked to a topological transition from an all-to-all to\na distributed spatial interaction network.

The former is a classic inverse problem that requires the\ninversion of an ill-conditioned matrix while the latter employs the observer\nframework. Combining the two inverse problems leads to our reconstruction\nalgorithm. We emphasise the role played by model selection and its impact on\nalgorithm design and the accuracy of the reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 06:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

Current safety analysis\nmethodologies, such as component fault trees, do not support such vertical\nlayers. Therefore, we present here a methodology that is able to divide safety\nanalysis models into different layers of a systems architecture.

This paper provides a non-trivial extension of the M-R relation by\nincluding the incident flux as an additional variable. By using Bayesian\nhierarchical modeling (BHM) that leverages the flexibility of finite mixture\nmodels, a probabilistic mass-radius-flux relationship (M-R-F relation) is\nobtained based on a sample of 319 exoplanets.

When 15L/min of\npure oxygen flow is not sufficient for the patient, treatment guidelines\nsuggest non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or high-flow nasal\noxygenation (HFNO) as the next stage of treatment. However, administering HFNO\nin the general wards of a low-resource hospital is difficult due to several\nfactors, including difficulty in operation, unavailability of electric power\noutlets, and frequent maintenance.

A basic\npromise of existing PLL solutions is that there are sufficient partial-label\n(PL) samples for training. However, it is more common than not to have just few\nPL samples at hand when dealing with new tasks. Furthermore, existing few-shot\nlearning algorithms assume precise labels of the support set; as such,\nirrelevant labels may seriously mislead the meta-learner and thus lead to a\ncompromised performance. How to enable PLL under a few-shot learning setting is\nan important problem, but not yet well studied. In this paper, we introduce an\napproach called FsPLL (Few-shot PLL). FsPLL first performs adaptive distance\nmetric learning by an embedding network and rectifying prototypes on the tasks\npreviously encountered. Next, it calculates the prototype of each class of a\nnew task in the embedding network. An unseen example can then be classified via\nits distance to each prototype. Experimental results on widely-used few-shot\ndatasets (Omniglot and miniImageNet) demonstrate that our FsPLL can achieve a\nsuperior performance than the state-of-the-art methods across different\nsettings, and it needs fewer samples for quickly adapting to new tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 07:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

Many voice\nconversion approaches rely on the use of a vocoder to reconstruct the speech\nfrom acoustic features, and as a consequence, the speech quality heavily\ndepends on such a vocoder. In this paper, we propose NVC-Net, an end-to-end\nadversarial network, which performs voice conversion directly on the raw audio\nwaveform of arbitrary length. By disentangling the speaker identity from the\nspeech content, NVC-Net is able to perform non-parallel traditional\nmany-to-many voice conversion as well as zero-shot voice conversion from a\nshort utterance of an unseen target speaker.

In this\nwork, we show that although most classical networks have only one stable\nequilibrium at initialisation, learning on tasks that require long-term memory\nonly occurs once the number of network stable equilibria increases; a property\nknown as multistability. Multistability is often not easily attained by\ninitially monostable networks, making learning of long-term dependencies\ndifficult. This insight leads to the design of a novel, general way to\ninitialise any recurrent network connectivity through a procedure called\n\"warmup\" to improve its capability to learn arbitrarily long time dependencies.\nThis initialisation procedure is designed to maximise network reachable\nmultistability, i.e., the number of attractors within the network that can be\nreached through relevant input trajectories.

A subharmonics based approach will lead to unequal\nsampling or weights calculation for subharmonics addition at the low-frequency\nrange and patch normalization factor. We have modified the subharmonics based\napproach by introducing a Gaussian phase autocorrelation matrix that\ncompensates for these shortfalls. We show that the maximum relative error in\nstructure function with respect to theoretical value is as small as 0.5-3% for\n$(G/L_0$) ratio of 1/1000 even for screen sizes up to 100 m diameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 07:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

The key to having good final performance is to\nautomatically extract the important attributes of the data space that are\ninherently relevant to the subsequent decision-making entity, and partition the\ndata space based on these attributes instead of partitioning the data space\nbased on predefined conventional metrics. For this purpose, we formulate the\nframework of decision-making oriented clustering and propose an algorithm\nproviding a decision-based partition of the data space and good representative\ndecisions. By applying this novel framework and algorithm to a typical problem\nof real-time pricing and that of power consumption scheduling, we obtain\nseveral insightful analytical results such as the expression of the best\nrepresentative price profiles for real-time pricing and a very significant\nreduction in terms of required clusters to perform power consumption scheduling\nas shown by our simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 08:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

In this paper, we present a\nbackground-independent formulation of the process matrix formalism - a form of\nquantum mechanics that allows for indefinite causal structure - while retaining\noperationally well-defined measurement statistics. We do this by postulating an\narbitrary probability distribution of measurement outcomes across discrete\n\"chunks\" of spacetime, which we think of as physical laboratories, and then\nrequiring that this distribution be invariant under any permutation of\nlaboratories. We find (a) that one still obtains nontrivial, indefinite causal\nstructures with background independence, (b) that we lose the idea of local\noperations in distinct laboratories, but can recover it by encoding a reference\nframe into the physical states of our system, and (c) that permutation\ninvariance imposes surprising symmetry constraints that, although formally\nsimilar to a superselection rule, cannot be interpreted as such.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 09:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 06:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 07:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Investigation\nof these biases has proved complicated due to the many variables that appear in\nthe experimental setup. Languages vary in many typological dimensions, and it\nis difficult to single out one or two to investigate without the others acting\nas confounders. We propose a novel method for investigating the inductive\nbiases of language models using artificial languages. These languages are\nconstructed to allow us to create parallel corpora across languages that differ\nonly in the typological feature being investigated, such as word order. We then\nuse them to train and test language models. This constitutes a fully controlled\ncausal framework, and demonstrates how grammar engineering can serve as a\nuseful tool for analyzing neural models. Using this method, we find that\ncommonly used neural architectures exhibit different inductive biases: LSTMs\ndisplay little preference with respect to word ordering, while transformers\ndisplay a clear preference for some orderings over others. Further, we find\nthat neither the inductive bias of the LSTM nor that of the transformer appears\nto reflect any tendencies that we see in attested natural languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 09:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

We calibrated\na SBCR for subgiant and dwarf early-type stars. The RMS of the relation is\n$\\sigma_{F_{V_{0}}} = 0.0051\\,$mag, leading to an average precision of 2.3% on\nthe estimation of angular diameters, with 3.1% for $V-K < -0.2\\,$mag and 1.8%\nfor $V-K > -0.2\\,$mag. We found that the conversion between Johnson-$K$ and\n2MASS-$K_s$ photometries is a key issue for early-type stars. Following this\nresult, we have revisited our previous SBCRs for late-type stars by calibrating\nthem with either converted Johnson-$K$ or 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries. We also\nimprove the calibration of these SBCRs based on the Gaia photometry. The\nexpected precision on the angular diameter using our SBCRs for late-type stars\nranges from 1.0% to 2.7%. By reaching a precision of 2.3% on the estimation of\nangular diameters for early-type stars, significant progress has been made to\ndetermine extragalactic distances using early-type eclipsing binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 11:03:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 09:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

We have performed multi-frequency (4-24 GHz) VLBA\nphase-referencing observations of the radio-intermediate quasar III Zw 2 using\nthree nearby calibrators as reference sources to estimate jet magnetic flux by\nmeasuring the core-shift effect. By combining the self-referencing core-shift\nof each calibrator with the phase-referencing core-shifts, we obtained an upper\nlimit of 0.16 mas for the core-shift between 4 and 24 GHz in III Zw 2. By\nassuming equipartition between magnetic and particle energy densities and\nadopting the flux-freezing approximation, we further estimated the upper limit\nfor both magnetic field strength and poloidal magnetic flux threading the black\nhole. We find that the upper limit to the measured magnetic flux is smaller by\nat least a factor of five compared to the value predicted by the magnetically\narrested disk (MAD) model. An alternative way to derive the jet magnetic field\nstrength from the turnover of the synchrotron spectrum leads to an even smaller\nupper limit. Hence, the central engine of III Zw 2 has not reached the MAD\nstate, which could explain why it has failed to develop a powerful jet, even\nthough the source harbours a fast-spinning black hole. However, it generates an\nintermittent jet, which is possibly triggered by small scale magnetic field\nfluctuations as predicted by the magnetic flux paradigm of Sikora & Begelman\n(2013). We propose here that combining black hole spin measurements with\nmagnetic field measurements from the VLBI core-shift observations of AGN over a\nrange of jet powers could provide a strong test for the dominant factor setting\nthe jet power relative to the accretion power available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 11:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

This bound is independent of the dimension\nof the original data representation, and explains the in-built regularisation\neffect of the compressive approach. We then instantiate this general bound to\nclassification and regression tasks, considering Johnson-Lindenstrauss mappings\nas the compression scheme. For each of these tasks, our strategy is to develop\na tight upper bound on the compressibility function, and by doing so we\ndiscover distributional conditions of geometric nature under which the\ncompressive algorithm attains minimax-optimal rates up to at most\npoly-logarithmic factors. In the case of compressive classification, this is\nachieved with a mild geometric margin condition along with a flexible moment\ncondition that is significantly more general than the assumption of bounded\ndomain. In the case of regression with strongly convex smooth loss functions we\nfind that compressive regression is capable of exploiting spectral decay with\nnear-optimal guarantees.

We found that all models provide significantly better predictions\nwith VBM images than quasi-raw data. This finding evolved as the training set\napproaches 10k samples where quasi-raw data almost reach the performance of\nVBM. Moreover, we showed that linear models perform comparably with SOTA CNN on\nVBM data.

Here, we introduce a complete overhaul of semopy that\nimproves upon the previous results and comes with lots of new capabilities.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel SEM model that combines in itself a notion of\nrandom effects from linear mixed models (LMMs) to model numerous phenomena,\nsuch as spatial data, time series or population stratification in genetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 13:18:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 10:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 17:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Here, we introduce a new variation of constrained DFT\n(CDFT), wherein the constraint corresponds to a particular transition (T), or\ncombination of transitions, between occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than\na region of the simulation space as in traditional CDFT. We compare T-CDFT with\nTDDFT and $\\Delta$SCF results for the low lying excited states (S$_{1}$ and\nT$_{1}$) of a set of gas phase acene molecules and OLED emitters, as well as\nwith reference results from the literature. At the PBE level of theory, T-CDFT\noutperforms $\\Delta$SCF for both classes of molecules, while also proving to be\nmore robust. For the local excitations seen in the acenes, T-CDFT and TDDFT\nperform equally well. For the charge-transfer (CT)-like excitations seen in the\nOLED molecules, T-CDFT also performs well, in contrast to the severe energy\nunderestimation seen with TDDFT. In other words, T-CDFT is equally applicable\nto both local excitations and CT states, providing more reliable excitation\nenergies at a much lower computational cost than TDDFT. T-CDFT is designed for\nlarge systems and has been implemented in the linear scaling BigDFT code.

Canonical PSO hyperparameters are first tuned to\nprioritize exploration in early phase and exploitation in late phase. Next, a\ntwo-stage multi-swarm PSO (2SPSO) is used where multiple-swarms of the first\nstage collapse into a single swarm in the second stage. Finally, MS2PSO with\nmultiple stages and multiple swarms is used in which swarms recursively\ncollapse after each stage. Multiple swarm strategy ensures that diversity is\nretained within the population and multiple modes are explored. Staging ensures\nthat local optima found during initial stage does not lead to premature\nconvergence. Optimization test case comprises of 90 control variables and a\ntwenty year period of flow simulation. It is observed that different algorithm\ndesigns have their own benefits and drawbacks. Multiple swarms and stages help\nalgorithm to move away from local optima, but at the same time they may also\nnecessitate larger number of iterations for convergence.

To the best of our knowledge, no\nexisting model has the ability to take inputs from varying modalities, e.g.\nimages or sounds, and classify them into unified music categories. We explore\nthe use of cross-modal retrieval as a pretext task to learn modality-agnostic\nrepresentations, which can then be used as inputs to classifiers that are\nindependent of modality.

It is natural to\nhypothesize that small datasets in RL necessitate simple models to avoid\noverfitting; however, this hypothesis is untested. In this paper we investigate\nhow RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern\nnetworks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on\nactor-critic algorithms. We empirically verify that naively adopting such\narchitectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing\nto the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset\nsize is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that instability from taking\ngradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that spectral\nnormalization (SN) can mitigate this issue and enable stable training with\nlarge modern architectures.

Dynamical and turbulent motions of gas in a protoplanetary disk are\ncrucial for their evolution and affect planet formation. Recent observations\nsuggest weak turbulence in the disk's outer regions. However, the physical\nmechanism of turbulence in these outer regions remains uncertain. The vertical\nshear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to produce turbulence in\ndisks. Aims. Our aim is to study the observability of the gas velocity\nstructure produced by the VSI via CO kinematics with ALMA. Methods. We perform\nglobal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a VSI-unstable disk. We post-process\nthe simulation results with radiative transfer calculations, and produce\nsynthetic predictions of CO rotational emission lines. Following, we compute\nthe line of sight velocity map, and its deviations from a sub-Keplerian\nequilibrium solution. We explore the detectability of the VSI by identifying\nkinematic signatures using realistic simulated observations. Results. Our 3D\nsimulations of the VSI show the steady state dynamics of the gas in great\ndetail. From the velocity structure we infer a turbulent stress value of\n$\\alpha_{r\\phi}=1.4 \\times 10^{-4}$. On large scales, we observe velocity\ndeviations of 50 m s$^{-1}$ as axisymmetric rings. We find optimal conditions\nat $i \\lesssim 20^{\\circ}$ to trace for the kinematic structures of the VSI. We\nfound that current diagnostics to constrain gas turbulence from non-thermal\nbroadening of the line emission are not applicable to anisotropic VSI\nturbulence. Conclusions. The detection of kinematic signatures produced by the\nVSI is possible with ALMA. Observations including an extended antenna\nconfiguration combined with the highest spectral resolution available are\nneeded for robust detection. The characterization of the large-scale velocity\nperturbations is required to constrain the turbulence level produced by the VSI\nfrom gas observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 13:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

ImVoxelNet successfully\nhandles both indoor and outdoor scenes, which makes it general-purpose.\nSpecifically, it achieves state-of-the-art results in car detection on KITTI\n(monocular) and nuScenes (multi-view) benchmarks among all methods that accept\nRGB images. Moreover, it surpasses existing RGB-based 3D object detection\nmethods on the SUN RGB-D dataset. On ScanNet, ImVoxelNet sets a new benchmark\nfor multi-view 3D object detection. The source code and the trained models are\navailable at https://github.com/saic-vul/imvoxelnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 14:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:25:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 12:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

Our results apply to ``policy-rich\" protocols, by which we mean protocols\nthat can have complex policies (e.g. conditional route transformations) that\nviolate traditional assumptions made in the standard presentation of\nBellman-Ford protocols.\n  First, we propose a new algebraic model for abstract routing problems which\nhas fewer primitives than previous models and can represent more expressive\npolicy languages. The new model is also the first to allow concurrent reasoning\nabout distance-vector and path-vector protocols.\n  Second, we demonstrate how DBF routing protocols are instances of a larger\nclass of asynchronous iterative algorithms, for which there already exist\npowerful results about convergence. These results allow us to build upon\nconditions previously shown by Sobrinho to be sufficient and necessary for the\nconvergence of path-vector protocols and strengthen them: we show that, with a\nminor modification, they also apply to distance-vector protocols; we prove they\nguarantee that the final routing solution reached is unique, thereby\neliminating the possibility of anomalies such as BGP wedgies; we relax the\nmodel of asynchronous communication, showing that the results still hold if\nrouting messages can be lost, reordered, and duplicated.\n  Thirdly, our model and our accompanying theoretical results have been fully\nformalised in the Agda theorem prover. The resulting library is a powerful tool\nfor quickly prototyping and formally verifying new policy languages. As an\nexample, we formally verify the correctness of a policy language with many of\nthe features of BGP including communities, conditional policy, path-inflation\nand route filtering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 14:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 07:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

The season was marked by severely\nanomalous rainfall trends, with upto 150 mm of departures from the mean daily\nprecipitation in the northern districts of the State. Although, there were many\nstudies about the hydrogeological factors which aggravated the floods in\nKerala, no attempt was made to delve into the physics which actually resulted\nin anomalous precipitation during the year. This study intends to document the\ndynamical phenomenon which caused the Kerala Floods of 2018. The westward\npropagating convectively-coupled Mixed Rossby-Gravity (MRG) waves were excited\nby the synoptic disturbances of the tropical Pacific at the pressure level of\n700 hPa, during the Indian Monsoon of 2018.

Before questioning whether the $S_8$ discrepancy calls for new\nphysics, it is important to assess the view of measurements other than CMB and\nWL ones on the discrepancy. Here, we examine the role of measurements of the\ngrowth rate $f(z)$ in arbitrating the $S_8$ discrepancy, considering\nmeasurements of $f\\sigma_8(z)$ from Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD). Our\nbaseline analysis combines RSD measurements with geometrical measurements from\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa), given the\nkey role of the latter in constraining $\\Omega_m$. From this combination and\nwithin the $\\Lambda$CDM model we find $S_8 = 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.025}$, and\nquantify the agreement between RSD+BAO+SNeIa and \\textit{Planck} to be at the\n$2.2\\sigma$ level: the mild disagreement is therefore compatible with a\nstatistical fluctuation. We discuss combinations of RSD measurements with other\ndatasets, including the $E_G$ statistic. This combination increases the\ndiscrepancy with \\textit{Planck}, but we deem it significantly less robust. Our\nearlier results are stable against an extension where we allow the dark energy\nequation of state $w$ to vary. We conclude that, from the point of view of\ncombined growth rate and geometrical measurements, there are hints, but no\nstrong evidence yet, for the \\textit{Planck} $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology\nover-predicting the amplitude of matter fluctuations at redshifts $z \\lesssim\n1$.

Here, we investigate the controllability and\nvisualization of the coherent phonon transport in a periodic MoS2/MoSe2 arrayed\nheterostructure with minimum lattice mismatching using non-equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the coherent phonon transport\ncan be destroyed and rebuilt through adjusting the density of MoSe2 nanodot\narrays.

In the case of low-mass (<8 Msun) protostars, strong\nobservational evidence exists that the launching and collimation is due to the\nX- and/or disk-wind mechanisms. In these models, it is the protostar/disk\nsystem that creates all the necessary conditions to launch and collimate the\njets near the protostar via strong magnetic fields. The origin of jets from\nmore massive protostars has been investigated much less, in part because of the\ndifficulty of resolving the collimation zone in these more distant objects.\nHere we present the highest angular resolution observations of a jet powered by\na massive protostar, the Cep A HW2 radio jet. We imaged the radio emission at\nprojected distances of only ~20 au from the protostar, resolving the innermost\n100 au of a massive protostellar jet for the first time. The morphology of the\nradio jet emission in this massive object is very different than what is\nusually observed in jets from low-mass protostars. We found that the outflowing\nmaterial in HW2 has two components: a wide-angle wind launched from the\nprotostar/disk system, and a highly collimated jet starting at 20-30 au from\nthe protostar. We discuss two possible scenarios: an extension of the classical\ndisk-wind to a massive protostar, or external collimation of a wide-angle wind.\nThese results have important consequences for our understanding of how stars of\ndifferent masses are formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 15:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Due to the decentralized nature of most\ncryptocurrencies, no entity can revert those operations. This is a central\nchallenge for decentralized systems, illustrated by numerous high-profile\nheists. Vault contracts reduce this risk by introducing artificial delay on\noperations, allowing abortion by the contract owner during the delay. However,\nthe theft of a key still renders the vault unusable and puts funds at risk.\n  We introduce Phoenix, a novel contract architecture that allows the user to\nrestore its security properties after key loss. Phoenix takes advantage of\nusers' ability to store keys in easily-available but less secure storage\n(tier-two) as well as more secure storage that is harder to access (tier-one).\nUnlike previous solutions, the user can restore Phoenix security after the\ntheft of tier-two keys and does not lose funds despite losing keys in either\ntier. Phoenix also introduces a mechanism to reduce the damage an attacker can\ncause in case of a tier-one compromise.\n  We formally specify Phoenix's required behavior and provide a prototype\nimplementation of Phoenix as an Ethereum contract. Since such an implementation\nis highly sensitive and vulnerable to subtle bugs, we apply a formal\nverification tool to prove specific code properties and identify faults.

A limitation\nof this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently\nlong time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian.

In this article, we carried out a systematic study on the\nHe star donor channel, in which a neutron star (NS) accretes matter from a He\nmain-sequence star through Roche-lobe overflow, where the mass-transfer is\ndriven by gravitational wave radiation. Firstly, we followed the long-term\nevolution of the NS+He main-sequence star binaries by employing the stellar\nevolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, and thereby\nobtained the initial parameter spaces for the production of UCXBs. We then used\nthese results to perform a detailed binary population synthesis approach to\nobtain the Galactic rates of UCXBs through this channel. We estimate the\nGalactic rates of UCXBs appearing as LISA sources to be $\\sim3.1-11.9\\, \\rm\nMyr^{-1}$ through this channel, and the number of such UCXB-LISA sources in the\nGalaxy can reach about $1-26$ calibrated by observations.

This study aims to investigate the use of deep\nlearning techniques to explore computer-aid diagnosis based on MRI as input.\nSeveral diagnosis problems ranging from classification of lesions as being\nclinically significant or not to the detection and segmentation of lesions are\naddressed with deep learning based approaches.\n  This thesis tackled two main problems regarding the diagnosis of prostate\ncancer. Firstly, XmasNet was used to conduct two large experiments on the\nclassification of lesions. Secondly, detection and segmentation experiments\nwere conducted, first on the prostate and afterward on the prostate cancer\nlesions. The former experiments explored the lesions through a two-dimensional\nspace, while the latter explored models to work with three-dimensional inputs.\nFor this task, the 3D models explored were the 3D U-Net and a pretrained 3D\nResNet-18. A rigorous analysis of all these problems was conducted with a total\nof two networks, two cropping techniques, two resampling techniques, two crop\nsizes, five input sizes and data augmentations experimented for lesion\nclassification.

The Pareto front reports the\noptimal trade-offs between competing objectives. Here we report a self-driving\nlaboratory, \"Ada\", that defines the Pareto front of conductivities and\nprocessing temperatures for palladium films formed by combustion synthesis. Ada\nidentified previously untested combustion synthesis conditions that resulted in\nthe discovery of lower processing temperatures (below 200 {\\deg}C) relative to\nthe prior art for this technique (250 {\\deg}C), a temperature difference that\nmakes the coating of different commodity plastic materials possible (e.g.,\nNafion, polyethersulfone). These conditions enabled us to use combustion\nsynthesis to spray coat uniform palladium films with moderate conductivity (1.1\n$\\times$ 10$^5$ S m$^{-1}$) at 191 {\\deg}C. Spray coating at 226 {\\deg}C\nyielded films with conductivities (2.0 $\\times$ 10$^6$ S m$^{-1}$) comparable\nto those of sputtered films (2.0 to 5.8 $\\times$ 10$^6$ S m$^{-1}$).

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown great\nsuccesses for this task, overtaking classical methods based on fixed molecular\nkernels. However, they still appear very limited from a theoretical\nperspective, since regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs. In\nthis work we close this gap between theory and practice. We show that GNNs with\ndirected edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal\napproximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and\nequivariant to permutation and rotation. We then leverage these insights and\nmultiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing\nneural network (GemNet). We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed changes in\nmultiple ablation studies. GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL,\nMD17, and OC20 datasets by 34%, 41%, and 20%, respectively, and performs\nespecially well on the most challenging molecules.

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing\ncurricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are\nexpanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12\ncomputing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of\nsuch systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and\nteachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational\nthinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula,\nunderstanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an\neven more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the\ncentral position of machine learning in the field of modern computing, the\ncomputing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies\nof how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning\nsystems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article\ncharts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and\ntechnology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article\nsituates the existing work in the context of computing education in general,\nand describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into\naccount when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the\nparadigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine\nlearning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is\nabandoning the belief that rule-based \"traditional\" programming is a central\naspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 10:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}
