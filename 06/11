We use POLARIS\nto calculate the dust grain temperatures and the local UV flux. We model the\nchemistry using the 3-phase astrochemical code NAUTILUS. Photoprocesses are\nhandled using frequency-dependent cross-sections, and a new method to account\nfor self and mutual shielding. The multi-grain model outputs are compared to\nthose of single-grain size models (0.1 $\\mu$m), with two different assumptions\nfor their equivalent temperature. We find that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH)\nmechanism at equilibrium temperature is not efficient to form H$_2$ at 3-4\nscale heights ($H$), and adopt a parametric fit to a stochastic method to model\nH$_2$ formation instead. We find the molecular layer composition (1-3 $H$) to\ndepend on the amount of remaining H atoms. Differences in molecular surface\ndensities between single and multi-grain models are mostly due to what occurs\nabove 1.5 $H$. At 100 au, models with colder grains produce H$_2$O and CH$_4$\nices in the midplane, and warmer ones produce more CO$_2$ ices, both allowing\nefficient depletion of C and O as soon as CO sticks on grain surfaces. Complex\norganic molecules (COMs) production is enhanced by the presence of warmer\ngrains in the multi-grain models. Using a single grain model mimicking grain\ngrowth and dust settling fails to reproduce the complexity of gas-grain\nchemistry. Chemical models with a single grain size are sensitive to the\nadopted grain temperature, and cannot account for all expected effects. A\nspatial spread of the snowlines is expected to result from the ranges in grain\ntemperature.

In particular, we demonstrate that the elementary\nexcitations of the homogeneous superfluid with enhanced periodic modulations\nare phonons, find the central charge to be $c=1$, and show that the velocity of\nsound, extracted from the intrinsic level splitting for finite systems, matches\nwith the propagation velocity of local excitations in dynamical simulations.\nThis suggests that the low-energy spectrum of the phase under investigation is\neffectively captured by a spinless Luttinger liquid, for which we find\nconsistent results between the Luttinger parameter obtained from the linear\ndependence of the structure factor and the algebraic decay of the one-body\ndensity matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 16:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 10:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

In\ncontrast, expert radiologists first locate the prominent anatomical structures\nbefore determining if those regions are anomalous. Therefore, integrating\nanatomical knowledge within deep learning models could bring substantial\nimprovement in automatic disease classification. Motivated by this, we propose\nAnatomy-XNet, an anatomy-aware attention-based thoracic disease classification\nnetwork that prioritizes the spatial features guided by the pre-identified\nanatomy regions. We adopt a semi-supervised learning method by utilizing\navailable small-scale organ-level annotations to locate the anatomy regions in\nlarge-scale datasets where the organ-level annotations are absent.

Here, we propose the Latent Score-based\nGenerative Model (LSGM), a novel approach that trains SGMs in a latent space,\nrelying on the variational autoencoder framework. Moving from data to latent\nspace allows us to train more expressive generative models, apply SGMs to\nnon-continuous data, and learn smoother SGMs in a smaller space, resulting in\nfewer network evaluations and faster sampling. To enable training LSGMs\nend-to-end in a scalable and stable manner, we (i) introduce a new\nscore-matching objective suitable to the LSGM setting, (ii) propose a novel\nparameterization of the score function that allows SGM to focus on the mismatch\nof the target distribution with respect to a simple Normal one, and (iii)\nanalytically derive multiple techniques for variance reduction of the training\nobjective.

The resultant \"knot basis\"\nelectromagnetic field configurations have non-trivial topology in that their\nfield lines form closed knots. We consider finite, complex linear combinations\nof these knot-basis solutions for a fixed spin $j$ and compute all the $15$\nconserved Noether charges associated with the conformal group. We find that the\nscalar charges either vanish or are proportional to the energy. For the\nnon-vanishing vector charges, we find a nice geometric structure that\nfacilitates computation of their spherical components as well. We present\nanalytic results for all charges for up to $j{=}1$. We demonstrate possible\napplications of our findings through some known previous results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 17:48:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 19:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 13:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

To\nachieve this, our model makes two approximations to the full space-time\nattention used in Video Transformers: (a) It restricts time attention to a\nlocal temporal window and capitalizes on the Transformer's depth to obtain full\ntemporal coverage of the video sequence. (b) It uses efficient space-time\nmixing to attend jointly spatial and temporal locations without inducing any\nadditional cost on top of a spatial-only attention model. We also show how to\nintegrate 2 very lightweight mechanisms for global temporal-only attention\nwhich provide additional accuracy improvements at minimal computational cost.\nWe demonstrate that our model produces very high recognition accuracy on the\nmost popular video recognition datasets while at the same time being\nsignificantly more efficient than other Video Transformer models. Code will be\nmade available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 17:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

In doing this, BPS disregards the integral role\nlate-stage evolution plays in determining the final fate, remnant type, and\nremnant mass within the neutrino-driven explosion paradigm. To highlight\ndifferences between a popular prescription which relies only on the core and\nfinal stellar mass and emerging methods which rely on a star's presupernova\ncore structure, we generate a series of compact object distributions using\nthree different methods for a sample population of single and binary stars\ncomputed in BPASS.

The second method uses the\npresupernova core structure based on the bare CO-core models of \\citet{Pat20}\ncombined with a parameterized explosion criterion to first determine final fate\nand remnant type, then remnant mass. The third method associates presupernova\nhelium-core masses with remnant masses determined from public explosion models\nwhich rely implicitly on core structure. We find that the core-/final\nmass-based prescription favors lower mass remnants, including a large\npopulation of mass gap black holes, and predicts neutron star masses which span\na wide range, whereas the structure-based prescriptions favor slightly higher\nmass remnants, mass gap black holes only as low as 3.5 \\Msun, and predict\nneutron star mass distributions which cluster in a narrow range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In this work we investigate LISA's sensitivity\nto the thermodynamic parameters encoded in the stochastic background produced\nby a phase transition, using the sound shell model to characterise the\ngravitational wave power spectrum, and the Fisher matrix to estimate\nuncertainties. We explore a parameter space with transition strengths $\\alpha <\n0.5$ and phase boundary speeds $0.4 < v_\\text{w} < 0.9$, for transitions\nnucleating at $T_{\\text{N}} = 100$ GeV, with mean bubble spacings $0.1$ and\n$0.01$ of the Hubble length, and sound speed $c/\\sqrt{3}$.

Determinations of the underlying thermodynamic\nparameters are complicated by degeneracies, but in all cases the phase boundary\nspeed will be the best constrained parameter. Turning to the principal\ncomponents of the Fisher matrix, a signal-to-noise ratio above 20 produces a\nrelative uncertainty less than 3% in the two highest-order principal\ncomponents, indicating good prospects for combinations of parameters. The\nhighest-order principal component is dominated by the wall speed.

Using a nonperturbative Green function approach, we\ncharacterize the nonequilibrium current distribution in different parameter\nregimes. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, we find chiral edge currents\nthat are robust against coupling to reservoirs and to the presence of defects\non the boundary or in the bulk. This robustness not only originates from\ntopological effects at zero temperature but, remarkably, also persists as a\nresult of dissipative symmetries in regimes where band topology plays no role.\nChirality of the edge currents implies that energy locally flows against the\ntemperature gradient without any external work input. In the fermionic case,\nthere is also a regime with topologically protected boundary currents, which\nnonetheless do not circulate around all system edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 18:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 08:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

At the\ncore of our approach is the fact that an RL process does not just learn a\npolicy, a mapping from states to actions, but also produces extra\nmeta-information, such as action values indicating the quality of alternative\nactions. This meta-information can indicate whether more than one action is\nnear-optimal for a certain state. We extend CN2 to make it able to leverage\nknowledge about equally-good actions to distill the policy into fewer rules,\nincreasing its interpretability by a person. Then, to ensure that the rules\nexplain a valid, non-degenerate policy, we introduce a refinement algorithm\nthat fine-tunes the rules to obtain good performance when executed in the\nenvironment.

A major\ncomplication in comparison to flat spaces is that it is unclear in which\nalignment a convolution kernel should be applied on a manifold. The underlying\nreason for this ambiguity is that general manifolds do not come with a\ncanonical choice of reference frames (gauge). Kernels and features therefore\nhave to be expressed relative to arbitrary coordinates. We argue that the\nparticular choice of coordinatization should not affect a network's inference\n-- it should be coordinate independent. A simultaneous demand for coordinate\nindependence and weight sharing is shown to result in a requirement on the\nnetwork to be equivariant under local gauge transformations (changes of local\nreference frames). The ambiguity of reference frames depends thereby on the\nG-structure of the manifold, such that the necessary level of gauge\nequivariance is prescribed by the corresponding structure group G. Coordinate\nindependent convolutions are proven to be equivariant w.r.t. those isometries\nthat are symmetries of the G-structure. The resulting theory is formulated in a\ncoordinate free fashion in terms of fiber bundles. To exemplify the design of\ncoordinate independent convolutions, we implement a convolutional network on\nthe M\\\"obius strip.

A simple folklore algorithm can output a 2-approximation to\nthe diameter in linear time by running BFS from an arbitrary vertex. It has\nbeen open whether a better approximation is possible in near-linear time. A\nseries of papers on fine-grained complexity have led to strong hardness results\nfor diameter in directed graphs, culminating in a recent tradeoff curve\nindependently discovered by [Li, STOC'21] and [Dalirrooyfard and Wein,\nSTOC'21], showing that under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for\nany integer $k\\ge 2$ and $\\delta>0$, a $2-\\frac{1}{k}-\\delta$ approximation for\ndiameter in directed $m$-edge graphs requires $mn^{1+1/(k-1)-o(1)}$ time.

Recent efforts combine it\nwith another l_infty imperceptible on the perturbation magnitudes. The\nresultant sparse and imperceptible attacks are practically relevant, and\nindicate an even higher vulnerability of DNNs that we usually imagined.\nHowever, such attacks are more challenging to generate due to the optimization\ndifficulty by coupling the l_0 regularizer and box constraints with a\nnon-convex objective. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a\nhomotopy algorithm, to jointly tackle the sparsity and the perturbation bound\nin one unified framework. Each iteration, the main step of our algorithm is to\noptimize an l_0-regularized adversarial loss, by leveraging the nonmonotone\nAccelerated Proximal Gradient Method (nmAPG) for nonconvex programming; it is\nfollowed by an l_0 change control step, and an optional post-attack step\ndesigned to escape bad local minima.

Such modeling arises whenever certain components of a\nstochastic model are stochastically determined by other models. There are at\nleast two main areas of applications, including (1) portfolio risk management\nin the banking sector and (2) principle-based reserving and capital\nrequirements in the insurance sector. As financial instrument values often\nchange with economic fundamentals, the risk management of a portfolio (outer\nloop) often requires the assessment of financial positions subject to changes\nin risk factors in the immediate future. The valuation of financial position\n(inner loop) is based on projections of cashflows and risk factors into the\ndistant future. The nesting of such stochastic modeling can be computationally\nchallenging.\n  Most of existing techniques to speed up nested simulations are based on curve\nfitting. The main idea is to establish a functional relationship between inner\nloop estimator and risk factors by running a limited set of economic scenarios,\nand, instead of running inner loop simulations, inner loop estimations are made\nby feeding other scenarios into the fitted curve. This paper presents a\nnon-conventional approach based on the concept of sample recycling. Its essence\nis to run inner loop estimation for a small set of outer loop scenarios and to\nfind inner loop estimates under other outer loop scenarios by recycling those\nknown inner loop paths. This new approach can be much more efficient when\ntraditional techniques are difficult to implement in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 20:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Our approach is optimal when theoretical frameworks or previous\nempirical data are impoverished.

HIT extracts the\nstructural representation of a node triplet of interest on the temporal\nhypergraph and uses it to tell what type of, when, and why the interaction\nexpansion could happen in this triplet. HIT could achieve significant\nimprovement (averaged 20% AUC gain to identify the interaction type, uniformly\nmore accurate time estimation) compared to both heuristic and other\nneural-network-based baselines on 5 real-world large temporal hypergraphs.\nMoreover, HIT provides a certain degree of interpretability by identifying the\nmost discriminatory structural features on the temporal hypergraphs for\npredicting different higher-order patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 20:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 19:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Each AP has an antenna array.\nIn previous studies, the DAS has been demonstrated great potential to improve\ncapacity and power efficiency compared to a centralized antenna system (CAS)\nwhich has all the antennas located in one place. The existing research also has\nshown that the placement of the APs is essential for the performance of the\nDAS. However, most research on AP placement does not take into account\nrealistic constraints. For instance, they assume that APs can be placed at any\nlocation in a region or the array radiation pattern of each AP is isotropic.\nThis paper focuses on optimizing the AP placement for the DAS with massive MIMO\n(D-mMIMO) in order to reduce the transmit power. A square topology for the AP\nplacement is applied, which is reasonable for deploying the D-mMIMO in urban\nareas while also offering theoretically interesting insights. We investigate\nthe impact of the radiation pattern, signal coherence, and region size on the\nD-mMIMO's performance. Our results suggest that i) among the three factors, the\narray radiation pattern of each AP is the most important one in determining the\noptimal AP placement for the D-mMIMO; ii) the performance of the D-mMIMO is\nhighly impacted by the placement and array radiation pattern of each AP, the\nD-mMIMO with unoptimized placement may perform even worse than the CAS with\nmassive MIMO (C-mMIMO); iii) with the consideration of patch antennas and the\nmutual coupling effect, the optimized D-mMIMO can potentially save more than 7\ndB transmit power compared to the C-mMIMO.

The standard 2-choice process corresponds to the case of $G=K_n$.\n  For any $k(n)$-edge-connected, $d(n)$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, and any\nnumber of balls, we give an allocation strategy that, with high probability,\nensures a gap of $O((d/k) \\log^4\\hspace{-1pt}n \\log \\log n)$, between the load\nof any two bins.

Our study shows how dilatometry can be\nused to unveil Weyl fermions in candidate topological semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 21:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 12:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Lexicase selection, by contrast, selects on the basis of performance on\nrandom sequences of training cases; this has been shown to enhance\nproblem-solving power in many circumstances. Lexicase selection can also be\nseen as better reflecting biological evolution, by modeling sequences of\nchallenges that organisms face over their lifetimes. Recent work has\ndemonstrated that the advantages of lexicase selection can be amplified by\ndown-sampling, meaning that only a random subsample of the training cases is\nused each generation. This can be seen as modeling the fact that individual\norganisms encounter only subsets of the possible environments, and that\nenvironments change over time. Here we provide the most extensive benchmarking\nof down-sampled lexicase selection to date, showing that its benefits hold up\nto increased scrutiny. The reasons that down-sampling helps, however, are not\nyet fully understood. Hypotheses include that down-sampling allows for more\ngenerations to be processed with the same budget of program evaluations; that\nthe variation of training data across generations acts as a changing\nenvironment, encouraging adaptation; or that it reduces overfitting, leading to\nmore general solutions. We systematically evaluate these hypotheses, finding\nevidence against all three, and instead draw the conclusion that down-sampled\nlexicase selection's main benefit stems from the fact that it allows the\nevolutionary process to examine more individuals within the same computational\nbudget, even though each individual is examined less completely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 23:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

However, many deep neural networks have\nmillions or billions of parameters, making them untenable for real-world\napplications due to constraints on memory size or latency requirements. As a\nresult, efficient network compression techniques are often required for the\nwidespread adoption of deep learning methods. We present DECORE, a\nreinforcement learning-based approach to automate the network compression\nprocess. DECORE assigns an agent to each channel in the network along with a\nlight policy gradient method to learn which neurons or channels to be kept or\nremoved. Each agent in the network has just one parameter (keep or drop) to\nlearn, which leads to a much faster training process compared to existing\napproaches. DECORE provides state-of-the-art compression results on various\nnetwork architectures and various datasets. For example, on the ResNet-110\narchitecture, it achieves a 64.8% compression and 61.8% FLOPs reduction as\ncompared to the baseline model without any accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10\ndataset. It can reduce the size of regular architectures like the VGG network\nby up to 99% with just a small accuracy drop of 2.28%. For a larger dataset\nlike ImageNet with just 30 epochs of training, it can compress the ResNet-50\narchitecture by 44.7% and reduce FLOPs by 42.3%, with just a 0.69% drop on\nTop-5 accuracy of the uncompressed model.

The skyrmion behavior is determined by the ratio of the damping and\nMagnus terms, as expressed in terms of the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. For a\nfixed driving force in the damping dominated regime, the effective viscosity\ndecreases monotonically with increasing skyrmion density, similar to what is\nobserved in overdamped systems where it becomes difficult for the driven\nparticle to traverse the surrounding medium at high densities. In contrast, in\nthe Magnus dominated regime the velocity dependence on the density is\nnonmonotonic, and there is a regime in which the skyrmion moves faster with\nincreasing density, as well as a pronounced speed-up effect in which a skyrmion\ntraveling through a dense medium moves more rapidly than it would at low\ndensities or in the single particle limit. At higher densities, the effective\ndamping increases and the velocity decreases. The velocity-force curves in the\nMagnus-dominated regime show marked differences from those in the\ndamping-dominated regimes. Under an increasing drive we find that there is a\nthreshold force for skyrmion motion which increases with density. Additionally,\nthe skyrmion Hall angle is drive dependent, starting near zero at the threshold\nfor motion and increasing with increasing drive before reaching a saturation\nvalue, similar to the behavior found for skyrmions driven over quenched\ndisorder. We map dynamic phase diagrams showing the threshold for motion,\nnonlinear flow, speed-up, and saturation regimes.

For example, the behaviour of Si under high pressure, in particular at\nthe ultra-high strain rates characteristic of dynamic compression, has been a\nmatter of debate for decades. A detailed understanding of how Si deforms is\ncrucial for a variety of fields, ranging from planetary science to materials\ndesign. Simulations suggest that in Si the shear stress generated during shock\ncompression is released inelastically, i.e., via a high-pressure phase\ntransition, challenging the classical picture of relaxation via defect-mediated\nplasticity.

When in\nclose proximity undulatory motion can lead to novel collective behaviors such\nas gait synchronization, spatial reconfiguration, and clustering. Here we study\nthe role of contact interactions between model undulatory swimmers: three-link\nrobots in experiment and multi-link robots in simulation. The undulatory gait\nof each swimmer is generated through a time-dependent sinusoidal-like waveform\nwhich has a fixed phase offset, $\\phi$. By varying the phase relationship\nbetween neighboring swimmers we seek to study how contact forces and spatial\nconfigurations are governed by the phase difference between neighboring\nswimmers. We find that undulatory actuation in close proximity drives\nneighboring swimmers into spatial equilibrium configurations that depend on the\nactuation phase difference. We propose a model for spatial equilibrium of\nnearest neighbor undulatory swimmers which we call the gait compatibility\ncondition, which is the set of spatial and gait configurations in which no\ncollisions occur. Robotic experiments with two, three, and four swimmers\nexhibit good agreement with the compatibility model. To probe the interaction\npotential between undulatory swimmers we perturb the each longitudinally from\ntheir equilibrium configurations and we measure their steady-state\ndisplacement. These studies reveal that undulatory swimmers in close proximity\nexhibit cohesive longitudinal interaction forces that drive the swimmers from\nincompatible to compatible configurations. This system of undulatory swimmers\nprovides new insight into active-matter systems which move through body\nundulation. In addition to the importance of velocity and orientation coherence\nin active-matter swarms, we demonstrate that undulatory phase coherence is also\nimportant for generating stable, cohesive group configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 02:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep\nlearning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most\nof these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and\nstandard clustering together. However, the separation of representation\nlearning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage\nstrategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks\n(e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts\nhave been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster\nassignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically\nconstructed objectives with representation and cluster assignment alternatively\noptimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously\nformulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue\nfor cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep\nclustering framework which radically integrates representation learning and\nclustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework\nexploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for\nlearning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the\ndistribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm.\nExperimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is\nsuperior, or at least comparable to, the state-of-the-art methods on the\nhandwritten digit recognition, fashion recognition, face recognition and object\nrecognition benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 04:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Significant progress on this problem has been\nmade on the mathematical modelling side of unbalanced OPF, however there is a\nlack of information on implementation aspects as well as data sets for\nbenchmarking. One of the key problems is the lack of definitions of current and\nvoltage bounds across different classes of representations of the power flow\nequations. Therefore, this tutorial-style paper summarizes the structural\nfeatures of the unbalanced (optimal) power problem for three-phase systems. The\nresulting nonlinear complex-value matrix formulations are presented for both\nthe bus injection and branch flow formulation frameworks, which typically\ncannot be implemented as-is in optimization toolboxes. Therefore, this paper\nalso derives the equivalent real-value formulations, and discusses challenges\nrelated to the implementation in optimization modeling toolboxes.

As the most commonly used reconciliation protocol in\nshort-distance CV-QKD, the slice error correction (SEC) allows a system to\ndistill more than 1 bit from each pulse. However, its quantization efficiency\nis greatly affected by the noisy channel with a low signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), which usually limits the secure distance to about 30 km. In this paper,\nan improved SEC protocol, named Rotation-based SEC (RSEC), is proposed through\nperforming a random orthogonal rotation on the raw data before quantization,\nand deducing a new estimator for quantized sequences. Moreover, the RSEC\nprotocol is implemented with polar codes. Experimental results show that the\nproposed protocol can reach up to a quantization efficiency of about 99\\%, and\nmaintains at around 96\\% even at the relatively low SNRs $(0.5,1)$, which\ntheoretically extends the secure distance to about 45 km. When implemented with\nthe polar codes with block length of 16 Mb, the RSEC can achieve a\nreconciliation efficiency of above 95\\%, which outperforms all previous SEC\nschemes. In terms of finite-size effects, we achieve a secret key rate of\n$7.83\\times10^{-3}$ bits/pulse at a distance of 33.93 km (the corresponding SNR\nvalue is 1). These results indicate that the proposed protocol significantly\nimproves the performance of SEC and is a competitive reconciliation scheme for\nthe CV-QKD system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 12:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

At the same time, the only rotating solution\navailable in the literature for dynamical CS (dCS) gravity is the slow-rotating\ncase most accurately known to quadratic order in spin. In this work, for the\nslow-rotating case (accurate to first order in spin), we derive the linear\nperturbation equations governing the metric and the dCS field accurate to\nlinear order in spin and quadratic order in the CS coupling parameter\n($\\alpha$) and obtain the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies.

We show that SLUCB-QVI and RSLUCB-QVI, while with \\emph{no\nsafety violation}, achieve a\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\kappa\\sqrt{d^3H^3T}\\right)$ regret, nearly matching\nthat of state-of-the-art unsafe algorithms, where $H$ is the duration of each\nepisode, $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $\\kappa$ is a constant\ncharacterizing the safety constraints, and $T$ is the total number of action\nplays. We further present numerical simulations that corroborate our\ntheoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Our aim is to understand the effect of the planet's\nperturbation on the formation of giant planet cores outside the orbit of the\nplanet. We calculate the orbital evolution of planetesimals ranging from\n$10^{13}$ to $10^{20}$g, with a Jupiter-mass planet located at 5.2 au. We find\norbital alignment of planetesimals distributed in $\\simeq 9$-15 au, except for\nthe mean motion resonance (MMR) locations. The degree of alignment increases\nwith increasing distance from the planet and decreasing planetesimal mass.\nAligned orbits lead to low encounter velocity and thus faster growth.

The\nrelative velocity decreases with increasing distance from the planet and\ndecreasing mass ratio of planetesimals.

As a result, a\nseries of recent related works have focused on the direction of transfer\nlearning for quickly fine-tuning hyperparameters on a dataset. Unfortunately,\nthe community does not have a common large-scale benchmark for comparing HPO\nalgorithms. Instead, the de facto practice consists of empirical protocols on\narbitrary small-scale meta-datasets that vary inconsistently across\npublications, making reproducibility a challenge. To resolve this major\nbottleneck and enable a fair and fast comparison of black-box HPO methods on a\nlevel playing field, we propose HPO-B, a new large-scale benchmark in the form\nof a collection of meta-datasets. Our benchmark is assembled and preprocessed\nfrom the OpenML repository and consists of 176 search spaces (algorithms)\nevaluated sparsely on 196 datasets with a total of 6.4 million hyperparameter\nevaluations. For ensuring reproducibility on our benchmark, we detail explicit\nexperimental protocols, splits, and evaluation measures for comparing methods\nfor both non-transfer, as well as, transfer learning HPO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 09:18:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 14:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Users' news click behaviors are widely used for inferring user interests\nand predicting future clicks.

It is\nimportant to eliminate the effect of position biases on the recommendation\nmodel to accurately target user interests. In this paper, we propose a news\nrecommendation method named DebiasGAN that can effectively eliminate the effect\nof position biases via adversarial learning. We use a bias-aware click model to\ncapture the influence of position bias on click behaviors, and we use a\nbias-invariant click model with random candidate news positions to estimate the\nideally unbiased click scores. We apply adversarial learning techniques to the\nhidden representations learned by the two models to help the bias-invariant\nclick model capture the bias-independent interest of users on news.\nExperimental results on two real-world datasets show that DebiasGAN can\neffectively improve the accuracy of news recommendation by eliminating position\nbiases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 09:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Quantum walks are heading the\ndevelopment of quantum algorithms for searching information on graphs more\nefficiently than their classical counterparts. A quantum-walk-based algorithm\nstanding out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The\nlackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search graph structures\nwhose vertices have a self-loop of weight $l$. This paper addresses several\nissues related to applying the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for\nmultiple solutions on grids successfully. Firstly, we show that only one of the\ntwo stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. We\nalso demonstrate that the final success probability depends on both the space\ndensity of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. Furthermore,\nthis work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple\nsolutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal\nadjustment of the self-loop weight $l$ for such $d$-dimensional grids. It turns\nout other fits of $l$ found in the literature are particular cases. Finally, we\nobserve a two-to-one relation between the steps of the lackadaisical quantum\nwalk and Grover's algorithm, which requires modifications in the stopping\ncondition. In conclusion, this work deals with practical issues one should\nconsider when applying the lackadaisical quantum walk, besides expanding the\ntechnique to a broader range of search problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 09:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 22:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Quasi-static\nspeckles originate from slowly evolving non-common path aberrations (NCPA). The\npurpose of this work is to present a proof-of-concept on-sky demonstration of\nspatial Linear Dark Field Control (LDFC). The ultimate goal of LDFC is to\nstabilize the point spread function (PSF) by addressing NCPA using the science\nimage as additional wavefront sensor. We combined spatial LDFC with the\nAsymmetric Pupil vector-Apodizing Phase Plate (APvAPP) on the Subaru\nCoronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system at the Subaru Telescope. In this\npaper, we report the results of the first successful proof-of-principle LDFC\non-sky tests. We present results from two types of cases: (1) correction of\ninstrumental errors and atmospheric residuals plus artificially induced static\naberrations introduced on the deformable mirror and (2) correction of only\natmospheric residuals and instrumental aberrations. When introducing artificial\nstatic wavefront aberrations on the DM, we find that LDFC can improve the raw\ncontrast by a factor of $3$--$7$ over the dark hole. In these tests, the\nresidual wavefront error decreased by $\\sim$50 nm RMS, from $\\sim$90 nm to\n$\\sim40$ nm RMS. In the case with only residual atmospheric wavefront errors\nand instrumental aberrations, we show that LDFC is able to suppress evolving\naberrations that have timescales of $<0.1$--$0.4$ Hz.

The observation that wind and\nsolar power depress market prices at times when they produce the most has been\ntermed the 'cannibalization effect'. This can have a substantial impact on the\nrevenue of these technologies, the magnitude of which has already been\nestablished within the economic literature on current and future markets. Yet,\nthe effect is neglected in the capital budgeting literature assessing green\ninvestments in the electricity sector (e.g. including methods such as\nportfolio- and real-options theory). In this paper, we present an analytical\nframework that explicitly models the correlation between VRE production and\nelectricity price, as well as the impact on revenues of the surrounding\ncapacity mix and cost to emit CO$_2$. In particular, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for the short-term and long-term expected revenue, the variance of\nthe revenue and the timing of investments. The effect of including these system\ncharacteristics is illustrated with numerical examples, using a wind investment\nin the Polish electricity system as a test case. We find the cannibalization\neffect to have major influence on the revenues, making the projected profit of\na project decrease from 33% to between 13% and -40% (i.e. a loss), depending on\nthe assumption for the rate of future VRE capacity expansion. Using a real\noptions framework, the investment threshold increases by between 13% and 67%,\ndue to the inclusion of cannibalization. Our results likewise indicate that\nsubjective beliefs and uncertainty about the future electricity capacity mix,\ne.g.\\ VRE capacity growth, significantly affect the assessment of the revenue\nand investment timing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 10:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

We\ncompare the group jellyfish galaxies identified in this work with the LoTSS\njellyfish galaxies in clusters presented in Roberts et al.

We find that jellyfish galaxies are most commonly found in\nclusters, with the frequency decreasing towards the lowest mass groups. Both\nthe orientation of observed radio continuum tails, and the positions of group\njellyfish galaxies in phase space, suggest that galaxies are stripped more\nslowly in groups relative to clusters. Finally, we find that the star formation\nrates of jellyfish galaxies in groups are consistent with `normal' star-forming\ngroup galaxies, which is in contrast to cluster jellyfish galaxies that have\nclearly enhanced star formation rates. On the whole, there is clear evidence\nfor ongoing ram pressure stripping in galaxy groups (down to very low group\nmasses), though the frequency of jellyfish galaxies and the strength of ram\npressure stripping appears smaller in groups than clusters.

The\ndamping mechanism responsible for the reported oscillations is not fully\nunderstood yet. To understand the oscillations and damping of prominence\nthreads it is mandatory to investigate first the nature of the equilibrium\nsolutions that arise under static conditions and under the presence of\nradiative losses, thermal conduction and background heating. This provides the\nbasis to calculate the eigenmodes of the thread models. The nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations for hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium under the\npresence of gravity are solved using standard numerical techniques and simple\nanalytical expressions are derived under certain approximations. The solutions\nto the equations represent a prominence thread, i.e., a dense and cold plasma\nregion of a certain length that connects with the corona through a prominence\ncorona transition region (PCTR). The solutions can also match with a\nchromospheric-like layer if a spatially dependent heating function localised\naround the footpoints is considered. We have obtained static solutions\nrepresenting prominence threads and have investigated in detail the dependence\nof these solutions on the different parameters of the model. Among other\nresults, we have shown that multiple condensations along a magnetic field line\nare possible, and that the effect of partial ionisation in the model can\nsignificantly modify the thermal balance in the thread and therefore their\nlength. This last parameter is also shown to be comparable to that reported in\nthe observations when the radiative losses are reduced for typical thread\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 11:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

We demonstrate the good performance and robustness of\nthe JKOnet fitting procedure, compared to a more direct forward method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 23:34:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 17:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

The theory of\ndispersion forces was developed by London in the early years of quantum\nmechanics. However, it was only in the 1960s that it was recognized that for\nmolecules lacking an inversion center such as chiral and helical molecules,\nthere are chirality-sensitive corrections to the dispersion forces proportional\nto the rotatory power known from the theory of circular dichroism and with the\nsame distance scaling law R-6 as the London energy. The discovery of the\nChirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect in recent years has led to an\nadditional twist in the study of chiral molecular systems, showing a close\nrelation between spin and molecular geometry. Motivated by it, we propose in\nthis investigation to describe the mutual induction of charge and spin-density\nfluctuations in a pair A-B of chiral molecules by a simple physical model. The\nmodel assumes that the same fluctuating electric fields responsible for vdW\nforces can induce a magnetic response via a Rashba-like term, so that an\nspin-orbit field acting on molecule B is generated by the electric field\narising from charge density fluctuations in molecule A (and viceversa). Within\na second-order perturbative approach, these contributions manifest as an\neffective intermolecular exchange interaction. Although expected to be weaker\nthan the standard London forces, these interactions display the same R$^6$\ndistance scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 08:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Connected and automated vehicles can benefit\nhuman-driven ones and the whole traffic system in different ways, for example\nby improving collision avoidance and reducing traffic waves. Many studies have\nbeen carried out to improve intersection management, a significant bottleneck\nin traffic, with intelligent traffic signals or exclusively automated vehicles.\nHowever, the problem of how to improve mixed traffic at unsignalized\nintersections has received less attention. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to optimizing traffic flow at intersections in mixed traffic\nsituations using deep reinforcement learning. Our reinforcement learning agent\nlearns a policy for a centralized controller to let connected autonomous\nvehicles at unsignalized intersections give up their right of way and yield to\nother vehicles to optimize traffic flow. We implemented our approach and tested\nit in the traffic simulator SUMO based on simulated and real traffic data.

Consequently, in\nrecent years, there has been increasing attention on modelling non-local\nadvection mathematically. These often take the form of partial differential\nequations, with integral terms modelling the non-locality. One common formalism\nis the aggregation-diffusion equation, a class of advection diffusion models\nwith non-local advection. This was originally used to model a single\npopulation, but has recently been extended to the multi-species case to model\nthe way organisms may alter their movement in the presence of coexistent\nspecies. Here we prove existence theorems for a class of non-local\nmulti-species advection-diffusion models, with an arbitrary number of\nco-existent species. We prove global existence for models in n=1 spatial\ndimension and local existence for n>1. We describe an efficient spectral method\nfor numerically solving these models and provide example simulation output.\nOverall, this helps provide a solid mathematical foundation for studying the\neffect of inter-species interactions on movement and space use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 13:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

We use a set of in situ\nmultispacecraft observations and perform kinetic hybrid simulations.

The first factor is\nfound to substantially exceed simple hydrodynamic predictions in most observed\ncases, the second effect has a rather moderate impact, while the third causes\nstrong oscillations of the current density. We show that the presence of\naccelerated particles in the bow shock precursor highly boosts the current\ndensity amplification, making the postshock magnetic reconnection more\nprobable. The pool of accelerated particles strongly affects the interaction of\nRDs with the Earth's bow shock, as it is demonstrated by observational data\nanalysis and hybrid code simulations. Thus, shocks should be distinguished not\nby the inclination angle, but rather by the presence of foreshocks populated\nwith shock reflected particles.

The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a\nlinear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed\nthat automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear\ntransformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently,\nmany DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of\nthe learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions.\nThis approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are\ncoming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many\napplications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here,\nthe DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ\nthem to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the\ngeneralization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to\nlearn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the\noverfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to\nenhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot\nLearning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning\nand employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general\nrepresentation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a\ndeep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention\nmechanism. Besides, a class adversarial network is utilized to enforce the deep\nmodel to seek class invariant features for the DML task. We evaluate our work\non widely used machine vision datasets in a ZSL setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 14:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Both microscopic wave functions and\nsemi-classical dynamics suggest that a CF is a dipole consisting of an electron\nand a double $2h/e$ quantum vortex, and its motion is subject to a Berry\ncurvature that is uniformly distributed in the momentum space. Based on the\npicture, we study the electromagnetic response of composite fermions. We find\nthat the response in the long-wavelength limit has a form identical to that of\nthe Dirac CF theory. To obtain the result, we show that the Berry curvature\ncontributes a half-quantized Hall conductance which, notably, is independent of\nthe filling factor of a Landau level and not altered by the presence of\nimpurities. The latter is because CFs undergo no side-jumps when scattered by\nquenched impurities in a Landau-level with the particle-hole symmetry. The\nremainder of the response is from an effective system that has the same Fermi\nwavevector, effective density, Berry phase, and therefore long-wavelength\nresponse to electromagnetic fields as a Dirac CF system. By interpreting the\nhalf-quantized Hall conductance as a contribution from a redefined vacuum, we\ncan explicitly show the emergence of a Dirac CF effective description from the\ndipole picture. We further determine corrections due to electric quadrupoles\nand magnetic moments of CFs and show deviations from the Dirac CF theory when\nmoving away from the long wavelength limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 14:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 07:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

In such systems,\nend-to-end application performance heavily depends on the fraction of objects\ntransferred from the cache, also known as the cache hit probability. Many\ncaching policies have been proposed and implemented to improve the hit\nprobability. In this work, we propose a new method to compute an upper bound on\nhit probability for all non-anticipative caching policies, i.e., for policies\nthat have no knowledge of future requests. Our key insight is to order the\nobjects according to the ratio of their Hazard Rate (HR) function values to\ntheir sizes and place in the cache the objects with the largest ratios till the\ncache capacity is exhausted. Under some statistical assumptions, we prove that\nour proposed HR to size ratio based ordering model computes the maximum\nachievable hit probability and serves as an upper bound for all\nnon-anticipative caching policies. We derive closed form expressions for the\nupper bound under some specific object request arrival processes. We also\nprovide simulation results to validate its correctness and to compare it to the\nstate-of-the-art upper bounds.

However, existing\nmultiscale design methods for cellular composites are either computationally\nexhaustive or confined to a single class of microstructures. In this paper, we\npropose a data-driven topology optimization (TO) approach to enable the\nmultiscale design of cellular structures with various choices of microstructure\nclasses. The key component is a newly proposed latent-variable Gaussian process\n(LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into\na low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable\ndistance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized\nstiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a\ndifferentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily\nachieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the\ndensity-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization\nprocess is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure\nconcepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency\noptimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with\nmulticlass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both\nsingle-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to\nother multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 15:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Today, after the\nobservation of the narrow scalar resonance at 125 GeV, Veltman's large-mass\nidea seems to be ruled out. Yet, this is not necessarily true. Depending on the\ndescription of SSB in $\\Phi^4$ theory, and by combining analytic calculations\nand lattice simulations, besides the known particle at 125 GeV, a new resonance\nof the Higgs field may also show up around 700 GeV.

Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged\nwith promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its\ncounterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data\naugmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of\nthumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That\nsignificantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill\nin this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization\nframework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data\naugmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general\nframework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as\nmin-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to\nbe in general aligned with previous \"best practices\" observed from handcrafted\ntuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we\npropose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route\noutput features through different projection heads corresponding to different\naugmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and\ntypes, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on\naugmentation selection.

The core component of the system is a suite of\nanalytical pipelines used to gather the next day's carbon intensity forecasts,\ntrain day-ahead demand prediction models, and use risk-aware optimization to\ngenerate the next day's carbon-aware Virtual Capacity Curves (VCCs) for all\ndatacenter clusters across Google's fleet. VCCs impose hourly limits on\nresources available to temporally flexible workloads while preserving overall\ndaily capacity, enabling all such workloads to complete within a day. Data from\noperation shows that VCCs effectively limit hourly capacity when the grid's\nenergy supply mix is carbon intensive and delay the execution of temporally\nflexible workloads to \"greener\" times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 04:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Many modern software packages utilize Python for high-level\nalgorithm design and depend on native libraries written in C/C++/Fortran for\nefficient computation kernels. Interaction between Python code and native\nlibraries introduces performance losses because of the abstraction lying on the\nboundary of Python and native libraries. On the one side, Python code,\ntypically run with interpretation, is disjoint from its execution behavior. On\nthe other side, native libraries do not include program semantics to understand\nalgorithm defects.\n  To understand the interaction inefficiencies, we extensively study a large\ncollection of Python software packages and categorize them according to the\nroot causes of inefficiencies. We extract two inefficiency patterns that are\ncommon in interaction inefficiencies. Based on these patterns, we develop\nPieProf, a lightweight profiler, to pinpoint interaction inefficiencies in\nPython applications. The principle of PieProf is to measure the inefficiencies\nin the native execution and associate inefficiencies with high-level Python\ncode to provide a holistic view. Guided by PieProf, we optimize 17 real-world\napplications, yielding speedups up to 6.3$\\times$ on application level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

It can\nbe seen as an extension of previous studies which have developed stochastic\nmodels for surface temperatures. The proposed model is a sum of a deterministic\nseasonality function and a L\\'evy-driven multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess, which is a mean-reverting stochastic process. More specifically, the\ndeseasonalized temperature model is an order 4 continuous time autoregressive\nmodel, meaning that the stratospheric temperature is modeled to be directly\ndependent on the temperature over four preceding days, while the model's\nlonger-range memory stems from its recursive nature. This study is based on\ntemperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\nERA-Interim reanalysis model product. The residuals of the autoregressive model\nare well-represented by normal inverse Gaussian distributed random variables\nscaled with a time-dependent volatility function. A monthly variability in\nspeed of mean reversion of stratospheric temperature is found, hence suggesting\na generalization of the 4th order continuous time autoregressive model. A\nstochastic stratospheric temperature model, as proposed in this paper, can be\nused in geophysical analyses to improve the understanding of stratospheric\ndynamics. In particular, such characterizations of stratospheric temperature\nmay be a step towards greater insight in modeling and prediction of large-scale\nmiddle atmospheric events, such as for example sudden stratospheric warmings.\nThrough stratosphere-troposphere coupling, the stratosphere is hence a source\nof extended tropospheric predictability at weekly to monthly timescales, which\nis of great importance in several societal and industry sectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 09:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

In simple terms dynamic spectrum management\ninvolves allowing unlicensed users known as secondary users (SUs) to access the\nlicensed spectrum of a licensed user also known as primary user (PU). This is\nprimarily achieved using spectrum sharing schemes that leverage spectrum\ndatabase and cognitive radio techniques. However, the use of spectrum database\nand cognitive radio techniques faces reliability, security and privacy concerns\nfor spectrum sharing.
