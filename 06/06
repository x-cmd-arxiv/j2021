Thus, we may identify the most influential seed\nnodes by exploring only a part of the underlying network given a small budget\nfor node queries. Motivated by the fact that collecting node metadata is more\ncost-effective than investigating the relationship between nodes via queried\nnodes, we propose IM-META, an end-to-end solution to IM in networks with\nunknown topology by retrieving information from queries and node metadata.\nHowever, using such metadata to aid the IM process is not without risk due to\nthe noisy nature of metadata and uncertainties in connectivity inference. To\ntackle these challenges, we formulate a new IM problem that aims to find both\nseed nodes and queried nodes. In IM-META, we develop an effective method that\niteratively performs three steps: 1) we learn the relationship between\ncollected metadata and edges via a Siamese neural network model, 2) we select a\nnumber of inferred confident edges to construct a reinforced graph, and 3) we\nidentify the next node to query by maximizing the inferred influence spread\nusing our topology-aware ranking strategy. By querying only 5% of nodes,\nIM-META reaches 93% of the upper bound performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 16:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 08:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

While a variety of methods exist to combat forgetting, in some cases\ntasks are fundamentally incompatible with each other and thus cannot be learnt\nby a single policy.

Modelling the\natomic scale structure of this material is critical to understanding these\nprocesses, which in turn is needed to describe c-Si/a-Si:H heterjunctions that\nare at the heart of the modern solar cells with world record efficiency.\nDensity functional theory (DFT) studies achieve the required high accuracy but\nare limited to moderate system sizes a hundred atoms or so by their high\ncomputational cost. Simulations of amorphous materials in particular have been\nhindered by this high cost because large structural models are required to\ncapture the medium range order that is characteristic of such materials.\nEmpirical potential models are much faster, but their accuracy is not\nsufficient to correctly describe the frustrated local structure. Data driven,\n\"machine learned\" interatomic potentials have broken this impasse, and have\nbeen highly successful in describing a variety of amorphous materials in their\nelemental phase. Here we extend the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for\nsilicon by incorporating the interaction with hydrogen, thereby significantly\nimproving the degree of realism with which amorphous silicon can be modelled.\nWe show that our Si:H GAP enables the simulation of hydrogenated silicon with\nan accuracy very close to DFT, but with computational expense and run times\nreduced by several orders of magnitude for large structures. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of the Si:H GAP by creating models of hydrogenated liquid and\namorphous silicon, and showing that their energies, forces and stresses are in\nexcellent agreement with DFT results, and their structure as captured by bond\nand angle distributions, with both DFT and experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 19:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 23:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 00:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

Recent neuroscience\nand neuroimaging studies have increasingly used naturalistic stimuli and\nexperimental design to identify such realistic sensory computation in the\nbrain. However, existing methods for cross-areal interaction analysis with\ndimensionality reduction, such as reduced-rank regression and canonical\ncorrelation analysis, have limited applicability and interpretability in\nnaturalistic settings because they usually do not appropriately 'demix' neural\ninteractions into those associated with different types of task parameters or\nstimulus features (e.g., visual or audio). In this paper, we develop a new\nmethod for cross-areal interaction analysis that uses the rich task or stimulus\nparameters to reveal how and what types of information are shared by different\nneural populations. The proposed neural demixed shared component analysis\ncombines existing dimensionality reduction methods with a practical neural\nnetwork implementation of functional analysis of variance with latent\nvariables, thereby efficiently demixing nonlinear effects of continuous and\nmultimodal stimuli. We also propose a simplifying alternative under the\nassumptions of linear effects and unimodal stimuli.

An intriguing\nproperty of some classical search tasks is an asymmetry such that finding a\ntarget A among distractors B can be easier than finding B among A. To elucidate\nthe mechanisms responsible for asymmetry in visual search, we propose a\ncomputational model that takes a target and a search image as inputs and\nproduces a sequence of eye movements until the target is found. The model\nintegrates eccentricity-dependent visual recognition with target-dependent\ntop-down cues. We compared the model against human behavior in six paradigmatic\nsearch tasks that show asymmetry in humans. Without prior exposure to the\nstimuli or task-specific training, the model provides a plausible mechanism for\nsearch asymmetry. We hypothesized that the polarity of search asymmetry arises\nfrom experience with the natural environment. We tested this hypothesis by\ntraining the model on augmented versions of ImageNet where the biases of\nnatural images were either removed or reversed. The polarity of search\nasymmetry disappeared or was altered depending on the training protocol. This\nstudy highlights how classical perceptual properties can emerge in neural\nnetwork models, without the need for task-specific training, but rather as a\nconsequence of the statistical properties of the developmental diet fed to the\nmodel.

Traditionally, such\nefficiency-related questions were tackled only at the level of the overall\nsystem, and in a peer-to-peer (P2P) setting where miners directly connect to\none another. Despite it being common today for miners to pool compute\ncapacities in a mining pool managed by a centralized coordinator, efficiency in\nsuch a coordinated setting has barely been studied.\n  In this paper, we propose a simple model of a proof-of-work blockchain with\nlatencies for both the P2P and the coordinated settings.

We provide theoretical guarantees for our\nproposed algorithm and show by experiments that our proposed algorithm improves\nthe robustness against various kinds of popular attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 22:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 03:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

As many other machine learning\nalgorithms, contextual bandit algorithms often have one or more\nhyper-parameters. As an example, in most optimal stochastic contextual bandit\nalgorithms, there is an unknown exploration parameter which controls the\ntrade-off between exploration and exploitation. A proper choice of the\nhyper-parameters is essential for contextual bandit algorithms to perform well.\nHowever, it is infeasible to use offline tuning methods to select\nhyper-parameters in contextual bandit environment since there is no\npre-collected dataset and the decisions have to be made in real time. To tackle\nthis problem, we first propose a two-layer bandit structure for auto tuning the\nexploration parameter and further generalize it to the Syndicated Bandits\nframework which can learn multiple hyper-parameters dynamically in contextual\nbandit environment. We derive the regret bounds of our proposed Syndicated\nBandits framework and show it can avoid its regret dependent exponentially in\nthe number of hyper-parameters to be tuned. Moreover, it achieves optimal\nregret bounds under certain scenarios.

In standard SGD, parameters are updated by improving along the\npath of the gradient at the current iterate on a batch of examples, where the\naddition of a ``momentum'' term biases the update in the direction of the\nprevious change in parameters. In non-stochastic convex optimization one can\nshow that a momentum adjustment provably reduces convergence time in many\nsettings, yet such results have been elusive in the stochastic and non-convex\nsettings. At the same time, a widely-observed empirical phenomenon is that in\ntraining deep networks stochastic momentum appears to significantly improve\nconvergence time, variants of it have flourished in the development of other\npopular update methods, e.g. ADAM [KB15], AMSGrad [RKK18], etc. Yet theoretical\njustification for the use of stochastic momentum has remained a significant\nopen question. In this paper we propose an answer: stochastic momentum improves\ndeep network training because it modifies SGD to escape saddle points faster\nand, consequently, to more quickly find a second order stationary point. Our\ntheoretical results also shed light on the related question of how to choose\nthe ideal momentum parameter--our analysis suggests that $\\beta \\in [0,1)$\nshould be large (close to 1), which comports with empirical findings.

This paper proposes to\nexplicitly tackle this challenge, via a principled framework called\nSelf-Damaging Contrastive Learning (SDCLR), to automatically balance the\nrepresentation learning without knowing the classes. Our main inspiration is\ndrawn from the recent finding that deep models have difficult-to-memorize\nsamples, and those may be exposed through network pruning. It is further\nnatural to hypothesize that long-tail samples are also tougher for the model to\nlearn well due to insufficient examples. Hence, the key innovation in SDCLR is\nto create a dynamic self-competitor model to contrast with the target model,\nwhich is a pruned version of the latter. During training, contrasting the two\nmodels will lead to adaptive online mining of the most easily forgotten samples\nfor the current target model, and implicitly emphasize them more in the\ncontrastive loss.

At the pulse wave modulation, deciding the high and\nlow voltage by the middle voltage when the receiving signal level is amplified\nis equal to deciding it by the threshold voltage without amplification. In this\npaper, we proposed two methods that adjust the threshold value using counting\nthe slot number and measuring the signal level. The number of signal slots is\nconstant per one symbol when we use Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). If the\nnumber of received signal slots per one symbol time is less than the\ntheoretical value, that means the threshold value is higher than the optimal\nvalue. If it is more than the theoretical value, that means the threshold value\nis lower. So, we can adjust the threshold value using the number of received\nsignal slots. At the second proposed method, the average received signal level\nis not equal to the signal level because there is a ratio between the number of\nhigh slots and low slots. So, we can calculate the threshold value from the\naverage received signal level and the slot ratio.

Source codes can be easily built by\nreferring to the software architectures. However, the reverse process i.e.\nderivation of the software architecture from the source code is a challenging\ntask. Further, such an architecture consists of multiple layers, and\ndistributing the existing elements into these layers should be done accurately\nand efficiently. In this paper, a novel approach is presented for the recovery\nof layered architectures from Java-based software systems using the concept of\nego networks. Ego networks have traditionally been used for social network\nanalysis, but in this paper, they are modified in a particular way and tuned to\nsuit the mentioned task. Specifically, a dependency network is extracted from\nthe source code to create an ego network. The ego network is processed to\ncreate and optimize ego layers in a particular structure. These ego layers when\nintegrated and optimized together give the final layered architecture. The\nproposed approach is evaluated in two ways: on static versions of three\nopen-source software, and a continuously evolving software system. The\ndistribution of nodes amongst the proposed layers and the committed violations\nare observed on both class level and package level. The proposed method is seen\nto outperform the existing standard approaches over multiple performance\nmetrics. We also carry out the analysis of variation in the results concerning\nthe change in the node selection strategy and the frequency. The empirical\nobservations show promising signs for recovering software architecture layers\nfrom source codes using this technique and also extending it further to other\nlanguages and software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 06:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Code clones, which are\nsyntactically or semantically similar code fragments, are perfect candidates\nfor such tasks. Searching for code clones involves a given search query to\nretrieve the relevant code fragments.

For this purpose, we generate metadata for each code clone in the form\nof a natural language document.

In this paper, we\nexplore the potential of double actors, which has been neglected for a long\ntime, for better value function estimation in continuous setting. First, we\nuncover and demonstrate the bias alleviation property of double actors by\nbuilding double actors upon single critic and double critics to handle\noverestimation bias in DDPG and underestimation bias in TD3 respectively. Next,\nwe interestingly find that double actors help improve the exploration ability\nof the agent. Finally, to mitigate the uncertainty of value estimate from\ndouble critics, we further propose to regularize the critic networks under\ndouble actors architecture, which gives rise to Double Actors Regularized\nCritics (DARC) algorithm. Extensive experimental results on challenging\ncontinuous control tasks show that DARC significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods with higher sample efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 07:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In this paper, a\nnovel 3D convolutional network, called two-stage-age-network (TSAN), is\nproposed to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI data. Compared with\nexisting methods, TSAN has the following improvements. First, TSAN uses a\ntwo-stage cascade network architecture, where the first-stage network estimates\na rough brain age, then the second-stage network estimates the brain age more\naccurately from the discretized brain age by the first-stage network. Second,\nto our knowledge, TSAN is the first work to apply novel ranking losses in brain\nage estimation, together with the traditional mean square error (MSE) loss.\nThird, densely connected paths are used to combine feature maps with different\nscales. The experiments with $6586$ MRIs showed that TSAN could provide\naccurate brain age estimation, yielding mean absolute error (MAE) of $2.428$\nand Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of $0.985$, between the estimated\nand chronological ages. Furthermore, using the brain age gap between brain age\nand chronological age as a biomarker, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild\nCognitive Impairment (MCI) can be distinguished from healthy control (HC)\nsubjects by support vector machine (SVM). Classification AUC in AD/HC and\nMCI/HC was $0.904$ and $0.823$, respectively.

Existing methods\ntypically extract hand-crafted features or model skeleton dynamics from the\ntrajectory of body joints, while they rarely explore valuable relation\ninformation contained in body structure or motion. To fully explore body\nrelations, we construct graphs to model human skeletons from different levels,\nand for the first time propose a Multi-level Graph encoding approach with\nStructural-Collaborative Relation learning (MG-SCR) to encode discriminative\ngraph features for person Re-ID. Specifically, considering that\nstructurally-connected body components are highly correlated in a skeleton, we\nfirst propose a multi-head structural relation layer to learn different\nrelations of neighbor body-component nodes in graphs, which helps aggregate key\ncorrelative features for effective node representations. Second, inspired by\nthe fact that body-component collaboration in walking usually carries\nrecognizable patterns, we propose a cross-level collaborative relation layer to\ninfer collaboration between different level components, so as to capture more\ndiscriminative skeleton graph features. Finally, to enhance graph dynamics\nencoding, we propose a novel self-supervised sparse sequential prediction task\nfor model pre-training, which facilitates encoding high-level graph semantics\nfor person Re-ID. MG-SCR outperforms state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods,\nand it achieves superior performance to many multi-modal methods that utilize\nextra RGB or depth features.

However, at the fundamental level, the physical\norigin of these effects of VWT remained unclear. Therefore, in this work, the\nelectron power absorption dynamics is investigated in a He/N$_2$ jet with a\nnitrogen concentration of 0.05\\% driven by a valleys waveform at a base\nfrequency of 13.56 MHz for different numbers of harmonics using a\nself-consistent Particle in Cell simulation coupled with a spatio-temporally\nresolved analysis of the electron power absorption based on the momentum\nbalance equation. Due to the local nature of the transport at atmospheric\npressure, ohmic power absorption is dominant. Increasing the number of\nharmonics, due to the peculiar shape of the excitation waveform the sheath\ncollapse at the grounded electrode is shortened relative to the one at the\npowered electrode. As a consequence, and in order to ensure flux compensation\nof electrons and positive ions at this electrode, a high current is driven\nthrough the discharge at the time of this short sheath collapse. This current\nis driven by a high ohmic electric field. Close to the grounded electrode,\nwhere the electron density is low and the electric field is high, electrons are\naccelerated to high energies and strong ionization as well as the formation of\na local electron density maximum are observed. This electron density maximum\nleads to a local ambipolar electric field that acts as an electric field\nreversal and accelerates electrons to even higher energies.

Other data such as BAO, CMB\nanisotropies, stellar ages, the rate of structure growth, etc are all\n`concordant' with this model but do not provide independent evidence for\naccelerated expansion. Analysis of a larger sample of 740 SNe Ia shows that\nthese are not quite standard candles, and highlights the \"corrections\" applied\nto analyse the data in the FLRW framework. The latter holds in the reference\nframe in which the CMB is isotropic, whereas observations are made in our\nheliocentric frame in which the CMB has a large dipole anisotropy. This is\nassumed to be of kinematic origin i.e. due to our non-Hubble motion driven by\nlocal inhomogeneity in the matter distribution. The $\\Lambda$CDM model predicts\nhow this peculiar velocity should fall off as the averaging scale is raised and\nthe universe becomes sensibly homogeneous. However observations of the local\n`bulk flow' are inconsistent with this expectation and convergence to the CMB\nframe is not seen. Moreover the kinematic interpretation implies a\ncorresponding dipole in the sky distribution of high redshift quasars, which is\nrejected by observations at 4.9$\\sigma$. The acceleration of the Hubble\nexpansion rate is also anisotropic at 3.9$\\sigma$ and aligned with the bulk\nflow. Thus dark energy may be an artefact of analysing data assuming that we\nare idealised observers in an FLRW universe, when in fact the real universe is\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic out to distances large enough to impact on\ncosmological analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 13:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

Neural models ground perceptual input\ninto a conceptual vocabulary, on which a classical reasoning algorithm is\napplied to generate output. A key limitation is that such neural-to-symbolic\nmodels can only be trained end-to-end for tasks where the output space is\nsymbolic. In this paper, we study neural-symbolic-neural models for reasoning\ntasks that require a conversion from an image input (e.g., a partially filled\nsudoku) to an image output (e.g., the image of the completed sudoku). While\ndesigning such a three-step hybrid architecture may be straightforward, the key\ntechnical challenge is end-to-end training -- how to backpropagate without\nintermediate supervision through the symbolic component. We propose NSNnet, an\narchitecture that combines an image reconstruction loss with a novel output\nencoder to generate a supervisory signal, develops update algorithms that\nleverage policy gradient methods for supervision, and optimizes loss using a\nnovel subsampling heuristic. We experiment on problem settings where symbolic\nalgorithms are easily specified: a visual maze solving task and a visual Sudoku\nsolver where the supervision is in image form.

However, existing conditional inputs are suffering from either\nunstructured forms (captions) or limited information and expensive labeling\n(scene graphs). For a targeted scene, the core items, objects, are usually\ndefinite while their interactions are flexible and hard to clearly define.\nThus, we introduce a more rational setting, generating a realistic image from\nthe objects and captions. Under this setting, objects explicitly define the\ncritical roles in the targeted images and captions implicitly describe their\nrich attributes and connections. Correspondingly, a MOC-GAN is proposed to mix\nthe inputs of two modalities to generate realistic images. It firstly infers\nthe implicit relations between object pairs from the captions to build a\nhidden-state scene graph. So a multi-layer representation containing objects,\nrelations and captions is constructed, where the scene graph provides the\nstructures of the scene and the caption provides the image-level guidance. Then\na cascaded attentive generative network is designed to coarse-to-fine generate\nphrase patch by paying attention to the most relevant words in the caption.

However,\nlike any other deep architectures, GNNs are data hungry. While requiring labels\nin real world is often expensive, pretraining GNNs in an unsupervised manner\nhas been actively explored. Among them, graph contrastive learning, by\nmaximizing the mutual information between paired graph augmentations, has been\nshown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, the current graph\ncontrastive learning framework has two limitations. First, the augmentations\nare designed for general graphs and thus may not be suitable or powerful enough\nfor certain domains. Second, the contrastive scheme only learns representations\nthat are invariant to local perturbations and thus does not consider the global\nstructure of the dataset, which may also be useful for downstream tasks.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study graph contrastive learning in the context of\nbiomedical domain, where molecular graphs are present.

The local-level domain\nknowledge guides the augmentation process such that variation is introduced\nwithout changing graph semantics. The global-level knowledge encodes the\nsimilarity information between graphs in the entire dataset and helps to learn\nrepresentations with richer semantics.

Each word sense in a\nlanguage is mentally represented by an m-script, a script function which\nembodies all the syntax and semantics of the word. M-scripts form a\nfully-lexicalised unification grammar, which can support adult language. Each\nword m-script can be learnt robustly from about six learning examples. The\ntheory has been implemented as a computer model, which can bootstrap-learn a\nlanguage from zero vocabulary. The Bayesian learning mechanism is (1) Capable:\nto learn arbitrarily complex meanings and syntactic structures; (2) Fast:\nlearning these structures from a few examples each; (3) Robust: learning in the\npresence of much irrelevant noise, and (4) Self-repairing: able to acquire\nimplicit negative evidence, using it to learn exceptions. Children learning\nlanguage are clearly all of (1) - (4), whereas connectionist theories fail on\n(1) and (2), and symbolic theories fail on (3) and (4). The theory is in good\nagreement with many key facts of language acquisition, including facts which\nare problematic for other theories.

In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra\nconvolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of\nfunctions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for\ntraditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions\nare equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian\nhomogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant\nfunction can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,\ngeneralizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra\nexpansions in Euclidean space.
