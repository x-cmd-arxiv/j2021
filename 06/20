With advances in technologies, the abstraction of\ncoding, programming languages, and the hardware resources involved will become\na reality. However, while we have not progressed to this stage, it is necessary\nto encourage the development of CT teaching from an early age.

This survey presents a\nsystematic review of the literature, emphasizing computational and robotic\ntools used in preschool classes to develop the CT. The systematic review\nevaluated more than 60 papers from 2010 to December 2020, electing 31 papers\nand adding three papers from the qualitative stage. The paper's amount was\nclassified in taxonomy to show CT's principal tools and initiates applied to\nchildren early.

Specifically, the algorithm has access to\nstreaming and noisy data only from a single and ongoing trial. It accomplishes\nsuch performance by effectively leveraging various forms of side information on\nthe dynamics to reduce the sample complexity. Such side information typically\ncomes from elementary laws of physics and qualitative properties of the system.\nMore precisely, the algorithm approximately solves an optimal control problem\nencoding the system's desired behavior. To this end, it constructs and\niteratively refines a data-driven differential inclusion that contains the\nunknown vector field of the dynamics. The differential inclusion, used in an\ninterval Taylor-based method, enables to over-approximate the set of states the\nsystem may reach. Theoretically, we establish a bound on the suboptimality of\nthe approximate solution with respect to the optimal control with known\ndynamics. We show that the longer the trial or the more side information is\navailable, the tighter the bound. Empirically, experiments in a high-fidelity\nF-16 aircraft simulator and MuJoCo's environments illustrate that, despite the\nscarcity of data, the algorithm can provide performance comparable to\nreinforcement learning algorithms trained over millions of environment\ninteractions.

DOO\nand VOOT balance exploration and exploitation, but use space partitioning\nstrategies independent of the reward function to be optimized. Recently, LaMCTS\nempirically learns to partition the search space in a reward-sensitive manner\nfor black-box optimization. In this paper, we develop a novel formal regret\nanalysis for when and why such an adaptive region partitioning scheme works. We\nalso propose a new path planning method LaP3 which improves the function value\nestimation within each sub-region, and uses a latent representation of the\nsearch space.

(3) In all these cases, we show that the sequence of\nnormalised edge-weights converge to a {\\it deterministic} limit, despite a\nlinear-reinforcement mechanism, and we conjecture that this is a general fact\nwhich is valid on all finite graphs. To prove these results, we use stochastic\napproximation methods, and in particular the ODE method. One difficulty comes\nfrom the fact that this method relies on understanding the behaviour at large\ntimes of the solution of a non-linear, multi-dimensional ODE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 19:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

There are two problems with Cauchy-Stokes decomposition. The\nfirst one is that the anti-symmetric or vorticity tensor cannot represent the\nfluid rotation or vortex. The second one is that the symmetric (strain-rate)\ntensor cannot distinguish the stretching (compression) and shear. The\nstretching and shear are dependent on the coordinate or are not Galilean\ninvariant. Since vorticity cannot distinguish between the non-rotational shear\nand the rigid rotation, vorticity has been decomposed to a rigid rotation\ncalled Liutex and anti-symmetric shear in our previous work. A Liutex-based\nprincipal coordinate was developed and the velocity gradient tensor was\ndecomposed in the principal coordinate as a rigid rotation (Liutex tensor), a\npure shear tensor and a stretching (compression) tensor, which is called the\nprincipal decomposition.

Significantly, this contribution is substantial at\nstrong couplings even at limit cycle, thus largely affecting the behavior of\nthe thermodynamic efficiency.

Contrastive\nlearning is a typical method of SSL that can learn general invariant features.\nHowever, most existing contrastive learning methods are designed for\nclassification tasks to obtain an image-level representation, which may be\nsuboptimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level\ndiscrimination. Therefore, we propose a global style and local matching\ncontrastive learning network (GLCNet) for remote sensing image semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, 1) the global style contrastive learning module is\nused to better learn an image-level representation, as we consider that style\nfeatures can better represent the overall image features. 2) The local features\nmatching contrastive learning module is designed to learn representations of\nlocal regions, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation.

Manifolds are\ndiscovered using the convergent cross mapping (CCM) causal inference algorithm\nwhich are then compressed into a reduced redundancy network. The representation\nis a network of manifolds embedded from observational data where each\northogonal axis of a local manifold is an embedding of a individually\nidentifiable neuron or brain area that has exact correspondence in the real\nworld. As such these can be experimentally manipulated to test hypotheses\nderived from theory and data analysis. Here we demonstrate that this\nrepresentation preserves the essential features of the brain of flies,larval\nzebrafish and humans. In addition to accurate near-term prediction, the GMN\nmodel can be used to synthesize realistic time series of whole brain neuronal\nactivity and locomotion viewed over the long term. Thus, as a final validation\nof how well GMN captures essential dynamic information, we show that the\nartificially generated time series can be used as a training set to predict\nout-of-sample observed fly locomotion, as well as brain activity in out of\nsample withheld data not used in model building.

The local and detailed feature from the shallower\nlayer such as boundary and tissue texture is particularly more important in\nmedical segmentation compared with natural image segmentation. To this end, we\npropose a novel upsample approach for medical image segmentation, Window\nAttention Upsample (WAU), which upsamples features conditioned on local and\ndetailed features from downsampling path in local windows by introducing\nattention decoders of Transformer.

In contrast to the conventional cascaded approach\nto speaker diarization, EEND methods are better in terms of speaker overlap\nhandling. However, EEND still has a disadvantage in that it cannot deal with a\nflexible number of speakers. To remedy this problem, we introduce\nencoder-decoder-based attractor calculation module (EDA) to EEND. Once\nframe-wise embeddings are obtained, EDA sequentially generates speaker-wise\nattractors on the basis of a sequence-to-sequence method using an LSTM\nencoder-decoder. The attractor generation continues until a stopping condition\nis satisfied; thus, the number of attractors can be flexible. Diarization\nresults are then estimated as dot products of the attractors and embeddings.\nThe embeddings from speaker overlaps result in larger dot product values with\nmultiple attractors; thus, this method can deal with speaker overlaps. Because\nthe maximum number of output speakers is still limited by the training set, we\nalso propose an iterative inference method to remove this restriction. Further,\nwe propose a method that aligns the estimated diarization results with the\nresults of an external speech activity detector, which enables fair comparison\nagainst cascaded approaches.

The method consists in starting from a CLS and engineering families\nof Bloch Hamiltonians as quadratic (or linear) functions of the associated\nBloch state. The resulting tight-binding models not only exhibit a flat band,\nbut also multifold quadratic (or linear) band touching points (BTPs) whose\nnumber, location, and degeneracy can be controlled to a large extent. Quadratic\nflat-band models are ubiquitous: they can be built from any arbitrary CLS, on\nany lattice, in any dimension and with any number $N\\geq2$ of bands. Linear\nflat-band models are rarer: they require $N\\geq3$ and can only be built from\nCLSs that fulfill certain compatibility relations with the underlying lattice.\nMost flat-band models from the literature can be classified according to this\nscheme: Mielke's and Tasaki's models belong to the quadratic class, while the\nLieb, dice and breathing Kagome models belong to the linear class. Many novel\nflat-band models are introduced, among which an $N=4$ bilayer honeycomb model\nwith fourfold quadratic BTPs, an $N=5$ dice model with fivefold linear BTPs,\nand an $N=3$ Kagome model with BTPs that can be smoothly tuned from linear to\nquadratic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 09:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

This leads to the study of the\ndesign of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. Given two objectives,\nnamely, utility maximization and privacy-loss minimization, this work is based\non two previously non-intersecting regimes -- Compressive Privacy and\nmulti-kernel method. Compressive Privacy is a privacy framework that employs\nutility-preserving lossy-encoding scheme to protect the privacy of the data,\nwhile multi-kernel method is a kernel based machine learning regime that\nexplores the idea of using multiple kernels for building better predictors. The\ncompressive multi-kernel method proposed consists of two stages -- the\ncompression stage and the multi-kernel stage. The compression stage follows the\nCompressive Privacy paradigm to provide the desired privacy protection. Each\nkernel matrix is compressed with a lossy projection matrix derived from the\nDiscriminant Component Analysis (DCA). The multi-kernel stage uses the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) score of each kernel to non-uniformly combine\nmultiple compressive kernels. The proposed method is evaluated on two\nmobile-sensing datasets -- MHEALTH and HAR -- where activity recognition is\ndefined as utility and person identification is defined as privacy. The results\nshow that the compression regime is successful in privacy preservation as the\nprivacy classification accuracies are almost at the random-guess level in all\nexperiments. On the other hand, the novel SNR-based multi-kernel shows utility\nclassification accuracy improvement upon the state-of-the-art in both datasets.\nThese results indicate a promising direction for research in privacy-preserving\nmachine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 10:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

When sonographic placement is not feasible, a\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)-guided biopsy is often preferred. The lack of\nreal-time imaging information and the deformations of the breast make it\nchallenging to bring the needle precisely towards the tumour detected in\npre-interventional Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. The current manual\nMRI-guided biopsy workflow is inaccurate and would benefit from a technique\nthat allows real-time tracking and localisation of the tumour lesion during\nneedle insertion. This paper proposes a robotic setup and software architecture\nto assist the radiologist in targeting MR-detected suspicious tumours. The\napproach benefits from image fusion of preoperative images with intraoperative\noptical tracking of markers attached to the patient's skin. A hand-mounted\nbiopsy device has been constructed with an actuated needle base to drive the\ntip toward the desired direction. The steering commands may be provided both by\nuser input and by computer guidance. The workflow is validated through phantom\nexperiments. On average, the suspicious breast lesion is targeted with a radius\ndown to 2.3 mm.

The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues\nmakes it possible to perform user personality profiling automatically and\nefficiently based on data represented across multiple data modalities. However,\nthe research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal\nsocial media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different\nsocial network data on machine learning performance has yet to be\ncomprehensively evaluated.

Protection of such mission-critical radio communication networks\nis usually tackled by exploiting radiogoniometers: at least three suitably\ndeployed radiogoniometers, and a gateway gathering information from them,\npermit to monitor and localise sources of electromagnetic emissions that are\nnot supposed to be present in the monitored area.

To further facilitate\ninteractive segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest\nthe next slice to segment based on the current segmentation quality of each\nslice.

Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel\nview synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce\na neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly\ncomplex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned\nimplicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface\nconstraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surface\nas the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a new\nvolume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation.

The extracted features were then used to\npredict grants productivity via machine learning in three major research areas,\nnamely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. We found that research\nsubject and publication history play a role in predicting productivity. In\naddition, institution-based features turned out to be relevant when combined\nwith other features. While the best results outperformed text-based attributes,\nthe evaluated features were not highly discriminative. Our findings indicate\nthat predicting grants success, at least with the considered set of\nbibliometric features, is not a trivial task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 14:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The exotic phase\ncannot be captured by the classification of any bosonic or fermionic\ntopological phases, and thus gives a novel class of invertible topological\nphases. When the $T$ symmetry defect admits a spin structure, our construction\nreduces to a sort of the decorated domain wall construction, in terms of a\nbosonic theory with $T$ symmetry defects decorated with a fermionic phase that\ndepends on a spin structure of the $T$ symmetry defect.

Advances in photonic integrated circuits have enabled\nresearch in photonic computation, where, despite excellent features such as\nfast linear computation, no integrated photonic deep network has been\ndemonstrated to date due to the lack of scalable nonlinear functionality and\nthe loss of photonic devices, making scalability to a large number of layers\nchallenging. Here we report the first integrated end-to-end photonic deep\nneural network (PDNN) that performs instantaneous image classification through\ndirect processing of optical waves. Images are formed on the input pixels and\noptical waves are coupled into nanophotonic waveguides and processed as the\nlight propagates through layers of neurons on-chip. Each neuron generates an\noptical output from input optical signals, where linear computation is\nperformed optically and the nonlinear activation function is realised\nopto-electronically. The output of a laser coupled into the chip is uniformly\ndistributed among all neurons within the network providing the same per-neuron\nsupply light. Thus, all neurons have the same optical output range enabling\nscalability to deep networks with large number of layers. The PDNN chip is used\nfor 2- and 4-class classification of handwritten letters achieving accuracies\nof higher than 93.7% and 90.3%, respectively, with a computation time less than\none clock cycle of state-of-the-art digital computation platforms.

SlimWeb consists of a JavaScript\nclassification service powered by a supervised Machine Learning (ML) model that\nprovides insights into each JavaScript element embedded in a web page. SlimWeb\naims to improve the web browsing experience by predicting the class of each\nelement, such that essential elements are preserved and non-essential elements\nare blocked by the browsers using the service. We motivate the core design of\nSlimWeb using a user preference survey of 306 users and perform a detailed\nevaluation of SlimWeb across 500 popular web pages in a developing region on\nreal 3G and 4G cellular networks, along with a user experience study with 20\nreal-world users and a usage willingness survey of 588 users. Evaluation\nresults show that SlimWeb achieves a 50% reduction in the page load time\ncompared to the original pages, and more than 30% reduction compared to\ncompeting solutions, while achieving high similarity scores to the original\npages measured via a qualitative evaluation study of 62 users. SlimWeb improves\nthe overall user experience by more than 60% compared to the original pages,\nwhile maintaining 90%-100% of the visual and functional components of most\npages. Finally, the SlimWeb classifier achieves a median accuracy of 90% in\npredicting the JavaScript category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 10:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Using input convex neural networks, the\nmodels are hyperelastic, anisotropic and fulfill the polyconvexity condition,\nwhich implies ellipticity and thus ensures material stability. The first\nconstitutive model is based on a set of polyconvex, anisotropic and objective\ninvariants. The second approach is formulated in terms of the deformation\ngradient, its cofactor and determinant, uses group symmetrization to fulfill\nthe material symmetry condition, and data augmentation to fulfill objectivity\napproximately. The extension of the dataset for the data augmentation approach\nis based on mechanical considerations and does not require additional\nexperimental or simulation data. The models are calibrated with highly\nchallenging simulation data of cubic lattice metamaterials, including finite\ndeformations and lattice instabilities. A moderate amount of calibration data\nis used, based on deformations which are commonly applied in experimental\ninvestigations. While the invariant-based model shows drawbacks for several\ndeformation modes, the model based on the deformation gradient alone is able to\nreproduce and predict the effective material behavior very well and exhibits\nexcellent generalization capabilities. In addition, the models are calibrated\nwith transversely isotropic data, generated with an analytical polyconvex\npotential. For this case, both models show excellent results, demonstrating the\nstraightforward applicability of the polyconvex neural network constitutive\nmodels to other symmetry groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 15:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 11:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

In the\nproposed work we test the hypothesis that GNSS positions directly recorded by\nsmartphones can be a valid solution for spatial analysis of people's behaviour\nin an urban garden. Particular behaviours can be linked to therapeutic spots\nthat promote health and well-being of visitors. Three parts are reported: (i)\nassessment of the accuracy of the positions relative to a reference track, (ii)\nimplementation of a framework for automating transmission and processing of the\nlocation information, (iii) analysis of preferred spots via spatial analytics.\nDifferent devices were used to survey at different times and with different\nmethods, i.e. in the pocket of the owner or on a rigid frame. Accuracy was\nestimated using distance of each located point to the reference track, and\nprecision was estimated with static multiple measures. A chat-bot through the\nTelegram application was implemented to allow users to send their data to a\ncentralized computing environment thus automating the spatial analysis. Results\nreport a horizontal accuracy below ~2.3 m at 95% confidence level, without\nsignificant difference between surveys, and very little differences between\ndevices. GNSS-only and assisted navigation with telephone cells also did not\nshow significant difference. Autocorrelation of the residuals over time and\nspace showed strong consistency of the residuals, thus proving a valid solution\nfor spatial analysis of walking behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 08:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Despite these efforts, modeling combustion\nkinetics is still challenging due to the demand for expert knowledge and\noptimization against experiments, as well as the lack of understanding of the\nassociated uncertainties. Therefore, data-driven approaches that enable\nefficient discovery and calibration of kinetic models have received much\nattention in recent years, the core of which is the optimization based on big\ndata. Differentiable programming is a promising approach for learning kinetic\nmodels from data by efficiently computing the gradient of objective functions\nto model parameters. However, it is often challenging to implement\ndifferentiable programming in practice. Therefore, it is still not available in\nwidely utilized combustion simulation packages such as CHEMKIN and Cantera.\nHere, we present a differentiable combustion simulation package leveraging the\neco-system in Julia, including DifferentialEquations.jl for solving\ndifferential equations, ForwardDiff.jl for auto-differentiation, and Flux.jl\nfor incorporating neural network models into combustion simulations and\noptimizing neural network models using the state-of-the-art deep learning\noptimizers.
