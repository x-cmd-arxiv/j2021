While many questions\nremain unanswered, experiments have found that the systems with the highest\ncritical temperatures tend to be layered materials where superconductivity\noccurs in two-dimensional (2D) structures. However, to what extent the\nremarkable stability of these strongly correlated 2D superfluids is related to\ntheir reduced dimensionality is still an open question. In this work, we use\ndilute gases of ultracold fermionic atoms as a model system to directly observe\nthe influence of dimensionality on strongly interacting fermionic superfluids.\nWe achieve this by measuring the superfluid gap of a strongly correlated\nquasi-2D Fermi gas over a wide range of interaction strengths and comparing the\nresults to recent measurements in 3D Fermi gases. We find that the superfluid\ngap follows the same universal function of the interaction strength in both\nsystems, which suggests that there is no inherent difference in the stability\nof fermionic superfluidity between two- and three-dimensional quantum gases.\nFinally, we compare our data to results from solid state systems and find a\nsimilar relation between the interaction strength and the gap for a wide range\nof two- and three-dimensional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 16:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Governed\nby the flow equation, our Residual Network (ResNet) builds smooth, fluid and\nregular flows of velocity fields and consequently generates smooth and\ninvertible transformations (i.e. diffeomorphic warping functions). Inspired by\nthe elegant Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework,\nthe final transformation is built by the flow of time-dependent vector fields\nwhich are none other than the building blocks of our Residual Network. The\nlatter is naturally viewed as an Eulerian discretization schema of the flow\nequation (an ODE). Once trained, our ResNet-TW aligns unseen data by a single\ninexpensive forward pass. As we show in experiments on both univariate (84\ndatasets from UCR archive) and multivariate time-series (MSR Action-3D,\nFlorence-3D and MSR Daily Activity), ResNet-TW achieves competitive performance\nin joint alignment and classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 16:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

We show\nthat ReLEX always performs no worse than a state-of-the-art algorithm without\nrepresentation learning, and will be strictly better in terms of sample\nefficiency if the function class of representations enjoys a certain mild\n\"coverage'' property over the whole state-action space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 17:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit\nrepresentations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable\navatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic\ncloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body\nscans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of\neffectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes\nand cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type\noptimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we\npropose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars,\nrepresented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We\nachieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a\nhypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork is\nconditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms\nnon-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to\neffectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus\ncan be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We\nqualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our\napproach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes\nfaster.

Assuming\nCP-violation, the particle X is absorbed at a different rate than the\nantiparticle $\\bar{X}$, producing an asymmetry in the baryonic number. We\nindependently test this scenario, finding that it suffers from two fundamental\nissues.\\\\ At the phenomenological level, strong absorption by PBHs initially\nincreases the baryon asymmetry.

In order to overcome this issue, we account for\nPBH evaporation, which provides a natural way of halting the absorption while\nkeeping a finite baryon asymmetry.

Many applied problems have coupled space and time\nheterogeneities.

In problems without scale separation, local problems include\nmultiple macroscopic variables and oversampled local problems, where these\nmacroscopic parameters are computed. These approaches, called Non-local\nmulti-continua, are proposed for problems with complex spatial heterogeneities\nin a number of previous papers.

One of the most challenging problems\nin the vision transformer is that the large sequence length of image tokens\nleads to high computational cost (quadratic complexity). A popular solution to\nthis problem is to use a single pooling operation to reduce the sequence\nlength. This paper considers how to improve existing vision transformers, where\nthe pooled feature extracted by a single pooling operation seems less powerful.\nTo this end, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective\nin various vision tasks owing to its powerful ability in context abstraction.\nHowever, pyramid pooling has not been explored in backbone network design. To\nbridge this gap, we propose to adapt pyramid pooling to Multi-Head\nSelf-Attention (MHSA) in the vision transformer, simultaneously reducing the\nsequence length and capturing powerful contextual features. Plugged with our\npooling-based MHSA, we build a universal vision transformer backbone, dubbed\nPyramid Pooling Transformer (P2T). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when\napplied P2T as the backbone network, it shows substantial superiority in\nvarious vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation,\nobject detection, and instance segmentation, compared to previous CNN- and\ntransformer-based networks.

The 0.5-7 keV\npost-outburst (2019) spectrum of the pulsar is best described by a\ntwo-component blackbody plus powerlaw model with a temperature of 0.2\\pm0.1\nkeV, photon index of 1.8\\pm0.4 and X-ray luminosity of ~1.9e33 erg s^{-1},\nconsistent with its pre-burst quiescent phase. We find that the pulsar has gone\nback to quiescence. The compact nebula shows a jet-like morphology elongated in\nthe north-south direction, similar to the pre-burst phase. The post-outburst\nPWN spectrum is best fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a photon index of\n2.3\\pm0.5 and flux of ~3.2e-14 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} (0.5-7 keV). The PWN spectrum\nshows evidence of spectral softening in the post-outburst phase, with the\npre-burst photon index of 1.2\\pm0.4 changing to 2.3\\pm0.5, and pre-burst\nluminosity of ~1.5e32 erg s^{-1} changing to 2.7e32 erg s^{-1} in the 0.5-7 keV\nband, suggesting magnetar outbursts can impact PWNe. The observed timescale for\nreturning to quiescence, of just a few years, implies a rather fast cooling\nprocess and favors a scenario where J1119 is temporarily powered by magnetic\nenergy following the magnetar outburst, in addition to its spin-down energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 18:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Most prior works use\nneural network-based detectors or complex statistical analysis for adversarial\ndetection. These approaches are computationally intensive and vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. To this end, we propose DetectX - a hardware friendly\nadversarial detection mechanism using hardware signatures like Sum of column\nCurrents (SoI) in memristive crossbars (XBar). We show that adversarial inputs\nhave higher SoI compared to clean inputs. However, the difference is too small\nfor reliable adversarial detection. Hence, we propose a dual-phase training\nmethodology: Phase1 training is geared towards increasing the separation\nbetween clean and adversarial SoIs; Phase2 training improves the overall\nrobustness against different strengths of adversarial attacks. For\nhardware-based adversarial detection, we implement the DetectX module using\n32nm CMOS circuits and integrate it with a Neurosim-like analog crossbar\narchitecture.

So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was\nmodeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was\nextracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a\nnoisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve\ngeometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We\nachieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This\nis in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the\nvolume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as\nLaplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance\nfunction (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three\nbenefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in\nthe neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity\napproximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.\nAccurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and\nradiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape\nand appearance in volume rendering.

This is usually done utilizing an\napparent horizon. An alternative proposal is to identify a geometric horizon\n(GH), which is characterized by a surface in the spacetime on which the\ncurvature tensor or its covariant derivatives are algebraically special. This\nnecessitates the choice of a special null frame, which we shall refer to as an\nalgebraically preferred null frame (APNF). The GH is then identified by\nsurfaces of vanishing scalar curvature invariants but, unfortunately, these are\ndifficult to compute. However, the algebraic nature of a GH means that the APNF\nplays a central role and suggests a null frame approach to characterizing the\nGH. Indeed, if we employ the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm to completely fix the\nnull frame invariantly, then all of the remaining non vanishing components of\nthe curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives are Cartan scalars. Hence\nthe GH is characterized by the vanishing of certain Cartan scalars.\n  A null frame approach is useful in the numerical investigation of the merger\nof two black holes in general, but we will focus on the application to\nidentifying a GH. We begin with a review of the use of APNF and GH in previous\nwork. The APNF is then defined and chosen so that the Weyl tensor is\nalgebraically special, and we must examine the covariant derivatives of the\nWeyl tensor in this frame. We show how to invariantly fix the null frame, and\nhence characterize the APNF, and describe how to then identify the GH using the\nzero-set of certain Cartan scalars. Our ultimate aim is to apply this frame\nformalism to the numerical collapse of two black holes. As an example, we\ninvestigate the axisymmetric evolution of a two black hole Kastor-Traschen\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 20:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 08:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 09:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

We find propagation\nsheaths to be denser and driven by stronger MEs, whereas expansion sheaths are\nfaster. Exploring the temporal profiles of these sheaths with a superposed\nepoch technique, we observe that most of the magnetic field and plasma\nsignatures are more elevated in propagation sheaths relative to expansion\nsheaths. The second categorization is based on speed variations across sheaths.\nEmploying linear least squares regression, we categorize four distinct speed\nprofiles of the sheath plasma. We find that the associated shock properties and\nsolar cycle phase do not impact the occurrence of such variations. Our results\nalso highlight that the properties of the driving MEs are a major source of\nvariability in the sheath properties.

We show\nthat model fits of simple intimate mixtures including water ice do not provide\nsimultaneous matches to absorption band depths at 1.5 and 2.0 $\\mu m$ when\naccounting for the spectral continuum. Possible solutions include invoking a\nmore complex continuum, including both crystalline and amorphous water ice, and\nallowing for sub-micron sized grains. We show that mixtures including magnetite\nand the CM2 chondrite Murchison provide a flexible framework for interpreting\nspectral variation of bodies with neutral-sloped spectra like that of Nereid.\nMagnetite in particular provides a good match to the spectral continuum without\nrequiring the presence of Tholin-like organics. We note that carbonaceous\nchondrites and their components may be useful analogs for the non-ice\ncomponents of outer solar system bodies, consistent with recent findings by\nFraser et al. (2019). Comparison to spectra of large TNOs and satellites of\nUranus show that Nereid's low albedo, deep water bands, and neutral color is\ndistinct from many other icy objects, but such comparisons are limited by\nincomplete understanding of spectral variability among $\\sim$100km-sized icy\nbodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 22:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Training of such\nLSTM applications is computationally intensive due to the recurrent nature of\nhidden state computation that repeats for each time step. While sparsity in\nDeep Neural Nets has been widely seen as an opportunity for reducing\ncomputation time in both training and inference phases, the usage of non-ReLU\nactivation in LSTM RNNs renders the opportunities for such dynamic sparsity\nassociated with neuron activation and gradient values to be limited or\nnon-existent. In this work, we identify dropout induced sparsity for LSTMs as a\nsuitable mode of computation reduction. Dropout is a widely used regularization\nmechanism, which randomly drops computed neuron values during each iteration of\ntraining. We propose to structure dropout patterns, by dropping out the same\nset of physical neurons within a batch, resulting in column (row) level hidden\nstate sparsity, which are well amenable to computation reduction at run-time in\ngeneral-purpose SIMD hardware as well as systolic arrays.

As the electronic correlations become stronger often embedding\nmethods based on first principles approaches are used to better treat the\ncorrelations by solving a suitably chosen many-body Hamiltonian with a higher\nlevel theory. Such combined methods are often referred to as second principles\napproaches. At such level of the theory the self energy, i.e. the functional\nthat embodies the stronger electronic correlations, is either a function of\nenergy or momentum or both. The success of such theories is commonly measured\nby the quality of the self energy functional.

These transformations are typically selected from a set of\nfunctions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied\n(e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many\nnatural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through\nexamination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these\nnatural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold.\nSeveral techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie\ngroup operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However,\nthese approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when\ntraining their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of\nthe manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address\nthese limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require\ntransformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions\nwhere each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of\ninputs.

We found that the overall kinetics increases rapidly\nwith the decrease of droplets lateral radius R, as dR/dt ~ R^(-2). The faster\nincrease in the concentration of the product in smaller droplets contributes to\naccelerating reaction kinetics. The enhancement of reaction rates from small\ndroplet sizes was further confirmed when a non-reactive compound presented\ninside the droplets without reducing the concentrations of the reactant and the\nproduct on the droplet surface. The results of our study improve the\nunderstanding of chemical kinetics with droplets. Our findings highlight the\neffectiveness of small droplets for the design and control of enhanced chemical\nreactions in a broad range of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

We propose a transformer based SR model, named MrTransformer\n(Multi-preference Transformer), that concatenates some special tokens in front\nof the sequence to represent multiple user preferences and makes sure they\ncapture different aspects through a preference coverage mechanism. Then, we\ndevise a preference editing-based self-supervised learning mechanism for\ntraining MrTransformer which contains two main operations: preference\nseparation and preference recombination.

However, some hardware imperfections, which are generally\nneglected in the existing literature concerning lower data rates and\ntraditional operating frequencies, cannot be overlooked in the THz systems.\nHardware imperfections usually consist of phase noise, in-phase/quadrature\nimbalance, and nonlinearity of power amplifier. Due to the time-variant\ncharacteristic of phase noise, frequent pilot insertion is required, leading to\ndecreased spectral efficiency. In this paper, to address this issue, a novel\npilot design strategy is proposed based on index modulation (IM), where the\npositions of pilots are flexibly changed in the data frame, and additional\ninformation bits can be conveyed by indices of pilots. Furthermore, a turbo\nreceiving algorithm is developed, which jointly performs the detection of pilot\nindices and channel estimation in an iterative manner.

The detailed analyses of the impedance data in the form of\ndc-conductivity, ac-conductivity, electrical modulus, dielectric constant and\ncomplex polarizability reveal a long-range Na-ionic conductivity with\nnegligible contribution from a local dipole relaxation. A significant\nenhancement (~10^4 times) of the Na-ion conductivity has been found with the\nincreasing temperature from 353 K to 713 K. The temperature dependent\nconductivity reveals thermally activated conduction process with activation\nenergies of 0.161 and 0.377 eV over the two temperature regions of 383-518 K\nand 518-713 K, respectively. AC conductivity study reveals a long-range hopping\nprocess for the conduction of charge carriers with a sharp increase of the\nhopping range at 518 K. The scaling study of the ac-conductivity reveals that\nthe frequency-activated conductivity (above 10^4 Hz at 353 K) is mainly\ncontrolled by the critical frequency that increases with the increasing\ntemperature. The Na-ion conduction in Na2Mn3O7 occurs predominantly by a\ncorrelated barrier hopping process. Besides, a correlation between ionic\nconduction and crystal structure has been established by x-ray and neutron\ndiffraction study.

The resulting\ntrained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or\npathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),\nreaches accuracy exceeding 84\\% when classifying cough to the label provided by\nthe physicians' diagnosis. In order to classify subject's respiratory pathology\ncondition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The\nresulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\\% for all three respiratory\npathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate\namong the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of\npathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider\nthe healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to\nhave some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is\nabove 84\\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing\npathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the\nfact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy\nthe same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 05:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Such agents will undoubtedly be expected to explain their\nbehavior and decisions. While generating explanations is an actively researched\ntopic, most works tend to focus on methods that generate explanations that are\none size fits all. As in the specifics of the user-model are completely\nignored. The handful of works that look at tailoring their explanation to the\nuser's background rely on having specific models of the users (either analytic\nmodels or learned labeling models). The goal of this work is thus to propose an\nend-to-end adaptive explanation generation system that begins by learning the\ndifferent types of users that the agent could interact with. Then during the\ninteraction with the target user, it is tasked with identifying the type on the\nfly and adjust its explanations accordingly. The former is achieved by a\ndata-driven clustering approach while for the latter, we compile our\nexplanation generation problem into a POMDP. We demonstrate the usefulness of\nour system on two domains using state-of-the-art POMDP solvers. We also report\nthe results of a user study that investigates the benefits of providing\npersonalized explanations in a human-robot interaction setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

The popularity of Shapley values in the explanation setting is\nprobably due to its unique theoretical properties. The main drawback with\nShapley values, however, is that its computational complexity grows\nexponentially in the number of input features, making it unfeasible in many\nreal world situations where there could be hundreds or thousands of features.\nFurthermore, with many (dependent) features, presenting/visualizing and\ninterpreting the computed Shapley values also becomes challenging. The present\npaper introduces groupShapley: a conceptually simple approach for dealing with\nthe aforementioned bottlenecks. The idea is to group the features, for example\nby type or dependence, and then compute and present Shapley values for these\ngroups instead of for all individual features. Reducing hundreds or thousands\nof features to half a dozen or so, makes precise computations practically\nfeasible and the presentation and knowledge extraction greatly simplified. We\nprove that under certain conditions, groupShapley is equivalent to summing the\nfeature-wise Shapley values within each feature group. Moreover, we provide a\nsimulation study exemplifying the differences when these conditions are not\nmet. We illustrate the usability of the approach in a real world car insurance\nexample, where groupShapley is used to provide simple and intuitive\nexplanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 08:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Biomedical NER,\nthe task of recognising biomedical names, is usually employed as the first step\nof the NLP pipeline. Standard NER models, based on sequence tagging technique,\nare good at recognising short entity mentions in the generic domain. However,\nthere are several open challenges of applying these models to recognise\nbiomedical names: 1) Biomedical names may contain complex inner structure\n(discontinuity and overlapping) which cannot be recognised using standard\nsequence tagging technique; 2) The training of NER models usually requires\nlarge amount of labelled data, which are difficult to obtain in the biomedical\ndomain; and, 3) Commonly used language representation models are pre-trained on\ngeneric data; a domain shift therefore exists between these models and target\nbiomedical data.

The\ndistinguishing feature of this HPF method is the generic and modular\nrepresentation of the system components.

Binary evolution can result in fast-rotating stars, predicted to be\nobservable as Be stars, through accretion of angular momentum during\nmass-transfer phases. Despite numerous observational evidence pointing to this\npossibly being the dominant Be formation channel, current models struggle to\nproduce a satisfactory description of Be star populations.\n  Aims. Given distinct uncertainties in detailed binary evolution calculations,\nwe investigate a rigorous and model independent upper limit for the production\nof Be stars through binary interaction and aim to confront this limit with\nobservations of Be stars in young star clusters.\n  Methods. Using extreme assumptions, we calculate the number ratio of\npost-interaction to pre-interaction binary systems in a coeval population,\nwhich describes an upper limit to Be star formation through mass-transfer. A\ndetailed comparison is made between our derived upper limit and relevant\nobservations of Be stars, which allows us to probe several aspects of binary\nstar physics.\n  Results. We find that in coeval populations, binary interaction can at most\naccount for one third of all main-sequence stars being Be stars. Near the\ncluster turn-off region, this limit appears to be realised in the clusters\nstudied. Away from the turn-off, applying simple assumptions about which\nsystems undergo unstable mass-transfer produces a good fit to the observed Be\nfraction as a function of mass.\n  Conclusions.

However, these existing deep learning-based methods depend on\nan enormous amount of carefully labeled images. Meanwhile, noise is inevitably\nintroduced in the labeling process, degrading the performance of models. Hence,\nit's significant to devise robust training strategies to mitigate label noise\nin the medical image classification tasks. Methods: In this work, we propose a\nnovel Bayesian statistics guided label refurbishment mechanism (BLRM) for DNNs\nto prevent overfitting noisy images. BLRM utilizes maximum a posteriori\nprobability (MAP) in the Bayesian statistics and the exponentially\ntime-weighted technique to selectively correct the labels of noisy images. The\ntraining images are purified gradually with the training epochs when BLRM is\nactivated, further improving classification performance. Results: Comprehensive\nexperiments on both synthetic noisy images (public OCT & Messidor datasets) and\nreal-world noisy images (ANIMAL-10N) demonstrate that BLRM refurbishes the\nnoisy labels selectively, curbing the adverse effects of noisy data. Also, the\nanti-noise BLRM integrated with DNNs are effective at different noise ratio and\nare independent of backbone DNN architectures. In addition, BLRM is superior to\nstate-of-the-art comparative methods of anti-noise.

Indeed, such an identification process often\nneeds the maximal monotonicity of nonlinear elliptic operators (involved in the\ndoubly-nonlinear equations) as well as uniform estimates for approximate\nsolutions; however, even the monotonicity is violated due to a localization of\nthe equations, which is also necessary to derive local-energy estimates for\napproximate solutions.

However, they fail\nto work in the Kerr spacetime because not all variables can be separable, or\nnot all splitting parts have analytical solutions as explicit functions of\nproper time. To cope with this difficulty, we introduce a time transformation\nfunction to the Hamiltonian of Kerr geometry so as to obtain a time-transformed\nHamiltonian consisting of five splitting parts, whose analytical solutions are\nexplicit functions of the new coordinate time. The chosen time transformation\nfunction can cause time steps to be adaptive, but it is mainly used to\nimplement the desired splitting of the time transformed Hamiltonian. In this\nmanner, new explicit symplectic algorithms are easily available. Unlike Runge\nKutta integrators, the newly proposed algorithms exhibit good long term\nbehavior in the conservation of Hamiltonian quantities when appropriate fixed\ncoordinate time steps are considered. They are better than same order implicit\nand explicit mixed symplectic algorithms and extended phase space explicit\nsymplectic like methods in computational efficiency. The proposed idea on the\nconstruction of explicit symplectic integrators is suitable for not only the\nKerr metric but also many other relativistic problems, such as a Kerr black\nhole immersed in a magnetic field, a Kerr Newman black hole with an external\nmagnetic field, axially symmetric core shell systems, and five dimensional\nblack ring metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 12:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

By using\nfirst-principles electronic structure calculations in combination with a\nsemiclassical model, we have studied the electron-phonon coupling and\nmagnetoresistance of LaBi in the pressure range from 0 to 18 GPa. Our\ncalculations show that LaBi undergoes a structural phase transition from a\nface-centered cubic lattice to a primitive tetragonal lattice at $\\sim$7 GPa,\nverifying previous experimental results. Meanwhile, LaBi remains topologically\nnontrivial across the structural transition. Under all pressures that we have\nstudied, the phonon-mediated mechanism based on the weak electron-phonon\ncoupling cannot account for the observed superconductivity in LaBi, and the\ncalculated magnetoresistance for LaBi does not show a suppression. The distinct\ndifference between our calculations and experimental observations suggests\neither the existence of extra Bi impurities in the real LaBi compound or the\npossibility of other unknown mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 13:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

The\ncommunication channel between the vehicles of a platoon can be easily\ninfluenced by numerous factors, e.g. the surrounding environment, and the\nrelative states of the connected vehicles, etc. In addition, the trajectories\nof the vehicles depend significantly on the motion policies of the preceding\nvehicle shared via the wireless channel and any delay can impact the safety and\noptimality of its performance. In the presented algorithm, Gaussian Process\nlearns the wireless channel model and is involved in the Model Predictive\nController to generate a control sequence that not only minimizes the\nconventional motion costs, but also minimizes the estimated delay of the\nwireless channel in the future. This results in a farsighted controller that\nmaximizes the amount of transferred information beyond the controller's time\nhorizon, which in turn guarantees the safety and optimality of the generated\ntrajectories in the future. To decrease computational cost, the algorithm finds\nthe reachable set from the current state and focuses on that region to minimize\nthe size of the kernel matrix and related calculations.

Most\napplications to date have been in computer vision, although some work in\nhealthcare has started to emerge. The use of deep learning (DL) in cardiac MR\nsegmentation has led to impressive results in recent years, and such techniques\nare starting to be translated into clinical practice.

In the medical domain, multi-state models give the\npossibility of further investigating intermediate events such as relapse and\nremission. In this work, a further extension is proposed using relative\nsurvival, where mortality due to population causes (i.e. non-disease-related\nmortality) is evaluated. The objective is to split all mortality in disease and\nnon-disease-related mortality, with and without intermediate events, in\ndatasets where cause of death is not recorded or is uncertain. To this end,\npopulation mortality tables are integrated into the estimation process, while\nusing the basic relative survival idea that the overall mortality hazard can be\nwritten as a sum of a population and an excess part. Hence, we propose an\nupgraded non-parametric approach to estimation, where population mortality is\ntaken into account. Precise definitions and suitable estimators are given for\nboth the transition hazards and probabilities. Variance estimating techniques\nand confidence intervals are introduced and the behaviour of the new method is\ninvestigated through simulations. The newly developed methodology is\nillustrated by the analysis of a cohort of patients followed after an\nallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

One of the most critical\nproblems in the case of disruption is increasing short-circuit current level in\ngrids, which leads to change the protection devices settings in the downstream\nand upstream grid. By using fault current limiters (FCL), short-circuit\ncurrents in grids with distributed generation can be reduced to acceptable\nlevels, so there is no needed to change the protection relays settings of the\ndownstream grid (including distributed generations). However, by locating the\nFCL in the tie-feeder, the downstream grid is not more effective than the\nupstream grid and thus its reliability indices also will be changed. Therefore,\nthis paper shows that by locating the unidirectional fault current limiter\n(UFCL) in the tie-feeder, the necessity of changing in the relay protection\nsettings of upstream grids is prevented.

Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and\ndynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with\ncompromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal\nMRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices\nfor oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording\nthe dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes\nit difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods.\nTo address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal\nResolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised\nsuper-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice\nacquisitions.

The strategy to detect these\natomically thin crystals has however remained unchanged since the discovery of\ngraphene. Such an absence of evolution is starting to pose problems because for\nmany of the 2D materials of current interest the optical contrast provided by\nthe commonly used detection procedure is insufficient to identify the presence\nof individual monolayers or to determine unambiguously the thickness of\natomically thin multilayers. Here we explore an alternative detection strategy,\nin which the enhancement of optical contrast originates from the use of\noptically inhomogeneous substrates, leading to diffusively reflected light.\nOwing to its peculiar polarization properties and to its angular distribution,\ndiffusively reflected light allows a strong contrast enhancement to be achieved\nthrough the implementation of suitable illumination-detection schemes. We\nvalidate this conclusion by carrying out a detailed quantitative analysis of\noptical contrast, which fully reproduces our experimental observations on over\n60 WSe$_2$ mono-, bi-, and trilayers. We further validate the proposed strategy\nby extending our analysis to atomically thin phosphorene, InSe, and graphene\ncrystals. Our conclusion is that the use of diffusively reflected light to\ndetect and identify atomically thin layers is an interesting alternative to the\ncommon detection scheme based on Fabry-Perot interference, because it enables\natomically thin layers to be detected on substrates others than the commonly\nused Si/SiO$_2$, and it may offer higher sensitivity depending on the specific\n2D material considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 14:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The experimental results show that the hysteresis phenomenon would be\naffected by the dielectric constant of transport layers and scan rate\nsignificantly. To explain this, a modified Poisson and drift-diffusion solver\ncoupled with a fully time-dependent ion migration model is developed to analyze\nhow the ion migration affects the performance and hysteresis of PSCs. The\nsimulation model was optimized for carrier transportation of organic materials,\nwhich can simulate the organic transport layer correctly without using heavy\ndoping in simulating the organic transport layer. The modeling results show\nthat the most crucial factor in the hysteresis behavior is the built-in\nelectric field of the perovskite. The non-linear hysteresis curves are\ndemonstrated under different scan rates, and the mechanism of the hysteresis\nbehavior is explained. The findings reveal why the change in hysteresis degree\nwith scan rate is Gaussian shaped rather than monotonic. Additionally, other\nfactors contributing to the degree of hysteresis are determined to be the\ndegree of degradation in the perovskite material, the quality of the perovskite\ncrystal, and the materials of the transport layer, which corresponds to the\ntotal ion density, carrier lifetime of perovskite, and the dielectric constant\nof the transport layer, respectively. Finally, it was found that the dielectric\nconstant of the transport layer is a key factor affecting hysteresis in\nperovskite solar cells; a lower dielectric constant corresponds to a higher\nelectric field of the transport layer. Hence, if the electric field of the\nperovskite material is small, the degree of hysteresis is small and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 14:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 13:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

One widely used approach towards this goal is to visualize unit\nresponses via activation maximization. These synthetic feature visualizations\nare purported to provide humans with precise information about the image\nfeatures that cause a unit to be activated - an advantage over other\nalternatives like strongly activating natural dataset samples. If humans indeed\ngain causal insight from visualizations, this should enable them to predict the\neffect of an intervention, such as how occluding a certain patch of the image\n(say, a dog's head) changes a unit's activation. Here, we test this hypothesis\nby asking humans to decide which of two square occlusions causes a larger\nchange to a unit's activation. Both a large-scale crowdsourced experiment and\nmeasurements with experts show that on average the extremely activating feature\nvisualizations by Olah et al.

We use a two-stream grey model for radiative transfer and explore the\nbrown-dwarf and earth-like regimes.

This instability is similar in nature to diabatic convection\nand relies only on buoyancy with radiative transfer heating and cooling. When\nthe temperature is decreasing with height in the atmosphere, a lower-opacity\nmedium on top of a higher-opacity medium is dynamically unstable while a\nhigher-opacity medium on top of a lower-opacity medium is stable. This\nstability/instability behavior is reversed if the temperature is increasing\nwith height.

However,\nstate-of-the-art Network Security Monitors (NSMs) typically lack the necessary\nflexibility to handle the diversity of the packet-oriented layers below the\nabstraction of TCP/IP connections. In this work, we advance the software\narchitecture of a network security monitor to facilitate the flexible\nintegration of lower-layer protocol dissectors while maintaining required\nperformance levels. We proceed in three steps: First, we identify the\nchallenges for modular packet-level analysis, present a refined NSM\narchitecture to address them and specify requirements for its implementation.\nSecond, we evaluate the performance of data structures to be used for protocol\ndispatching, implement the proposed design into the popular open-source NSM\nZeek and assess its impact on the monitor performance. Our experiments show\nthat hash-based data structures for dispatching introduce a significant\noverhead while array-based approaches qualify for practical application.\nFinally, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed architecture and\nimplementation by migrating Zeek's previously hard-coded stack of link and\ninternet layer protocols to the new interface. Furthermore, we implement\ndissectors for non-IP based industrial communication protocols and leverage\nthem to realize attack detection strategies from recent applied research. We\nintegrate the proposed architecture into the Zeek open-source project and\npublish the implementation to support the scientific community as well as\npractitioners, promoting the transfer of research into practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 15:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

However, due to their\ncomplexity and large number of parameters, these (typically transformer-based)\nmodels are often non-interpretable in that ranking decisions can not be clearly\nattributed to specific parts of the input documents.\n  In this paper we propose ranking models that are inherently interpretable by\ngenerating explanations as a by-product of the prediction decision. We\nintroduce the Select-and-Rank paradigm for document ranking, where we first\noutput an explanation as a selected subset of sentences in a document.\nThereafter, we solely use the explanation or selection to make the prediction,\nmaking explanations first-class citizens in the ranking process. Technically,\nwe treat sentence selection as a latent variable trained jointly with the\nranker from the final output. To that end, we propose an end-to-end training\ntechnique for Select-and-Rank models utilizing reparameterizable subset\nsampling using the Gumbel-max trick.\n  We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach is\ncompetitive to state-of-the-art methods.

With a new class of dynamic\nfeedback, we propose kinematic and adaptive dynamic controllers for\nteleoperators with closed architecture, and we show that the proposed kinematic\nand dynamic controllers are robust with respect to arbitrary bounded\ntime-varying delay. In addition, by exploiting the input-output properties of\nan inverted form of the dynamics of robot manipulators with closed\narchitecture, we remove the assumption of uniform exponential stability of a\nlinear time-varying system due to the adaptation to the gains of the inner\ncontroller in demonstrating stability of the presented adaptive dynamic\ncontrol. The application of the proposed approach is illustrated by the\nexperimental results using a Phantom Omni and a UR10 robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 15:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

We exploit\nisotropic-to-anisotropic temporal boundaries within spatially subwavelength\nregions where their permittivity is rapidly changed in time. In so doing, it is\nshown how resulting scattered waves travel in directions that are different\nfrom the direction of the impinging wave, and depend on the values of the\nchosen anisotropic permittivity tensor. To provide a full physical insight of\ntheir performance, multiple scenarios are studied numerically such as the\neffect of using different values of permittivity tensor, different geometries\nof the spatiotemporal meta-atom and time duration of the induced\nisotropic-to-anisotropic temporal boundary.

Such events are useful for early warning for accident, protest, election\nor breaking news. However, neither the list of events nor the resolution of\nboth event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we\npropose an online spatio-temporal event detection system using social media\nthat is able to detect events at different time and space resolutions. First,\nto address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events, a\nquad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into\nmultiscale regions based on the density of social media data. Then, a\nstatistical unsupervised approach is performed that involves Poisson\ndistribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected\ndensity of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by\nmerging events happening in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A\npost processing stage is introduced to filter out events that are spam, fake or\nwrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social media entities\nto assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method\nis evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for\ndifferent cities: Melbourne, London, Paris and New York. To verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results with two baseline\nalgorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.\nFor performance evaluation, we manually compute recall and precision. We also\npropose a new quality measure named strength index, which automatically\nmeasures how accurate the reported event is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

Deep learning\nbased models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled\ndata on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade\non other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are\nposed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events,\nwhere large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding\nthe knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from\nscratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,\nexpensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those\nchallenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named\nMetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events\nwith a few verified posts.

Such digital texts\nhave attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden\nevolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing\napproaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a\ncurrent topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,\nthese approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring\nlatent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance\ndegradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all\nprior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the\nmulti-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between\nevolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across\ntime steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with\na set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully\ndiscomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate\nmodel is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the\ninference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter\nalgorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.\nIn addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is\nexploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the\nsparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The\nproposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against\nthe competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in\nterms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document\ntime prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 08:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Today's\napproaches mainly focus on modeling dynamic aspects of the traffic situation\nand try to predict traffic participants behavior based on this. In this article\nwe take a first step towards extending this common practice by calculating\nlocation-specific a-priori lane change probabilities. The idea behind this is\nstraight forward: The driving behavior of humans may vary in exactly the same\ntraffic situation depending on the respective location. E.g. drivers may ask\nthemselves: Should I pass the truck in front of me immediately or should I wait\nuntil reaching the less curvy part of my route lying only a few kilometers\nahead? Although, such information is far away from allowing behavior prediction\non its own, it is obvious that today's approaches will greatly benefit when\nincorporating such location-specific a-priori probabilities into their\npredictions. For example, our investigations show that highway interchanges\ntend to enhance driver's motivation to perform lane changes, whereas curves\nseem to have lane change-dampening effects. Nevertheless, the investigation of\nall considered local conditions shows that superposition of various effects can\nlead to unexpected probabilities at some locations. We thus suggest dynamically\nconstructing and maintaining a lane change probability map based on customer\nfleet data in order to support onboard prediction systems with additional\ninformation. For deriving reliable lane change probabilities a broad customer\nfleet is the key to success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 06:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, it is difficult to compute optimal VaR\nportfolios; that is, an optimal risk-reward portfolio allocation using VaR as\nthe risk measure. This is due to VaR being non-convex and of combinatorial\nnature. In particular, it is well known that the VaR portfolio problem can be\nformulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that is difficult to solve\nwith current MILP solvers for medium to large-scale instances of the problem.\nHere, we present an algorithm to compute near-optimal VaR portfolios that takes\nadvantage of this MILP formulation and provides a guarantee of the solution's\nnear-optimality. As a byproduct, we obtain an algorithm to compute tight lower\nbounds on the VaR portfolio problem that outperform related algorithms proposed\nin the literature for this purpose. The near-optimality guarantee provided by\nthe proposed algorithm is obtained thanks to the relation between minimum risk\nportfolios satisfying a reward benchmark and the corresponding maximum reward\nportfolios satisfying a risk benchmark. These alternate formulations of the\nportfolio allocation problem have been frequently studied in the case of convex\nrisk measures and concave reward functions. Here, this relationship is\nconsidered for general risk measures and reward functions.

This circulator is composing a\nnonreciprocal temporal phase shifter and two reciprocal delay-line-based phase\nshifters. The proposed nonreciprocal temporal phase shifter is based on the\ngeneration of time-harmonic signals, enforcing destructive interference for\nundesired time harmonics and constructive interference for desired time\nharmonics at different locations of the structure.
