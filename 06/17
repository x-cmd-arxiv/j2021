We study the\naggregates of clusters which share several of the assigned member stars in\nrelatively narrow volumes of the phase space. Using the most recent list of\nopen clusters, we compare the cited central parallaxes with the histograms of\nparallax distributions of cluster aggregates. The aggregates were chosen based\non the member stars which are shared by multiple clusters. Many of the clusters\nin the aggregates have been assigned parallaxes which coincide with the\nhistograms. However, clusters that share a large number of members in a small\nvolume of the phase space display parallax distributions which do not coincide\nwith the values from the literature. This is the result of ignoring a\npossibility of assigning multiple probabilities to a single star. We propose\nthat this small number of clusters should be analysed anew.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

With given\ncomputational power in hand, efficient data analysis techniques can expand the\nsize and dimensionality of the parameter space to search for a variety of GW\nsources. Matched filtering based analyses that depend on modeled signals to\nproduce adequate signal-to-noise ratios for signal detection may miss them if\nthe parameter space is too restrained. Specifically, the CBC search is\ncurrently limited to non-precessing binaries only, where the spins of the\ncomponents are either aligned or anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum.\nA hierarchical search for CBCs is thus well motivated. The first stage of this\nsearch is performed by matched filtering coarsely sampled data with a coarse\ntemplate bank to look for candidate events. These candidates are then followed\nup for a finer search around the vicinity of an event's parameter space.\nPerforming such a search leads to enormous savings in computational cost.

When using a Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Space (RKHS) to define the function class, we show that the KALE\ncontinuously interpolates between the KL and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD).

Therefore, identifying and\nultimately resolve it quickly is highly important. However, in the production\nenvironment running on the cloud, memory leak detection is a challenge without\nthe knowledge of the application or its internal object allocation details.\n  This paper addresses this challenge of detection of memory leaks in\ncloud-based infrastructure without having any internal knowledge by introducing\ntwo novel machine learning-based algorithms: Linear Backward Regression (LBR)\nand Precog and, their two variants: Linear Backward Regression with Change\nPoints Detection (LBRCPD) and Precog with Maximum Filteration (PrecogMF). These\nalgorithms only use one metric i.e the system's memory utilization on which the\napplication is deployed for detection of a memory leak. The developed\nalgorithm's accuracy was tested on 60 virtual machines manually labeled memory\nutilization data and it was found that the proposed PrecogMF algorithm achieves\nthe highest accuracy score of 85%. The same algorithm also achieves this by\ndecreasing the overall compute time by 80% when compared to LBR's compute time.\n  The paper also presents the different memory leak patterns found in the\nvarious memory leak applications and are further classified into different\nclasses based on their visual representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

Both water\npotential and hydraulic resistance vary spatially throughout the leaf transport\nnetwork, consisting of xylem, stomata and water-storage cells, and portions of\nleaf areas far from the leaf base can be disproportionately disadvantaged under\nwater stress. Besides the suppression of transpiration and reduction of water\nloss caused by stomatal closure, the leaf capacitance of water storage, which\ncan also vary locally, is thought to be crucial for the maintenance of leaf\nwater status. In order to study the fluid dynamics in these networks, we\ndevelop a spatially explicit, capacitive model which is able to capture the\nlocal spatiotemporal changes of water potential and flow rate. In\nelectrical-circuit analogues described by Ohm's law, we implement linear\ncapacitors imitating water storage, and we present both analytical calculations\nof a uniform one-dimensional model and numerical simulation methods for general\nspatially explicit network models, and their relation to conventional\nlumped-element models. Calculation and simulation results are shown for the\nuniform model, which mimics key properties of a monocotyledonous grass leaf. We\nillustrate water status of a well-watered leaf, and the lowering of water\npotential and transpiration rate caused by excised water source or reduced air\nhumidity. We show that the time scales of these changes under water stress are\nhugely affected by leaf capacitance and resistances to capacitors, in addition\nto stomatal resistance. Through this modeling of a grass leaf, we confirm the\npresence of uneven water distribution over leaf area, and also discuss the\nimportance of considering the spatial variation of leaf hydraulic traits in\nplant biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

We\ninvestigate the phase behavior of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)\nunder the addition of a non--adsorbing polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG). From\nsmall angle x-ray scattering we infer that the eGFP undergoes dimerization and\nwe treat the dimers as spherocylinders with aspect ratio $L/D-1 = 1.05$.\nDespite the complex nature of the proteins, we find that the phase behaviour is\nsimilar to that of hard spherocylinders with ideal polymer depletant,\nexhibiting aggregation and, in a small region of the phase diagram,\ncrystallization. By comparing our measurements of the onset of aggregation with\npredictions for hard colloids and ideal polymers [S.V. Savenko and M. Dijkstra,\nJ. Chem.

In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods.

Here, extending analysis of multiple\nvirus and immune response populations in a resource - prey (consumer) -\npredator model from Browne and Smith \\cite{browne2018dynamics}, we show that\nlong term dynamics of viral mutants evolving resistance at distinct epitopes\n(viral proteins targeted by immune responses) are governed by epistasis in the\nvirus fitness landscape. In particular, the stability of persistent equilibrium\nvirus-immune (prey-predator) network structures, such as nested and one-to-one,\nand bifurcations are determined by a collection of circuits defined by\ncombinations of viral fitnesses that are minimally additive within a hypercube\nof binary sequences representing all possible viral epitope sequences ordered\naccording to immunodominance hierarchy. Numerical solutions of our ordinary\ndifferential equation system, along with an extended stochastic version\nincluding random mutation, demonstrate how pairwise or multiplicative epistatic\ninteractions shape viral evolution against concurrent immune responses and\nconvergence to the multi-variant steady state predicted by theoretical results.\nFurthermore, simulations illustrate how periodic infusions of subdominant\nimmune responses can induce a bifurcation in the persistent viral strains,\noffering superior host outcome over an alternative strategy of immunotherapy\nwith strongest immune response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

The pandemic has made a\nsignificant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The\npast year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic\nspreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework\nto study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework\nextends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex\nnetworks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically\nequivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities\nbased on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics.\nMeanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is\nreciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the\ncoupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a\ngiven herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given\nepidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic\nsubstitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent\nnetwork to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop\nstructure-preserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent\nproperties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics.

In this paper, we quantify the interloper bias\nto LIM lensing for the first time, and derive a ''LIM-pair'' estimator which\navoids it exactly after cross-correlating with CMB lensing.

As a result, this\nforeground avoidance method is robust to even large changes in the amplitude of\nthe interloper power and non-Gaussianity.

Despite\nthe subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation,\nboth learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure\nbetween existing training tasks could lead to better generalization and\nadaptation. In this paper, we take one important step further to understand the\nclose connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical investigation. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms.

Although mostly framed since in\nterms of satellite counts in luminosity space, the missing satellites problem\nwas originally posed in velocity space.

In this work, we completeness correct the MW\nsatellite stellar velocity dispersion function down to its ultrafaint dwarfs\n($L \\gtrsim 340$ L$_\\odot$). Our most conservative completeness correction is\nin good agreement with a simple CDM model in which massive, classical\nsatellites (M$_{\\rm 200} \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^8~$M$_\\odot$) have baryon-driven\ncores, while lower mass, ultrafaint satellites inhabit cuspy halos that are not\nstrongly tidally stripped.

The linear model is then evaluated on both its ability to\nclassify images it just saw, and also on images from previous iterations. This\ngives rise to representations that favor quick knowledge retention with minimal\nforgetting.

The latent components are assumed to\nreside in the probability simplex, and are transformed by an unknown\npost-nonlinear mixing system. This problem finds various applications in signal\nand data analytics, e.g., nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing, image embedding,\nand nonlinear clustering. Linear mixture learning problems are already\nill-posed, as identifiability of the target latent components is hard to\nestablish in general. With unknown nonlinearity involved, the problem is even\nmore challenging. Prior work offered a function equation-based formulation for\nprovable latent component identification. However, the identifiability\nconditions are somewhat stringent and unrealistic. In addition, the\nidentifiability analysis is based on the infinite sample (i.e., population)\ncase, while the understanding for practical finite sample cases has been\nelusive. Moreover, the algorithm in the prior work trades model expressiveness\nwith computational convenience, which often hinders the learning performance.\nOur contribution is threefold. First, new identifiability conditions are\nderived under largely relaxed assumptions. Second, comprehensive sample\ncomplexity results are presented -- which are the first of the kind.

Jupiter has been the most well-studied giant planet in terms of its\natmosphere; however, the origin of the Jovian atmospheric composition remains a\npuzzle as the abundances of nitrogen and noble gases as high as those of other\nelements could only originate from extremely cold environments. We propose a\nnovel idea for explaining the Jovian atmospheric composition: Dust pileup at\nthe H$_2$O snow line casts a shadow and cools the Jupiter orbit so that N$_2$\nand noble gases can freeze. Planetesimals or a core formed in the shadowed\nregion can enrich nitrogen and noble gases as much as other elements through\ntheir dissolution in the envelope. We compute the temperature structure of a\nshadowed protosolar disk with radiative transfer calculations. Then, we\ninvestigate the radial volatile distributions and predict the atmospheric\ncomposition of Jupiter with condensation calculations. We find that the\nvicinity of the current Jupiter orbit, approximately $3$--$7~{\\rm AU}$, could\nbe as cold as $30~{\\rm K}$ if the small-dust surface density varies by a factor\nof $\\gtrsim30$ across the H$_2$O snow line. According to previous grain growth\nsimulations, this condition could be achieved by weak disk turbulence if\nsilicate grains are more fragile than icy grains. The shadow can cause the\ncondensation of most volatile substances, namely N$_2$ and Ar. We demonstrate\nthat the dissolution of shadowed solids can explain the elemental abundance\npatterns of the Jovian atmosphere even if proto-Jupiter was formed near\nJupiter's current orbit. The disk shadow may play a vital role in controlling\natmospheric compositions. The effect of the shadow also impacts the\ninterpretation of upcoming observations of exoplanetary atmospheres by JWST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In this work, we\ntheoretically and experimentally investigate how an off-resonant drive on the\ntransmon ancilla modifies the nonlinearities of cavity modes in qualitatively\ndifferent ways, depending on the interrelation among cavity-transmon detuning,\ndrive-transmon detuning and transmon anharmonicity. For a cavity-transmon\ndetuning that is smaller than or comparable to the drive-transmon detuning and\ntransmon anharmonicity, the off-resonant transmon drive can induce multiphoton\nresonances among cavity and transmon excitations that strongly modify cavity\nnonlinearities as drive parameters vary. For a large cavity-transmon detuning,\nthe drive induces cavity-photon-number-dependent ac Stark shifts of transmon\nlevels that translate into effective cavity nonlinearities. In the regime of\nweak transmon-cavity coupling, the cavity Kerr nonlinearity relates to the\nthird-order nonlinear susceptibility function $\\chi^{(3)}$ of the driven\nancilla. This susceptibility function provides a numerically efficient way of\ncomputing the cavity Kerr particularly for systems with many cavity modes\ncontrolled by a single transmon.

Because our approach stands on the U-statistics based\nclustering framework of the methods in R package uclust, it inherits its\ncharacteristics being a non-parametric method relying on very few assumptions\nabout the data, and thus can be applied to a wide range of dataset. Furthermore\nour method aims to be a more powerful tool to find the best partitions of the\ndata into three groups when that particular structure is present. In order to\ndo so, we first propose an extension of the test U-statistic and develop its\nasymptotic theory. Additionally we propose a ternary non-nested significance\nclustering method. Our approach is tested through multiple simulations and\nfound to have more statistical power than competing alternatives in all\nscenarios considered. Applications to peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to\nimage recognition shows the versatility of our proposal, presenting a superior\nperformance when compared with other approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 20:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

As a consequence of their goal of\nsuppressing starlight, coronagraphic instruments for high-contrast imaging have\nparticularly complex field-dependent point-spread-functions (PSFs). The Roman\nCoronagraph Instrument (CGI), Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) is one example. The\npurpose of the HLC is to image exoplanets and exozodiacal dust in order to\nunderstand dynamics of solar systems. This paper details how images of\nexoplanets and exozodiacal dust are simulated using some of the most recent\nPSFs generated for the CGI HLC imaging mode. First, PSFs are generated using\nphysical optics propagation techniques. Then, the angular offset of pixels in\nimage scenes, such as exozodiacal dust models, are used to create a library of\ninterpolated PSFs using interpolation and rotation techniques, such that the\ninterpolated PSFs correspond to angular offsets of the pixels. This means\ninterpolation needs only be done once and an image can then be simulated by\nmultiplying the vector array of the model astrophysical scene by the matrix\narray of the interpolated PSF data. This substantially reduces the time\nrequired to generate image simulations by reducing the process to matrix\nmultiplication, allowing for faster scene analysis. We will detail the steps\nrequired to generate coronagraphic scenes, quantify the speed-up of our matrix\napproach versus other implementations, and provide example code for users who\nwish to simulate their own scenes using publicly available HLC PSFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 20:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

To harvest the past efforts on MILPs and MISOCPs, this paper\npresents second-order conic (SOC) and polyhedral approximation schemes for the\nexponential cone with application to MIECPs. To do so, we first extend and\ngeneralize existing SOC approximation approaches in the extended space, propose\nnew scaling and shifting methods, prove approximation accuracies, and derive\nlower bounds of approximations.

The trajectory generation problem is almost always\nnonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient\nand reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle. The three algorithms that\nwe discuss use problem reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to\nnonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a\nconvex optimizer.

To answer this question, we perform a large-scale analysis of\npopular model compression techniques which uncovers several intriguing\npatterns. Notably, in contrast to traditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine\ntuning and gradual magnitude pruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\"\napproaches can surprisingly be used to produce CARDs, including binary-weight\nCARDs.

The present study addresses\nthis question by evaluating human-AI interactions using Grice's four maxims; we\ndemonstrate that humans do, indeed, apply these maxims to interactions with AI,\neven making explicit references to the AI's performance through a Gricean lens.\nTwenty-three participants interacted with an American English-speaking Alexa\nand rated and discussed their experience with an in-lab researcher. Researchers\nthen reviewed each exchange, identifying those that might relate to Grice's\nmaxims: Quantity, Quality, Manner, and Relevance. Many instances of explicit\nuser frustration stemmed from violations of Grice's maxims. Quantity violations\nwere noted for too little but not too much information, while Quality\nviolations were rare, indicating trust in Alexa's responses. Manner violations\nfocused on speed and humanness. Relevance violations were the most frequent,\nand they appear to be the most frustrating. While the maxims help describe many\nof the issues participants encountered, other issues do not fit neatly into\nGrice's framework.

To address this gap, we propose\nthe addition of human Priority to describe human-AI interaction. Humans and AIs\nare not conversational equals, and human initiative takes priority.

With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance, when the\ninput vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results\ncan be generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight\ncan be either positive or negative, but the in-situ computation assumes all\ncells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current architectures\neither use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an\noffset to weights so that all values become positive. Neither solution is\nideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset\ncircuity. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes FORMS, a\nfine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of\ntrying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is\nto enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that\nall weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally\navoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely generated\nusing alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized\noptimization, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To\nachieve high accuracy, we propose to use fine-grained sub-array columns, which\nprovide a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, significantly avoiding\nunnecessary computations. It also makes the hardware much easier to implement.\nPutting all together, with the same optimized models, FORMS achieves\nsignificant throughput improvement and speed up in frame per second over ISAAC\nwith similar area cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 21:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Analysis of the strongest Sel4Sel networks reveals a general\ntendency to favor highly novel individuals early on, with a gradual shift\ntowards fitness-based selection as deceptive local optima are bypassed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 22:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

The accuracy of the predicted flow deteriorates with distance\nfrom the wall, most precipitously across the buffer layer beyond which only\nlarge-scale structures are reconstructed. To quantify the difficulty of the\nstate estimation, the Hessian of the associated cost function is evaluated at\nthe true solution. The forward-adjoint duality is exploited to efficiently\ncompute the Hessian matrix from the ensemble-averaged cross-correlation of the\nadjoint fields due to impulses at the sensing locations and times.\nCharacteristics of the Hessian are examined when observations correspond to the\nstreamwise or spanwise wall shear stress or wall pressure. Most of the\neigenmodes decay beyond the buffer layer, thus demonstrating weak sensitivity\nof wall observations to the turbulence in the bulk. However, when the\nmeasurement time $t_m^+ \\gtrsim 20$, some streamwise-elongated Hessian\neigenfunctions remain finite in the outer flow, which corresponds to the\nsensitivity of wall observations to outer large-scale motions. Furthermore, we\nreport statistics of the adjoint-field kinetic-energy budget at long times,\nwhich are distinctly different from those of the forward model. One notable\ndifference is the high concentration of energy within the buffer layer and its\nnarrower support.

We show that our approach significantly\noutperforms other self-supervised methods on the Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW)\ndataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Lip Reading Sentences 2\n(LRS2) using only a fraction of the total labelled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 23:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Expect for frequently changing bursty load, fluctuated service time at\nstorage backend also drastically changes the need of cores. In order to\nguarantee tail latency service level objectives (SLOs), the abrupt changing\nneed of cores must be satisfied immediately. Otherwise, tail latency SLO\nviolation happens.

First, we show that the\npreconditioned Lasso can solve a large class of sparse linear regression\nproblems nearly optimally: it succeeds whenever the dependency structure of the\ncovariates, in the sense of the Markov property, has low treewidth -- even if\n$\\Sigma$ is highly ill-conditioned. Second, we construct (for the first time)\nrandom-design instances which are provably hard for an optimally preconditioned\nLasso. In fact, we complete our treewidth classification by proving that for\nany treewidth-$t$ graph, there exists a Gaussian Markov Random Field on this\ngraph such that the preconditioned Lasso, with any choice of preconditioner,\nrequires $\\Omega(t^{1/20})$ samples to recover $O(\\log n)$-sparse signals when\ncovariates are drawn from this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 02:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Consensus has been reached on a set of representative\nresearch problems in services computing, such as service selection, service\ncomposition, service recommendation, and service quality prediction. An obvious\nfact is that most services keep constant changes to timely adapt to changes of\nexternal business/technical environment and changes of internal development\nstrategies. However, traditional services computing research does not consider\nsuch changes sufficiently. Many works regard services as \\textit{static}\nentities; this leads to the situation that some proposed models/algorithms do\nnot work in real world. Sensing various types of service changes is of great\nsignificance to the practicability and rationality of services computing\nresearch. In this paper, a new research problem \\textit{External Service\nSensing} (ESS) is defined to cope with various changes in services, and a\nresearch framework of ESS is presented to elaborate the scope and boundary of\nESS. This framework is composed of four orthogonal dimensions: sensing objects,\nsensing contents, sensing channels, and sensing techniques. Each concrete ESS\nproblem is defined by combining different values in these dimensions, and\nexisting research work related to service changes can be well adapted to this\nframework. Real-world case studies demonstrate the soundness of ESS and its\nframework. Finally, some challenges and opportunities in ESS research are\nlisted for researchers in the services computing community. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time to systematically define service\nchange-related research as a standard services computing problem, and thus\nbroadening the research scope of services computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 02:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

However, despite the tremendous progress, deep learning models are\noften prone to adversarial attacks, which can significantly threaten the\nrobustness and generalizability of these models by leading them to\nmisclassification with unexpected inputs. To address the above issue, many deep\nlearning testing approaches have been proposed, however, these approaches\nmainly focus on testing deep learning applications in the domains of image,\naudio, and text analysis, etc., which cannot be directly applied to neural\nmodels for code due to the unique properties of programs. In this paper, we\npropose a coverage-based fuzzing framework, CoCoFuzzing, for testing deep\nlearning-based code processing models. In particular, we first propose ten\nmutation operators to automatically generate valid and semantically preserving\nsource code examples as tests; then we propose a neuron coverage-based approach\nto guide the generation of tests. We investigate the performance of CoCoFuzzing\non three state-of-the-art neural code models, i.e., NeuralCodeSum, CODE2SEQ,\nand CODE2VEC. Our experiment results demonstrate that CoCoFuzzing can generate\nvalid and semantically preserving source code examples for testing the\nrobustness and generalizability of these models and improve the neuron\ncoverage.

However, its flexibility is limited due to lack\nof adaptiveness, i.e., manual fixing or tuning the appropriate homotopy\ncoefficients. To address the problem above, we propose a novel adaptive\nhomotopy framework (AH) in which the Maclaurin duality is employed, such that\nthe homotopy parameters can be adaptively obtained. Accordingly, the proposed\nAH can be widely utilized to enhance the homotopy-based algorithm. In\nparticular, in this paper, we apply AH to contrastive learning (AHCL) such that\nit can be effectively transferred from weak-supervised learning (given label\npriori) to unsupervised learning, where soft labels of contrastive learning are\ndirectly and adaptively learned. Accordingly, AHCL has the adaptive ability to\nextract deep features without any sort of prior information. Consequently, the\naffinity matrix formulated by the related adaptive labels can be constructed as\nthe deep Laplacian graph that incorporates the topology of deep representations\nfor the inputs.

Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning.

Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n  We formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 05:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Many learning-based methods have been proposed to learn an\nexploration strategy. In the frontier-based exploration, learning algorithms\ntend to learn the optimal or near-optimal frontier to explore. Most of these\nmethods represent the environments as fixed size images and take these as\ninputs to neural networks. However, the size of environments is usually\nunknown, which makes these methods fail to generalize to real world scenarios.\nTo address this issue, we present a novel state representation method based on\n4D point-clouds-like information, including the locations, frontier, and\ndistance information. We also design a neural network that can process these 4D\npoint-clouds-like information and generate the estimated value for each\nfrontier. Then this neural network is trained using the typical reinforcement\nlearning framework. We test the performance of our proposed method by comparing\nit with other five methods and test its scalability on a map that is much\nlarger than maps in the training set.

Particularly,\nthe MAP first determines a set of the best MUs for the FL process based on the\nMUs' provided information/features. To mitigate straggling problems with\nprivacy-awareness, each selected MU can then encrypt part of local data and\nupload the encrypted data to the MAP for an encrypted training process, in\naddition to the local training process. For that, each selected MU can propose\na contract to the MAP according to its expected trainable local data and\nprivacy-protected encrypted data.

Our consideration is made on LES of\nturbulent channel flows with a first grid point set relatively far from the\nwall ($\\sim$ 10 wall units), while still resolving the near-wall region, to\npresent a new path to save the computational cost. Convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is utilized to estimate a virtual wall-surface velocity from $x-z$\nsectional fields near the wall, whose training data are generated by a direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) at ${\\rm Re}_{\\tau}=180$. The virtual wall-surface\nvelocity is prepared with the extrapolation of the DNS data near the wall. This\nidea enables us to give a proper wall condition to correct a velocity gradient\nnear the wall. The estimation ability of the model from near wall information\nis first investigated as a priori test. The estimated velocity fields by the\npresent CNN model are in statistical agreement with the reference DNS data. The\nmodel trained in a priori test is then combined with the LES as a posteriori\ntest. We find that the LES can successfully be augmented using the present\nmodel at both the friction Reynolds number ${\\rm Re}_{\\tau}=180$ used for\ntraining and the unseen Reynolds number ${\\rm Re}_{\\tau}=360$ even when the\nfirst grid point is located at 5 wall units off the wall. We also investigate\nthe robustness of the present model for the choice of sub-grid scale model and\nthe possibility of transfer learning in a local domain. The observations\nthrough the paper suggest that the present model is a promising tool for\nrecovering the accuracy of LES with a coarse grid near the wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 06:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

In the accretion flows around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei\nsuch as M87, electrons and ions are not in thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the\nelectron temperature, which is important for the thermal synchrotron radiation\nat EHT frequencies of 230 GHz, is not independently determined. In this work,\nwe investigate the commonly used parameterised ion-to-electron temperature\nratio prescription, the so-called R-$\\beta$ model, considering images at 230\nGHz by comparing with electron-heating prescriptions obtained from\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of magnetised\naccretion flows in a Magnetically Arrested Disc (MAD) regime with different\nrecipes for the electron thermodynamics. When comparing images at 230 GHz, we\nfind a very good match between images produced with the R-$\\beta$ prescription\nand those produced with the turbulent- and magnetic reconnection- heating\nprescriptions.

From this\ncomparative study of different physical aspects, which include the image,\nvisibilities, broadband spectra, and light curves, we conclude that, within the\ncontext of images at 230 GHz relative to MAD accretion flows around\nsupermassive black holes, the commonly-used and simple R-$\\beta$ model is able\nto reproduce well the various and more complex electron-heating prescriptions\nconsidered here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 06:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

However, most existing GNNs are oriented\ntoward homogeneous graphs, and in which each layer can only aggregate the\ninformation of one-hop neighbors. Stacking multilayer networks introduces\nconsiderable noise and easily leads to over smoothing. We propose here a\nmultihop heterogeneous neighborhood information fusion graph representation\nlearning method (MHNF). Specifically, we propose a hybrid metapath autonomous\nextraction model to efficiently extract multihop hybrid neighbors. Then, we\nformulate a hop-level heterogeneous information aggregation model, which\nselectively aggregates different-hop neighborhood information within the same\nhybrid metapath. Finally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF)\nis constructed, which can efficiently integrate different-hop and\ndifferent-path neighborhood information. In this fashion, this paper solves the\nproblem of aggregating multihop neighborhood information and learning hybrid\nmetapaths for target tasks. This mitigates the limitation of manually\nspecifying metapaths. In addition, HSAF can extract the internal node\ninformation of the metapaths and better integrate the semantic information\npresent at different levels.

One example of\nsuch adversities is the electromigration (EM) effects in the through-silicon\nvias (TSVs) of the power delivery network (PDN) of 3D-stacked DRAM\narchitectures. Several prior works have addressed the effects of EM in TSVs of\n3D integrated circuits. However, no prior work has addressed the effects of EM\nin the PDN TSVs on the performance and lifetime of 3D-stacked DRAMs. In this\npaper, we characterize the effects of EM in PDN TSVs on a Hybrid Memory Cube\n(HMC) architecture employing the conventional PDN design with clustered layout\nof power and ground TSVs.

Our benchmark-driven simulation-based analysis shows\nthat compared to the clustered PDN layout, our proposed distributed PDN layout\nimproves the EM-affected lifetime of the HMC architecture by up to 10 years.\nDuring this useful lifetime, the HMC architecture yields up to 1.51 times less\nenergy-delay product (EDP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 08:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

In classical software engineering, lifecycles are used to\ndocument the process of designing, implementing, maintaining, analyzing, and\nadapting software. Such lifecycles provide a common understanding of how to\ndevelop and operate an application, which is especially important due to the\ninterdisciplinary nature of quantum computing. Since today`s quantum\napplications are, in most cases, hybrid, consisting of quantum and classical\nprograms, the lifecycle for quantum applications must involve the development\nof both kinds of programs. However, the existing lifecycles only target the\ndevelopment of quantum or classical programs in isolation. Additionally, the\nvarious programs must be orchestrated, e.g., using workflows. Thus, the\ndevelopment of quantum applications also incorporates the workflow lifecycle.\nIn this chapter, we analyze the software artifacts usually comprising a quantum\napplication and present their corresponding lifecycles. Furthermore, we\nidentify the points of connection between the various lifecycles and integrate\nthem into the overall quantum software development lifecycle. Therefore, the\nintegrated lifecycle serves as a basis for the development and execution of\nhybrid quantum applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 08:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

The purpose of this\nhand is to grasp complex-shaped workpieces as they leave the machining centres.\nAmong the taxonomy of grips, cylindrical and spherical grips are often used to\ngrasp heavy objects. A combination of these two modes makes it possible to\ncapture most of the workpieces machined with 5-axis machines. However, the\nchange in grasping mode requires the fingers to reconfigure themselves to\nperform spatial movements.

This article proposes to extend the notion of under-actuated fingers to\nspatial movements.

Although promising, blockchains and smart contracts have no access\nto the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events\nresides; consequently, the usability of smart contracts in terms of performance\nand programmability would be limited to the on-chain data.

This paper studies the operation of channel shuffle as a\nregularization technique in deep convolutional networks. We show that while\nrandom shuffling of channels during training drastically reduce their\nperformance, however, randomly shuffling small patches between channels\nsignificantly improves their performance. The patches to be shuffled are picked\nfrom the same spatial locations in the feature maps such that a patch, when\ntransferred from one channel to another, acts as structured noise for the later\nchannel. We call this method \"ShuffleBlock\". The proposed ShuffleBlock module\nis easy to implement and improves the performance of several baseline networks\non the task of image classification on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. It also\nachieves comparable and in many cases better performance than many other\nregularization methods. We provide several ablation studies on selecting\nvarious hyperparameters of the ShuffleBlock module and propose a new scheduling\nmethod that further enhances its performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 10:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

One of its key challenges is\nthe potential convergence of the dynamics to unphysical fixed points. The\nstatistical sampling process at such a fixed point is not based on the physical\naction and hence leads to wrong predictions.

The convex partial correlation selection method\n(CONCORD) developed by Khare et al. (2015) has recently been credited with some\ntheoretical properties for estimating sparse precision matrices. The CONCORD\nobtains its solution by a coordinate descent algorithm (CONCORD-CD) based on\nthe convexity of the objective function. However, since a coordinate-wise\nupdate in CONCORD-CD is inherently serial, a scale-up is nontrivial. In this\npaper, we propose a novel parallelization of CONCORD-CD, namely, CONCORD-PCD.\nCONCORD-PCD partitions the off-diagonal elements into several groups and\nupdates each group simultaneously without harming the computational convergence\nof CONCORD-CD. We guarantee this by employing the notion of edge coloring in\ngraph theory. Specifically, we establish a nontrivial correspondence between\nscheduling the updates of the off-diagonal elements in CONCORD-CD and coloring\nthe edges of a complete graph. It turns out that CONCORD-PCD simultaneously\nupdates off-diagonal elements in which the associated edges are colorable with\nthe same color. As a result, the number of steps required for updating\noff-diagonal elements reduces from p(p-1)/2 to p-1 (for even p) or p (for odd\np), where p denotes the number of variables. We prove that the number of such\nsteps is irreducible In addition, CONCORD-PCD is tailored to single-instruction\nmultiple-data (SIMD) parallelism. A numerical study shows that the\nSIMD-parallelized PCD algorithm implemented in graphics processing units (GPUs)\nboosts the CONCORD-CD algorithm multiple times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 10:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

No clear extended multi-wavelength counterpart of\nthe LHAASO source has been found from the radio to sub-TeV bands. The LHAASO\nobservations are consistent with the scenario that VHE electrons escaped from\nthe pulsar, diffused in the interstellar medium, and scattered the interstellar\nradiation field. If interpreted as the pulsar halo scenario, the diffusion\ncoefficient, inferred for electrons with median energies of $\\sim160$~TeV, is\nconsistent with those obtained from the extended halos around Geminga and\nMonogem and much smaller than that derived from cosmic ray secondaries. The\nLHAASO discovery of this source thus likely enriches the class of so-called\npulsar halos and confirms that high-energy particles generally diffuse very\nslowly in the disturbed medium around pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 11:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

The state follows a Markov chain, that is\ncontrolled by both players. Actions and states are imperfectly observed by\nplayers, who receive a private signal at each stage. Mertens (ICM 1986)\nconjectured two properties regarding games with long duration: first, that\nlimit value always exists, second, that when Player 1 is more informed than\nPlayer 2, she can guarantee uniformly the limit value. These conjectures were\ndisproved recently by the author, but remain widely open in many subclasses. A\nwell-known particular subclass is the one of absorbing games with incomplete\ninformation on both sides, in which the state can move at most once during the\ngame, and players get a private signal about it at the outset of the game.

Here, we report a graphene field-effect\ntransistor (FET) on a diamond substrate, with a $f_{max}$ up to 54 GHz for a\ngate length of 500 nm. The high thermal conductivity of diamond provides an\nefficient heat-sink, and its relatively high optical-phonon energy improves\nsaturation velocity of carriers in the graphene channel. Moreover, we show that\ngraphene FETs on diamond, with different gate lengths, exhibit excellent\nscaling behavior. These results indicate that graphene FETs on diamond\ntechnology can reach sub-terahertz frequency performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 11:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 21:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 20:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

To balance the\nsecurity, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an\non-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain\nand an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its\noff-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the\ninconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause\nundesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions\nsent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be\nreversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in\nthe transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to\nperform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of\nfamiliarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we\ninvestigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in\nEthereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in\ninconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such\non-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model\nto guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate\nthe automatic identification of bugs.

Additionally, DocNLI has pretty limited artifacts which unfortunately\nwidely exist in some popular sentence-level NLI datasets.

The source features a large angular extent ($\\sim 4$ deg in diameter),\nnearly circular shape and X-ray spectrum dominated by emission lines of helium-\nand hydrogen-like oxygen. It lacks bright counterparts of similar extent at\nother wavelengths which could be unequivocally associated with it. Given the\nrelatively high Galactic latitude of the source, $b\\approx-26$ deg, we\ninterpret these observational properties as an indication of the off-disk\nlocation of this SNR candidate.

The\nlow density of the halo gas implies that the cooling and collisional ionization\nequilibrium (CEI) timescales downstream of the forward shock are much longer\nthan the age of the SNR. This results in a relatively soft spectrum, reflecting\npre-shock ionization state of the gas, and strong boost in the plasma\nemissivity (compared to CEI) due to enhanced collisional excitation through the\nincreased electron temperature.

Big data analysis and machine learning,\ntwo sub-fields of artificial intelligence, are at the core of many recent\nbreakthroughs in many application fields (e.g., medicine, communication,\nfinance, ...), including some that are strongly related to our day-to-day life\n(e.g., social networks, computers, smartphones, ...). In machine learning,\nsignificant improvements are usually achieved at the price of an increasing\ncomputational complexity and thanks to bigger datasets. Currently, cutting-edge\nmodels built by the most advanced machine learning algorithms typically became\nsimultaneously very efficient and profitable but also extremely complex. Their\ncomplexity is to such an extent that these models are commonly seen as\nblack-boxes providing a prediction or a decision which can not be interpreted\nor justified. Nevertheless, whether these models are used autonomously or as a\nsimple decision-making support tool, they are already being used in machine\nlearning applications where health and human life are at stake.

Internet advertising platforms typically offer advertisers the\npossibility to pace the rate at which their budget is depleted, through\nbudget-pacing mechanisms. We focus on multiplicative pacing mechanisms in an\nonline setting in which a bidder is repeatedly confronted with a series of\nadvertising opportunities. After collecting bids, each item is then allocated\nthrough a single-item, second-price auction. If there were no budgetary\nconstraints, bidding truthfully would be an optimal choice for the advertiser.\nHowever, since their budget is limited, the advertiser may want to shade their\nbid downwards in order to preserve their budget for future opportunities, and\nto spread expenditures evenly over time. The literature on online pacing\nproblems mostly focuses on the setting in which the bidder optimizes an\nadditive separable objective, such as the total click-through rate or the\nrevenue of the allocation.

With the popularization of commercial light field (LF) cameras,\ncapturing LF images (LFIs) is as convenient as taking regular photos, and\ngeometry information can be reliably inferred. This inspires us to use a sparse\nset of LF captures to render high-quality novel views globally. However, fusion\nof LF captures from multiple angles is challenging due to the scale\ninconsistency caused by various capture settings. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose a novel scale-consistent volume rescaling algorithm that robustly\naligns the disparity probability volumes (DPV) among different captures for\nscale-consistent global geometry fusion.

We present a new concept of privacy and\ncorresponding data formats, mechanisms, and theories for privatizing data\nduring data collection. The privacy, named Interval Privacy, enforces the raw\ndata conditional distribution on the privatized data to be the same as its\nunconditional distribution over a nontrivial support set. Correspondingly, the\nproposed privacy mechanism will record each data value as a random interval\n(or, more generally, a range) containing it. The proposed interval privacy\nmechanisms can be easily deployed through survey-based data collection\ninterfaces, e.g., by asking a respondent whether its data value is within a\nrandomly generated range. Another unique feature of interval mechanisms is that\nthey obfuscate the truth but do not perturb it. Using narrowed range to convey\ninformation is complementary to the popular paradigm of perturbing data. Also,\nthe interval mechanisms can generate progressively refined information at the\ndiscretion of individuals, naturally leading to privacy-adaptive data\ncollection. We develop different aspects of theory such as composition,\nrobustness, distribution estimation, and regression learning from\ninterval-valued data. Interval privacy provides a new perspective of\nhuman-centric data privacy where individuals have a perceptible, transparent,\nand simple way of sharing sensitive data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 14:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 07:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 05:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

There has\nrecently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy\nrates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social\ngood properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a\ngame-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated\nlearning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves\ninto federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable\ncoalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how\nfar from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and\ndefine a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating\nagents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient\nalgorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players.\nNext, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an\narrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all\nstable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show\nthis is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements\nwith higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we\ngive the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability\nand optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can\nbe no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of\nAnarchy bound of 9).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 15:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Social media provides an opportunity to\nestimate emerging risks to vaccine acceptance by including geographical\nlocation and detailing vaccine-related concerns. Methods for classifying social\nmedia posts, such as vaccine-related tweets, use language models (LMs) trained\non general domain text. However, challenges to measuring vaccine sentiment at\nscale arise from the absence of tonal stress and gestural cues and may not\nalways have additional information about the user, e.g., past tweets or social\nconnections. Another challenge in LMs is the lack of commonsense knowledge that\nare apparent in users metadata, i.e., emoticons, positive and negative words\netc. In this study, to classify vaccine sentiment tweets with limited\ninformation, we present a novel end-to-end framework consisting of\ninterconnected components that use domain-specific LM trained on\nvaccine-related tweets and models commonsense knowledge into a bidirectional\ngated recurrent network (CK-BiGRU) with context-aware attention.

Different\nastrophysical and cosmological processes are likely to give rise to backgrounds\nwith distinct spectral signatures and distributions on the sky. The observed\nSGWB will therefore be a superposition of these components. Hence, one of the\nfirst questions that will come up after the first detection of a SGWB will\nlikely be about identifying the dominant components and their distributions on\nthe sky. Both these questions were addressed separately in the literature,\nnamely, how to separate components of isotropic backgrounds and how to probe\nthe anisotropy of a single component. Here, we address the question of how to\nseparate distinct anisotropic backgrounds with (sufficiently) different\nspectral shapes. We first obtain the combined Fisher information matrix from\nfolded data using an efficient analysis pipeline PyStoch, which incorporates\ncovariances between pixels and spectral indices. This is necessary for\nestimating the detection statistic and setting upper limits. However, based on\na recent study, we ignore the pixel-to-pixel noise covariance that does not\nhave a significant effect on the results at the present sensitivity levels of\nthe detectors. We show that the joint analysis accurately separates and\nestimates backgrounds with different spectral shapes and different sky\ndistributions with no major bias. This does come at the cost of increased\nvariance. Thus making the joint upper limits safer, though less strict than the\nindividual analysis. We finally set joint upper limits on the multicomponent\nanisotropic background using Advanced LIGO data taken up to the first half of\nthe third observing run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 15:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 12:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

A special feature of these systems is that the binding energy\nscales with single particle tunneling $t$ rather than exchange interactions,\nsince effective attraction arises from alleviating kinetic frustration.

Our framework opens up a new avenue\nand toolset for tackling calibration, which we believe will inspire further\nwork in this important challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 15:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 16:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

The core challenge for localizing\noutliers is that they are highly variable and difficult to annotate. To\novercome this challenging problem, we introduce a joint Face-autoencoder and\noutlier segmentation approach (FOCUS).In particular, we exploit the fact that\nthe outliers cannot be fitted well by the face model and hence can be localized\nwell given a high-quality model fitting. The main challenge is that the model\nfitting and the outlier segmentation are mutually dependent on each other, and\nneed to be inferred jointly. We resolve this chicken-and-egg problem with an\nEM-type training strategy, where a face autoencoder is trained jointly with an\noutlier segmentation network. This leads to a synergistic effect, in which the\nsegmentation network prevents the face encoder from fitting to the outliers,\nenhancing the reconstruction quality. The improved 3D face reconstruction, in\nturn, enables the segmentation network to better predict the outliers. To\nresolve the ambiguity between outliers and regions that are difficult to fit,\nsuch as eyebrows, we build a statistical prior from synthetic data that\nmeasures the systematic bias in model fitting. Experiments on the NoW testset\ndemonstrate that FOCUS achieves SOTA 3D face reconstruction performance among\nall baselines that are trained without 3D annotation. Moreover, our results on\nCelebA-HQ and the AR database show that the segmentation network can localize\noccluders accurately despite being trained without any segmentation annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 15:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 15:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Finally, we provide several insights for AL practitioners to\nconsider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch size, the effect of\ninitialization, the importance of retraining the model at every round, and\nother insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 23:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 04:49:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 20:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Various techniques using conventional network\narchitectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research\nwork is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D\nrepresentation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to\ngenerate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of\ndense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,\na novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which\nimproves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple\nmodel by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not\nonly uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also\nuses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the\nprevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep\nnetwork architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.\nThis is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.\nVarious experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is\ncompared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains\nin performance are demonstrated.
