We then advocate for and develop multivariate methods using\nstatistical data transformations and regression techniques that take the\nspecial structure of the compositional sample space into account. In a\ncomparative analysis on synthetic and real data we show the advantages and\nlimitations of our proposal. We posit that our framework provides a useful\nstarting point and guidance for valid and informative cause-effect estimation\nin the context of compositional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 16:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

However, plenty of effort paid on planar signals that\nprojected from spherical signals, which leading to some problems, e.g. waste of\npixels, distortion. Recent advances in spherical CNN have opened up the\npossibility of directly analysing spherical signals. However, they pay\nattention to the full mesh which makes it infeasible to deal with situations in\nreal-world application due to the extremely large bandwidth requirement. To\naddress the bandwidth waste problem associated with 360-degree video streaming\nand save computation, we exploit Focused Icosahedral Mesh to represent a small\narea and construct matrices to rotate spherical content to the focused mesh\narea. We also proposed a novel VertexShuffle operation that can significantly\nimprove both the performance and the efficiency compared to the original\nMeshConv Transpose operation introduced in UGSCNN. We further apply our\nproposed methods on super resolution model, which is the first to propose a\nspherical super-resolution model that directly operates on a mesh\nrepresentation of spherical pixels of 360-degree data. To evaluate our model,\nwe also collect a set of high-resolution 360-degree videos to generate a\nspherical image dataset. Our experiments indicate that our proposed spherical\nsuper-resolution model achieves significant benefits in terms of both\nperformance and inference time compared to the baseline spherical\nsuper-resolution model that uses the simple MeshConv Transpose operation. In\nsummary, our model achieves great super-resolution performance on 360-degree\ninputs, achieving 32.79 dB PSNR on average when super-resoluting 16x vertices\non the mesh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 16:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

The corresponding two-body\nentanglement with non-zero concurrence induced by the dipole blockade effect is\nan important resource for quantum information processing. Here, we propose a\nnovel physical mechanism for realizing dipole blockade without the\ndipole-dipole interaction, where two qubits coupled to a cavity, are driven by\na coherent field. By suitably chosen placements of the qubits in the cavity and\nby adjusting the relative decay strengths of the qubits and cavity field, we\nkill many unwanted excitation pathways. This leads to dipole blockade. In\naddition, we show that these two qubits are strongly entangled over a broad\nregime of the system parameters. We show that a strong signature of this dipole\nblockade is the bunching property of the cavity photons which thus provides a\npossible measurement of the dipole blockade. We present dynamical features of\nthe dipole blockade without dipole-dipole interaction.

However, in terms of the mathematical formulation of the corresponding\nproblems, one of the major challenges is coming from the fact that\ncorresponding stochastic processes should, in most cases, be considered in\nbounded domains, possibly with obstacles. This has been known for a long time\nand yet, very little has been done for the quantification of uncertainties in\nmodelling complex behavioral systems described by such stochastic processes. In\nthis paper, we address this challenge by considering a coupled system of\nSkorokhod-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describing interactions\nbetween active and passive participants of a mixed-population group. In\ndeveloping a multi-fidelity modelling methodology for such behavioral systems,\nwe combine low- and high-fidelity results obtained from (a) the solution of the\nunderlying coupled system of SDEs and (b) simulations with a\nstatistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kinetic Monte\nCarlo procedure.

Classical MC is\ndefined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While\nmore refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic\nassumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and\nlocal mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can\nreconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between\nnearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,\nresulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle\nthese challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing\ntessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning\nthe vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for\ncontextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube\nparameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible\nwith neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be\nemployed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that\nare applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,\nand the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently\nby following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local\nfeatures with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes\nand new datasets.

This is due to the emergence of\nmultiple metastable phases in the state space, separated by narrow bottlenecks\nthat are hard for the dynamics to cross. It is a folklore belief that if the\ndynamics is initialized from an appropriate random mixture of ground states,\none for each phase, then convergence to the Gibbs distribution should be much\nfaster. However, such phenomena have largely evaded rigorous analysis, as most\ntools in the study of Markov chain mixing times are tailored to worst-case\ninitializations.\n  In this paper we develop a general framework towards establishing this\nconjectured behavior for the Ising model. In the classical setting of the Ising\nmodel on an $N$-vertex torus in $\\mathbb Z^d$, our framework implies that the\nmixing time for the Glauber dynamics, initialized from a $\\frac 12$-$\\frac 12$\nmixture of the all-plus and all-minus configurations, is $N^{1+o(1)}$ in\ndimension $d=2$, and at most quasi-polynomial in all dimensions $d\\ge 3$, at\nall temperatures below the critical one. The key innovation in our analysis is\nthe introduction of the notion of \"weak spatial mixing within a phase\", a\nlow-temperature adaptation of the classical concept of weak spatial mixing. We\nshow both that this new notion is strong enough to control the mixing time from\nthe above random initialization (by relating it to the mixing time with plus\nboundary condition at $O(\\log N)$ scales), and that it holds at all low\ntemperatures in all dimensions.\n  This framework naturally extends to much more general families of graphs. To\nillustrate this, we also use the same approach to establish optimal $O(N\\log\nN)$ mixing for the Ising Glauber dynamics on random regular graphs at\nsufficiently low temperatures, when initialized from the same random mixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 17:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 21:54:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 15:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

However, to the best of\nour knowledge, few studies explore the fundamental reasons why Adam is superior\nto other optimizers like SGD for BNN optimization or provide analytical\nexplanations that support specific training strategies. To address this, in\nthis paper we first investigate the trajectories of gradients and weights in\nBNNs during the training process. We show the regularization effect of\nsecond-order momentum in Adam is crucial to revitalize the weights that are\ndead due to the activation saturation in BNNs. We find that Adam, through its\nadaptive learning rate strategy, is better equipped to handle the rugged loss\nsurface of BNNs and reaches a better optimum with higher generalization\nability. Furthermore, we inspect the intriguing role of the real-valued weights\nin binary networks, and reveal the effect of weight decay on the stability and\nsluggishness of BNN optimization.

METHODS: The analysis is based on\nhigh-resolution spectra for a sample of 91 dwarf and subgiant stars that were\nobtained during microlensing events when the brightnesses of the stars were\nhighly magnified.

Additionally, we integrate two auxiliary sub-networks into the model for\nthe deblurring task. The first sub-network is a ridge extractor model.

The aim of the present study is to measure the\nproper motions of the previously discovered kinematically separated structures\nin the working surface of the HH 83 collimated outflow. We used observations\nfrom two epochs separated by 15 years, which were performed on the 6m telescope\nwith Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer. We obtained images corresponding to\ndifferent radial velocities for the two separate epochs, and used them to\nmeasure proper motions. In the course of our data analysis, we discovered a\ncounter bow-shock of HH 83 flow with positive radial velocity, which makes this\nflow a relatively symmetric bipolar system. The second epoch observations\nconfirm that the working surface of the flow is split into two structures with\nan exceptionally large (250 km\\ s$^{-1}$) difference in radial velocity. The\nproper motions of these structures are almost equal, which suggests that they\nare physically connected. The asymmetry of the bow shock and the turning of\nproper motion vectors suggests a collision between the outflow and a dense\ncloud. The profile of the H$\\alpha$ line for the directly invisible infrared\nsource HH 83 IRS, obtained by integration of the data within the reflection\nnebula, suggests it to be of P Cyg type with a broad absorption component\ncharacteristic of the FU Ori like objects.

This is done on the lattice, using the gradient flow to isolate\nthe long-distance modes in the functional integral measure and tracing it over\nsuccessive length scales. The key point is that the vacuum splits into\ndisconnected topological sectors with markedly different physical\ncharacteristics, which gives rise to a nontrivial behavior depending on\n$\\theta$.

The renormalized vacuum\nangle $\\theta$ is found to flow to zero in the infrared limit, leading to a\nself-consistent solution within QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 18:57:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 09:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 16:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 14:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

In particular, instead of using statistical channel\nmodels, we utilize a model-free data-driven approach with foundations in\nmachine learning to generate codebooks that adapt to the surrounding\npropagation conditions. We use a tensor representation of the FD-MIMO channel\nand exploit its properties to design quantized version of the channel\nprecoders. We find the best representation of the optimal precoder as a\nfunction of Kronecker Product (KP) of two low-dimensional precoders,\nrespectively corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the\nUPA, obtained from the tensor decomposition of the channel. We then quantize\nthis precoder to design product codebooks such that an average loss in mutual\ninformation due to quantization of channel state information (CSI) is\nminimized. The key technical contribution lies in exploiting the constraints on\nthe precoders to reduce the product codebook design problem to an unsupervised\nclustering problem on a Cartesian Product Grassmann manifold (CPM), where the\ncluster centroids form a finite-sized precoder codebook. This codebook can be\nfound efficiently by running a $K$-means clustering on the CPM.

In this paper,\nwe address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a\ngiven budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually fine-tune a\npre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing\nactive learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty\nscores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even\nwhen only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To\naddress this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based\nmachine translation (PBMT) era that selected not full sentences, but rather\nindividual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT\nsystems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need\nto be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of\nsentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to\nselect both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the\nnew domain for routing to human translators.

However, the mechanism does not have direct access to the\ngraph. Instead, the vertices are partitioned over multiple players (hospitals),\nand each player reports a subset of her vertices to the mechanism. In\nparticular, a player may strategically omit vertices to increase how many of\nher vertices lie on the path returned by the mechanism.\n  Our objective is to find mechanisms that limit incentives for such\nmanipulation while producing long paths. Unfortunately, in worst-case\ninstances, competing with the overall longest path is impossible while\nincentivizing (approximate) truthfulness, i.e., requiring that hiding nodes\ncannot increase a player's utility by more than a factor of $1 + o(1)$. We\ntherefore adopt a semi-random model where a small ($o(n)$) number of random\nedges are added to worst-case instances. While it remains impossible for\ntruthful mechanisms to compete with the overall longest path, we give a\ntruthful mechanism that competes with a weaker but non-trivial benchmark: the\nlength of any path whose subpaths within each player have a minimum average\nlength. In fact, our mechanism satisfies even a stronger notion of\ntruthfulness, which we call matching-time incentive compatibility.

One assumption underlying research\nin transparent AI systems is that explanations help to better assess\npredictions of machine learning (ML) models, for instance by enabling humans to\nidentify wrong predictions more efficiently. Recent empirical evidence however\nshows that explanations can have the opposite effect: When presenting\nexplanations of ML predictions humans often tend to trust ML predictions even\nwhen these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests that this effect can be\nattributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation appears. This\neffect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible usage of\ntransparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish\nmachine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative\nmetric for XAI methods based on Turing's imitation game, a Turing Test for\nTransparency.

Tubular plasmas of this type can be obtained over an unmatched range\nof operating conditions, namely the frequency of the wave, the inner radius of\nthe discharge tube, the density and the nature of the carrier gas. The\nanalytical and numerical modeling of these plasmas has so far generally\nconsisted in considering the wave and the associated plasma column as a whole,\nwhich amounts to assuming that the plasma column along which the wave\npropagates affects the properties of the wave. This is not the case: our\nassertion is based on the experimental fact that the axial distribution of the\nelectron density along a plasma column supported by a surface wave is linear\n(constant slope) until its termination, whatever the operating conditions. The\nlinearity of these plots (from various laboratories) is statistically validated\nby linear least-squares regressions that provide a high coefficient of\ndetermination. On the other hand, it is shown that any attempt to incorporate\nplasma column characteristics into the SW equations alters the linearity of the\naxial electron density profile, particularly towards the end of the column.\nThis intrinsic linearity results from the transfer of power from the SW to the\ndischarge gas that it ionizes as if it were a weakly dissipative (passive)\nmedium. Indeed, the power attenuation coefficient {\\alpha}(z) of the guided\nwave depends only on ne(z), the axial electron density, such that it is locally\nproportional to the power flux (as observed).

At the critical point, the presence of\nnon-ergodic extended states yields anomalous sub-diffusion. The Fibonacci\nmodel, on the other hand, yields anomalous transport with a continuously\nvarying exponent depending on the potential strength. By computing the\ncovariance matrix in the non-equilibrium steady-state, we show that\nsufficiently strong dephasing always renders the transport diffusive. The\ninterplay between dephasing and quasi-periodicity gives rise to a maximum of\nthe diffusion coefficient for finite dephasing, which suggests the combination\nof quasi-periodic geometries and dephasing can be used to control\nnoise-enhanced transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 20:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 12:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

However, DNNs have been used extensively in real-world adaptive\ntasks such as reinforcement learning (RL), making such systems vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks as well. Prior works in provable robustness in RL seek to\ncertify the behaviour of the victim policy at every time-step against a\nnon-adaptive adversary using methods developed for the static setting. But in\nthe real world, an RL adversary can infer the defense strategy used by the\nvictim agent by observing the states, actions, etc., from previous time-steps\nand adapt itself to produce stronger attacks in future steps. We present an\nefficient procedure, designed specifically to defend against an adaptive RL\nadversary, that can directly certify the total reward without requiring the\npolicy to be robust at each time-step. Our main theoretical contribution is to\nprove an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma -- a key lemma for\nsmoothing-based certificates -- where the adversarial perturbation at a\nparticular time can be a stochastic function of current and previous\nobservations and states as well as previous actions. Building on this result,\nwe propose policy smoothing where the agent adds a Gaussian noise to its\nobservation at each time-step before passing it through the policy function.\nOur robustness certificates guarantee that the final total reward obtained by\npolicy smoothing remains above a certain threshold, even though the actions at\nintermediate time-steps may change under the attack.

Trained neural networks are usually tested in an\nunrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In\nan attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open\nset environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of\nincremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial\ntrained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and\nautonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some\nproblems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to\nretrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy\nas multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new\nclasses is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold\napproach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies\nhigh by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources\nused in the retraining of the neural network.

To fulfill a lightweight (fewer\nmaterials and less energy) support structure for the electromagnetic launcher\nwith strength requirements, the tensegrity structure minimum mass principle\nwithout global buckling has been developed and applied to support the\nelectromagnetic acceleration device. Therefore, this paper proposes and\ndevelops a minimal mass electromagnetic tensegrity lunar launcher.

Secondly, we lift\ncellularity to the graded setting.\n  As applications of our main theorem, we show that the graded decomposition\nmatrices of the Hecke algebras of type $G(\\ell,p,n)$ are unitriangular, we\nconstruct and classify their graded simple modules and we prove the existence\nof ``adjustment matrices'' in positive characteristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:38:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 11:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The MBIST controller is designed based on a\nmemory testing March algorithm. This March algorithm is a little modified March\nC algorithm which is modified by adding a paused element to test memory data\nretention faults. In assertion based functional verification, creation of\nverification plan, for MBIST controller RTL model and the implementation &\nsimulation of the verification plan using System-Verilog and Synopsys-VCS are\ndone. In ABV, verification plan includes the MBIST controller design and\nfunctional specification, functional coverage goals, code coverage goals, and\nassertions. Assertions are used to check the errors in RTL model of MBIST\ncontroller and to provide the functionality coverage. Functional coverage\nmetrics are used to track the level or quality of verification. Most of the\nfunctional metrics score approximately reached the planned goal of 100 % which\nis planned in the verification plan. The designed MBIST controller is verified\nagainst the intended features. ABV approach helped to make the verification and\ndesign process efficient and less time-consuming by finding the bugs,\nexercising the corner cases in the design, and using the directed test cases in\na small design. ABV helped to write directed and efficient test cases (25)\nwhich are approx 32 % less than the use of maximum possible random test cases\n(88) for designed MBIST controller with 100% assertion coverage and\napproximately equal total functional coverage, i.e., 97 % approx. In this way,\nABV helped to fasten the design and verification process with better quality\nand assurance of correct functionality of MBIST controller after the\nintegration in MBIST architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Most\nstudies on open lossless dielectric waveguides are concerned with regular\nguided modes which are confined around the waveguide core, have a real\npropagation constant, and propagate along the waveguide axis without\nattenuation. However, there may be guided modes with a complex propagation\nconstant even though the waveguide consists of lossless isotropic dielectric\nmaterials, and they are the so-called complex modes. The complex modes are\nproper modes confined around the waveguide core, and are different from the\nleaky modes which have divergent wave fields in the transverse plane. For\nwaveguides with discontinuities and defects, the complex modes can be excited\nand must be included in eigenmode expansions. However, existing studies on\ncomplex modes in open lossless dielectric waveguides are very limited. In this\nLetter, we consider circular fibers and silicon waveguides, study the formation\nmechanism of complex modes, and calculate the dispersion relations for several\ncomplex modes in each waveguide.

However, current\nnumeric ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models are good at perceptual\nintelligence such as image recognition while they are not good at cognitive\nintelligence such as logical representation, blocking the further application\nof ANN.

Unfortunately, the 3D biomedical video analysis is lagging,\nimpeded by resource insensitive human curation using off-the-shelf 3D analytic\ntools. Herein, biologists often need to discard a considerable amount of rich\n3D spatial information by compromising on 2D analysis via maximum intensity\nprojection. Recently, pixel embedding-based cell instance segmentation and\ntracking provided a neat and generalizable computing paradigm for understanding\ncellular dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatial-temporal\nvoxel-embedding (VoxelEmbed) based learning method to perform simultaneous cell\ninstance segmenting and tracking on 3D volumetric video sequences. Our\ncontribution is in four-fold: (1) The proposed voxel embedding generalizes the\npixel embedding with 3D context information; (2) Present a simple multi-stream\nlearning approach that allows effective spatial-temporal embedding; (3)\nAccomplished an end-to-end framework for one-stage 3D cell instance\nsegmentation and tracking without heavy parameter tuning; (4) The proposed 3D\nquantification is memory efficient via a single GPU with 12 GB memory. We\nevaluate our VoxelEmbed method on four 3D datasets (with different cell types)\nfrom the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge. The proposed VoxelEmbed method achieved\nconsistent superior overall performance (OP) on two densely annotated datasets.\nThe performance is also competitive on two sparsely annotated cohorts with\n20.6% and 2% of data-set having segmentation annotations. The results\ndemonstrate that the VoxelEmbed method is a generalizable and memory-efficient\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 02:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

For this purpose, this paper proposes to\ndescribe wallpaper texture images by using multi-label semantics.

In this\nframework, a perceptual model is trained to recognize whether the wallpapers\nproduced by the generator network are sufficiently realistic and have the\nattribute designated by given perceptual description; these multi-label\nsemantic attributes are treated as condition variables to generate wallpaper\nimages. The generated wallpaper images can be converted to those with\nwell-known artist styles using CycleGAN.

Expanding on recent work by Blume, Easley, and Halpern\n(BEH), we consider a language-based framework in which actions are identified\nwith (conditional) descriptions in a simple underlying language, while states\nand outcomes (along with probabilities and utilities) are constructed as part\nof a representation theorem. Our work expands the role of language from that of\nBEH by using it not only for the conditions that determine which actions are\ntaken, but also the effects. More precisely, we take the set of actions to be\nbuilt from those of the form \"do(phi)\", for formulas phi in the underlying\nlanguage. This presents a problem: how do we interpret the result of do(phi)\nwhen phi is underspecified (i.e., compatible with multiple states)? We answer\nthis using tools familiar from the semantics of counterfactuals: roughly\nspeaking, do(phi) maps each state to the \"closest\" phi-state. This notion of\n\"closest\" is also something we construct as part of the representation theorem;\nin effect, then, we prove that (under appropriate assumptions) the agent is\nacting as if each underspecified action is first made definite and then\nevaluated (i.e., by maximizing expected utility).

An awareness epistemic logic that captures qualified versions\nof both principles was recently proposed in the literature. This paper extends\nthat logic in three different directions. First, we try to improve its\nconceptual grounds, by depicting its philosophical foundations, critically\ndiscussing some of its design choices and exploring further possibilities.\nSecond, we provide a (heretofore missing) completeness theorem for the basic\nfragment of the logic. Third, we study, using techniques from dynamic epistemic\nlogic, how different forms of information change can be captured in the\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 02:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

In\ngeneral, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial\nconstraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic\nprogramming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements.\nGiven that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a\npractical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to\napproximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of\ntheir solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate\nthe aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based\nregularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining\nit with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a\ndifferentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization\n(KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the\noptimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed\nmodel. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower\ntime and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform\nsegmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting\nmultiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to\nfurther introduce an extended variant of the proposed model.

The resultant bus delays degrade the service level\nof urban public transportation. A potential solution is to reschedule the\narrivals of the buses at the stop for full utilization of the berths with the\naid of connected vehicle technologies. This study proposes a mixed-integer\nlinear programming model to optimize the scheduling of bus arrivals and the\nbus-berth matching at a curbside stop under connected vehicle environment. The\nobjective is the minimization of the bus delays weighted by the number of\npassengers on the buses. Bus arrival times at the stop and the assignment of\nberths are optimized together with bus departure times from the stop. Bus\npunctuality is also taken into consideration. The proposed model could be\napplied dynamically to cater to time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical\nstudies validate the advantages of the proposed model over the\nfirst-come-first-service strategy and the relaxed model without bus punctuality\nin terms of weighted bus delays and bus punctuality. Sensitivity analyses show\nthat: 1) the proposed model is robust to the fluctuation of bus service time;\nand 2) a smaller number of berths may be preferred on condition that the bus\ndemand does not exceed the stop capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 05:37:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 06:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Existing graphical modeling\ntechniques for extreme values rely on binning or thresholding observations,\nwhich may not be appropriate for calcium imaging data.

Hence, there is a compelling need for efficient\ncompression of light field images. Existing solutions are commonly composed of\nseveral separate modules, some of which may not have been designed for the\nspecific structure and quality of light field data.

There are two very different schools of thought that have\ntackled this problem. On one hand, Pearlian framework commonly assumes\nstructural knowledge (provided by an expert) in form of directed acyclic graphs\nand provides graphical criteria such as back-door criterion to identify valid\nadjustment sets. On other hand, potential outcomes (PO) framework commonly\nassumes that all observed features satisfy ignorability (i.e., no hidden\nconfounding), which in general is untestable. In prior works that attempted to\nbridge these frameworks, there is an observational criteria to identify an\nanchor variable and if a subset of covariates (not involving the anchor\nvariable) passes a suitable conditional independence criteria, then that subset\nis a valid back-door. Our main result strengthens these prior results by\nshowing that under a different expert-driven structural knowledge -- that one\nvariable is a direct causal parent of treatment variable -- remarkably, testing\nfor subsets (not involving the known parent variable) that are valid back-doors\nis equivalent to an invariance test. Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial\ncase where entire set of observed features is not ignorable (generalizing the\nPO framework) without requiring knowledge of all parents of treatment variable.\nOur key technical idea involves generation of a synthetic sub-sampling (or\nenvironment) variable that is a function of the known parent variable. In\naddition to designing an invariance test, this sub-sampling variable allows us\nto leverage Invariant Risk Minimization, and thus, connects finding valid\nadjustments (in non-ignorable observational setting) to representation\nlearning. We demonstrate effectiveness and tradeoffs of our approaches on a\nvariety of synthetic data as well as real causal effect estimation benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 06:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 20:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

A federated learning system can be viewed as a\nlarge-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders\nwith diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated\nlearning system requires both software system design thinking and machine\nlearning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning\nfrom the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature\nreview on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for\nsoftware architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose\nFLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a\ntemplate design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA\nreference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of\nfederated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial\nimplementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of\narchitectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design\nproblems in federated learning architectures. The FLRA reference architecture\ncan serve as a design guideline to assist architects and developers with\npractical solutions for their problems, which can be further customised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 06:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

By selecting matched type 1 and 2 subsamples in\nthe X-ray luminosity and redshift parameter space, we find that both types live\nin galaxies with similar star formation.

The magnetic field strength in the masering\nregions is estimated byusing right circular polarization (RCP) and left\ncircular polarization (LCP) pair splitting. The high-velocity resolution\nprovides uswith an estimation of a comparatively small magnetic field strength\nfor the 189.030+0.783 and 90.92+1.49 star-forming regions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 07:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Although PTMs are well\ndocumented, little is known about the mechanisms which produce these\nstructures. In the case of the PTM, an ELM-postcursor, its genesis is usually\nexplained by ergodisation of the magnetic field due to edge localized modes and\nthe appearance of a seed magnetic island which evolves into a PTM later. In\nthis study we try to invoke a creation mechanism based on the concepts and\nobservations in edge plasma turbulence. An interesting aspect of plasma\nturbulence is the occurrence of coherent, long-lived structures in the\nscrape-off-layer (SOL). These localized and magnetic-field-aligned regions with\nhigher or lower plasma densities are called blobs and holes. Measurements show\nthat these filaments carry parallel currents.

Linearizing a pertinent Langevin equation around the\ndeterministic steady state solution, we calculate the two-time covariances of\n$X(t)$ and $\\ell(t)$. The variance of $X(t)$ directly follows from the\ncovariance of $X(t)$, and it scales as $1/N$ as to be expected from the law of\nlarge numbers. The variance of $\\ell(t)$ behaves differently: it exhibits an\nanomalous scaling $\\ln N/N$. This anomaly appears because all spatial scales,\nincluding a narrow region near the edges of the swarm where only a few\nparticles are present, give a significant contribution to the variance. We\nargue that the variance of $\\ell(t)$ can be obtained from the covariance of\n$\\ell(t)$ by introducing a cutoff at the microscopic time $1/N$ where the\ncontinuum Langevin description breaks down. Our theoretical predictions are in\ngood agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations of the microscopic model.\nGeneralizations to higher dimensions are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 09:09:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 08:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

However, maintaining functional\ndiversity between ensemble members that are independently trained with gradient\ndescent is challenging. This can lead to pathologies when adding more ensemble\nmembers, such as a saturation of the ensemble performance, which converges to\nthe performance of a single model. Moreover, this does not only affect the\nquality of its predictions, but even more so the uncertainty estimates of the\nensemble, and thus its performance on out-of-distribution data. We hypothesize\nthat this limitation can be overcome by discouraging different ensemble members\nfrom collapsing to the same function. To this end, we introduce a kernelized\nrepulsive term in the update rule of the deep ensembles. We show that this\nsimple modification not only enforces and maintains diversity among the members\nbut, even more importantly, transforms the maximum a posteriori inference into\nproper Bayesian inference.

Comparing these alpha values with metallicity measurements also\nbased on the same MUSE data, we find no evidence for an increase in the\nspecific abundance of PNe when transitioning between metal-rich and metal-poor\nregions.\n  Conclusions. Our analysis highlights the importance of ensuring spatial\nconsistency to avoid misleading results when investigating the link between PNe\nand their parent stellar populations and suggest that in passively-evolving\nsystems variations in the specific number of PNe may pertain to rather extreme\nmetallicity regimes found either in the innermost or outermost regions of\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 10:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Using a new\nnanoprobe technique which has sufficient dynamic range of force and stiffness,\nwe demonstrate the processes involved in the transition from purely interface\nsliding at the nanoscale to the situation where at least one of the sliding\nbodies undergoes some plastic deformation. For sliding of micrometer-scale\ndiamond spherical tips on metallic substrates, additional local plastic\nyielding of the substrate resulting from tangential tractions causes the tip to\nsink into the surface, increasing the contact area in the direction of loading\nand resulting in a static friction coefficient higher than the kinetic during\nploughing. This sink-in is largely absent in fused silica, and no friction drop\nis observed, along with lower friction in general. The transition from sinking\nin within the static friction regime to ploughing in the sliding friction\nregime is mediated by failure of the contact interface, indicated by a sharp\nincrease in energy dissipation. At lower contact pressures, the elastic\ninterfacial sliding behaviour characteristic of scanning probe or surface force\napparatus experiments is recovered, bridging the gap between the exotic realm\nof nanotribology and plasticity dominated macroscale friction.

In the surface superconducting state (SSS),\nincrease of the current beyond the surface critical current $I_c$ leads to\nbreakdown of SSS and penetration of external magnetic field into the sample\nbulk. An interesting free-of-bulk system in SSS is offered by thin-walled\nsuperconducting cylinders. The critical state model (CSM) asserts the ac\nsusceptibility $\\chi$ to exhibit jumps as a function of the external ac field\namplitude $H_{ac}$, because of the periodic destruction and restoration of SSS\nin the cylinder wall. Here, we investigate experimentally the low-frequency\n(128-8192\\,Hz) ac response of thin-walled superconducting cylinders in\nsuperimposed dc and ac magnetic fields applied parallel to the cylinder axis.\nDistinct from the CSM predictions, experiments reveal that $\\chi$ is a smooth\nfunction of $H_{ac}$. For the explanation of our observations we propose a\nphenomenological model of partial penetration of magnetic flux (PPMF). The PPMF\nmodel implies that after a restoration of the superconducting state, the\nmagnetic fields inside and outside the cylinder are not equal, and the value of\nthe penetrating flux is random for each penetration.

Recently, a breakthrough\nwas made in reducing the channel estimation overhead by revealing that the\nIRS-BS (base station) channels are common in the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels\nof all the users, and if the cascaded channel of one typical user is estimated,\nthe other users' cascaded channels can be estimated very quickly based on their\ncorrelation with the typical user's channel \\cite{b5}. One limitation of this\nstrategy, however, is the waste of user energy, because many users need to keep\nsilent when the typical user's channel is estimated. In this paper, we reveal\nanother correlation hidden in the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels by observing\nthat the user-IRS channel is common in all the cascaded channels from users to\neach BS antenna as well. Building upon this finding, we propose a novel\ntwo-phase channel estimation protocol in the uplink communication.\nSpecifically, in Phase I, the correlation coefficients between the channels of\na typical BS antenna and those of the other antennas are estimated; while in\nPhase II, the cascaded channel of the typical antenna is estimated. In\nparticular, all the users can transmit throughput Phase I and Phase II. Under\nthis strategy, it is theoretically shown that the minimum number of time\ninstants required for perfect channel estimation is the same as that of the\naforementioned strategy in the ideal case without BS noise. Then, in the case\nwith BS noise, we show by simulation that the channel estimation error of our\nproposed scheme is significantly reduced thanks to the full exploitation of the\nuser energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 12:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Based on this simulation chain, a quantification of charge\nsharing effect as well as signal-to-background ratio at different beam energies\nhas been made for a germanium detector equipped with and without collimator. In\naddition, two experimental measurements have been performed on the SAMBA\nbeamline at SOLEIL synchrotron. The experimental data were used to set up the\nfull simulation chain and good agreements have been observed between data and\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 12:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 06:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 14:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 10:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

Given a probabilistic system, a\nprobabilistic model checker takes a property and checks whether or not the\nproperty holds in that system. For this reason, probabilistic model checking\nprovide rigorous guarantees. So far, however, probabilistic model checking has\nfocused on propositional models where a state is represented by a symbol. On\nthe other hand, it is commonly required to make relational abstractions in\nplanning and reinforcement learning. Various frameworks handle relational\ndomains, for instance, STRIPS planning and relational Markov Decision\nProcesses. Using propositional model checking in relational settings requires\none to ground the model, which leads to the well known state explosion problem\nand intractability. We present pCTL-REBEL, a lifted model checking approach for\nverifying pCTL properties of relational MDPs. It extends REBEL, a relational\nmodel-based reinforcement learning technique, toward relational pCTL model\nchecking. PCTL-REBEL is lifted, which means that rather than grounding, the\nmodel exploits symmetries to reason about a group of objects as a whole at the\nrelational level. Theoretically, we show that pCTL model checking is decidable\nfor relational MDPs that have a possibly infinite domain, provided that the\nstates have a bounded size. Practically, we contribute algorithms and an\nimplementation of lifted relational model checking, and we show that the lifted\napproach improves the scalability of the model checking approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 13:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 11:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

If the\nneutrino is a Majorana fermion, then by definition it is identical and\nindistinguishable from the corresponding antineutrino. When a Majorana neutrino\nand antineutrino are pair produced, the corresponding state has to obey the\nPauli principle unlike in the Dirac case. We use this property to distinguish\nbetween the two cases using the process $B^0 \\to\n\\mu^-\\,\\mu^+\\,\\nu_\\mu\\,\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$. We show that the two cases differ\ndramatically in a special kinematic scenario where, in the rest frame of the\nparent $B$ meson, the muons fly away back-to-back (i.e. fly with 3-momenta of\nequal magnitudes but opposite directions), and so do the neutrino and\nantineutrino. Unlike any other scenario, we know the energies and magnitudes of\n$3$-momenta of both the neutrino and the antineutrino in this back-to-back\nconfiguration without even directly measuring them. This provides a way of\navoiding the constraint imposed by the `practical Dirac-Majorana confusion\ntheorem', as one need not fully integrate over neutrino and antineutrino in\nthis case. As a true signature of the universal principle of quantum statistics\nwhich does not depend on the size of the mass of the particle but its spin, the\ndifference between Dirac and Majorana cases in this special kinematic\nconfiguration does survive independent of the neutrino mass as long as neutrino\nmass is nonzero. The analysis presented here is applicable immediately to\nseveral other processes with the same final state as in the case of $B^0$ decay\nwithout any major change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 13:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 02:37:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 10:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 09:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Among the major novelties, BUSCO now enables phylogenetic\nplacement of the input sequence to automatically select the most appropriate\ndataset for the assessment, allowing the analysis of metagenome-assembled\ngenomes of unknown origin. A newly-introduced genome workflow increases the\nefficiency and runtimes especially on large eukaryotic genomes. BUSCO is the\nonly tool capable of assessing both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, and can\nbe applied to various data types, from genome assemblies and metagenomic bins,\nto transcriptomes and gene sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 14:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

A common approach is to reduce the\ndimension by fixing some parameters (which we will call auxiliary parameters)\nto a best estimate and use techniques from PDE-constrained optimization to\nestimate the other parameters. In this article, hyper-differential sensitivity\nanalysis (HDSA) is used to assess the sensitivity of the solution of the\nPDE-constrained optimization problem to changes in the auxiliary parameters.\nFoundational assumptions for HDSA require satisfaction of the optimality\nconditions which are not always practically feasible as a result of\nill-posedness in the inverse problem.

The success of a cross-silo FL process requires\nactive participation of many clients. Clients in cross-silo FL aim to optimize\ntheir long-term benefits by selfishly choosing their participation levels.\nWhile there has been some work on incentivizing clients to join FL, the\nanalysis of clients' long-term selfish participation behaviors in cross-silo FL\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the selfish participation\nbehaviors of heterogeneous clients in cross-silo FL. Specifically, we model\nclients' long-term selfish participation behaviors as an infinitely repeated\ngame. For the stage game SPFL, we derive the unique Nash equilibrium (NE), and\npropose a distributed algorithm for each client to calculate its equilibrium\nparticipation strategy. We show that at the NE, clients fall into at most three\ncategories: (i) free riders, (ii) a unique partial contributor (if exists), and\n(iii) contributors. For the long-term interactions among clients, we derive a\ncooperative strategy for clients which minimizes the number of free riders\nwhile increasing the amount of local data for model training. We show that\nenforced by a punishment strategy, such a cooperative strategy is a subgame\nperfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the infinitely repeated game, under which\nsome clients who are free riders at the NE of the stage game choose to be\n(partial) contributors. We further propose an algorithm to calculate the\noptimal SPNE which minimizes the number of free riders while maximizing the\namount of local data for model training.

In this context,\na number of studies have revealed that nucleation in the calcium sulfate system\nis non-classical, involving the aggregation and reorganization of nanosized\nprenucleation particles. In a recent work we have shown that this\nparticle-mediated nucleation pathway is actually imprinted in the resultant\nsingle micron-sized CaSO4 crystals. This property of CaSO4 minerals provides us\nwith an unique opportunity to search for evidence of non-classical nucleation\npathways in geological environments. In particular, we focused on the\nquintessential single crystals of anhydrite extracted from the Naica mine in\nMexico. We elucidated the growth history from this mineral sample by mapping\ngrowth defects at different length scales. Based on these data we argue that\nthe nano-scale misalignment of the structural sub-units observed in the initial\ncalcium sulfate crystal seed propagate through different length-scales both in\nmorphological, as well as strictly crystallographic aspects, eventually causing\nthe formation of large mesostructured single crystals of anhydrite. Hence, the\nnanoparticle mediated nucleation mechanism introduces a 'seed of imperfection',\nwhich leads to a macroscopic single crystal, in which its fragments do not fit\ntogether at different length-scales in a self-similar manner. Consequently,\nanisotropic voids of various sizes are formed with very well-defined\nwalls/edges. But, at the same time the material retains its essential single\ncrystal nature.

Early and precise detection is\ncritical for clinicians to make timely decisions. An essential challenge in\napplying machine learning models to electronic health records (EHRs) is the\npervasiveness of missing values. Most existing imputation methods are involved\nin the data preprocessing phase, failing to capture the relationship between\ndata and outcome for downstream predictions. In this paper, we propose\nclassifier-guided generative adversarial imputation networks Classifier-GAIN)\nfor MOF prediction to bridge this gap, by incorporating both observed data and\nlabel information. Specifically, the classifier takes imputed values from the\ngenerator(imputer) to predict task outcomes and provides additional supervision\nsignals to the generator by joint training. The classifier-guide generator\nimputes missing values with label-awareness during training, improving the\nclassifier's performance during inference.

Unlike existing methods that depend\nstrongly on the density of data points close to the boundary of the safe state\nspace to train neural network controllers with closed-loop safety guarantees,\nhere we propose an alternative approach that lifts such strong assumptions on\nthe data that are hard to satisfy in practice and instead allows for graceful\nsafety violations, i.e., of a bounded magnitude that can be spatially\ncontrolled. To do so, we employ reachability analysis techniques to encapsulate\nsafety constraints in the training process. Specifically, to obtain a\ncomputationally efficient over-approximation of the forward reachable set of\nthe closed-loop system, we partition the robot's state space into cells and\nadaptively subdivide the cells that contain states which may escape the safe\nset under the trained control law. Then, using the overlap between each cell's\nforward reachable set and the set of infeasible robot configurations as a\nmeasure for safety violations, we introduce appropriate terms into the loss\nfunction that penalize this overlap in the training process. As a result, our\nmethod can learn a safe vector field for the closed-loop system and, at the\nsame time, provide worst-case bounds on safety violation over the whole\nconfiguration space, defined by the overlap between the over-approximation of\nthe forward reachable set of the closed-loop system and the set of unsafe\nstates. Moreover, it can control the tradeoff between computational complexity\nand tightness of these bounds.

This paper introduces an importance\n(re-)weighting method in MC history scoring to concurrently construct estimates\nfor error scenarios, the expected dose and its variance from a single set of MC\nsimulated particle histories. The approach relies on a multivariate Gaussian\ninput and uncertainty model, which assigns probabilities to the initial phase\nspace sample, enabling the use of different correlation models.

We find a peculiar velocity $1.6\\pm 0.5 \\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$,\nlarger than the CMBR value roughly by a factor of four, along\nRA$=173^{\\circ}\\pm12^{\\circ}$, Dec$=10^{\\circ}\\pm9^{\\circ}$, the direction\nbeing within $\\stackrel{<}{_{\\sim}}2\\sigma$ of the CMBR dipole. Since a genuine\nsolar motion would not depend upon the method or the dataset employed, large\ndiscrepancies seen among various dipole amplitudes could imply that these\ndipoles, including the CMBR one, might not pertain to observer's peculiar\nmotion. However, a common direction for various dipoles might indicate a\npreferred direction in the universe, implying an intrinsic anisotropy, in\nviolation of the cosmological principle, a cornerstone of the modern cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 11:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 16:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 09:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

To handle these issues, two new interference alignment schemes,\ni.e., the retrospective interference regeneration (RIR) scheme and the\nbeamforming based distributed retrospective interference alignment (B-DRIA)\nscheme, are proposed for cellular K-user MIMO downlink networks. For the RIR\nscheme, it adopts interference elimination algorithm to erase redundant symbols\nin inter-cell interference (ICI) signals, and then uses interference\nregeneration algorithm to avoid secondary interference. The RIR scheme obtains\ngreater DoF gain than the retrospective interference alignment (RIA) scheme,\nbut incurs performance degradation when the transceiver antennas ratio (TAR)\napproaches 1.

Legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and recent state-level regulations, permits\nsharing de-identified person-level data; however, current de-identification\napproaches are limited. namely, they are inefficient, relying on retrospective\ndisclosure risk assessments, and do not flex with changes in infection rates or\npopulation demographics over time. In this paper, we introduce a framework to\ndynamically adapt de-identification for near-real time sharing of person-level\nsurveillance data. The framework leverages a simulation mechanism, capable of\napplication at any geographic level, to forecast the re-identification risk of\nsharing the data under a wide range of generalization policies. The estimates\ninform weekly, prospective policy selection to maintain the proportion of\nrecords corresponding to a group size less than 11 (PK11) at or below 0.1.\nFixing the policy at the start of each week facilitates timely dataset updates\nand supports sharing granular date information. We use August 2020 through\nOctober 2021 case data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in\nmaintaining the PK!1 threshold of 0.01. When sharing COVID-19 county-level case\ndata across all US counties, the framework's approach meets the threshold for\n96.2% of daily data releases, while a policy based on current de-identification\ntechniques meets the threshold for 32.3%. Periodically adapting the data\npublication policies preserves privacy while enhancing public health utility\nthrough timely updates and sharing epidemiologically critical features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 19:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 16:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

However, existing\noptimizations were designed for settings where CNNs were platform- (not user-)\ndetermined, and fail to meet at least one of the following key platform goals\nwhen that condition is violated: reliable accuracy, low latency, and minimal\nwasted work.\n  We present Boggart, a system that simultaneously meets all three goals while\nsupporting the generality that today's platforms seek. Prior to queries being\nissued, Boggart carefully employs traditional computer vision algorithms to\ngenerate indices that are imprecise, but are fundamentally comprehensive across\ndifferent CNNs/queries. For each issued query, Boggart employs new techniques\nto quickly characterize the imprecision of its index, and sparingly run CNNs\n(and propagate the results to other frames) in a way that bounds accuracy\ndrops. Our results highlight that Boggart's improved generality comes at low\ncost, with speedups that match (and most often, exceed) prior, model-specific\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 19:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 19:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Since the dramatic increase in amount of data puts\nforward higher requirements for the capability of real-time signal analysis, it\nis difficult for existing EMD and its variants to trade off the growth of data\ndimension and the speed of signal analysis. In order to decompose\nmulti-dimensional signals at a faster speed, we present a novel\nsignal-serialization method (serial-EMD), which concatenates multi-variate or\nmulti-dimensional signals into a one-dimensional signal and uses various\none-dimensional EMD algorithms to decompose it. To verify the effects of the\nproposed method, synthetic multi-variate time series, artificial 2D images with\nvarious textures and real-world facial images are tested. Compared with\nexisting multi-EMD algorithms, the decomposition time becomes significantly\nreduced. In addition, the results of facial recognition with Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs) extracted using our method can achieve a higher accuracy than\nthose obtained by existing multi-EMD algorithms, which demonstrates the\nsuperior performance of our method in terms of the quality of IMFs.\nFurthermore, this method can provide a new perspective to optimize the existing\nEMD algorithms, that is, transforming the structure of the input signal rather\nthan being constrained by developing envelope computation techniques or signal\ndecomposition methods. In summary, the study suggests that the serial-EMD\ntechnique is a highly competitive and fast alternative for multi-dimensional\nsignal analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 03:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The remaining\n\"tough nuts\" regarding modelling capabilities include non-energy sector and\nsocial behaviour interaction effects. In general, the optimisation and\nsimulation models differ in their respective strengths, justifying the\nexistence of both.

The introduced formalism allows us to derive three\nstatistical-physics-based algorithms for the KP: one based on the recursive\ndefinition of the exact partition function; another based on the large weight\nlimit of that partition function; and a final one based on the zero-temperature\nlimit of the second. Comparing the performances of the algorithms, we find that\nthey do not consistently outperform (in terms of runtime and accuracy) dynamic\nprogramming, annealing, or standard greedy algorithms. However, the exact\npartition function is shown to reproduce the dynamic programming solution to\nthe KP, and the zero-temperature algorithm is shown to produce a greedy\nsolution. Therefore, although dynamic programming and greedy solutions to the\nKP are conceptually distinct, the statistical physics formalism introduced in\nthis work reveals that the large weight-constraint limit of the former leads to\nthe latter. We conclude by discussing how to extend this formalism in order to\nobtain more accurate versions of the introduced algorithms and to other similar\ncombinatorial optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 15:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 23:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}
