To this end, we use the inversion code STiC to\nextract the strength and orientation of the magnetic field from synthetic\nspectropolarimetric data generated with the Hanle-RT code. The latter accounts\nfor the generation of polarization through scattering processes as well as the\njoint actions of the Hanle and the Zeeman effects.

To identify these subspaces,\nresearchers typically analyze the statistical information from a collection of\nsynthesized data, and the identified subspaces tend to control image attributes\nglobally (i.e., manipulating an attribute causes the change of an entire\nimage). By contrast, this work introduces low-rank subspaces that enable more\nprecise control of GAN generation. Concretely, given an arbitrary image and a\nregion of interest (e.g., eyes of face images), we manage to relate the latent\nspace to the image region with the Jacobian matrix and then use low-rank\nfactorization to discover steerable latent subspaces. There are three\ndistinguishable strengths of our approach that can be aptly called LowRankGAN.\nFirst, compared to analytic algorithms in prior work, our low-rank\nfactorization of Jacobians is able to find the low-dimensional representation\nof attribute manifold, making image editing more precise and controllable.\nSecond, low-rank factorization naturally yields a null space of attributes such\nthat moving the latent code within it only affects the outer region of\ninterest. Therefore, local image editing can be simply achieved by projecting\nan attribute vector into the null space without relying on a spatial mask as\nexisting methods do.

In this work, we propose\na deep reinforcement learning based solution for order dispatching and we\nconduct large scale online A/B tests on DiDi's ride-dispatching platform to\nshow that the proposed method achieves significant improvement on both total\ndriver income and user experience related metrics. In particular, we model the\nride dispatching problem as a Semi Markov Decision Process to account for the\ntemporal aspect of the dispatching actions. To improve the stability of the\nvalue iteration with nonlinear function approximators like neural networks, we\npropose Cerebellar Value Networks (CVNet) with a novel distributed state\nrepresentation layer. We further derive a regularized policy evaluation scheme\nfor CVNet that penalizes large Lipschitz constant of the value network for\nadditional robustness against adversarial perturbation and noises. Finally, we\nadapt various transfer learning methods to CVNet for increased learning\nadaptability and efficiency across multiple cities. We conduct extensive\noffline simulations based on real dispatching data as well as online AB tests\nthrough the DiDi's platform. Results show that CVNet consistently outperforms\nother recently proposed dispatching methods. We finally show that the\nperformance can be further improved through the efficient use of transfer\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 16:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

This work presents a\nfollow up study of the spectral evolution over two decades of the pulsing ULX\nNGC 1313 X-2, in order to understand the structure of the accretion disc. The\nprimary objective is to determine the shape and nature of the dominant spectral\ncomponents by investigating their variability with the changes in the source\nluminosity. We have performed a spectral analysis over the canonical 0.3-10 keV\nenergy band of all the high signal-to-noise XMM-Newton observations, and we\nhave tested a number of different spectral models, which should approximate\nsuper-Eddington accretion discs. The baseline model consists of two thermal\nblackbody components with different temperatures plus an exponential cutoff\npowerlaw. In particular, the hotter and brighter thermal component describes\nthe emission from the super-Eddington inner disc and the cutoff powerlaw the\ncontribution from the accretion column of the neutron star. Instead, the cooler\ncomponent describes the emission from the outer region of the disc close to the\nspherisation radius and the wind. The luminosity-temperature relation for the\ncool component follows a negative trend, which is not consistent with\nL$\\propto$T$^4$, as expected from a sub-Eddington thin disc of Shakura-Sunayev,\nnor with L$\\propto$T$^2$, as expected for advection-dominated disc, but would\nrather agree with a wind-dominated X-ray emitting region. Instead, the (L,T)\nrelation for the hotter component is somewhere in between the first two\ntheoretical scenarios.

In this work, we first propose a novel pure\ntransformer-based mask vision transformer (MVT) for FER in the wild, which\nconsists of two modules: a transformer-based mask generation network (MGN) to\ngenerate a mask that can filter out complex backgrounds and occlusion of face\nimages, and a dynamic relabeling module to rectify incorrect labels in FER\ndatasets in the wild. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MVT\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on RAF-DB with 88.62%, FERPlus with\n89.22%, and AffectNet-7 with 64.57%, respectively, and achieves a comparable\nresult on AffectNet-8 with 61.40%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 16:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 13:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Conventional\npost-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this\npaper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference\ncomplexity, without sacrificing the achievable accuracy. We carry out the\nfirst-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach of\nintegrating sparsity in ViTs \"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of\ntraining full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while\nsticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes\nmodel parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with\none sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended\nfrom unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide\nthe prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. We further co-explore\ndata and architecture sparsity for additional efficiency gains by plugging in a\nnovel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the currently most vital\npatches. Extensive results on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones validate the\neffectiveness of our proposals which obtain significantly reduced computational\ncost and almost unimpaired generalization.

Humans possess the ability to extrapolate reasoning strategies learned\non simple problems to solve harder examples, often by thinking for longer. For\nexample, a person who has learned to solve small mazes can easily extend the\nvery same search techniques to solve much larger mazes by spending more time.\nIn computers, this behavior is often achieved through the use of algorithms,\nwhich scale to arbitrarily hard problem instances at the cost of more\ncomputation. In contrast, the sequential computing budget of feed-forward\nneural networks is limited by their depth, and networks trained on simple\nproblems have no way of extending their reasoning to accommodate harder\nproblems. In this work, we show that recurrent networks trained to solve simple\nproblems with few recurrent steps can indeed solve much more complex problems\nsimply by performing additional recurrences during inference.

Generalizing across environments thus challenges the conventional\nframeworks. The classical settings suggest either considering data as i.i.d.\nand learning a single model to cover all situations or learning\nenvironment-specific models. Both are sub-optimal: the former disregards the\ndiscrepancies between environments leading to biased solutions, while the\nlatter does not exploit their potential commonalities and is prone to scarcity\nproblems. We propose LEADS, a novel framework that leverages the commonalities\nand discrepancies among known environments to improve model generalization.\nThis is achieved with a tailored training formulation aiming at capturing\ncommon dynamics within a shared model while additional terms capture\nenvironment-specific dynamics.

The relationship between the subsystem size (in\ndimensionless form) $\\frac{l}{a}$ and the turning point (in dimensionless form)\nintroduces a critical length scale $\\frac{l_c}{a}$ which leads to three domains\nin the theory, namely, the deep UV domain ($l< l_c$; $au_{t}\\gg 1$, $au_{t}\\sim\nau_{b}$), deep noncommutative domain ($l> l_c,~au_{b}>au_t\\gg 1$) and deep IR\ndomain ($l> l_c,~au_t\\ll 1$).

Traditionally,\nthe size of the MHOs is estimated through scale variation, a simple but ad hoc\nmethod without probabilistic interpretation. Bayesian approaches provide a\ncompelling alternative to estimate the size of the MHOs, but it is not clear\nhow to interpret the perturbative scales, like the factorisation and\nrenormalisation scales, in a Bayesian framework. Recently, it was proposed that\nthe scales can be incorporated as hidden parameters into a Bayesian model. In\nthis paper, we thoroughly scrutinise Bayesian approaches to MHO estimation and\nsystematically study the performance of different models on an extensive set of\nhigh-order calculations. We extend the framework in two significant ways.\nFirst, we define a new model that allows for asymmetric probability\ndistributions.

Despite past efforts in computing\nperturbative string corrections to the tree-level action, neither a systematic\napproach nor a unified framework has emerged yet. We make progress in this\ndirection, focusing on the moduli dependence of perturbative corrections to the\n4D scalar potential of type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications. We\nproceed by employing two strategies. First, we use two rescaling symmetries of\ntype IIB string theory to infer the dependence of any perturbative correction\non both the dilaton and the Calabi-Yau volume. Second, we use F/M-theory\nduality to conclude that KK reductions on elliptically-fibred Calabi-Yau\nfourfolds of the M-theory action at any order in the derivative expansion can\nonly generate $(\\alpha')^{\\rm even}$ corrections to the 4D scalar potential,\nwhich, moreover, all vanish for trivial fibrations. We finally give evidence\nthat $(\\alpha')^{\\rm odd}$ effects arise from integrating out KK and winding\nmodes on the elliptic fibration and argue that the leading no-scale breaking\neffects at string tree-level arise from $(\\alpha')^3$ effects, modulo potential\nlogarithmic corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Perhaps the most important non-thermal desorption\nmechanism is one induced by cosmic rays (CRs), which, when passing through a\ngrain, heat it transiently to a high temperature - the grain cools back to its\noriginal equilibrium temperature via the (partial) sublimation of the ice.\nCurrent cosmic-ray-induced desorption (CRD) models assume a fixed grain cooling\ntime. In this work we present a revised description of CRD in which the\ndesorption efficiency depends dynamically on the ice content. We apply the\nrevised desorption scheme to two-phase and three-phase chemical models in\nphysical conditions corresponding to starless and prestellar cores, and to\nmolecular cloud envelopes. We find that inside starless and prestellar cores,\nintroducing dynamic CRD can decrease gas-phase abundances by up to an order of\nmagnitude in two-phase chemical models. In three-phase chemical models our\nmodel produces very similar results to the static cooling scheme - when only\none monolayer of ice is considered active. Ice abundances are generally\ninsensitive to variations in the grain cooling time. Further improved CRD\nmodels need to take into account additional effects in the transient heating of\nthe grains, introduced for example by the adoption of a spectrum of CR\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 11:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

We introduce a\nparticularly simple subclass of multipartite states, which we term\npair-entangled network (PEN) states, as those that can be created by\ndistributing exclusively bipartite entanglement in a connected network. We show\nthat genuine multipartite entanglement in a PEN state depends on both the level\nof noise and the network topology and, in sharp contrast to the case of pure\nstates, it is not guaranteed by the mere distribution of mixed bipartite\nentangled states. Our main result is a markedly drastic feature of this\nphenomenon: the amount of connectivity in the network determines whether\ngenuine multipartite entanglement is robust to noise for any system size or\nwhether it is completely washed out under the slightest form of noise for a\nsufficiently large number of parties. This latter case implies fundamental\nlimitations for the application of certain networks in realistic scenarios,\nwhere the presence of some form of noise is unavoidable.

Li and Na abundances have been derived from the UVES\nspectrum using transitions weakly sensitive to non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium and assumed isotopic ratio. This new analysis confirms the\nsurprising Li and Na abundances of this star (A(Li) =+2.71+-0.07 dex,\n[Na/Fe]=+1.00+-0.05 dex). Additionally, we provide new pieces of evidence for\nits chemical characterisation. The 12C/13C isotopic ratio (15+-2) shows that\nthis star has not yet undergone the extra-mixing episode usually associated\nwith the red giant branch bump. Therefore, we can rule out the scenario of\nefficient deep extra-mixing during the red giant branch phase envisaged to\nexplain the high Li and Na abundances. Also, the star exhibits high abundances\nof both C and N ([C/Fe]=+0.45+-0.16 dex and [N/Fe]=+0.99+-0.20 dex), not\ncompatible with the typical C-N anticorrelation observed in globular cluster\nstars. We found evidence of a radial velocity variability in 25664, suggesting\nthat the star could be part of a binary system, likely having accreted material\nfrom a more massive companion when the latter was evolving in the AGB phase.\nViable candidates for the donor star are AGB stars with 3-4 Msun and super-AGB\nstars (~7-8 Msun), both able to produce Li- and Na-rich material.\nAlternatively, the star could be formed from the pure ejecta of a super-AGB\nstars, before the dilution with primordial gas occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 19:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

A player's utility in an SHG depends on its own\ndecision, and on the choices of its parent and all the tree leaves. SHGs thus\ngeneralize simultaneous-move games, as well as Stackelberg games with many\nfollowers. We leverage the structure of both the sequence of player moves as\nwell as payoff dependence to develop a gradient-based back propagation-style\nalgorithm, which we call Differential Backward Induction (DBI), for\napproximating equilibria of SHGs. We provide a sufficient condition for\nconvergence of DBI and demonstrate its efficacy in finding approximate\nequilibrium solutions to several SHG models of hierarchical policy-making\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 20:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 22:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 05:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 16:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

However, using a different subset of features that is most\ninformative for each test instance individually may not only improve prediction\naccuracy, but also the overall interpretability of the model. At the same time,\nfeature selection methods for classification have been known to be the most\neffective when many features are irrelevant and/or uncorrelated. In fact,\nfeature selection ignoring correlations between features can lead to poor\nclassification performance. In this work, a Bayesian network is utilized to\nmodel feature dependencies.

The small, but not insignificant, radial (~0.15 au) and\nlongitudinal (~8 deg) separation between PSP and STEREO-A at this time allows\nfor observations of both short-term radial evolution as well as investigation\nof the global CME structure in longitude. Although initially a slow CME,\nmagnetic field and plasma observations indicate that the CME drove a shock at\nSTEREO-A and also exhibited an increasing speed profile through the CME (i.e.\nevidence for compression). We find that the presence of the shock and other\ncompression signatures at 1 au are due to the CME having been overtaken and\naccelerated by a high speed solar wind stream (HSS). We estimate the minimum\ninteraction time between the CME and the HSS to be about 2.5 days, indicating\nthe interaction started well before the CME arrival at PSP and STEREO-A.\nDespite alterations of the CME by the HSS, we find that the CME magnetic field\nstructure is similar between the vantage points, with overall the same flux\nrope classification and the same field distortions present. These observations\nare consistent with the fact that coherence in the magnetic structure is needed\nfor steady and continued acceleration of the CME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 20:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

To quantify the\nrelationship between object-oriented (OO) metrics and defects, modelling has to\ntake into account the direct, and potentially indirect, effects of class size\non defects. However, some studies have shown that size cannot be simply\ncontrolled or ignored, when building prediction models. As such, there remains\na question whether, and when, to control for class size. This study provides a\nnew in-depth examination of the impact of class size on the relationship\nbetween OO metrics and software defects or defect-proneness. We assess the\nimpact of class size on the number of defects and defect-proneness in software\nsystems by employing a regression-based mediation (with bootstrapping) and\nmoderation analysis to investigate the direct and indirect effect of class size\nin count and binary defect prediction. Our results show that the size effect is\nnot always significant for all metrics. Of the seven OO metrics we\ninvestigated, size consistently has significant mediation impact only on the\nrelationship between Coupling Between Objects (CBO) and\ndefects/defect-proneness, and a potential moderation impact on the relationship\nbetween Fan-out and defects/defect-proneness. Based on our results we make\nthree recommendations. One, we encourage researchers and practitioners to\nexamine the impact of class size for the specific data they have in hand and\nthrough the use of the proposed statistical mediation/moderation procedures.\nTwo, we encourage empirical studies to investigate the indirect effect of\npossible additional variables in their models when relevant.

However, designing such composable DCNs can be challenging. A\ncomposable DCN that adopts a full mesh backplane between disaggregated compute\ncomponents within a rack and employs dedicated interfaces on each\npoint-to-point link is wasteful and expensive. In this paper, we propose and\ndescribe two (i.e., electrical, and electrical-optical) variants of a network\nfor composable DC (NetCoD). NetCoD adopts a targeted design to reduce the\nnumber of transceivers required when a mesh physical backplane is deployed\nbetween disaggregated compute components in the same rack.

The electrical-optical\nvariant of NetCoD achieves similar performance as a reference network while\nutilizing fewer transceivers per compute node. The targeted adoption of optical\ntechnologies by both variants of NetCoD achieves greater (4 - 5 times greater)\nutilization of available network throughput than the reference network which\nimplements a generic design. Under the various forms of disaggregation\nconsidered, both variant of NetCoD achieve near-optimal compute energy\nefficiency in the composable DC while satisfying both compute and network\nconstraints. This is because marginal concession of optimal compute energy\nefficiency is often required to achieve overall optimal energy efficiency in\ncomposable DCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 21:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Our\ntheoretical results are verified against Monte-Carlo simulations and compared\nwith explicit results for a general 1-dimensional system, thus providing new\ninsights into the variability of RI onset and helping better quantify the\nuncertainties of RI variability for practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 22:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 11:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Nevertheless, the wide and optimised\ndeployment of DL models is currently hindered by the vast system heterogeneity\nof mobile devices, the varying computational cost of different DL models and\nthe variability of performance needs across DL applications. This paper\nproposes OODIn, a framework for the optimised deployment of DL apps across\nheterogeneous mobile devices. OODIn comprises a novel DL-specific software\narchitecture together with an analytical framework for modelling DL\napplications that: (1) counteract the variability in device resources and DL\nmodels by means of a highly parametrised multi-layer design; and (2) perform a\nprincipled optimisation of both model- and system-level parameters through a\nmulti-objective formulation, designed for DL inference apps, in order to adapt\nthe deployment to the user-specified performance requirements and device\ncapabilities. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework\nconsistently outperforms status-quo designs across heterogeneous devices and\ndelivers up to 4.3x and 3.5x performance gain over highly optimised platform-\nand model-aware designs respectively, while effectively adapting execution to\ndynamic changes in resource availability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 22:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Passivity is a fundamental\nconcept in control theory, which abstracts energy conservation and dissipation\nin physical systems. It has become a standard tool in analysis of general\nfeedback systems, to which game dynamics belong. Our starting point is to show\nthat all continuous-time Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) dynamics, which\ninclude the well-known Replicator Dynamic, are lossless, i.e. it is passive\nwith no energy dissipation. Interestingly, we prove that passivity implies\nbounded regret, connecting two fundamental primitives of control theory and\nonline optimization.\n  The observation of energy conservation in FTRL inspires us to present a\nfamily of lossless learning dynamics, each of which has an underlying energy\nfunction with a simple gradient structure. This family is closed under convex\ncombination; as an immediate corollary, any convex combination of FTRL dynamics\nis lossless and thus has bounded regret. This allows us to extend the framework\nof Fox and Shamma [Games, 2013] to prove not just global asymptotic stability\nresults for game dynamics, but Poincar\\'e recurrence results as well.\nIntuitively, when a lossless game (e.g. graphical constant-sum game) is coupled\nwith lossless learning dynamics, their feedback interconnection is also\nlossless, which results in a pendulum-like energy-preserving recurrent\nbehavior, generalizing the results of Piliouras and Shamma [SODA, 2014] and\nMertikopoulos, Papadimitriou and Piliouras [SODA, 2018].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 00:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 17:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The structure and dynamics in the so-called supra-arcade\nregion thus contain important clues to the physical processes in flares and\nCMEs.

By identifying each\nindividual spike during the decay phase of four selected flares, in which the\nassociated CME is traversed by a near-Earth spacecraft, we found that the\nwidths of spikes are log-normal distributed, while the Fourier power spectra of\nthe overall supra-arcade EUV emission, including bright spikes and dark\ndownflows as well as the diffuse background, are power-law distributed, in\nterms of either spatial frequency $k$ or temporal frequency $\\nu$, which\nreflects the fragmentation of the VCS.

These members\nare defined through the various approaches such as photometric, statistical,\nkinematics etc. In the present paper, we have been using the photometric\ncolours of the identified stars for categorized them into the blue and red\ncomponent groups and identification of these groups is possible through (B-V)\nvs V colour magnitude diagram (CMD). Furthermore, the influence/effect of these\ngroups is also examined in the estimation of cluster parameters. The stellar\nenhancement of cluster NGC 6866 is found through the blue-component-stars (BCS)\nand the linear solution of best fitted values of King Models of the\nradial-densityprofile (RDP) gives the core radius as 5.22+/-0.29 arcmin. The\ngood agreement of present estimated parameters of the cluster with the\nliterature seems to be an effective evidence to consider BCS as the true\nrepresentative of the cluster. The stellar distribution of the cluster shows\ncontinuous phenomena of the mass segregation.

The usefulness of such near-term techniques, generally based on\nthe Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), however, is limited by device noise\nand the need to perform many circuit repetitions. This paper addresses these\nchallenges by generalizing VQE to consider wavefunctions in a subspace spanned\nby classically tractable states and states that can be prepared on a quantum\ncomputer. The manuscript shows how the ground and excited state energies can be\nestimated using such \"classical-boosting\" and how this approach can be combined\nwith VQE Hamiltonian decomposition techniques. Unlike existing VQE approaches,\nthe sensitivity to sampling error and device noise approaches zero in the limit\nwhere the classically tractable states are able to describe an eigenstate. A\ndetailed analysis of the measurement requirements in the simplest case, where a\nsingle computational basis state is used to boost conventional VQE, shows that\nthe ground-state energy estimation of several closed-shell homonuclear diatomic\nmolecules can be accelerated by a factor of approximately 10-1000. The analysis\nalso shows that the measurement reduction of such single basis state boosting,\nrelative to conventional VQE, can be estimated using only the overlap between\nthe ground state and the computational basis state used for boosting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 00:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

While it\nis possible to obtain a linear reduction in the variance by averaging all the\nstochastic gradients at every step, this requires a lot of communication\nbetween the workers and the server, which can dramatically reduce the gains\nfrom parallelism. The Local SGD method, proposed and analyzed in the earlier\nliterature, suggests machines should make many local steps between such\ncommunications. While the initial analysis of Local SGD showed it needs $\\Omega\n( \\sqrt{T} )$ communications for $T$ local gradient steps in order for the\nerror to scale proportionately to $1/(NT)$, this has been successively improved\nin a string of papers, with the state of the art requiring $\\Omega \\left( N\n\\left( \\mbox{ poly} (\\log T) \\right) \\right)$ communications.

Prior\nredundancy design approaches typically have each homogeneous redundant\nprocessing element (PE) to mitigate faulty PEs for a limited region of the 2-D\ncomputing array rather than the entire computing array to avoid the excessive\nhardware overhead. However, they fail to recover the computing array when the\nnumber of faulty PEs in any region exceeds the number of redundant PEs in the\nsame region. The mismatch problem deteriorates when the fault injection rate\nrises and the faults are unevenly distributed. To address the problem, we\npropose a hybrid computing architecture (HyCA) for fault-tolerant DLAs. It has\na set of dot-production processing units (DPPUs) to recompute all the\noperations that are mapped to the faulty PEs despite the faulty PE locations.\nAccording to our experiments, HyCA shows significantly higher reliability,\nscalability, and performance with less chip area penalty when compared to the\nconventional redundancy approaches. Moreover, by taking advantage of the\nflexible recomputing, HyCA can also be utilized to scan the entire 2-D\ncomputing array and detect the faulty PEs effectively at runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 02:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 11:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

In CCR theory, additional terms are invoked in the\nconstitutive relations of NSF equations originating from the arguments of\nirreversible thermodynamics as well as consistent with kinetic theory of gases.\nThe modelling approach allows us to derive new fundamental solutions for the\nlinearised CCR model and to develop a numerical framework based upon the method\nof fundamental solutions (MFS) and enables threedimensional multiphase\nmicro-flow simulations to be performed at remarkably low computational cost.\nThe new framework is benchmarked against classical results and then explored as\nan efficient tool for solving three-dimensional phase-change events involving\ndroplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 04:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Current forensic practice visually inspects the complex jagged\ntrajectory of fractured surfaces to recognize a ``match'' using comparative\nmicroscopy and physical pattern analysis. We developed a novel computational\nframework, utilizing the basic concepts of fracture mechanics and statistical\nanalysis to provide quantitative match analysis for match probability and error\nrates. The framework employs the statistics of fracture surfaces to become\nnon-self-affine with unique roughness characteristics at relevant microscopic\nlength scale, dictated by the intrinsic material resistance to fracture and its\nmicrostructure. At such a scale, which was found to be greater than two\ngrain-size or micro-feature-size, we establish that the material intrinsic\nproperties, microstructure, and exposure history to external forces on an\nevidence fragment have the premise of uniqueness, which quantitatively\ndescribes the microscopic features on the fracture surface for forensic\ncomparisons. The methodology utilizes 3D spectral analysis of overlapping\ntopological images of the fracture surface and classifies specimens with very\nhigh accuracy using statistical learning. Cross correlations of image-pairs in\ntwo frequency ranges are used to develop matrix variate statistical models for\nthe distributions among matching and non-matching pairs of images, and provides\na decision rule for identifying matches and determining error rates.

The Bloch equations, which describes spin and relaxation in a\nmagnetic field, is a set of integer order differential equations with a\nsolution exhibiting mono-exponential behaviour in time. Parameters of the model\nmay be estimated using a non-linear solver, or by creating a dictionary of\nmodel parameters from which MRI signals are simulated and then matched with\nexperiment.

Due to the safety-critical nature of blockchains,\nensuring the correctness of their implementation is paramount.\n  We show our formally verified implementation of the core part of Plebeia\nusing F*. Plebeia is a library to manipulate an extension of Merkle trees\n(called Plebeia trees). It is being implemented as a part of the storage system\nof the Tezos blockchain system. To this end, we gradually ported Plebeia to F*;\nthe OCaml code extracted from the modules ported to F* is linked with the\nunverified part of Plebeia. By this gradual porting process, we can obtain a\nworking code from our partially verified implementation of Plebeia; we\nconfirmed that the binary passes all the unit tests of Plebeia.\n  More specifically, we verified the following properties on the implementation\nof Plebeia: (1) Each tree-manipulating function preserves the invariants on the\ndata structure of a Plebeia tree and satisfies the functional requirements as a\nnested key-value store; (2) Each function for serializing/deserializing a\nPlebeia tree to/from the low-level storage is implemented correctly; and (3)\nThe hash function for a Plebeia tree is relatively collision-resistant with\nrespect to the cryptographic safety of the blake2b hash function. During\nporting Plebeia to F*, we found a bug in an old version of Plebeia, which was\noverlooked by the tests bundled with the original implementation. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that verifies a production-level\nimplementation of a Merkle-tree library by F*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Here,\n$(j_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}$ is a sequence of positive numbers growing\nproportionally to $\\log n$. We call such levels late, for the nested occupancy\nscheme gets extinct in the levels which grow super-logarithmically in $n$ in\nthe sense that each occupied box contains one ball. Also, in some regimes we\nprove the strong laws of large numbers (a) for the number of the $j$th level\nboxes which contain at least $k$ balls, $k\\geq 2$ and (b) under the assumption\nthat the mean number of the first level boxes is finite, for the number of\nempty boxes in the $j$th level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

On the other hand, the new method overcomes\nthe shortcomings of Bayesian inference in giving precise and unambiguous\nguidelines for the selection of covariates by benefiting from boosting\ntechniques. The implementation of Bayesian inference leads to the randomness of\nmodel selection criteria like the conditional AIC (cAIC), so we also propose a\ncAIC-based model selection criteria that focus on the stabilized regions\ninstead of the global minimum. The effectiveness of the new approach can be\nobserved via simulation and in a data example from the field of neurophysiology\nfocussing on the mechanisms in the brain while listening to unpleasant sounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 07:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

This\ngap is surprising, given that the bipartite fractional matching polytope is\nintegral, and so lossless rounding is possible. This gap was explained by\nDevanur et al.~(SODA'13), who showed that \\emph{online} lossless rounding is\nimpossible.\n  Despite the above, we initiate the study of lossless online rounding for\nonline bipartite matching problems. Our key observation is that while lossless\nonline rounding is impossible \\emph{in general}, randomized algorithms induce\nfractional algorithms of the same competitive ratio which by definition are\nlosslessly roundable online. This motivates the addition of constraints that\ndecrease the ``online integrality gap'', thus allowing for lossless online\nrounding. We characterize a set of non-convex constraints which allow for such\nlossless online rounding, and better competitive ratios than yielded by\ndeterministic algorithms.\n  As applications of our lossless online rounding approach, we obtain two\nresults of independent interest: (i) a doubly-exponential improvement, and a\nsharp threshold for the amount of randomness (or advice) needed to outperform\ndeterministic online (vertex-weighted) bipartite matching algorithms, and (ii)\nan optimal semi-OCS, matching a recent result of Gao et al.~(FOCS'21) answering\na question of Fahrbach et al.~(FOCS'20).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 07:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 04:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Fine-tuning a pre-trained CTR model from source domains\nand adapting it to a target domain allows knowledge transferring. However,\noptimizing all the parameters of the pre-trained network may result in\nover-fitting if the target dataset is small and the number of parameters is\nlarge. This leads us to think of directly reusing parameters in the pre-trained\nmodel which represent more general features learned from multiple domains.\nHowever, the design of freezing or fine-tuning layers of parameters requires\nmuch manual effort since the decision highly depends on the pre-trained model\nand target instances. In this work, we propose an end-to-end transfer learning\nframework, called Automatic Fine-Tuning (AutoFT), for CTR prediction.

As our main contribution, we prove that the\ngeneralization error of a stochastic optimization algorithm can be bounded\nbased on the `complexity' of the fractal structure that underlies its invariant\nmeasure. Leveraging results from dynamical systems theory, we show that the\ngeneralization error can be explicitly linked to the choice of the algorithm\n(e.g., stochastic gradient descent -- SGD), algorithm hyperparameters (e.g.,\nstep-size, batch-size), and the geometry of the problem (e.g., Hessian of the\nloss). We further specialize our results to specific problems (e.g.,\nlinear/logistic regression, one hidden-layered neural networks) and algorithms\n(e.g., SGD and preconditioned variants), and obtain analytical estimates for\nour bound.For modern neural networks, we develop an efficient algorithm to\ncompute the developed bound and support our theory with various experiments on\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 08:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

However, existing\nalgorithms and theories for learning near-optimal policies in these two\nsettings are rather different and disconnected. Towards bridging this gap, this\npaper initiates the theoretical study of policy finetuning, that is, online RL\nwhere the learner has additional access to a \"reference policy\" $\\mu$ close to\nthe optimal policy $\\pi_\\star$ in a certain sense. We consider the policy\nfinetuning problem in episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$\nstates, $A$ actions, and horizon length $H$. We first design a sharp offline\nreduction algorithm -- which simply executes $\\mu$ and runs offline policy\noptimization on the collected dataset -- that finds an $\\varepsilon$\nnear-optimal policy within $\\widetilde{O}(H^3SC^\\star/\\varepsilon^2)$ episodes,\nwhere $C^\\star$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient between $\\mu$\nand $\\pi_\\star$. This offline result is the first that matches the sample\ncomplexity lower bound in this setting, and resolves a recent open question in\noffline RL. We then establish an $\\Omega(H^3S\\min\\{C^\\star, A\\}/\\varepsilon^2)$\nsample complexity lower bound for any policy finetuning algorithm, including\nthose that can adaptively explore the environment. This implies that -- perhaps\nsurprisingly -- the optimal policy finetuning algorithm is either offline\nreduction or a purely online RL algorithm that does not use $\\mu$. Finally, we\ndesign a new hybrid offline/online algorithm for policy finetuning that\nachieves better sample complexity than both vanilla offline reduction and\npurely online RL algorithms, in a relaxed setting where $\\mu$ only satisfies\nconcentrability partially up to a certain time step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 08:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 06:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Using graph representations,\nMultiScaleGNN can impose periodic boundary conditions as an inductive bias on\nthe edges in the graphs, and achieve independence to the nodes' positions. We\ndemonstrate this method on advection problems and incompressible fluid\ndynamics. Our results show that the proposed model can generalise from uniform\nadvection fields to high-gradient fields on complex domains at test time and\ninfer long-term Navier-Stokes solutions within a range of Reynolds numbers.\nSimulations obtained with MultiScaleGNN are between two and four orders of\nmagnitude faster than the ones on which it was trained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 08:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Even an imperceptible change can sometimes entail significant\nmodifications of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the underlying model\nused by browsers to render all the elements included in a web application.\nScripts that interact with web applications (e.g. web test scripts, crawlers,\nor robotic process automation) rely on this continuously evolving DOM which\nmeans they are often particularly fragile. More precisely, the major cause of\nbreakages observed in automation scripts are element locators, which are\nidentifiers used by automation scripts to navigate across the DOM. When the DOM\nevolves, these identifiers tend to break, thus causing the related scripts to\nno longer locate the intended target elements. For this reason, several\ncontributions explored the idea of automatically repairing broken locators on a\npage. These works attempt to repair a given broken locator by scanning all\nelements in the new DOM to find the most similar one. Unfortunately, this\napproach fails to scale when the complexity of web pages grows, leading either\nto long computation times or incorrect element repairs. This article,\ntherefore, adopts a different perspective on this problem by introducing a new\nlocator repair solution that leverages tree matching algorithms to relocate\nbroken locators.

Notably, TL is widely used for neural domain\nadaptation to transfer valuable knowledge from high-resource to low-resource\ndomains. In the standard fine-tuning scheme of TL, a model is initially\npre-trained on a source domain and subsequently fine-tuned on a target domain\nand, therefore, source and target domains are trained using the same\narchitecture. In this paper, we show through interpretation methods that such\nscheme, despite its efficiency, is suffering from a main limitation. Indeed,\nalthough capable of adapting to new domains, pre-trained neurons struggle with\nlearning certain patterns that are specific to the target domain. Moreover, we\nshed light on the hidden negative transfer occurring despite the high\nrelatedness between source and target domains, which may mitigate the final\ngain brought by transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose to\naugment the pre-trained model with normalised, weighted and randomly\ninitialised units that foster a better adaptation while maintaining the\nvaluable source knowledge. We show that our approach exhibits significant\nimprovements to the standard fine-tuning scheme for neural domain adaptation\nfrom the news domain to the social media domain on four NLP tasks:\npart-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and morphosyntactic\ntagging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 09:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Namely, on adversarially-trained models, perturbing adversarial\nexamples with a small random noise may invalidate their misled predictions.\nAfter carefully examining state-of-the-art attacks of various kinds, we find\nthat all these attacks have this deficiency to different extents.

SAD optimizes the online inference efficiency for GEC\nby two innovations: 1) it aggressively decodes as many tokens as possible in\nparallel instead of always decoding only one token in each step to improve\ncomputational parallelism; 2) it uses a shallow decoder instead of the\nconventional Transformer architecture with balanced encoder-decoder depth to\nreduce the computational cost during inference. Experiments in both English and\nChinese GEC benchmarks show that aggressive decoding could yield the same\npredictions as greedy decoding but with a significant speedup for online\ninference. Its combination with the shallow decoder could offer an even higher\nonline inference speedup over the powerful Transformer baseline without quality\nloss. Not only does our approach allow a single model to achieve the\nstate-of-the-art results in English GEC benchmarks: 66.4 F0.5 in the CoNLL-14\nand 72.9 F0.5 in the BEA-19 test set with an almost 10x online inference\nspeedup over the Transformer-big model, but also it is easily adapted to other\nlanguages.

These two types of\ncurrents can be separately excited by specific light polarization, circularly\npolarized lights for injection currents and linearly polarized lights for shift\ncurrents. Based on a tight binding model formed by carbon 2p$_z$ orbitals, we\nnumerically calculate the spectra of injection coefficients and shift\nconductivities, as well as their dependence on the static field strength and\nribbon width. The spectra show many peaks associated with the optical\ntransition between different subbands, and the positions and amplitudes of\nthese peaks can be effectively controlled by the static electric field.

Therefore, we construct effective contrastive\npairs for learning better illuminant-dependent features via a novel raw-domain\ncolor augmentation. On the NUS-8 dataset, our method provides $17.5\\%$ relative\nimprovements over a strong baseline, reaching state-of-the-art performance\nwithout increasing model complexity. Furthermore, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance on the Gehler dataset with $3\\times$ fewer parameters\ncompared to top-ranking deep learning methods. More importantly, we show that\nour model is more robust to different scenes under close proximity of\nilluminants, significantly reducing $28.7\\%$ worst-case error in data-sparse\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 11:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Gathering global contextual information will inevitably\nneed a tremendous amount of memory and computing resources, which has been\nextensively studied in the past several years. However, there is a further\nproblem with the self-attention scheme: is all information gathered from the\nglobal scope helpful for the contextual modelling? To our knowledge, few\nstudies have focused on the problem. Aimed at both questions this paper\nproposes the salient positions-based attention scheme SPANet, which is inspired\nby some interesting observations on the attention maps and affinity matrices\ngenerated in self-attention scheme. We believe these observations are\nbeneficial for better understanding of the self-attention. SPANet uses the\nsalient positions selection algorithm to select only a limited amount of\nsalient points to attend in the attention map computing. This approach will not\nonly spare a lot of memory and computing resources, but also try to distill the\npositive information from the transformation of the input feature maps. In the\nimplementation, considering the feature maps with channel high dimensions,\nwhich are completely different from the general visual image, we take the\nsquared power of the feature maps along the channel dimension as the saliency\nmetric of the positions. In general, different from the non-local block method,\nSPANet models the contextual information using only the selected positions\ninstead of all, along the channel dimension instead of space dimension.

To\nremain stealthy, the localization of devices in LTrack is fully passive,\nrelying on our new uplink/downlink sniffer. Our sniffer records both the times\nof arrival of LTE messages and the contents of the Timing Advance Commands,\nbased on which LTrack calculates locations. LTrack is the first to show the\nfeasibility of a passive localization in LTE through implementation on\nsoftware-defined radio.\n  Passive localization attacks reveal a user's location traces but can at best\nlink these traces to a device's pseudonymous temporary identifier (TMSI),\nmaking tracking in dense areas or over a long time-period challenging. LTrack\novercomes this challenge by introducing and implementing a new type of IMSI\nCatcher named IMSI Extractor. It extracts a device's IMSI and binds it to its\ncurrent TMSI. Instead of relying on fake base stations like existing IMSI\nCatchers, which are detectable due to their continuous transmission, IMSI\nExtractor relies on our uplink/downlink sniffer enhanced with surgical message\novershadowing. This makes our IMSI Extractor the stealthiest IMSI Catcher to\ndate.\n  We evaluate LTrack through a series of experiments and show that in\nline-of-sight conditions, the attacker can estimate the location of a phone\nwith less than 6m error in 90% of the cases. We successfully tested our IMSI\nExtractor against a set of 17 modern smartphones connected to our\nindustry-grade LTE testbed.

However, these technologies are prone to\ncomputational non-idealities, due to process variation and intrinsic device\nphysics. This degrades the task performance of networks deployed to the\nprocessor, by introducing parameter noise into the deployed model. While it is\npossible to calibrate each device, or train networks individually for each\nprocessor, these approaches are expensive and impractical for commercial\ndeployment. Alternative methods are therefore needed to train networks that are\ninherently robust against parameter variation, as a consequence of network\narchitecture and parameters. We present a new adversarial network optimisation\nalgorithm that attacks network parameters during training, and promotes robust\nperformance during inference in the face of parameter variation.

The aquaplanet's oceanic\ncirculation is dominated by an equatorial zonal jet and four Ekman driven\nmeridional overturning circulation (MOC) cells aligned with the westerly\natmospheric jet streams and easterly trade winds in both hemispheres. Including\nSGW parameterization (representing modulations of air-sea momentum fluxes,\nLangmuir circulation and Stokes-Coriolis force) increases mixed layer vertical\nmomentum diffusivity by approx. 40% and dampens surface momentum fluxes by\napprox. 4%. The correspondingly dampened MOC impacts the oceanic density\nstructure to 1 km depth by lessening the large-scale advective transports of\nheat and salt, freshening the equatorial latitudes (where evaporation minus\nprecipitation [E-P] is negative) and increasing salinity in the subtropics\n(where E-P is positive) by approx. 1%.

The\ncompression of matter accompanying the decay of the magnetic field may trigger\nexothermic electron captures and, possibly, pycnonuclear fusions of light\nelements that may have been accreted onto the surface from the fallback of\nsupernova debris, from a disk or from the interstellar medium. This scenario\nbears some resemblance to deep crustal heating in accreting neutron stars,\nalthough the matter composition and the thermodynamic conditions are very\ndifferent. The maximum possible amount of heat that can be released by each\nreaction and their locations are determined analytically taking into account\nthe Landau--Rabi quantization of electron motion. Numerical results are also\npresented using experimental, as well as theoretical nuclear data. Whereas the\nheat deposited is mainly determined by atomic masses, the locations of the\nsources are found to be very sensitive to the magnetic field strength, thus\nproviding a new way of probing the internal magnetic field of magnetars. Most\nsources are found to be concentrated at densities $10^{10}-10^{11}$ g cm$^{-3}$\nwith heat power $W^\\infty\\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}$ erg/s, as found empirically by\ncomparing cooling simulations with observed thermal luminosity. The change of\nmagnetic field required to trigger the reactions is shown to be consistent with\nthe age of known magnetars. This suggests that electron captures and\npycnonuclear fusion reactions may be a viable heating mechanism in magnetars.\nThe present results provide consistent microscopic inputs for neutron star\ncooling simulations, based on the same model as that underlying the\nBrussels-Montreal unified equations of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 12:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

The interaction between dark matter\nparticles and baryonic matter causes dark matter particles to lose some part of\ntheir kinetic energy. Once dark matter particles lose part of their kinetic\nenergy, they are gravitationally bound to stars, and stars start to absorb dark\nmatter particles from the halo. The absorption of dark matter particles inside\ncompact binary systems increases the mass of the binary components, and then\nthe total mass of the binary systems increases as well. According to Kepler's\nthird law, increased mass through this way can affect other physical parameters\n(e.g., semi-major axes and orbital periods) of these systems too. We estimate\nthe period change of some known compact binary systems due to the accretion of\ndark matter particles into them.

Directly combining two tasks by\npost-processing also leads to poor performance. There is a lack of research on\nrelative saliency at present, limiting the practical applications such as\ncontent-aware image cropping, video summary, and image labeling.\n  In this paper, we study the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) task, which manages\nto assign a ranking order of each detected object according to its visual\nsaliency.

So far, much attention has been devoted\nto the detection of communities, bipartite and core-periphery structures on\nbinary networks: such an effort has led to the definition of a unified\nframework based upon the score function called surprise, i.e. a p-value that\ncan be assigned to any given partition of nodes, on both undirected and\ndirected networks. Here, we aim at making a step further, by extending the\nentire framework to the weighted case: after reviewing the application of the\nsurprise-based formalism to the detection of binary mesoscale structures, we\npresent a suitable generalization of it for detecting weighted mesoscale\nstructures, a topic that has received much less attention. To this aim, we\nanalyze four variants of the surprise; from a technical point of view, this\namounts at employing four variants of the hypergeometric distribution: the\nbinomial one for the detection of binary communities, the multinomial one for\nthe detection of binary \"bimodular\" structures and their negative counterparts\nfor the detection of communities and \"bimodular\" structures on weighted\nnetworks. On top of that, we define two \"enhanced\" variants of surprise, able\nto encode both binary and weighted constraints and whose definition rests upon\ntwo suitable generalizations of the hypergeometric distribution itself. As a\nresult, we present a general, statistically-grounded approach to detect\nmesoscale structures on networks via a unified, suprise-based framework. To\nillustrate the performance of our methods, we, first, test them on a variety of\nwell-established, synthetic benchmarks and, then, apply them to several\nreal-world networks, i.e. social, economic, financial and ecological ones.\nMoreover, we attach to the paper a Python code implementing all the considered\nvariants of surprise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 13:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 22:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

These miniaturized and battery driven microcombs have become a disruptive\ntechnology for precision metrology, broadband telecommunication and ultrafast\noptical ranging. In this work, we report on the first experimental observation\nof dissipative Kerr solitons generated in a ring cavity with a fast\nsemiconductor gain medium. The moderate quality factor of the ring cavity is\ncompensated by the giant resonant Kerr nonlinearity of a quantum cascade laser,\nwhich is more than a million times larger than in Si3N4.

Two\nindependent techniques shed light on the waveform and coherence of the solitons\nand confirm a pulse width of approximately 3 ps.

Our approach takes inspiration\nfrom the concept of strong backdoors, which corresponds to a small set of\nvariables such that only branching on these variables yields an optimal\nintegral solution and a proof of optimality. Our notion of pseudo-backdoors\ncorresponds to a small set of variables such that only branching on them leads\nto faster solve time (which can be solver dependent). A key advantage of\npseudo-backdoors over strong backdoors is that they are much amenable to\ndata-driven identification or prediction. Our proposed method learns to\nestimate the solver performance of a proposed pseudo-backdoor, using a labeled\ndataset collected on a set of training MIP instances.

However, finding the optimal adversary is challenging, in terms of both\nwhether we can find the optimal attack and how efficiently we can find it.\nExisting works on adversarial RL either use heuristics-based methods that may\nnot find the strongest adversary, or directly train an RL-based adversary by\ntreating the agent as a part of the environment, which can find the optimal\nadversary but may become intractable in a large state space. This paper\nintroduces a novel attacking method to find the optimal attacks through\ncollaboration between a designed function named \"actor\" and an RL-based learner\nnamed \"director\". The actor crafts state perturbations for a given policy\nperturbation direction, and the director learns to propose the best policy\nperturbation directions. Our proposed algorithm, PA-AD, is theoretically\noptimal and significantly more efficient than prior RL-based works in\nenvironments with large state spaces.

Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed\n2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We\nuse an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural\nimages. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to\nsubjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -\nreferred to as \"paired\" data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images\nwith no fMRI recordings (\"unpaired data\"). The estimated depth maps are then\nused as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction\ndirectly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and\njoint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available \"paired\"\ntraining data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via\nself-supervised cycle-consistent training on many \"unpaired\" data (natural\nimages & depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and\ntrained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.\nWe show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its\nindirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images.

Due to the alternation or movement of\nimage devices, the acquired multispectral and multimodal images are usually\nmisaligned, and hence image registration is pre-requisite. Different from the\nregistration of common images, the registration of multispectral or multimodal\nimages is a challenging problem due to the nonlinear variation of intensity and\ngradient. To cope with this challenge, we propose the phase congruency network\n(PCNet) to enhance the structure similarity of multispectral or multimodal\nimages. The images can then be aligned using the similarity-enhanced feature\nmaps produced by the network. PCNet is constructed under the inspiration of the\nwell-known phase congruency. The network embeds the phase congruency prior into\ntwo simple trainable layers and series of modified learnable Gabor kernels.\nThanks to the prior knowledge, once trained, PCNet is applicable on a variety\nof multispectral and multimodal data such as flash/no-flash and RGB/NIR images\nwithout additional further tuning. The prior also makes the network\nlightweight. The trainable parameters of PCNet are 2400 times less than the\ndeep-learning registration method DHN, while its registration performance\nsurpasses DHN. Experimental results validate that PCNet outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art conventional multimodal registration algorithms.

Bello et al. (2016) propose active search,\nwhich adjusts the weights of a (trained) model with respect to a single\ninstance at test time using reinforcement learning. While active search is\nsimple to implement, it is not competitive with state-of-the-art methods\nbecause adjusting all model weights for each test instance is very time and\nmemory intensive. Instead of updating all model weights, we propose and\nevaluate three efficient active search strategies that only update a subset of\nparameters during the search.

We aim to investigate\nthe nature of the proto-typical superthin galaxy Fourcade-Figueroa (FF), to\nunderstand the role played by the dark matter halo in forming its superthin\nshape and to investigate the mechanism that explains the observed disruption in\nthe approaching side of the galaxy. Combining new HI 21-cm observations\nobtained with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope with archival data from the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array we were able to obtain sensitive HI\nobservations of the FF galaxy. These data were modeled with a 3D tilted ring\nmodel in order to derive the rotation curve and surface brightness density of\nthe neutral hydrogen. We subsequently used this model, combined with a stellar\nprofile from the literature, to derive the radial distribution of the dark\nmatter in the FF galaxy. For the FF galaxy the Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter\ndistribution provides the best fit to the observed rotation curve. However, the\ndifferences with a pseudo-isothermal halo are small. Both models indicate that\nthe core of the dark matter halo is compact. Even though the FF galaxy\nclassifies as superthin, the gas thickness about the galactic centre exhibits a\nsteep flaring of the gas which is in agreement with the edge of the stellar\ndisk. As suggested previously in the literature, the compact dark matter halo\nmight be the main responsible for the superthin structure of the stellar disk\nin FF. This idea is strengthened through the detection of the mentioned\ndisruption; the fact that the galaxy is disturbed also seems to support the\nidea that it is not isolation that cause its superthin structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 15:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

The bias of the feature\nvariable is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the\nfeature variable and the target variable. The weight of the edge connecting the\ntwo feature variables is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient\nbetween two feature variables in the binary quadratic model.

Since the representation of a node is computed by\nrecursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its\nneighboring nodes from previous layers, the receptive fields grow\nexponentially, which makes standard stochastic optimization techniques\nineffective. Various approaches have been proposed to alleviate this issue,\ne.g., sampling-based methods and techniques based on pre-computation of graph\nfilters.\n  In this paper, we take a different approach and propose to use graph\ncoarsening for scalable training of GNNs, which is generic, extremely simple\nand has sublinear memory and time costs during training. We present extensive\ntheoretical analysis on the effect of using coarsening operations and provides\nuseful guidance on the choice of coarsening methods. Interestingly, our\ntheoretical analysis shows that coarsening can also be considered as a type of\nregularization and may improve the generalization. Finally, empirical results\non real world datasets show that, simply applying off-the-shelf coarsening\nmethods, we can reduce the number of nodes by up to a factor of ten without\ncausing a noticeable downgrade in classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 15:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

The examples presented show\nthat the covering-based method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors,\nincluding coffee-house, suggesting that it inherits from its guaranteed 50\\%\noptimality gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 09:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

This excess could be a thermal IR echo from\npre-existing CSM dust, or emission from newly-formed dust either in the cooling\npostshock region of the CSM, or in the cooling SN ejecta. Recent analysis has\nshown that dust formation in the CSM can commence only after day ~380, and has\nalso ruled out newly-formed ejecta dust as the source of the NIR emission. The\nearly (< 380 d) NIR emission can therefore only be attributed to an IR echo.\nThe H-K color temperature of the echo is about 1250 K. The best fitting model\nrequires the presence of about 1.6e-4 Msun of amorphous carbon dust at a\ndistance of 2.2e16 cm from the explosion. The CSM-powered luminosity is\npreceded by an intense burst of hard radiation generated by the breakout of the\nSN shock through the stellar surface. The peak burst luminosity seen by the CSM\ndust is significantly reduced by Thomson scattering in the CSM, but still has\nthe potential of evaporating the dust needed to produce the echo.

In this paper, an intelligent\ntire system is presented to develop a novel slip ratio estimation model using\nmachine learning algorithms. The accelerations, generated by a triaxial\naccelerometer installed onto the inner liner of the tire, are varied when the\ntire rotates to update the contact patch. Meanwhile, the slip ratio reference\nvalue can be measured by the MTS Flat-Trac tire test platform. Then, by\nanalyzing the variation between the accelerations and slip ratio, highly useful\nfeatures are discovered, which are especially promising for assessing vertical\nacceleration. For these features, machine learning (ML) algorithms are trained\nto build the slip ratio estimation model, in which the ML algorithms include\nartificial neural networks (ANNs), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), random\nforests (RFs), and support vector machines (SVMs).

What aspects of a\nvisual task does attention help to deal with? We aim to answer this with a\ncomputational experiment based on a general framework called task-oriented\nablation design. First we define a broad range of visual tasks and identify six\nfactors that underlie task variability.

These smart health monitoring systems could be\nrealized in a smart home context to render long-term care to the elderly\npopulation. In this paper, we present the design of a wearable health\nmonitoring system suitable for older adults in a smart home context. The\nproposed system offers solutions to monitor the stress, blood pressure, and\nlocation of an individual within a smart home environment. The stress detection\nmodel proposed in this work uses Electrodermal Activity (EDA),\nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG), and Skin Temperature (ST) sensors embedded in a smart\nwristband for detecting physiological stress. The stress detection model is\ntrained and tested using stress labels obtained from salivary cortisol which is\na clinically established biomarker for physiological stress. A voice-based\nprototype is also implemented and the feasibility of the proposed system for\nintegration in a smart home environment is analyzed by simulating a data\nacquisition and streaming scenario. We have also proposed a blood pressure\nestimation model using PPG signal and advanced regression techniques for\nintegration with the stress detection model in the wearable health monitoring\nsystem. Finally, the design of a voice-assisted indoor location system is\nproposed for integration with the proposed system within a smart home\nenvironment. The proposed wearable health monitoring system is an important\ndirection to realize a smart home environment with extensive diagnostic\ncapabilities so that such a system could be useful for rendering long-term and\npersonalized care to the aging population in the comfort of their home.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 03:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}
