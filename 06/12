Classical\nmodels make the stringent assumption that the sender knows the receiver's\nutility. This can be relaxed by considering an online learning framework in\nwhich the sender repeatedly faces a receiver of an unknown, adversarially\nselected type. We study, for the first time, an online Bayesian persuasion\nsetting with multiple receivers. We focus on the case with no externalities and\nbinary actions, as customary in offline models. Our goal is to design no-regret\nalgorithms for the sender with polynomial per-iteration running time. First, we\nprove a negative result: for any $0 < \\alpha \\leq 1$, there is no\npolynomial-time no-$\\alpha$-regret algorithm when the sender's utility function\nis supermodular or anonymous. Then, we focus on the case of submodular sender's\nutility functions and we show that, in this case, it is possible to design a\npolynomial-time no-$(1 - \\frac{1}{e})$-regret algorithm. To do so, we introduce\na general online gradient descent scheme to handle online learning problems\nwith a finite number of possible loss functions. This requires the existence of\nan approximate projection oracle. We show that, in our setting, there exists\none such projection oracle which can be implemented in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 16:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

We account for magnetic field amplification produced\nby either cosmic-ray induced instabilities or by magneto-hydrodynamics\ninstabilities my means of a parametric description.

We discuss observational and\ntheoretical evidences supporting such a behaviour.

We aim to\nanswer the following questions for size distributions of stellar flares: (i)\nWhat are the values and uncertainties of power law slopes? (ii) Do power law\nslopes vary with time ? (iii) Do power law slopes depend on the stellar\nspectral type? (iv) Are they compatible with solar flares? (v) Are they\nconsistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) models? We find that the\nobserved size distributions of stellar flare fluences (or energies) exhibit\npower law slopes of $\\alpha_E=2.09\\pm0.24$ for optical data sets observed with\nKepler. The observed power law slopes do not show much time variability and do\nnot depend on the stellar spectral type (M, K, G, F, A, Giants).

Furthermore, most of the\nstellar flares are temporally not resolved in low-cadence (30 min) Kepler data,\nwhich causes an additional bias.

For\nevery such algebra $B$, we construct a polygon $\\mathcal{S}$ with a\ncheckerboard pattern in its interior that gives rise to a category\n$\\text{Diag}(\\mathcal{S})$. The indecomposable objects of\n$\\text{Diag}(\\mathcal{S})$ are the 2-diagonals in $\\mathcal{S}$, and its\nmorphisms are given by certain pivoting moves between the 2-diagonals. We\nconjecture that the category $\\text{Diag}(\\mathcal{S})$ is equivalent to the\nstable syzygy category over the algebra $B$, such that the rotation of the\npolygon corresponds to the shift functor on the syzygies. In particular, the\nnumber of indecomposable syzygies is finite and the projective resolutions are\nperiodic. We prove the conjecture in the special case where every chordless\ncycle in the quiver is of length three.\n  As a consequence, we obtain an explicit description of the projective\nresolutions. Moreover, we show that the syzygy category is equivalent to the\n2-cluster category of type $\\mathbb{A}$, and we introduce a new derived\ninvariant for the algebra $B$ that can be read off easily from the quiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 16:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

For example, the estimated likelihood of rain on a specific\nday changes by the hour as new information becomes available. Given a\ncollection of such probability paths, we introduce a Bayesian framework --\nwhich we call the Gaussian latent information martingale, or GLIM -- for\nmodeling the structure of dynamic predictions over time. Suppose, for example,\nthat the likelihood of rain in a week is 50 %, and consider two hypothetical\nscenarios. In the first, one expects the forecast to be equally likely to\nbecome either 25 % or 75 % tomorrow; in the second, one expects the forecast to\nstay constant for the next several days. A time-sensitive decision-maker might\nselect a course of action immediately in the latter scenario, but may postpone\ntheir decision in the former, knowing that new information is imminent. We\nmodel these trajectories by assuming predictions update according to a latent\nprocess of information flow, which is inferred from historical data. In\ncontrast to general methods for time series analysis, this approach preserves\nimportant properties of probability paths such as the martingale structure and\nappropriate amount of volatility and better quantifies future uncertainties\naround probability paths. We show that GLIM outperforms three popular baseline\nmethods, producing better estimated posterior probability path distributions\nmeasured by three different metrics.

While we agree that the\nchance of an individual GW event being lensed at $\\mu>2$ is smaller than\n$10^{-3}$, the number of observed events depends on the product of this small\nprobability times the rate of mergers at high redshift. Observational\nconstraints from the stochastic GW background indicate that the rate of\nconventional mass BBH mergers (8 < M (M$_{\\odot}$) < 15) in the redshift range\n1<z< 2 could be as high as O($10^7$) events per year, more than sufficient to\ncompensate for the intrinsically low probability of lensing. To reach the LVC\ntrigger threshold these events require high magnification, but would still\nproduce up to 10 to 30 LVC observable events per year. Thus, all the LVC\nobserved ordinary stellar mass BBH mergers from this epoch must be strongly\nlensed. By adopting low-rates at high redshift, LVC assumes that lensed events\ncan not be taking place, thus incorrectly assigning them a closer distance and\nhigher masses by a factor of a few (typically 2 to 5). The LVC adopted priors\non time delay are in tension with the distribution of observed time delays in\nlensed quasars. Pairs of events like GW190421-GW190910 and GW190424-GW190910,\nwhich are directly assigned a probability of zero by LVC, should be instead\nconsidered as prime candidates to be strongly lensed GW pairs, since their\nseparation in time is consistent with observations of time delays in lensed\nquasars. Correcting for the LVC wrong Bayesian priors, maximum merger rate of\nconventional mass BBH in 1<z<2, and gravitational lensing time-delay model,\nreverses the LVC conclusions and supports the strong gravitational lensing\nhypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 09:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

However, reports on the ``anomalous'' softening with alloying\nadditions are not uncommon; for example, it is known that the heterogeneous\nnucleation of dislocations at the sites of solute atoms can lead to softening.\nIn this study, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we show anomalous\nsoftening in Cu-Al alloys deformed at 300 K; specifically, not only the yield\nstress but also the magnitude of stress drop at yield decrease with increasing\nAl content. We calculate the stress needed for the homogeneous nucleation of\npartial dislocation loops using a continuum model. One of the key inputs to the\ncontinuum model is the stacking fault energy (SFE). We carry out the\nthermodynamic integration to evaluate the free energies in crystals with and\nwithout the stacking faults and hence calculate the SFE as a function of Al\ncontent at 300 K. Using the SFE values thus obtained we show that softening is\na consequence of the reduction of SFE values with the addition of Al in a\nsystem where yielding is controlled by the nucleation of dislocation loops.\nSpecifically, the results of continuum model are in good agreement with MD\nsimulation results of pure copper. However, in the Cu-Al alloys, the drop in\nyield strength can only be explained using a combination of the continuum model\n(which assumes homogeneous nucleation), and the reduction in heterogeneous\nnucleation barrier (which is a function of the ratio of the unstable and stable\nstacking fault energies).

In lieu of the conventional approach of operating a tonne-scale\nreal-time detector to search for DM-induced nuclear recoils, paleo-detectors\ntake advantage of small samples of naturally occurring rocks on Earth that have\nbeen deep underground ($\\gtrsim 5$ km), accumulating nuclear damage tracks from\nrecoiling nuclei for $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Gyr.

In this\narticle, we use improved background modeling and a new spectral analysis\ntechnique to update the sensitivity forecast for paleo-detectors.

This work proposes a novel\nNAS method, called HR-NAS, which is able to find efficient and accurate\nnetworks for different tasks, by effectively encoding multiscale contextual\ninformation while maintaining high-resolution representations. In HR-NAS, we\nrenovate the NAS search space as well as its searching strategy. To better\nencode multiscale image contexts in the search space of HR-NAS, we first\ncarefully design a lightweight transformer, whose computational complexity can\nbe dynamically changed with respect to different objective functions and\ncomputation budgets. To maintain high-resolution representations of the learned\nnetworks, HR-NAS adopts a multi-branch architecture that provides convolutional\nencoding of multiple feature resolutions, inspired by HRNet. Last, we proposed\nan efficient fine-grained search strategy to train HR-NAS, which effectively\nexplores the search space, and finds optimal architectures given various tasks\nand computation resources. HR-NAS is capable of achieving state-of-the-art\ntrade-offs between performance and FLOPs for three dense prediction tasks and\nan image classification task, given only small computational budgets.

To\ntackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast development of DNN\naccelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable jointly\nsearching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently\nlocalizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each\ntarget dataset and acceleration specification.

Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies validate that both Auto-NBA generated networks and accelerators\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art designs (including\nco-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN\naccelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator\nefficiency.

Research on present-day devices has focused almost\nexclusively on stabilisation of rotating modes, as it has been considered\nimperative to avoid locked modes. However, in larger devices, stabilisation\nduring the rotating phase is made difficult by fast locking at small island\nwidths, and large broadening of the stabilising wave-driven current profile. In\ncontrast, the smaller island width at locking not only mitigates the\ndeleterious consequences of locked modes, but also permits their efficient\nstabilisation.

We look at strategies to\nmaximize the expected number of detections per year (DPY) of search. Assuming\nthat ET civilizations will be associated with star systems, we want to maximize\nthe number of stars that may be observed at one time. Assuming a representative\nstar density, this requires maximizing the search volume in a cone defined by\nthe detection range and field of view (FOV). The parameter trades are modified\nfrom the case where one simply maximizes signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, a\njoint optimization between FOV and sensitivity is needed. Some implications: 1)\nInstead of focusing on the terrestrial microwave window of 1-10 GHz,\nfrequencies below 1 GHz may be optimal for detection rate due to the larger\nfield of view; 2) Arrays of smaller dishes should be favored compared to a\nsingle dish of equivalent area; 3) Aperture arrays are desirable due to their\nlarge potential FOV. Many radio telescopes under development will provide both\nhigh sensitivity and large FOV, and should offer much improved SETI detection\nrates.

In this work we provide novel and\nnuanced evidence relevant to existing explanations for the cold posterior\neffect, disentangling three hypotheses: 1. The dataset curation hypothesis of\nAitchison (2020): we show empirically that the CPE does not arise in a real\ncurated data set but can be produced in a controlled experiment with varying\ncuration strength. 2. The data augmentation hypothesis of Izmailov et al.\n(2021) and Fortuin et al. (2021): we show empirically that data augmentation is\nsufficient but not necessary for the CPE to be present. 3.

Our results demonstrate how the CPE can arise in isolation from\nsynthetic curation, data augmentation, and bad priors.

The benefit of a speed increase is generally assessed\nas the value of the saved travel time. However, this approach conflicts with\nthe observation that time spent on travelling is rather constant and might not\nbe affected by speed changes. The paper aims to define the benefits of a speed\nincrease and addresses two research questions. First, how will a speed increase\nin person transport work out, which factors are affected? Second, is the value\nof time a good proxy for the value of speed? Based on studies on time spending\nand research on the association between speed and land use, we argue that human\nwealth could be the main affected factor by speed changes, rather than time or\naccess. Then the value of time is not a good proxy for the value of speed: the\nbenefits of a wealth increase are negatively correlated with prosperity\nfollowing the law of diminishing marginal utility, while the calculated\nbenefits of saved travel time prove to be positively correlated. The inadequacy\nof the value of time is explained by some shortcomings with respect to the\nwillingness to pay that is generally used for assessing the value of time:\npeople do not predict correctly the personal benefits that will be gained from\na decision, and they neglect the social impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 20:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

A value of 364.73(19)~keV was obtained from a\nmeasurement of the cyclotron frequency ratio of the decay parent $^{159}$Dy and\nthe decay daughter $^{159}$Tb ions using the novel phase-imaging ion-cyclotron\nresonance technique. The $Q$ values for allowed Gamow-Teller transition to\n$5/2^-$ and the third-forbidden unique transition to $11/2^+$ state with\nexcitation energies of 363.5449(14)~keV and 362.050(40)~keV in $^{159}$Tb were\ndetermined to be 1.18(19) keV and 2.68(19) keV, respectively. The\nhigh-precision $Q$ value of transition $3/2^-\\to 5/2^-$ from this work,\nrevealing itself as the lowest electron-capture $Q$ value, is utilized to\nunambiguously characterise all the possible lines that are present in its\nelectron capture spectrum. { We performed atomic many-body calculations for\nboth transitions to determine electron-capture probabilities from various\natomic orbitals, and found an order of magnitude enhancement in the event rates\nnear the end-point of energy spectrum in the transition to the $5/2^-$ nuclear\nexcited state, which can become very interesting once the experimental\nchallenges of identifying decays into excited states are overcome. The\ntransition to the $11/2^+$ state is strongly suppressed and found unsuitable\nfor measuring the neutrino mass.

On the other hand, asynchronous aggregation of client updates in FL\n(i.e., asynchronous FL) alleviates the scalability issue. However, aggregating\nindividual client updates is incompatible with Secure Aggregation, which could\nresult in an undesirable level of privacy for the system. To address these\nconcerns, we propose a novel buffered asynchronous aggregation method, FedBuff,\nthat is agnostic to the choice of optimizer, and combines the best properties\nof synchronous and asynchronous FL.

Despite the presence of a multitude of metrics, a compelling\nstandardized 3D metric is yet missing, aggravating inter-study comparability\nbetween different studies. Hence, evaluating human performance in virtual\nenvironments is a long-standing research goal, and a performance metric that\ncombines two or more metrics under one formulation remains largely unexplored,\nparticularly in higher dimensions. The absence of such a metric is primarily\nattributed to the discrepancies between pointing and manipulation, the complex\nspatial variables in 3D, and the combination of translational and rotational\nmovements altogether. In this work, four experiments were designed and\nconducted with progressively higher spatial complexity to study and compare\nexisting metrics thoroughly. The research goal was to quantify the difficulty\nof these 3D tasks and model human performance sufficiently in full 3D\nperipersonal space. Consequently, a new model extension has been proposed and\nits applicability has been validated across all the experimental results,\nshowing improved modelling and representation of human performance in combined\nmovements of 3D object pointing and manipulation tasks than existing work.\nLastly, the implications on 3D interaction, teleoperation and object task\ndesign in virtual reality are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 01:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

As a result, it tends to\nproduce noisy estimates and be underpowered to detect significant activations,\nparticularly in individual subjects and small groups. A recent alternative, a\ncortical surface-based spatial Bayesian GLM, leverages spatial dependencies\namong neighboring cortical vertices to produce more accurate estimates and\nareas of functional activation. The spatial Bayesian GLM can be applied to\nindividual and group-level analysis. In this study, we assess the reliability\nand power of individual and group-average measures of task activation produced\nvia the surface-based spatial Bayesian GLM. We analyze motor task data from 45\nsubjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and HCP Retest datasets.

In this setting, the learner has access\nto a dataset $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n_1+n_2) \\times d}$ which is composed of $n_1$\nunlabelled examples that an algorithm can actively query, and $n_2$ examples\nlabelled a-priori.

This algebraic equation involves a graph-Laplacian\ntype matrix obtained via DM asymptotic expansion, which is a consistent\nestimator of second-order elliptic differential operators. The resulting\nnumerical method is to solve a highly non-convex empirical risk minimization\nproblem subjected to a solution from a hypothesis space of neural networks. In\na well-posed elliptic PDE setting, when the hypothesis space consists of neural\nnetworks with either infinite width or depth, we show that the global minimizer\nof the empirical loss function is a consistent solution in the limit of large\ntraining data.

We introduce a\nmodel that relates quark wave functions in a baryon and the occupation\nprobability of states for baryons and quarks in dense matter. In a dilute\nregime, the confined quarks contribute to the energy density through the masses\nof baryons, but do not directly contribute to the pressure; hence, the\nequations of state are very soft. This dilute regime continues until the low\nmomentum states for quarks get saturated; this may happen even before baryons\nfully overlap, possibly at density slightly above the nuclear saturation\ndensity. After the saturation the pressure grows rapidly while changes in\nenergy density are modest, producing a peak in the speed of sound. If we use\nbaryonic descriptions for quark distributions near the Fermi surface, we reach\na description similar to the quarkyonic matter model of McLerran and Reddy.\nWith a simple adjustment of quark interactions to get the nucleon mass, our\nmodel becomes consistent with the constraints from 1.4-solar mass neutron\nstars, but the high density part is too soft to account for two-solar mass\nneutron stars.

The early-time\nspectra of this SN are characterized by a blue continuum on which are\nsuperimposed narrow P~Cygni profile lines of He I, suggesting the presence of\nslowly moving (~1000 km/s), He-rich circumstellar material (CSM).

For example, cellular\nmembranes exhibit changes in lipid composition and order, which in turn\nmodulate their function in space and time. Simultaneous measurement of\nthickness and refractive index would be one way to observe these variations,\nyet doing it noninvasively remains an elusive goal. Here we present a\nmicroscopic-imaging technique to simultaneously measure the thickness and\nrefractive index of thin layers in a spatially resolved manner using\nreflectometry. The heterodyne-detected interference between a light field\nreflected by the sample and a reference field allows measurement of the\namplitude and phase of the reflected field and thus determination of the\ncomplex reflection coefficient. Comparing the results with the simulated\nreflection of a thin layer under coherent illumination of high numerical\naperture by the microscope objective, the refractive index and thickness of the\nlayer can be determined.

Some recent efforts rely on exhaustively or manually searched\nweights to fuse a group of candidate loss functions, which is exceptionally\ncostly in computation and time.

Such design improves the\nmodel's generalizability and transferability between deep recommender systems\nand datasets. We evaluate the proposed framework on two benchmark datasets.

However, most existing methods are based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), which fail to build long-range\ndependencies and global context connections due to the limitation of receptive\nfield in convolution operation. Inspired by the success of Transformer in\nmodeling the long-range contextual information, some researchers have expended\nconsiderable efforts in designing the robust variants of Transformer-based\nU-Net. Moreover, the patch division used in vision transformers usually ignores\nthe pixel-level intrinsic structural features inside each patch. To alleviate\nthese problems, we propose a novel deep medical image segmentation framework\ncalled Dual Swin Transformer U-Net (DS-TransUNet), which might be the first\nattempt to concurrently incorporate the advantages of hierarchical Swin\nTransformer into both encoder and decoder of the standard U-shaped architecture\nto enhance the semantic segmentation quality of varying medical images. Unlike\nmany prior Transformer-based solutions, the proposed DS-TransUNet first adopts\ndual-scale encoder subnetworks based on Swin Transformer to extract the coarse\nand fine-grained feature representations of different semantic scales. As the\ncore component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive\nFusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies\nbetween features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism.\nFurthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to\nfurther explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling\nprocess. Extensive experiments across four typical tasks for medical image\nsegmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TransUNet, and show that our\napproach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 08:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

Compared to the existing\nmethods, the proposed approach does not need to detect the interference and\nalso improves the estimation accuracy of the separated useful signals. Both\nnumerical simulations with point-like targets and experiment results with\ndistributed targets (i.e., raindrops) are presented to demonstrate and verify\nits performance. The results show that the proposed approach is generally\napplicable for interference mitigation in both stationary and moving target\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 11:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 09:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

This problem\nemerges in many networks of great importance for society such as transportation\nand critical infrastructure networks. We identify two significant shortcomings\nwith present methods. Firstly, they focus exclusively on network topology while\nignoring spatial information; however, in many real-world networks, nodes are\nembedded in space, which yields different global objectives and governs the\nrange and density of realizable connections. Secondly, existing RL methods\nscale poorly to large networks due to the high cost of training a model and the\nscaling factors of the action space and global objectives.\n  In this work, we formulate this problem as a deterministic MDP. We adopt the\nMonte Carlo Tree Search framework for planning in this domain, prioritizing the\noptimality of final solutions over the speed of policy evaluation.

A major research project has been to make\nthese historical documents accessible and understandable. An increasing amount\nof research has focused on the character recognition task and the location of\ncharacters on image, yet less research has focused on how to predict the\nsequential ordering of the characters. This is because sequence in classical\nJapanese is very different from modern Japanese. Ordering characters into a\nsequence is important for making the document text easily readable and\nsearchable. Additionally, it is a necessary step for any kind of natural\nlanguage processing on the data (e.g. machine translation, language modeling,\nand word embeddings). We explore a few approaches to the task of predicting the\nsequential ordering of the characters: one using simple hand-crafted rules,\nanother using hand-crafted rules with adaptive thresholds, and another using a\ndeep recurrent sequence model trained with teacher forcing. We provide a\nquantitative and qualitative comparison of these techniques as well as their\ndistinct trade-offs.

These devices benefit from the suppression of free charge\nrecombination with regard to the Langevin-limit of charge encounter in a\nhomogeneous medium. It has been recognized that the main cause of suppressed\nfree charge recombination is the reformation and resplitting of charge transfer\nstates at the interface between donor and acceptor domains. Here, we use\nkinetic Monte Carlo simulations to understand the interplay between free charge\nmotion and recombination in an energetically-disordered phase-separated\ndonor-acceptor blend. We identify conditions for encounter-dominated and\nresplitting-dominated recombination. In the former regime, recombination is\nproportional to mobility for all parameters tested and only slightly reduced\nwith respect to the Langevin limit. In contrast, mobility is not the decisive\nparameter determining the non-geminate recombination coefficient k_2in the\nlatter case where k_2 is a sole function of the morphology, CT and CS\nenergetics and CT states decay properties. Our simulations also show that free\ncharge encounter in the phase-separated disordered blend is determined by the\naverage mobility of all carriers, while CT reformation and resplitting involves\nmostly states near the transport energy. Therefore, charge encounter is more\naffected by increased disorder than the resplitting of the CT state. As a\nconsequence, for a given mobility, larger energetic disorder in combination\nwith a higher hopping rate is preferred. These findings have important\nimplications for the understanding of suppressed recombination in solar cells\nwith non-fullerene acceptors which are known to exhibit lower energetic\ndisorder than fullerenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 15:08:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 09:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Therefore the energy deposition\nalong the axis can be either subluminal or superluminal as required in various\napplications. This article first explores how the axiparabola design defines\nits properties in the geometric optics approximation. Then the obtained\ndescription is considered in numerical simulations for two cases of interest\nfor laser-plasma acceleration. We show that the axiparabola can be used either\nto generate a plasma waveguide to overcome diffraction or for driving a\ndephasingless wakefield accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 15:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 17:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception\nmethods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and\npictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.\nHowever, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its\ninfancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent\nyears. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception\nmechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this\nfact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and\ndepth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed\nnew network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only\nused a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and\na semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the\noutput of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison\nbetween the developed network and original network showed that our novel\nstructures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\\% of relative\nerror of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were\ncarried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to\nisolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and\nsemantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular\nsynthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an\nappropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these\ncases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against\ndomain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 10:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}
