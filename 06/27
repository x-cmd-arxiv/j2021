The flat subband bends downwards or upwards due\nto the effect of the line defect. The spin-orbit coupling induces quantum spin\nHall states. Especially, the energy band depends on the distance between the\nline defect and the edge of the nanoribbon. The effects of the on-site energies\non the band spectra of the two defect configurations are different.

As a step towards the more practical application\nscenarios, we introduce a novel task that aims to describe a video using the\nnatural language dialog between two agents as a supplementary information\nsource given incomplete visual data. Different from most existing\nvision-language tasks where AI systems have full access to images or video\nclips, which may reveal sensitive information such as recognizable human faces\nor voices, we intentionally limit the visual input for AI systems and seek a\nmore secure and transparent information medium, i.e., the natural language\ndialog, to supplement the missing visual information. Specifically, one of the\nintelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two semantic segmented frames from the\nbeginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities\nto ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video.\nA-BOT, the other agent who has access to the entire video, assists Q-BOT to\naccomplish the goal by answering the asked questions.

However, most existing algorithms for DCCO only work in\nnetworks that are deterministically connected during bounded communication\nrounds, and therefore cannot be extended to stochastic networks. In this paper,\nwe propose a new decentralized dual averaging (DDA) algorithm that can solve\nDCCO in stochastic networks. Under a rather mild condition on stochastic\nnetworks, we show that the proposed algorithm attains global linear convergence\nif each local objective function is strongly convex. Our algorithm\nsubstantially improves the existing DDA-type algorithms as the latter were only\nknown to converge sublinearly prior to our work.

First, we give a much simpler algorithm to\nconstruct piecewise-linear morphs between planar straight-line graphs.\nSpecifically, given isomorphic straight-line drawings $\\Gamma_0$ and $\\Gamma_1$\nof the same 3-connected planar graph $G$, with the same convex outer face, we\nconstruct a morph from $\\Gamma_0$ to $\\Gamma_1$ that consists of $O(n)$\nunidirectional morphing steps, in $O(n^{1+\\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm\nentirely avoids the classical edge-collapsing strategy dating back to Cairns;\ninstead, in each morphing step, we interpolate the pair of weights associated\nwith a single edge. Second, we describe a natural extension of barycentric\ninterpolation to geodesic graphs on the flat torus. Barycentric interpolation\ncannot be applied directly in this setting, because the linear systems defining\nintermediate vertex positions are not necessarily solvable. We describe a\nsimple scaling strategy that circumvents this issue. Computing the appropriate\nscaling requires $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time, after which we can can compute the\ndrawing at any point in the morph in $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm is\nconsiderably simpler than the recent algorithm of Chambers et al.\n(arXiv:2007.07927) and produces more natural morphs. Our techniques also yield\na simple proof of a conjecture of Connelly et al. for geodesic torus\ntriangulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 20:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 12:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 06:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In contrast\nto more constrained environments, such as automated underground trains,\nautomotive perception systems cannot be tailored to a narrow field of specific\ntasks but must handle an ever-changing environment with unforeseen events. As\ncurrently no single sensor is able to reliably perceive all relevant activity\nin the surroundings, sensor data fusion is applied to perceive as much\ninformation as possible. Data fusion of different sensors and sensor modalities\non a low abstraction level enables the compensation of sensor weaknesses and\nmisdetections among the sensors before the information-rich sensor data are\ncompressed and thereby information is lost after a sensor-individual object\ndetection. This paper develops a low-level sensor fusion network for 3D object\ndetection, which fuses lidar, camera, and radar data. The fusion network is\ntrained and evaluated on the nuScenes data set. On the test set, fusion of\nradar data increases the resulting AP (Average Precision) detection score by\nabout 5.1% in comparison to the baseline lidar network. The radar sensor fusion\nproves especially beneficial in inclement conditions such as rain and night\nscenes. Fusing additional camera data contributes positively only in\nconjunction with the radar fusion, which shows that interdependencies of the\nsensors are important for the detection result. Additionally, the paper\nproposes a novel loss to handle the discontinuity of a simple yaw\nrepresentation for object detection. Our updated loss increases the detection\nand orientation estimation performance for all sensor input configurations.

However, cross pose face\nrecognition remains a significant challenge. It is difficult for many deep\nlearning algorithms to narrow the performance gap caused by pose variations;\nthe main reasons for this relate to the intra-class discrepancy between face\nimages in different poses and the pose imbalances of training datasets.\nLearning pose-robust features by traversing to the feature space of frontal\nfaces provides an effective and cheap way to alleviate this problem. In this\npaper, we present a method for progressively transforming profile face\nrepresentations to the canonical pose with an attentive pair-wise loss.\nFirstly, to reduce the difficulty of directly transforming the profile face\nfeatures into a frontal pose, we propose to learn the feature residual between\nthe source pose and its nearby pose in a block-byblock fashion, and thus\ntraversing to the feature space of a smaller pose by adding the learned\nresidual. Secondly, we propose an attentive pair-wise loss to guide the feature\ntransformation progressing in the most effective direction. Finally, our\nproposed progressive module and attentive pair-wise loss are light-weight and\neasy to implement, adding only about 7:5% extra parameters.

We focus on the important\nproblem of improving the latency of image recognition. CNNs' large data at each\nlayer's input, filters, and output poses a memory bandwidth problem. While\nprevious work captures only some of the enormous data reuse, full reuse implies\nthat the initial input image and filters are read once from off chip and the\nfinal output is written once off chip without spilling the intermediate layers'\ndata to off-chip. We propose Occam to capture full reuse via four\ncontributions. (1) We identify the necessary condition for full reuse. (2) We\nidentify the dependence closure as the sufficient condition to capture full\nreuse using the least on-chip memory. (3) Because the dependence closure is\noften too large to fit in on-chip memory, we propose a dynamic programming\nalgorithm that optimally partitions a given CNN to guarantee the least off-chip\ntraffic at the partition boundaries for a given on-chip capacity. Occam's\npartitions reside on different chips forming a pipeline so that a partition's\nfilters and dependence closure remain on-chip as different images pass through\n(i.e., each partition incurs off-chip traffic only for its inputs and outputs).\n(4) because the optimal partitions may result in an unbalanced pipeline, we\npropose staggered asynchronous pipelines (STAP) which replicates the bottleneck\nstages to improve throughput by staggering the mini-batches across the\nreplicas.

Recently, some RDH-EI schemes with\nmultiple data hiders have been proposed using secret sharing technique.\nHowever, these schemes protect the contents of the original images with\nlightweight security level. In this paper, we propose a high-security RDH-EI\nscheme with multiple data hiders. First, we introduce a cipher-feedback secret\nsharing (CFSS) technique. It follows the cryptography standards by introducing\nthe cipher-feedback strategy of AES. Then, using the CFSS technique, we devise\na new (r,n)-threshold (r<=n) RDH-EI scheme with multiple data hiders called\nCFSS-RDHEI. It can encrypt an original image into n encrypted images with\nreduced size using an encryption key and sends each encrypted image to one data\nhider.

Low power\nfluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the\nfluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and\neffectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more\nprone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise\nmeasurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.\nMoreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower\nbut still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a\nshielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,\nit can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents\nalgorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.\nTo improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms\nthat employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired\nand well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support\nvector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network\narchitecture.

The accuracy of\nthe machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly\nemphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural\nnetwork can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding\nreceiver operating characteristic curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 05:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Although high accuracy has been achieved, a FAS system\nwill never be perfect due to the non-stationary applied environments and the\npotential emergence of new types of presentation attacks in real-world\napplications. In practice, given a handful of labeled samples from a new\ndeployment scenario (target domain) and abundant labeled face images in the\nexisting source domain, the FAS system is expected to perform well in the new\nscenario without sacrificing the performance on the original domain. To this\nend, we identify and address a more practical problem: Few-Shot Domain\nExpansion for Face Anti-Spoofing (FSDE-FAS). This problem is challenging since\nwith insufficient target domain training samples, the model may suffer from\nboth overfitting to the target domain and catastrophic forgetting of the source\ndomain. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Style transfer-based\nAugmentation for Semantic Alignment (SASA) framework.

With the assistant of the augmented data, we further propose a\ncarefully designed mechanism to align different domains from both\ninstance-level and distribution-level, and then stabilize the performance on\nthe source domain with a less-forgetting constraint.

These are accounted for through the use of an\nextended definition of the velocity operator and are determined by means of a\ndynamic Hellmann-Feynman theorem (DHFT) that we derive here for the first time.\nThe DHFT introduces generalized Berry curvatures and it is valid for\ncalculating observables nonperturbatively, hence with results valid to all\norders of the external fields.

The empirical results on real-world datasets determine\nthat our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.\nMoreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based\nalgorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the\nprediction outcomes.

However, most existing methods encode\nthe location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,\nwhich describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,\nfor the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the\nposition information (i.e. absolute location) of targets.

With this\nmotivation, this study presents a methodology to characterize the vortex\nstructures. Precisely, we use mapping and characterization of vortex\nstructures' changes to relate it with the hemodynamic indicators of disturbed\nshear. Topological features of vortex core lines (VCLs) are used to quantify\nthe changes in vortex structures. We use the Sujudi-Haimes algorithm to extract\nthe VCLs from the flow simulation results. The idea of relating vortex\nstructures with disturbed shear is demonstrated for cerebral arteries with\naneurysms virtually treated by inserting foam in the sac. To get\nphysiologically realistic flow fields, we simulate blood flow in two\npatient-specific geometries before and after foam insertion, with realistic\nvelocity waveform imposed at the inlet, using the Carreau-Yashuda model to\nmimic the shear-thinning behavior. With homogenous porous medium assumption,\nflow through the foam is modeled using the Forcheimmer-Brinkmann extended Darcy\nmodel. Results show that foam insertion increases the number of VCLs in the\nparent lumen. The average length of VCL increases by 168.9% and 55.6% in both\ngeometries. For both geometries under consideration, results demonstrate that\nthe region with increased disturbed shear lies in the same arterial segment\nexhibiting an increase in the number of oblique VCLs. Based on the findings, we\nconjecture that an increase in oblique VCLs is related to increased disturbed\nshear at the neighboring portion of the arterial wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 09:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

The average is with respect to the classical\nrandomness associated with the random time intervals between successive\ninteractions, which we consider to be independent and identically-distributed\nrandom variables. We provide two explicit applications of the formalism in the\ncontext of the so-called tight-binding model relevant in various contexts in\nsolid-state physics. In one dimension, the corresponding tight-binding chain\nmodels the motion of a charged particle between the sites of a lattice, wherein\nthe particle is for most times localized on the sites, but which owing to\nspontaneous quantum fluctuations tunnels between nearest-neighbour sites. We\nconsider two representative forms of interactions: stochastic reset of quantum\ndynamics, in which the density operator is at random times reset to its initial\nform, and projective measurements performed on the system at random times. In\nthe former case, we demonstrate with our exact results how the particle is\nlocalized on the sites at long times, leading to a time-independent\nmean-squared displacement of the particle about its initial location. In the\ncase of projective measurements at random times, we show that repeated\nprojection to the initial state of the particle results in an effective\nsuppression of the temporal decay in the probability of the particle to be\nfound on the initial state.

The EBCLE heuristic employs a\npriori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to\ndetermine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity\ntransformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for\nenhancing model performance.

Our framework deforms the point cloud of the\ncategory-level template shape to align the observed instance point cloud for\nimplicitly representing its 3D rotation.

The slow decay rates violate the\ninstantaneous reaction assumption of quasi-stationarity, introducing\nnon-Markovian contributions to the scattering process. Memory signatures in\nscattering from a rotating dipole are studied theoretically, showing symmetry\nbreaking of micro-Doppler combs.

However, the realization of drone-based\nnetworks raises several issues. One of the critical issues is drones are\nextremely power-hungry. To overcome this, we need to characterize a new type of\ndrones, so-called charging drones, which can deliver energy to MBS drones.\nMotivated by the fact that the charging drones also need to be charged, we\ndeploy ground-mounted charging towers for delivering energy to the charging\ndrones. We introduce a new energy-efficiency maximization problem, which is\npartitioned into two independently separable tasks. More specifically, as our\nfirst optimization task, two-stage charging matching is proposed due to the\ninherent nature of our network model, where the first matching aims to schedule\nbetween charging towers and charging drones while the second matching solves\nthe scheduling between charging drones and MBS drones. We analyze how to\nconvert the formulation containing non-convex terms to another one only with\nconvex terms.

First, user behaviors in their rich\nhistorical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they\ncannot sufficiently reflect users' actual preferences. In addition, users'\ndynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult\nto capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we\npropose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential\nRecommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues.\nSpecifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user\nbehaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences\ninto tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps\nexplicitly distinguish users' core interests, by forming dense clusters in the\ninterest graph.

However, overheads\nincurred by a heavy software-stack intervention seriously negate the benefits\nof such memories. First, to significantly reduce the software stack overheads,\nwe propose HAMS, a hardware automated Memory-over-Storage (MoS) solution.\nSpecifically, HAMS aggregates the capacity of NVDIMM and ultra-low latency\nflash archives (ULL-Flash) into a single large memory space, which can be used\nas a working or persistent memory expansion, in an OS-transparent manner. HAMS\nresides in the memory controller hub and manages its MoS address pool over\nconventional DDR and NVMe interfaces; it employs a simple hardware cache to\nserve all the memory requests from the host MMU after mapping the storage space\nof ULL-Flash to the memory space of NVDIMM. Second, to make HAMS more\nenergy-efficient and reliable, we propose an \"advanced HAMS\" which removes\nunnecessary data transfers between NVDIMM and ULL-Flash after optimizing the\ndatapath and hardware modules of HAMS. This approach unleashes the ULL-Flash\nand its NVMe controller from the storage box and directly connects the HAMS\ndatapath to NVDIMM over the conventional DDR4 interface.

Further, they usually\nrely on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is limited by the\nintrinsic locality in capturing the long-distance dependency. To this end, we\npropose a multi-modal transformer (MTrans), which is capable of transferring\nmulti-scale features from the target modality to the auxiliary modality, for\naccelerated MR imaging. To capture deep multi-modal information, our MTrans\nutilizes an improved multi-head attention mechanism, named cross attention\nmodule, which absorbs features from the auxiliary modality that contribute to\nthe target modality. Our framework provides three appealing benefits: (i) Our\nMTrans use an improved transformers for multi-modal MR imaging, affording more\nglobal information compared with existing CNN-based methods. (ii) A new cross\nattention module is proposed to exploit the useful information in each modality\nat different scales. The small patch in the target modality aims to keep more\nfine details, the large patch in the auxiliary modality aims to obtain\nhigh-level context features from the larger region and supplement the target\nmodality effectively.

In this paper we derive a Fokker-Planck model\nfor the evolution of the planar grain boundary network. The proposed model\nconsiders anisotropic grain boundary energy which depends on lattice\nmisorientation and takes into account mobility of the triple junctions, as well\nas independent dynamics of the misorientations. We establish long time\nasymptotics of the Fokker-Planck solution, namely the joint probability density\nfunction of misorientations and triple junctions, and closely related the\nmarginal probability density of misorientations. Moreover, for an equilibrium\nconfiguration of a boundary network, we derive explicit local algebraic\nrelations, a generalized Herring Condition formula, as well as formula that\nconnects grain boundary energy density with the geometry of the grain\nboundaries that share a triple junction. Although the stochastic model neglects\nthe explicit interactions and correlations among triple junctions, the\nconsidered specific form of the noise, under the fluctuation-dissipation\nassumption, provides partial information about evolution of a grain boundary\nnetwork, and is consistent with presented results of extensive grain growth\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 15:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Due to their fascinating and\nintriguing novel properties, the theory of optical vector solitons has been\ndeveloped considerably both from theoretical and experimental points of view\nleading to soliton based promising potential applications. In the recent past,\nmany types of vector solitons have been identified both in the integrable and\nnon-integrable coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (CNLS) equations framework. In\nthis article, we review some of the recent progress in understanding the\ndynamics of the so called nondegenerate vector bright solitons in nonlinear\noptics, where the fundamental soliton can have more than one propagation\nconstant. We address this theme by considering the integrable two CNLS family\nof equations, namely Manakov system, mixed 2-CNLS system, coherently CNLS\nsystem, generalized CNLS system and two-component long-wave short-wave\nresonance interaction (LSRI) system. In these models, we discuss the existence\nof nondegenerate vector solitons and their associated novel multi-hump\ngeometrical profile nature by deriving their analytical forms through the\nHirota bilinear method.

This work aims to mitigate the\naforementioned issues by introducing a novel decentralized federated learning\nframework where heavily compressed 1-bit soft-labels, resembling 1-hot label\npredictions, are aggregated on a smart contract. In a context where workers'\ncontributions are now easily comparable, we modify the Peer Truth Serum for\nCrowdsourcing mechanism (PTSC) for FD to reward honest participation based on\npeer consistency in an incentive compatible fashion.

Such a State of the Art is\nmethodologically problematic, since information regarding a key feature such as\npower is either missing or limited. Results: By concentrating on a\nrepresentative set of word-frequency based AF functions, we perform the first\ncoherent and uniform evaluation of the power, involving also Type I error for\ncompleteness. Two Alternative models of important genomic features (CIS\nRegulatory Modules and Horizontal Gene Transfer), a wide range of sequence\nlengths from a few thousand to millions, and different values of k have been\nused.

In the latter part of the 20th\ncentury, in the aftermath of two World Wars and the shadow of nuclear,\nbiological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on the subject than ever\nbefore. Wars have a negative impact on a country's economy, social order,\ninfrastructure, and public health. In this paper, we study the wars fought in\nhistory and draw conclusions from that. We explore the participation of\ncountries in wars and the nature of relationships between various countries\nduring different timelines. A big part of today's wars is fought against\nterrorism. Therefore, this study also attempts to shed light on different\ncountries' exposure to terrorist encounters and analyses the impact of wars on\na country's economy in terms of change in GDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 10:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

While this method involves additional effort by requiring multiple\nscans, it also provides flexibility for the incident field to be generated,\nsimply by changing the objective of a numerical optimization which is used to\nfind the required horn configurations for the different experiments.

The inductive task outputs the prediction probabilities using the\ndeductive task output, similar to a transductive model. We trained our model\nwith Turkish-English and Portuguese-English datasets from TED talk transcripts\nfor machine translation and compared the model performance and characteristics\nto a transformer model with scaled dot product attention trained on the same\nexperimental setup. We report BLEU scores of $17.79$ and $28.33$ on the\nTurkish-English and Portuguese-English translation tasks with our model,\nrespectively.

Understanding the fragility of individual towers is helpful in\nimproving the resilience of such systems. Fragility curves have been developed\nin the past for some regions, but without considering relevant epistemic\nuncertainties. Further, risk and resilience studies are best performed using\nthe fragility curves specific to a region. Such studies become particularly\nimportant if the region is exposed to cyclones rather frequently. This paper\npresents the development of fragility curves for high-voltage power\ntransmission towers in the state of Odisha, India, based on macro-level damage\ndata from 2019 cyclone Fani, which was obtained through concerned government\noffices. Two types of damages were identified, namely, collapse and partial\ndamage. Accordingly, fragility curves for collapse and functionality disruption\ndamage states were developed considering relevant aleatory and epistemic\nuncertainties. The latter class of uncertainties included that associated with\nwind speed estimation at a location and the finite sample uncertainty. The most\nsignificant contribution in the epistemic uncertainty was due to the wind speed\nestimation at a location. The median and logarithmic standard deviation for the\n50th percentile fragility curve associated with collapse was close to that for\nthe functionality disruption damage state. These curves also compared\nreasonably well with those reported for similar structures in other parts of\nthe world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 18:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}
