Those representations are considered useful in\ndownstream tasks such as link prediction and clustering. However, the number of\ngraph embedding methods available on the market is large, and practitioners\nface the non-trivial choice of selecting the proper approach for a given\napplication. The present work attempts to close this gap of knowledge through a\nsystematic comparison of eleven different methods for graph embedding. We\nconsider methods for embedding networks in the hyperbolic and Euclidean metric\nspaces, as well as non-metric community-based embedding methods. We apply these\nmethods to embed more than one hundred real-world and synthetic networks. Three\ncommon downstream tasks -- mapping accuracy, greedy routing, and link\nprediction -- are considered to evaluate the quality of the various embedding\nmethods. Our results show that some Euclidean embedding methods excel in greedy\nrouting. As for link prediction, community-based and hyperbolic embedding\nmethods yield overall performance superior than that of Euclidean-space-based\napproaches. We compare the running time for different methods and further\nanalyze the impact of different network characteristics such as degree\ndistribution, modularity, and clustering coefficients on the quality of the\ndifferent embedding methods. We release our evaluation framework to provide a\nstandardized benchmark for arbitrary embedding methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In the meanwhile, the uncondensed\nloop-like excitations serves as a natural candidate of dark matter and a\ngeneralized Einstein equation can be derived in the presence of\nloop-source(dark matter) background. Surprisingly, we find that such kind of\ndark matter will not contribute to scalar curvature, however, it will become a\nsource of torsion. Finally, we derive the generalized Einstein equation in the\npresence of Dirac field. Very different from the usual Einstein-Carton theory,\nour theory further predicts that any type of normal matter, including Dirac\nfield will not produce torsion.

Here, we carried out systematic\nstudies on the electronic structure of KMgBi single crystal by combining\nangle-resolve photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). The flat band was clearly observed near the\nFermi level. We also revealed a small bandgap of ~ 20 meV between the flat band\nand the conduction band.

However, there is still a big gap\nbetween the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation. Yet, large\namounts of online interactions are often not possible in practice. To overcome\nthis problem, we introduce active offline policy selection - a novel sequential\ndecision approach that combines logged data with online interaction to identify\nthe best policy. We use OPE estimates to warm start the online evaluation.\nThen, in order to utilize the limited environment interactions wisely we decide\nwhich policy to evaluate next based on a Bayesian optimization method with a\nkernel that represents policy similarity.

Moreover, if energy injection is inhomogeneous, it may induce a\nspatially-varying ionization fraction, and non-Gaussianity in the CMB. The\nobservability of these signals, however, is contingent upon how far the\ninjected particles propagate and deposit their energy into the primordial\nplasma, relative to the characteristic scale of energy injection fluctuations.\nIn this study we inspect the spatial properties of energy deposition and\nperturbed recombination resulting from an inhomogeneous energy injection of\nsub-10 MeV photons, relevant to accreting primordial black holes (PBHs). We\ndevelop a novel Monte-Carlo radiation transport code accounting for all\nrelevant photon interactions in this energy range, and including secondary\nelectron energy deposition efficiency through a new analytic approximation. For\na specified injected photon spectrum, the code outputs an\ninjection-to-deposition Green's function depending on time and distance from\nthe injection point. Combining this output with a linearized solution of the\nperturbed recombination problem, we derive time- and scale-dependent\ndeposition-to-ionization Green's functions. We apply this general framework to\naccreting PBHs, whose luminosity is strongly spatially modulated by supersonic\nrelative velocities between cold dark matter and baryons. We find that the\nresulting spatial fluctuations of the free-electron fraction are of the same\nmagnitude as its mean deviation from standard recombination, from which current\nCMB power spectra constraints are derived.

It is a\nfundamental and challenging task in video understanding. Previous methods\ntackle this task with complicated pipelines. They often need to train multiple\nnetworks and involve hand-designed operations, such as non-maximal suppression\nand anchor generation, which limit the flexibility and prevent end-to-end\nlearning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Transformer-based method for\nTAD, termed TadTR. Given a small set of learnable embeddings called action\nqueries, TadTR adaptively extracts temporal context information from the video\nfor each query and directly predicts action instances with the context. To\nadapt Transformer to TAD, we propose three improvements to enhance its locality\nawareness. The core is a temporal deformable attention module that selectively\nattends to a sparse set of key snippets in a video. A segment refinement\nmechanism and an actionness regression head are designed to refine the\nboundaries and confidence of the predicted instances, respectively. With such a\nsimple pipeline, TadTR requires lower computation cost than previous detectors,\nwhile preserving remarkable performance. As a self-contained detector, it\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 (56.7% mAP) and HACS Segments\n(32.09% mAP).

Spectroscopic data are also used to\nmeasure the inner velocity dispersions of 15 cluster galaxies and calibrate the\nscaling relations to model the subhalo cluster component. The model is based on\n62 multiple images grouped in 17 families belonging to 4 different sources. The\nmajority of them are multiple images of compact stellar knots belonging to a\nsingle star-forming galaxy at z=2.3702. This source is strongly lensed by the\ncluster to form the Sunburst Arc system. To accurately reproduce all the\nmultiple images, we build a parametric mass model, which includes both\ncluster-scale and galaxy-scale components. The resulting model has a r.m.s.\nseparation between the model-predicted and the observed positions of the\nmultiple images of only 0.14''. We conclude that PSZ1 G311.65-18.48 has a\nrelatively round projected shape and a large Einstein radius (29'' for z_s =\n2.3702), which could indicate that the cluster is elongated along the line of\nsight. The Sunburst Arc source is located at the intersection of a complex\nnetwork of caustics, which explains why parts of the arc are imaged with\nunprecedented multiplicity (up to 12 times).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The\nvalue-equivalence (VE) principle proposes a simple answer to this question: a\nmodel should capture the aspects of the environment that are relevant for\nvalue-based planning. Technically, VE distinguishes models based on a set of\npolicies and a set of functions: a model is said to be VE to the environment if\nthe Bellman operators it induces for the policies yield the correct result when\napplied to the functions. As the number of policies and functions increase, the\nset of VE models shrinks, eventually collapsing to a single point corresponding\nto a perfect model. A fundamental question underlying the VE principle is thus\nhow to select the smallest sets of policies and functions that are sufficient\nfor planning. In this paper we take an important step towards answering this\nquestion. We start by generalizing the concept of VE to order-$k$ counterparts\ndefined with respect to $k$ applications of the Bellman operator. This leads to\na family of VE classes that increase in size as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. In the\nlimit, all functions become value functions, and we have a special\ninstantiation of VE which we call proper VE or simply PVE. Unlike VE, the PVE\nclass may contain multiple models even in the limit when all value functions\nare used. Crucially, all these models are sufficient for planning, meaning that\nthey will yield an optimal policy despite the fact that they may ignore many\naspects of the environment. We construct a loss function for learning PVE\nmodels and argue that popular algorithms such as MuZero can be understood as\nminimizing an upper bound for this loss. We leverage this connection to propose\na modification to MuZero and show that it can lead to improved performance in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 19:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 03:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

We show that, when\nconsidering the predictive relationship between various identities categories\nsuch as race, sex, and income (as a proxy for class) on outcomes such as health\nand wellness, robust statistical synergies appear. These synergies show that\nthere are joint-effects of identities on outcomes that are irreducible to any\nidentity considered individually and only appear when specific categories are\nconsidered together (for example, there is a large, synergistic effect of race\nand sex considered jointly on income irreducible to either race or sex). We\nthen show using synthetic data that the current gold-standard method of\nassessing intersectionalities in data (linear regression with multiplicative\ninteraction coefficients) fails to disambiguate between truly synergistic,\ngreater-than-the-sum-of-their-parts interactions, and redundant interactions.\nWe explore the significance of these two distinct types of interactions in the\ncontext of making inferences about intersectional relationships in data and the\nimportance of being able to reliably differentiate the two.

This introduces a hysteresis effect so\nthat it is easier to enter the congested state than to leave it. However, many\nexisting first-order models of traffic flow, particularly those used for\ncontrol design, ignore capacity drop, leading to suboptimal controllers. In\nthis paper, we consider a cell transmission model of traffic flow that\nincorporates capacity drop to study the problem of optimal freeway ramp\nmetering. We show that, if capacity drop is ignored in the control design, then\nthe resulting controller, obtained via a convex program, may be significantly\nsuboptimal. We then propose an alternative model predictive controller that\naccounts for capacity drop via a mixed integer linear program and show that,\nfor sufficiently large rollout horizon, this controller is optimal. We also\ncompare these approaches to a heuristic hand-crafted controller that is viewed\nas a modification of an integral feedback controller to account for capacity\ndrop. This heuristic controller outperforms the controller that ignores\ncapacity drop but underperforms compared to the proposed alternative model\npredictive controller. These results suggest that it is generally important to\ninclude capacity drop in the controller design process, and we demonstrate this\ninsight on several case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 20:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

For the purpose we extend our previous work [1]\nto introduce a light new physics vector mediator besides a scalar one in order\nto ensure feeble interaction between fermionic DM and $\\beta$ stable hadronic\nmatter in NSs. The masses of DM fermion, the mediators and the couplings are\nchosen consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster and\nfrom present day relic abundance. Assuming that both the scalar and vector\nmediators contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of\nstate (EoS) of the DM admixed NSs to find that the present consideration of the\nvector new physics mediator do not bring any significant change to the EoS and\nstatic NS properties of DM admixed NSs compared to the case where only the\nscalar mediator was considered [1]. However, the obtained structural properties\nin static conditions are in good agreement with the various constraints on them\nfrom massive pulsars like PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational\nwave (GW170817) data and the recently obtained results of NICER experiments for\nPSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620.

In the last\ndecade, deep networks are proven to be effective due to their ability to form\nincreasingly complex abstractions. However, these abstractions are distributed\nover many neurons, making the re-use of a learned skill costly. Previous work\neither enforced formation of abstractions creating a designer bias, or used a\nlarge number of neural units without investigating how to obtain high-level\nfeatures that may more effectively capture the source task. For avoiding\ndesigner bias and unsparing resource use, we propose to exploit neural response\ndynamics to form compact representations to use in skill transfer. For this, we\nconsider two competing methods based on (1) maximum information compression\nprinciple and (2) the notion that abstract events tend to generate slowly\nchanging signals, and apply them to the neural signals generated during task\nexecution. To be concrete, in our simulation experiments, we either apply\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) or slow feature analysis (SFA) on the\nsignals collected from the last hidden layer of a deep network while it\nperforms a source task, and use these features for skill transfer in a new\ntarget task. We compare the generalization performance of these alternatives\nwith the baselines of skill transfer with full layer output and no-transfer\nsettings. Our results show that SFA units are the most successful for skill\ntransfer. SFA as well as PCA, incur less resources compared to usual skill\ntransfer, whereby many units formed show a localized response reflecting\nend-effector-obstacle-goal relations. Finally, SFA units with lowest\neigenvalues resembles symbolic representations that highly correlate with\nhigh-level features such as joint angles which might be thought of precursors\nfor fully symbolic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Among those services, sensing the liquid level in a container is\ncritical to building many smart home and mobile healthcare applications that\nimprove the quality of life. This paper presents LiquidSense, a liquid-level\nsensing system that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different\ndaily liquids and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing smart\nhome networks. LiquidSense uses an existing home WiFi network and a low-cost\ntransducer that attached to the container to sense the resonance of the\ncontainer for liquid level detection. In particular, our system mounts a\nlow-cost transducer on the surface of the container and emits a well-designed\nchirp signal to make the container resonant, which introduces subtle changes to\nthe home WiFi signals. By analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi\nsignals, LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for liquid\nlevel detection. Our system constructs prediction models for both continuous\nand discrete predictions using curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate\nLiquidSense in home environments with containers of three different materials\nand six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense achieves an overall\naccuracy of 97% for continuous prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for\ndiscrete prediction. Results also show that our system has a large coverage in\na home environment and works well under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Recently\nsupervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical\nimaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training\nlabels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can\nbe acquired by extending the scanning time.

We design Ditto, a Byzantine SMR protocol\nthat enjoys the best of both worlds: optimal communication on and off the happy\npath (linear and quadratic, respectively) and progress guarantee under\nasynchrony and DDoS attacks. We achieve this by replacing the\nview-synchronization of partially synchronous protocols with an asynchronous\nfallback mechanism at no extra asymptotic cost.

As a\nseparate contribution and an intermediate step, we design a 2-chain version of\nHotStuff, Jolteon, which leverages a quadratic view-change mechanism to reduce\nthe latency of the standard 3-chain HotStuff. We implement and experimentally\nevaluate all our systems. Notably, Jolteon's commit latency outperforms\nHotStuff by 200-300ms with varying system size.

In this work, Eulerian--Lagrangian\nsimulations are utilized to probe the effect of solids heterogeneity (e.g.,\nclustering) on the thermal entrance length. For the moderately dense systems\nconsidered here, clustering leads to a factor of 2--3 increase in the thermal\nentrance length, as compared to an uncorrelated (perfectly mixed) distribution\nof particles.

However, available one-shot voice conversion approaches are not\nstable for unseen speakers as the speaker embedding extracted from one\nutterance of an unseen speaker is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a\ndeep discriminative speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding from one\nutterance more effectively. Specifically, the speaker encoder first integrates\nresidual network and squeeze-and-excitation network to extract discriminative\nspeaker information in frame level by modeling frame-wise and channel-wise\ninterdependence in features. Then attention mechanism is introduced to further\nemphasize speaker related information via assigning different weights to frame\nlevel speaker information. Finally a statistic pooling layer is used to\naggregate weighted frame level speaker information to form utterance level\nspeaker embedding. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\nspeaker encoder can improve the robustness of one-shot voice conversion for\nunseen speakers and outperforms baseline systems in terms of speech quality and\nspeaker similarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 03:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

We first develop CPRR schemes, which in comparison to the\nuntolled case, simultaneously increase system efficiency without worsening\nwealth inequality, while being \\emph{user-favorable}: irrespective of their\ninitial wealth or values-of-time (which may differ across users), users would\nexperience a lower travel cost after the implementation of the proposed scheme.\nWe then characterize the set of optimal user-favorable CPRR schemes that\nsimultaneously maximize system efficiency and minimize wealth inequality.\nFinally, we provide a concrete methodology for computing optimal CPRR schemes\nand also highlight additional equilibrium properties of these schemes under\ndifferent models of user behavior. Overall, our work demonstrates that through\nappropriate refunding policies we can design user-favorable CPRR schemes that\nmaximize system efficiency while reducing wealth inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 03:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 00:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

However, the consideration\nof only two types of constraints, i.e., budgets of individual buyers and\ncapacities of goods, makes Fisher markets less amenable for resource allocation\nsettings when agents have additional linear constraints, e.g., knapsack and\nproportionality constraints. In this work, we introduce a modified Fisher\nmarket, where each agent may have additional linear constraints and show that\nthis modification to classical Fisher markets fundamentally alters the\nproperties of the market equilibrium as well as the optimal allocations. These\nproperties of the modified Fisher market prompt us to introduce a budget\nperturbed social optimization problem (BP-SOP) and set prices based on the dual\nvariables of BP-SOP's capacity constraints. To compute the budget\nperturbations, we develop a fixed point iterative scheme and validate its\nconvergence through numerical experiments.\n  Since this fixed point iterative scheme involves solving a centralized\nproblem at each step, we propose a new class of distributed algorithms to\ncompute equilibrium prices. In particular, we develop an Alternating Direction\nMethod of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with strong convergence guarantees for\nFisher markets with homogeneous linear constraints as well as for classical\nFisher markets. In this algorithm, the prices are updated based on the\ntatonnement process, with a step size that is completely independent of the\nutilities of individual agents.

However, under the dynamic and uncertainty of IoT data collection and\nenergy replenishment processes, optimizing the performance for UAV collectors\nis a very challenging task. Thus, this paper introduces a novel framework that\njointly optimizes the flying speed and energy replenishment for each UAV to\nsignificantly improve the data collection performance. Specifically, we first\ndevelop a Markov decision process to help the UAV automatically and dynamically\nmake optimal decisions under the dynamics and uncertainties of the environment.\nWe then propose a highly-effective reinforcement learning algorithm leveraging\ndeep Q-learning, double deep Q-learning, and a deep dueling neural network\narchitecture to quickly obtain the UAV's optimal policy. The core ideas of this\nalgorithm are to estimate the state values and action advantages separately and\nsimultaneously and to employ double estimators for estimating the action\nvalues. Thus, these proposed techniques can stabilize the learning process and\neffectively address the overestimation problem of conventional Q-learning\nalgorithms. To further reduce the learning time as well as significantly\nimprove learning quality, we develop advanced transfer learning techniques to\nallow UAVs to ``share'' and ``transfer'' learning knowledge. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that our proposed solution can improve the average data\ncollection performance of the system up to 200% compared with those of current\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

In this work, we\npresent the basic geometry and formulae that describe the absorption process of\na pulsar in binary with an O/B star and apply our model to two typical and\nwell-studied binaries: PSR~B1259-63/LS~2883 and LS 5039. We investigate the\ninfluences of the equatorial disc of LS 2883 with different orientations on the\ndispersion measure and free-free absorption of the radio pulsation from PSR\nB1259-63. The observed data are consistent with the disc inserted on the\norbital plane with a relatively large inclination angle. For LS 5039, due to\nits tight orbit, it was believed that the strong wind absorption makes\ndetecting radio emissions from the putative pulsar unlikely. However,\nconsidering the wind interaction and orbital motion, a bow shock cavity and a\nCoriolis shock would be formed, thereby allowing the pulsations to partially\navoid stellar outflow absorption. We investigate the dependence of the radio\noptical depth on the observing frequencies, the orbital inclination angle, and\nthe wind parameters. We suppose that the presumptive pulsar in LS 5039 is\nsimilar to PSR B1259-63 with pulsed emission extending to several tens of\ngigahertz. In that case, there could be a transparent window for radio\npulsations when the pulsar is moving around the inferior conjunction. The\nfollowing deep monitoring of LS 5039 and other systems by radio telescopes at\nhigh radio frequencies might reveal the nature of compact objects in the\nfuture.

We propose Motion-Appearance\nSynergistic Networks (MASN), which embed two cross-modal features grounded on\nmotion and appearance information and selectively utilize them depending on the\nquestion's intentions.

The underlying mechanism behind CACC is the use of\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks to transmit\nacceleration commands to adjacent vehicles in the platoon. However, the use of\nV2V networks leads to increased vulnerabilities against faults and cyberattacks\nat the communication channels. Communication networks serve as new access\npoints for malicious agents trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or\neven cause crashes. Here, we address the problem of increasing robustness of\nCACC schemes against cyberattacks by the use of multiple V2V networks and a\ndata fusion algorithm. The idea is to transmit acceleration commands multiple\ntimes through different communication networks (channels) to create redundancy\nat the receiver side. We exploit this redundancy to obtain attack-free\nestimates of acceleration commands. To accomplish this, we propose a\ndata-fusion algorithm that takes data from all channels, returns an estimate of\nthe true acceleration command, and isolates compromised channels. Note,\nhowever, that using estimated data for control introduces uncertainty into the\nloop and thus decreases performance. To minimize performance degradation, we\npropose a robust $H_{\\infty}$ controller that reduces the joint effect of\nestimation errors and sensor/channel noise in the platooning performance\n(tracking performance and string stability).

Mechanical stability is of key importance for the\nhigh performance of nano devices based on the van der Waals heterostructure. In\nparticular, buckling instability is a critical mechanical issue for the\nheterostructure due to its two-dimensional nature. Using graphene/MoS$_2$\nheterostructure as an example, the present work demonstrates the relationship\nbetween the buckling instability and the inevitable misfit strain in the\nheterostructure by molecular dynamics simulations. The misfit strain has rather\ndifferent effects on the buckling phenomenon depending on the magnitude of the\nmisfit strain.\n  (1) For negative misfit strain, the buckling stability of the heterostructure\nis reduced by the misfit strain. It is because the graphene layer, which\ninitiates the buckling process in the heterostructure of negative misfit\nstrain, is pre-compressed by the misfit strain that accelerates the buckling of\nthe graphene layer.\n  (2) For small positive misfit strain, the buckling stability for the\ngraphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is elevated. The underlying mechanism is that\nthe graphene layer initiates the buckling process of the heterostructure and is\npre-stretched by the small positive misfit strain, which decelerates the\nbuckling of the graphene layer.\n  (3) For large positive misfit strain, the graphene layer is pre-stretched\nwhile the MoS$_2$ layer is considerably pre-compressed, so the buckling of the\nheterostructure is initiated by the MoS$_2$ layer. As a consequence, the\nbuckling stability of the graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is reduced by the\nincrease of large positive misfit strain. These findings shall be valuable for\nunderstanding mechanical properties of van der Waals heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 10:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 03:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Oftentimes, users want to enhance their social\nvisibility, as it can make their contents, i.e., opinions, videos, pictures,\netc., attract attention from more users, which in turn may bring higher\ncommercial benefit to them. Motivated by this, we propose a mechanism, where\nthe OSN operator provides a \"social visibility boosting service\" to incentivize\n\"transactions\" between requesters (users who seek to enhance their social\nvisibility via adding new \"neighbors\") and suppliers (users who are willing to\nbe added as a new \"neighbor\" of any requester when certain \"rewards\" is\nprovided). We design a posted pricing scheme for the OSN provider to charge the\nrequesters who use such boosting service, and reward the suppliers who\ncontribute to such boosting service. The OSN operator keeps a fraction of the\npayment from requesters and distributes the remaining part to participating\nsuppliers \"fairly\" via the Shapley value.

A major\nchallenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the\ncross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this\nproblem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of\ntransfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.\nIn this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score\nthat dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in\nOTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the\njoint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal\ntransport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and\nlabel distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative\nconditional entropy of the matched labels.

Cumulative knowledge structures can be studied\nusing a network approach, in which nodes represent findings and links represent\nknowledge flows. Of particular interest to those studies is the notion of\nnetwork paths and path length. Starting from the Price model of network growth,\nwe derive an exact solution for the path length distribution of all unique\npaths from a given initial node to each node in the network. We study the\nrelative importance of the average in-degree and cumulative advantage effect\nand implement a generalization where the in-degree depends on the number of\nnodes. The cumulative advantage effect is found to fundamentally slow down path\nlength growth. As the collection of all unique paths may contain many\nredundancies, we additionally consider the subset of the longest paths to each\nnode in the network. As this case is more complicated, we only approximate the\nlongest path length distribution in a simple context. Where the number of all\nunique paths of a given length grows unbounded, the number of longest paths of\na given length converges to a finite limit, which depends exponentially on the\ngiven path length. Fundamental network properties and dynamics therefore\ncharacteristically shape cumulative structures in those networks, and should\ntherefore be taken into account when studying those structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 12:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

To mitigate this problem, we present techniques\nwhich soften the teacher influence for subgroups where it is less reliable.\nExperiments on several image classification benchmarks show that these\nmodifications of distillation maintain boost in overall accuracy, while\nadditionally ensuring improvement in subgroup performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 13:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 14:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

By using a special set of moments of the momentum distribution,\nwe reduce the kinetic equation to a coupled mode problem which encompasses all\nversions of second order viscous hydrodynamics for Bjorken flows. This coupled\nmode problem is analysed first using techniques of linear algebra. Then we\ntransform this two mode problem into a single non linear differential equation\nand proceed to a fixed point analysis. We identify an attractor solution as the\nparticular solution of this non linear equation that joins two fixed points:\none corresponding to the collisionless, early time regime, the other\ncorresponding to late time hydrodynamics.

This paper\nconsiders a class of networked games among multiple coalitions where each\ncoalition contains multiple agents that cooperate to minimize the sum of their\ncosts, subject to the demand of reaching an agreement on their state values.\nFurthermore, the underlying network topology among the agents does not need to\nbe balanced. To achieve the goal of NE seeking within such a context, two\nestimates are constructed for each agent, namely, an estimate of partial\nderivatives of the cost function and an estimate of global state values, based\non which, an iterative state updating law is elaborately designed. Linear\nconvergence of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. It is shown that the\nconsistency-constrained multi-coalition games investigated in this paper put\nthe well-studied networked games among individual players and distributed\noptimization in a unified framework, and the proposed algorithm can easily\ndegenerate into solutions to these problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 15:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:06:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 10:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

The VAE approach is adapted to model\nthe choice set generation process, in which the likelihood of perceiving chosen\nalternatives in the choice set is maximized. The VAE approach for route choice\nset generation is exemplified using a real dataset.

Commonly these uncertainties are\naccounted for using random fields and processes, which require knowledge about\nthe appearing probability distributions functions that is not readily\navailable. In these cases non-probabilistic approaches such as interval\nanalysis and fuzzy set theory are helpful uncertainty measures. Partial\ndifferential equations involving fuzzy and interval fields are traditionally\nsolved using the finite element method where the input fields are sampled using\nsome basis function expansion methods. This approach however is problematic, as\nit is reliant on knowledge about the spatial correlation fields. In this work\nwe utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve interval and fuzzy\npartial differential equations. The resulting network structures termed\ninterval physics-informed neural networks (iPINNs) and fuzzy physics-informed\nneural networks (fPINNs) show promising results for obtaining bounded solutions\nof equations involving spatially and/or temporally uncertain parameter fields.\nIn contrast to finite element approaches, no correlation length specification\nof the input fields as well as no Monte-Carlo simulations are necessary. In\nfact, information about the input interval fields is obtained directly as a\nbyproduct of the presented solution scheme. Furthermore, all major advantages\nof PINNs are retained, i.e. meshfree nature of the scheme, and ease of inverse\nproblem set-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

We observe that\nthese methods suffer locking in that limit. On the contrary, aggregated finite\nelement spaces are locking-free because they can be expressed as an extension\noperator from well-posed to ill-posed degrees of freedom. Next, we propose\nnovel ghost penalty methods that penalise the distance between the solution and\nits aggregation-based discrete extension.

The service\nprovider is adversarial in the sense that it can infer the users' private\ninformation based on the shared useful information. To minimize the privacy\nleakage while maintaining a desired level of utility, the users carefully\nperturb the useful information via a probabilistic privacy mapping before\nsharing it. We focus on the setting in which the adversary attempting an\ninference attack on the users' privacy has potentially biased information about\nthe statistical correlation between the private and useful variables. This\ninformation asymmetry between the users and the limited adversary leads to\nbetter privacy guarantees than the case of the omniscient adversary under the\nsame utility requirement. We first identify assumptions on the adversary's\ninformation so that the inference costs are well-defined and finite. Then, we\ncharacterize the impact of the information asymmetry and show that it increases\nthe inference costs for the adversary. We further formulate the design of the\nprivacy mapping against a limited adversary using a difference of convex\nfunctions program and solve it via the concave-convex procedure. When the\nadversary's information is not precisely available, we adopt a Bayesian view\nand represent the adversary's information by a probability distribution. In\nthis case, the expected cost for the adversary does not admit a closed-form\nexpression, and we establish and maximize a lower bound of the expected cost.\nWe provide a numerical example regarding a census data set to illustrate the\ntheoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 20:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to perform intelligent visual\nobject recognition. Yet, CNNs still suffer from severe accuracy degradation,\nparticularly on illumination-variant datasets. To address this problem, we\npropose a new CNN method based on orientation fusion for visual object\nrecognition. The proposed cloud-based video analytics system pioneers the use\nof bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition to split a video frame into\nintrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We further propose these IMFs to endure Reisz\ntransform to produce monogenic object components, which are in turn used for\nthe training of CNNs. Past works have demonstrated how the object orientation\ncomponent may be used to pursue accuracy levels as high as 93\\%. Herein we\ndemonstrate how a feature-fusion strategy of the orientation components leads\nto further improving visual recognition accuracy to 97\\%. We also assess the\nscalability of our method, looking at both the number and the size of the video\nstreams under scrutiny. We carry out extensive experimentation on the publicly\navailable Yale dataset, including also a self generated video datasets, finding\nsignificant improvements (both in accuracy and scale), in comparison to\nAlexNet, LeNet and SE-ResNeXt, which are the three most commonly used deep\nlearning models for visual object recognition and classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 07:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}
