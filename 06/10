Hence, this prediction of general relativity is verifiable\nexperimentally by measurement of the final relative separation between test\nmasses that comprise gravitational-wave detectors. In a separate context,\nindependent calculations have demonstrated that exact, sandwich, plane wave\nspacetimes exhibit a velocity memory effect: a non-zero relative velocity,\ngained by a pair of test masses in free fall, after the passage of a\ngravitational wave. In this paper, we find that in addition to the known\nconstant displacement memory effect test masses experience, a velocity memory\neffect at leading order arises due to the non-linear nature of gravitational\nwaves from compact binary sources.

We further improve this to a fast linear rate for PL\nfunctions, which is the first linear convergence result for an EF-type method\nnot relying on unbiased compressors.

Restricting access to genomic datasets is one\nsolution, but this greatly reduces their usefulness for research purposes. To\nallow sharing of genomic datasets while addressing these privacy concerns,\nseveral studies propose privacy-preserving mechanisms for data sharing.\nDifferential privacy (DP) is one of such mechanisms that formalize rigorous\nmathematical foundations to provide privacy guarantees while sharing aggregated\nstatistical information about a dataset. However, it has been shown that the\noriginal privacy guarantees of DP-based solutions degrade when there are\ndependent tuples in the dataset, which is a common scenario for genomic\ndatasets (due to the existence of family members). Results: In this work, we\nintroduce a near-optimal mechanism to mitigate the vulnerabilities of the\ninference attacks on differentially private query results from genomic datasets\nincluding dependent tuples. We propose a utility-maximizing and\nprivacy-preserving approach for sharing statistics by hiding selective SNPs of\nthe family members as they participate in a genomic dataset. By evaluating our\nmechanism on a real-world genomic dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our\nproposed mechanism can achieve up to 40% better privacy than state-of-the-art\nDP-based solutions, while near-optimally minimizing the utility loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 16:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

We provide a novel analysis\nof this method at the PDE level (without discretization). First, we formulate\nthe method as a fixed point iteration, and show (in dimensions 1,2,3) that it\nis well-defined in a tensor product of appropriate local function spaces, each\nwith $L^2$ impedance boundary data. Given this, we then obtain a bound on the\nnorm of the fixed point operator in terms of the local norms of certain\nimpedance-to-impedance maps arising from local interactions between subdomains.\nThese bounds provide conditions under which (some power of) the fixed point\noperator is a contraction. In 2-d, for rectangular domains and strip-wise\ndomain decompositions (with each subdomain only overlapping its immediate\nneighbours), we present two techniques for verifying the assumptions on the\nimpedance-to-impedance maps which ensure power contractivity of the fixed point\noperator. The first is through semiclassical analysis, which gives rigorous\nestimates valid as the frequency tends to infinity. These results verify the\nrequired assumptions for sufficiently large overlap. For more realistic domain\ndecompositions, we directly compute the norms of the impedance-to-impedance\nmaps by solving certain canonical (local) eigenvalue problems. We give\nnumerical experiments that illustrate the theory.

Very massive single stars stripped by their own winds ($\\gtrsim\n25-30 M_{\\odot}$ at solar metallicity) are considered viable progenitors of\nthese events. However, recent 1D core-collapse simulations show that some\nmassive stars may collapse directly into black holes after a failed explosion,\nwith a weak or no visible transient. In this letter, we estimate the effect of\ndirect collapse into a black hole on the rates of stripped-envelope supernovae\nthat arise from single stars. For this, we compute single-star MESA models at\nsolar metallicity and map their final state to their core-collapse outcome\nfollowing prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis. According to our\nmodels, no single stars that have lost their entire hydrogen-rich envelope are\nable to explode, and only a fraction of progenitors left with a thin hydrogen\nenvelope do (IIb progenitor candidates), unless we use a prescription that\ntakes the effect of turbulence into account or invoke increased wind mass-loss\nrates. This result increases the existing tension between the single-star\nparadigm to explain most stripped-envelope supernovae and their observed rates\nand properties. At face value, our results point toward an even higher\ncontribution of binary progenitors to stripped-envelope supernovae.\nAlternatively, they may suggest inconsistencies in the common practice of\nmapping different stellar models to core-collapse outcomes and/or higher\noverall mass loss in massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 17:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 12:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

In the\npast, some browsers evaluated an unknown URL for inclusion in a list of known\nphishing pages. However, as the number of URLs and known phishing pages\ncontinued to increase at a rapid pace, browsers started to include one or more\nmachine learning classifiers as part of their security services that aim to\nbetter protect end users from harm. While additional information could be used,\nbrowsers typically evaluate every unknown URL using some classifier in order to\nquickly detect these phishing pages. Early phishing detection used standard\nmachine learning classifiers, but recent research has instead proposed the use\nof deep learning models for the phishing URL detection task. Concurrently, text\nembedding research using transformers has led to state-of-the-art results in\nmany natural language processing tasks.

Combining the insights from these experiments, we propose URLTran which\nuses transformers to significantly improve the performance of phishing URL\ndetection over a wide range of very low false positive rates (FPRs) compared to\nother deep learning-based methods. For example, URLTran yields a true positive\nrate (TPR) of 86.80% compared to 71.20% for the next best baseline at an FPR of\n0.01%, resulting in a relative improvement of over 21.9%.

The attackers holding a specially\ncrafted patch can hide themselves from the state-of-the-art person detectors,\ne.g., YOLO, even in the physical world. This kind of attack can bring serious\nsecurity threats, such as escaping from surveillance cameras. In this paper, we\ndeeply explore the detection problems about the adversarial patch attacks to\nthe object detection. First, we identify a leverageable signature of existing\nadversarial patches from the point of the visualization explanation. A fast\nsignature-based defense method is proposed and demonstrated to be effective.\nSecond, we design an improved patch generation algorithm to reveal the risk\nthat the signature-based way may be bypassed by the techniques emerging in the\nfuture. The newly generated adversarial patches can successfully evade the\nproposed signature-based defense. Finally, we present a novel\nsignature-independent detection method based on the internal content semantics\nconsistency rather than any attack-specific prior knowledge. The fundamental\nintuition is that the adversarial object can appear locally but disappear\nglobally in an input image. The experiments demonstrate that the\nsignature-independent method can effectively detect the existing and improved\nattacks. It has also proven to be a general method by detecting unforeseen and\neven other types of attacks without any attack-specific prior knowledge.

Strikingly, however, the experiment also reported vanishing thermal Hall\nconductivity coexisting with the oscillations of the longitudinal one. Such\nabsence of the thermal Hall effect must originate from crystalline symmetries\nof $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

The associated pseudoscalar spinon Fermi surface states allow for the\ncoexistence of an emergent Landau quantizing magnetic field while having an\nexactly zero thermal Hall conductivity.

While photometric lensing and\nclustering cross-correlations have provided some of the tightest cosmological\nconstraints to date, it is not well understood how to optimally perform similar\nRSD/WL joint analyses in a lossless way. RSD is typically measured in $3D$\nredshift space, but WL is inherently a projected signal, making angular\nstatistics a natural choice for the combined analysis. Thus, we determine the\namount of RSD information that can be extracted using projected statistics.\nSpecifically we perform a Fisher analysis to forecast constraints and model\nbias comparing two different Fingers-of-God (FoG) models using both, the $3D$\npower spectrum, $P(k, \\mu)$, and tomographic $C(\\ell)$. We find that because\nna\\\"ive tomographic projection mixes large scales with poorly modelled\nnonlinear radial modes, it does not provide competitive constraints to the $3D$\nRSD power spectrum without the model bias becoming unacceptably large. This is\ntrue even in the limit of narrow tomographic bins. In light of this we propose\na new radial weighting scheme which unmixes radial RSD scales in projection\nyielding competitive constraints to the $3D$ RSD power spectrum, while keeping\nthe model bias small. This work lays the groundwork for optimal joint analyses\nof RSD and cosmic shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

An important challenge is to interpolate between the singular\nlimits to determine the full correlators at arbitrary kinematics. This is\nparticularly relevant because the singularities of correlators are not directly\nobservable, but can only be accessed by analytic continuation. In this paper,\nwe study rational correlators, including those of gauge fields, gravitons, and\nthe inflaton, whose only singularities at tree level are poles and whose\nbehavior away from these poles is strongly constrained by unitarity and\nlocality. We describe how unitarity translates into a set of cutting rules that\nconsistent correlators must satisfy, and explain how this can be used to\nbootstrap correlators given information about their singularities. We also\nderive recursion relations that allow the iterative construction of more\ncomplicated correlators from simpler building blocks. In flat space, all energy\nsingularities are simple poles, so that the combination of unitarity\nconstraints and recursion relations provides an efficient way to bootstrap the\nfull correlators. In many cases, these flat-space correlators can then be\ntransformed into their more complex de Sitter counterparts. As an example of\nthis procedure, we derive the correlator associated to graviton Compton\nscattering in de Sitter space, though the methods are much more widely\napplicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

We advocate that the light-front quantization\nshould be viewed as an effective theory in which small $k^+$ modes have been\neffectively ``integrated out'', with an infinite number of renormalization\nconstants. Instead of solving light-front quantized field theories directly, we\nmake the large momentum expansion of the equal-time Euclidean correlation\nfunctions in instant quantization as an effective way to systematically\ncalculate light-front correlations, including the light-front wave function\namplitudes. This large-momentum effective theory accomplishes an effective\nlight-front quantization through lattice QCD calculations. We demonstrate our\napproach using an example of a pseudo-scalar meson wave function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 18:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

An\nattractive solution is synthetic data generation. However, most such methods\nare overly sophisticated, focusing on high-quality, realistic data in the input\nspace. It is unclear whether adapting them to the few-shot regime and using\nthem for the downstream task of classification is the right approach. Previous\nworks on synthetic data generation for few-shot classification focus on\nexploiting complex models, e.g. a Wasserstein GAN with multiple regularizers or\na network that transfers latent diversities from known to novel classes.\n  We follow a different approach and investigate how a simple and\nstraightforward synthetic data generation method can be used effectively.

Popular incremental learning methods mitigate\nsuch forgetting by retaining a subset of previously seen samples and replaying\nthem during the training on subsequent tasks. However, this is not always\npossible, e.g., due to data protection regulations. In such restricted\nscenarios, one can employ generative models to replay either artificial images\nor hidden features to a classifier. In this work, we propose Genifer\n(GENeratIve FEature-driven image Replay), where a generative model is trained\nto replay images that must induce the same hidden features as real samples when\nthey are passed through the classifier. Our technique therefore incorporates\nthe benefits of both image and feature replay, i.e.: (1) unlike conventional\nimage replay, our generative model explicitly learns the distribution of\nfeatures that are relevant for classification; (2) in contrast to feature\nreplay, our entire classifier remains trainable; and (3) we can leverage\nimage-space augmentations, which increase distillation performance while also\nmitigating overfitting during the training of the generative model.

At triggering instants, each agent\nsolves a local min-max optimization problem based on local system states and\npredicted system states of neighbors, determines its next triggering instant\nand broadcasts its predicted state trajectory to its neighbors. As a result,\nthe communication load is greatly alleviated while retaining robustness and\ncomparable control performance compared to periodic algorithms. In order to\nhandle time-varying delays, a novel consistency constraint is incorporated into\neach local optimization problem to restrict the deviation between the newest\npredicted states and previously broadcast predicted states.

These solutions are well-reproduced by\nhydrodynamic simulations, in which, as in the case of isothermal winds launched\nfrom the mid-plane, we find winds launch at the maximum Mach number for which\nthe streamline solutions extend to infinity without encountering a singularity.\nWe explain this behaviour based on the fact that lower Mach number solutions do\nnot fill the spatial domain.

We also propose a two-stage extract-then-generate baseline\nand show that there exists a large gap (19.9% in ROUGE-L) between\nstate-of-the-art models and human performance, suggesting that the data will\nsupport significant future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 20:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 21:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

The Indian buffet process (IBP) is\na popular exchangeable prior distribution for latent feature matrices. In the\npresence of additional information, however, the exchangeability assumption is\nnot reasonable or desirable. The AIBD can incorporate pairwise similarity\ninformation, yet it preserves many properties of the IBP, including the\ndistribution of the total number of features. Thus, much of the interpretation\nand intuition that one has for the IBP directly carries over to the AIBD. A\ntemperature parameter controls the degree to which the similarity information\naffects feature-sharing between observations. Unlike other nonexchangeable\ndistributions for feature allocations, the probability mass function of the\nAIBD has a tractable normalizing constant, making posterior inference on\nhyperparameters straight-forward using standard MCMC methods. A novel posterior\nsampling algorithm is proposed for the IBP and the AIBD.

Neural rendering uses deep neural\nnetworks to solve inverse rendering tasks and applies techniques similar to\nDVR.

A range of\nadversarial defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate the interference\nof adversarial noise, among which the input pre-processing methods are scalable\nand show great potential to safeguard DNNs. However, pre-processing methods may\nsuffer from the robustness degradation effect, in which the defense reduces\nrather than improving the adversarial robustness of a target model in a\nwhite-box setting. A potential cause of this negative effect is that\nadversarial training examples are static and independent to the pre-processing\nmodel. To solve this problem, we investigate the influence of full adversarial\nexamples which are crafted against the full model, and find they indeed have a\npositive impact on the robustness of defenses. Furthermore, we find that simply\nchanging the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not\ncompletely alleviate the robustness degradation effect. This is due to the\nadversarial risk of the pre-processed model being neglected, which is another\ncause of the robustness degradation effect. Motivated by above analyses, we\npropose a method called Joint Adversarial Training based Pre-processing (JATP)\ndefense. Specifically, we formulate a feature similarity based adversarial risk\nfor the pre-processing model by using full adversarial examples found in a\nfeature space. Unlike standard adversarial training, we only update the\npre-processing model, which prompts us to introduce a pixel-wise loss to\nimprove its cross-model transferability. We then conduct a joint adversarial\ntraining on the pre-processing model to minimize this overall risk. Empirical\nresults show that our method could effectively mitigate the robustness\ndegradation effect across different target models in comparison to previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 01:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

We propose to study\nthese phenomena by investigating how the modes, or local maxima, of a\ndistribution are maintained throughout the full learning chain of the\nground-truth, empirical, learned and decoding-induced distributions, via the\nnewly proposed mode recovery cost. We design a tractable testbed where we build\nthree types of ground-truth distributions: (1) an LSTM based structured\ndistribution, (2) an unstructured distribution where probability of a sequence\ndoes not depend on its content, and (3) a product of these two which we call a\nsemi-structured distribution. Our study reveals both expected and unexpected\nfindings. First, starting with data collection, mode recovery cost strongly\nrelies on the ground-truth distribution and is most costly with the\nsemi-structured distribution. Second, after learning, mode recovery cost from\nthe ground-truth distribution may increase or decrease compared to data\ncollection, with the largest cost degradation occurring with the\nsemi-structured ground-truth distribution. Finally, the ability of the\ndecoding-induced distribution to recover modes from the learned distribution is\nhighly impacted by the choices made earlier in the learning chain.

Recent progress on node embedding shows that proximity matrix\nfactorization methods gain superb performance and scale to large graphs with\nmillions of nodes. Existing approaches first define a proximity matrix and then\nlearn the embeddings that fit the proximity by matrix factorization. Most\nexisting matrix factorization methods adopt the same proximity for different\ntasks, while it is observed that different tasks and datasets may require\ndifferent proximity, limiting their representation power.\n  Motivated by this, we propose {\\em Lemane}, a framework with trainable\nproximity measures, which can be learned to best suit the datasets and tasks at\nhand automatically. Our method is end-to-end, which incorporates differentiable\nSVD in the pipeline so that the parameters can be trained via backpropagation.\nHowever, this learning process is still expensive on large graphs. To improve\nthe scalability, we train proximity measures only on carefully subsampled\ngraphs, and then apply standard proximity matrix factorization on the original\ngraph using the learned proximity. Note that, computing the learned proximities\nfor each pair is still expensive for large graphs, and existing techniques for\ncomputing proximities are not applicable to the learned proximities.

However, this subject is less addressed in recent\nstudies. Classical methods with certain variants, such as Dynamic Programming\nwith Tile Coding which discretizes the state space, fail to handle slowly\nchanging variables because those methods cannot capture the tiny changes in\neach transition step, as it is computationally expensive or impossible to\nestablish an extremely granular grid system. In this paper, we introduce a\nHyperspace Neighbor Penetration (HNP) approach that solves the problem. HNP\ncaptures in each transition step the state's partial \"penetration\" into its\nneighboring hyper-tiles in the gridded hyperspace, thus does not require the\ntransition to be inter-tile in order for the change to be captured. Therefore,\nHNP allows for a very coarse grid system, which makes the computation feasible.\nHNP assumes near linearity of the transition function in a local space, which\nis commonly satisfied.

In\nfact, given their underlying deep models, it is impossible to directly\nunderstand the mapping from observations to actions for any reasonably complex\nagent. Producing this supporting technology to \"open the black box\" of these AI\nsystems, while not sacrificing performance, was the fundamental goal of the\nDARPA XAI program. In our journey through this program, we have several \"big\npicture\" takeaways: 1) Explanations need to be highly tailored to their\nscenario; 2) many seemingly high performing RL agents are extremely brittle and\nare not amendable to explanation; 3) causal models allow for rich explanations,\nbut how to present them isn't always straightforward; and 4) human subjects\nconjure fantastically wrong mental models for AIs, and these models are often\nhard to break. This paper discusses the origins of these takeaways, provides\namplifying information, and suggestions for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 05:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

To prepare the training data, vFL needs to identify\nthe common data entities shared by all parties. It is usually achieved by\nPrivate Set Intersection (PSI) which identifies the intersection of training\nsamples from all parties by using personal identifiable information (e.g.\nemail) as sample IDs to align data instances. As a result, PSI would make\nsample IDs of the intersection visible to all parties, and therefore each party\ncan know that the data entities shown in the intersection also appear in the\nother parties, i.e. intersection membership. However, in many real-world\nprivacy-sensitive organizations, e.g. banks and hospitals, revealing membership\nof their data entities is prohibited. In this paper, we propose a vFL framework\nbased on Private Set Union (PSU) that allows each party to keep sensitive\nmembership information to itself. Instead of identifying the intersection of\nall training samples, our PSU protocol generates the union of samples as\ntraining instances. In addition, we propose strategies to generate synthetic\nfeatures and labels to handle samples that belong to the union but not the\nintersection.

While various\nfixes have been proposed, a more fundamental understanding of why this\nunder-coverage bias happens in the first place remains elusive.\n  In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical study on the coverage of\nuncertainty estimation algorithms in learning quantiles.

The instruments involved are MAGIC, FACT, Fermi-LAT, Swift, GASP-WEBT,\nOVRO, Medicina and Mets\\\"ahovi. Additionally, four deep exposures (several\nhours long) with simultaneous MAGIC and NuSTAR observations allowed a precise\nmeasurement of the falling segments of the two spectral components. The\nvery-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma rays and X-rays are positively\ncorrelated at zero time lag, but the strength and characteristics of the\ncorrelation change substantially across the various energy bands probed. The\nVHE versus X-ray fluxes follow different patterns, partly due to substantial\nchanges in the Compton dominance during a few days without a simultaneous\nincrease in the X-ray flux (i.e. orphan gamma-ray activity). Studying the\nbroadband spectral energy distribution (SED) during the days including NuSTAR\nobservations, we show that these changes can be explained within a one-zone\nleptonic model with a blob that increases its size over time. Our multi-band\ncorrelation study also hints at an anti-correlation between UV/optical and\nX-ray at a significance higher than 3 sigmas. A VHE flare observed on 2017\nFebruary 4 shows gamma-ray variability on multi-hour timescales, with a factor\n10 increase in the TeV flux but only a moderate increase in the keV flux. The\nrelated broadband SED is better described by a two-zone leptonic scenario\nrather than by a one-zone scenario. We find that the flare can be produced by\nthe appearance of a compact second blob populated by high energetic electrons\nspanning a narrow range of Lorentz factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 06:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Existing methods heavily rely on accurate demographic annotations.\nHowever, such annotations are usually unavailable in real scenarios. Moreover,\nthese methods are typically designed for a specific demographic group and are\nnot general enough. In this paper, we propose a false positive rate penalty\nloss, which mitigates face recognition bias by increasing the consistency of\ninstance False Positive Rate (FPR). Specifically, we first define the instance\nFPR as the ratio between the number of the non-target similarities above a\nunified threshold and the total number of the non-target similarities. The\nunified threshold is estimated for a given total FPR. Then, an additional\npenalty term, which is in proportion to the ratio of instance FPR overall FPR,\nis introduced into the denominator of the softmax-based loss. The larger the\ninstance FPR, the larger the penalty. By such unequal penalties, the instance\nFPRs are supposed to be consistent. Compared with the previous debiasing\nmethods, our method requires no demographic annotations. Thus, it can mitigate\nthe bias among demographic groups divided by various attributes, and these\nattributes are not needed to be previously predefined during training.\nExtensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over state-of-the-art competitors.

GALEX observations found\nthat surprisingly 30% of all the nearby spiral galaxies have XUV disks. The XUV\ngalaxies can be broadly classified as type 1 and type 2 XUV disks. The type 1\nXUV disks have star formation that is linked to that in their main disk, and\nthe UV emission appears as extended, filamentary spiral arms. The UV luminosity\nis associated with compact star forming regions along the extended spiral arms.\nThe star formation is probably driven by slow gas accretion from nearby\ngalaxies or the intergalactic medium (IGM). But the type 2 XUV disks have star\nformation associated with an outer low luminosity stellar disk that is often\ntruncated near the optical radius of the galaxy. The nature of the stellar\ndisks in type 2 XUV disks are similar to that of the diffuse stellar disks of\nlow surface brightness galaxies. The star formation in type 2 XUV disks is\nthought to be due to rapid gas accretion or gas infall from nearby high\nvelocity clouds (HVCs), interacting galaxies or the IGM.

By exploiting the interrelations of\nswarm intelligence, self-organization and emergence, DBS serves as an\nalternative approach to the optimization of a global objective function in the\ntask of clustering. The swarm omits the usage of a global objective function\nand is parameter-free because it searches for the Nash equilibrium during its\nannealing process. To our knowledge, DBS is the first swarm combining these\napproaches. Its clustering can outperform common clustering methods such as\nK-means, PAM, single linkage, spectral clustering, model-based clustering, and\nWard, if no prior knowledge about the data is available. A central problem in\nclustering is the correct estimation of the number of clusters. This is\naddressed by a DBS visualization called topographic map which allows assessing\nthe number of clusters. It is known that all clustering algorithms construct\nclusters, irrespective of the data set contains clusters or not. In contrast to\nmost other clustering algorithms, the topographic map identifies, that\nclustering of the data is meaningless if the data contains no (natural)\nclusters.

In this paper, we propose a\nself-consistent derivation of this formula based on the linearized Vlasov\nequation. The proposed mode coupling instability for coasting beams was never\npredicted or discussed in the past and we believe that the reason is twofold.\nFirst, to derive it analytically from the linearized Vlasov equation, one\nshould not make the usual approximation $\\sin(\\phi)\\simeq (e^{j\\phi})/(2j)$,\nwhere $\\phi$ is the transverse betatron phase, but really consider the two\nterms of $\\sin(\\phi)=(e^{j\\phi}-e^{-j\\phi})/(2j)$ as the second term is the one\nresponsible for the mode coupling in coasting beams. It should be stressed here\nthat mode coupling is found already with driving impedance only. Note that the\nprevious approximation is also usually made for bunched beams and this case\nshould therefore also be carefully reviewed in the future. Second, by including\nthe detuning impedance, the coupling is much stronger and this is what we found\nalso in pyHeadTail simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 07:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

This sudden change has rendered many face recognition\nbased access control, authentication and surveillance systems ineffective.\nOfficial documents such as passports, driving license and national identity\ncards are enrolled with fully uncovered face images. However, in the current\nglobal situation, face matching systems should be able to match these reference\nimages with masked face images.

The variety of\nspecies detected after UV irradiation of ices containing methylamine revealed\nthe presence of 12 species which have been already detected in the ISM, being 4\nof them typically classified as complex organic molecules: formamide (HCONH2),\nmethyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN), CH$_3$NH and CH$_3$CHNH. Warming up of the\nirradiated CH$_3$NH$_2$-bearing ice samples lead to the formation of\ntrimethylentriamine (TMT), a N-heterocycle precursor of HMT, and the subsequent\nsynthesis of HMT at temperatures above 230 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 10:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Kinetically dominated regimes arise in classical fast-roll\nscenarios as well as in quantum bouncing cosmologies. For instance, kinetic\ndominance is typical in interesting preinflationary phases of Loop Quantum\nCosmology. In this work, we analyze the leading-order effects that the presence\nof a scalar field potential causes on the primordial cosmological perturbations\nin these kinetically dominated epochs. These effects can be grouped in two\nsets, namely, those that affect the effective mass of the perturbations and\nthose that affect the choice of their vacuum state. The effective mass is\nmodified directly by terms that include the potential, but also indirectly by\nthe change in the background dynamics and the relation between the\nparameterization of these dynamics and the conformal time, usually employed to\ndescribe the evolution of the perturbations. On the other hand, away from de\nSitter inflation, the Bunch-Davies state is no longer the most natural vacuum\nat all scales. Recent proposals suggest to modify it by carrying out certain\nHamiltonian diagonalization with a suitable asymptotic behavior at large\nwavenumber scales.

The first type\nis amplitude interferometry, which includes conventional optical telescopes and\nVery Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The second type is intensity\ninterferometry, which relies on Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type measurements. At\noptical frequencies, where direct phase measurements are impossible, amplitude\ninterferometry has an effective numerical aperture that is limited by the\ndistance from which photons can coherently interfere. Intensity interferometry,\non the other hand, correlates only photon fluxes and can thus support much\nlarger numerical apertures, but suffers from a reduced signal due to the low\naverage photon number per mode in thermal light. It has hitherto not been clear\nwhich method is superior under realistic conditions. Here, we give a\ncomparative analysis of the performance of amplitude and intensity\ninterferometry, and we relate this to the fundamental resolution limit that can\nbe achieved in any physical measurement.

Most prior studies on radar sensing focus on\ndistant targets, which usually rely on far-field assumption with uniform plane\nwave (UPW) models.

Furthermore, new closed-form expressions of the sensing\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are derived for both XL-MIMO radar and\nXL-phased-array radar modes. Our results reveal that different from the\nconventional UPW model where the SNR scales linearly and unboundedly with N for\nMIMO radar and with MN for phased-array radar, with M and N being the transmit\nand receive antenna numbers, respectively, more practical SNR scaling laws are\nobtained. For XL-phased-array radar with optimal power allocation, the SNR\nincreases with M and N with diminishing returns, governed by new parameters\ncalled the transmit and receive angular spans.

The experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.\nFor instance, MST achieves Top-1 accuracy of 76.9% with DeiT-S only using\n300-epoch pre-training by linear evaluation, which outperforms supervised\nmethods with the same epoch by 0.4% and its comparable variant DINO by 1.0\\%.\nFor dense prediction tasks, MST also achieves 42.7% mAP on MS COCO object\ndetection and 74.04% mIoU on Cityscapes segmentation only with 100-epoch\npre-training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 11:05:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 06:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Some adversarial algorithms perturb all the pixels in the\nimage minimally for the image classification task in image classification. In\ncontrast, some algorithms perturb few pixels strongly. However, very little\ninformation is available regarding why these adversarial samples so diverse\nfrom each other exist. Recently, Vargas et al. showed that the existence of\nthese adversarial samples might be due to conflicting saliency within the\nneural network. We test this hypothesis of conflicting saliency by analysing\nthe Saliency Maps (SM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM)\nof original and few different types of adversarial samples. We also analyse how\ndifferent adversarial samples distort the attention of the neural network\ncompared to original samples. We show that in the case of Pixel Attack,\nperturbed pixels either calls the network attention to themselves or divert the\nattention from them. Simultaneously, the Projected Gradient Descent Attack\nperturbs pixels so that intermediate layers inside the neural network lose\nattention for the correct class. We also show that both attacks affect the\nsaliency map and activation maps differently. Thus, shedding light on why some\ndefences successful against some attacks remain vulnerable against other\nattacks. We hope that this analysis will improve understanding of the existence\nand the effect of adversarial samples and enable the community to develop more\nrobust neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 11:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

The balance, dobbed the\nQCD trilemma, is unavoidably violated when one of the magnitudes among them is\nhighly dominated, or suppressed. Based on a three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel, we explicitly evaluate the amount of violation of the QCD trilemma at\nphysical point, and show that the violation takes place not only at vacuum, but\neven in a whole temperature regime including the chiral crossover epoch. This\nwork confirms and extends the suggestion recently reported from lattice QCD\nwith 2 flavors on dominance of the axial and topological susceptibilities left\nin the chiral susceptibility at high temperatures. It turns out that the\nimbalance is essentially due to the flavor symmetry violation of the lightest\nthree flavors, and the flavor breaking specifically brings enhancement of the\naxial anomaly contribution in the chiral order parameter, while the the\nstrength of the axial breaking and the transition rate of the topological\ncharge are fairly insensitive to the flavor symmetry. The violation of QCD\ntrilemma and its flavor dependence can be tested by lattice simulations with 2\n+ 1 flavors in the future, and would also give a new guiding principle to\nexplore the flavor dependence of the chiral phase transition, such as the\nColumbia plot, including possible extension with external fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 11:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 11:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 09:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 09:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Instead of only learning from the teacher's soft label as in\nconventional KD, researchers find that the rich information contained in the\nhidden layers of BERT is conducive to the student's performance. To better\nexploit the hidden knowledge, a common practice is to force the student to\ndeeply mimic the teacher's hidden states of all the tokens in a layer-wise\nmanner. In this paper, however, we observe that although distilling the\nteacher's hidden state knowledge (HSK) is helpful, the performance gain\n(marginal utility) diminishes quickly as more HSK is distilled. To understand\nthis effect, we conduct a series of analysis. Specifically, we divide the HSK\nof BERT into three dimensions, namely depth, length and width. We first\ninvestigate a variety of strategies to extract crucial knowledge for each\nsingle dimension and then jointly compress the three dimensions. In this way,\nwe show that 1) the student's performance can be improved by extracting and\ndistilling the crucial HSK, and 2) using a tiny fraction of HSK can achieve the\nsame performance as extensive HSK distillation. Based on the second finding, we\nfurther propose an efficient KD paradigm to compress BERT, which does not\nrequire loading the teacher during the training of student.

We find that the integrated neutrino luminosity of the\nCooper Pair Formation (CPF) process can be written as a product of two factors.\nThe first factor depends on the neutron star mass, radius and maximal critical\ntemperature of neutron pairing in the core, $T_{Cn \\mathrm{max}}$, but not on\nthe particular superfluidity model; it can be expressed by an analytical\nformula valid for many nucleon equations of state. The second factor depends on\nthe shape of the critical temperature profile within the star, the ratio of the\ntemperature $T$ to $T_{Cn \\mathrm{max}}$, but not on the maximal critical\ntemperature itself. While this second factor depends on the superfluidity\nmodel, it obeys several model-independent constraints. This property allows one\nto analyse the thermal evolution of neutron stars with superfluid cores without\nrelying on a specific model of their interiors. The constructed expressions\nallow us to perform a self-consistent analysis of spectral data and neutron\nstar cooling theory. We apply these findings to the cooling neutron star in the\nCassiopeia A supernova remnant using 14 sets of observations taken over 19\nyears. We constrain $T_{Cn\\mathrm{max}}$ to the range of $ (5-10)\\times 10^8$\nK. This value depends weakly on the equation of state and superfluidity model,\nand will not change much if cooling is slower than the current data suggest. We\nalso constrain the overall efficiency of the CPF neutrino luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Moreover,\nwhen the graph is known, standard techniques may be used to give estimates and\nconfidence intervals for causal effects.

While the\ndiscovery of evolutionary cycles have marked a breakthrough in our\nunderstanding of the accretion flow changes in the sub-Eddington regime in\nGalactic Black Hole Binaries, their evidence in the super-Eddington regime\nremained elusive. However, recent circumstantial evidence had hinted the\npresence of a recurrent evolutionary cycle in two archetypal ULXs: Holmberg II\nX-1 and NGC 5204 X-1. Here we build on our previous work and exploit the\nlong-term high-cadence monitoring of Swift-XRT in order to provide evidence of\nthe evolutionary cycle in these two sources and investigate the main physical\nparameters inducing their spectral transitions. We study the long-term\nevolution of both sources using hardness-intensity diagrams (HID) and by means\nof Lomb-Scargle periodograms and Gaussian processes modelling to look for\nperiodic variability. We show that both sources follow a recurrent evolutionary\npattern in the HID that can be characterized by the hard ultraluminous (HUL)\nand soft ultraluminous (SUL) spectral regimes, and a third state with\ncharacteristics similar to the supersoft ultraluminous (SSUL) state. The\ntransitions between the soft states seem aperiodic, as revealed by timing\nanalysis of the light curve of Holmberg II X-1, albeit further investigation is\nwarranted. The light curve of NGC 5204 X-1 shows a periodicity of $\\sim$ 200\ndays, possibly associated with the duration of the evolutionary cycle. We\nsupport a scenario in which the spectral changes from HUL to SUL are due to a\nperiodic increase of the mass-transfer rate and subsequent narrowing of the\nopening angle of the supercritical funnel. The narrower funnel, combined with\nstochastic variability imprinted by the wind, might explain the SUL--SSUL\nspectral changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:47:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 12:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Studying the pattern of the parton shower is\none of the key experimental tools for testing QCD. This pattern is expected to\ndepend on the mass of the initiating parton, through a phenomenon known as the\ndead-cone effect, which predicts a suppression of the gluon spectrum emitted by\na heavy quark of mass $m_{\\rm{Q}}$ and energy $E$, within a cone of angular\nsize $m_{\\rm{Q}}$/$E$ around the emitter.

We also show that the\ninformation coming from the angular probability distribution allows designing\nnon-uniform codebook quantization, reducing the degradation of the performances\ncompared to uniform one. Numerical simulation on realistic scenarios shows that\nPCBs-based beam selection outperforms the 5G standard in terms of the number of\nIA trials, with a performance comparable to position-based methods, without\nrequiring the signaling of sensitive information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

We refer to our multi-agent learning strategy\nas Fairness through Equivariance (Fair-E) and demonstrate its effectiveness\nempirically. We then introduce Fairness through Equivariance Regularization\n(Fair-ER) as a soft-constraint version of Fair-E and show that it reaches\nhigher levels of utility than Fair-E and fairer outcomes than non-equivariant\npolicies. Finally, we present novel findings regarding the fairness-utility\ntrade-off in multi-agent settings; showing that the magnitude of the trade-off\nis dependent on agent skill.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 13:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the\nnumber of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms\nis the existence of an orthogonal representation that describes such drawings\ncombinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges around each vertex\nand the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any kind of geometric\ninformation such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths.\n  We generalize this idea to ortho-radial representations of ortho-radial\ndrawings, which are embeddings into an ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are\nconcentric circles around the origin and straight-line spokes emanating from\nthe origin but excluding the origin itself. Unlike the orthogonal case, there\nexist ortho-radial representations that do not admit a corresponding drawing,\nfor example so-called strictly monotone cycles. An ortho-radial drawing is\ncalled valid if it does not contain a strictly monotone cycle. Our first result\nis that an ortho-radial representation admits a corresponding drawing if and\nonly if it is valid. Previously such a characterization was only known for\northo-radial drawings of paths, cycles, and theta graphs, and in the special\ncase of rectangular drawings of cubic graphs, where the contour of each face is\nrequired to be a rectangle. Further, we give a quadratic-time algorithm that\ntests for an ortho-radial representation whether it is valid, and we show how\nto draw a valid ortho-radial representation in the same running time.\n  Altogether, this reduces the problem of computing a minimum-bend ortho-radial\ndrawing to the task of computing a valid ortho-radial representation with the\nminimum number of bends, and hence establishes an ortho-radial analogue of the\ntopology-shape-metrics framework for planar orthogonal drawings by Tamassia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

We hypothesized that a method capable of performing\nwell on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and\npotentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the\nhypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a\nbiomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude\nof both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore\nthe axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical\nimages, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small\nobjects.

Moreover, by monitoring the MSD\nwinner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well\nto a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis.\nThree main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image\nsegmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when\nretrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across\nmultiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the\ntraining of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI\nexperts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In this paper, we present an approach to bridge this gap.\nOur technique slightly alters the generator, so that an out-of-domain image is\nfaithfully mapped into an in-domain latent code. The key idea is pivotal tuning\n- a brief training process that preserves the editing quality of an in-domain\nlatent region, while changing its portrayed identity and appearance. In Pivotal\nTuning Inversion (PTI), an initial inverted latent code serves as a pivot,\naround which the generator is fined-tuned. At the same time, a regularization\nterm keeps nearby identities intact, to locally contain the effect. This\nsurgical training process ends up altering appearance features that represent\nmostly identity, without affecting editing capabilities. We validate our\ntechnique through inversion and editing metrics, and show preferable scores to\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further qualitatively demonstrate our technique by\napplying advanced edits (such as pose, age, or expression) to numerous images\nof well-known and recognizable identities. Finally, we demonstrate resilience\nto harder cases, including heavy make-up, elaborate hairstyles and/or headwear,\nwhich otherwise could not have been successfully inverted and edited by\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

The most common approaches to feature extraction are the convolutional\ntechniques to extract relevant positional information from images and the\nfilters for edge detection or background removal. Here we apply hashing\ntechniques for the first time used for features extraction in this problem. The\nstudy of the classification capacity of hashes is carried out by comparing 5\ndifferent hash algorithms, 2 of which are based on wavelets.

However, in many practical settings it would be more useful to\nobtain a 'least bad' policy than just a 'No', where 'least bad' is\ncharacterized by some numerical value indicating the extent to which the policy\nviolates the base authorization relation and constraints. Accordingly, we\nintroduce the Valued APEP, which returns an authorization policy of minimum\nweight, where the (non-negative) weight is determined by the constraints\nviolated by the returned solution. We then establish a number of results\nconcerning the parameterized complexity of Valued APEP. We prove that the\nproblem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if the set of constraints satisfies\ntwo restrictions, but is intractable if only one of these restrictions holds.\n(Most constraints known to be of practical use satisfy both restrictions.) We\nalso introduce a new type of resiliency for workflow satisfiability problem,\nshow how it can be addressed using Valued APEP and use this to build a set of\nbenchmark instances for Valued APEP.

However, the prosody of those systems is generally flatter\nthan natural speech, producing samples with low expressiveness. Disentanglement\nof speaker id and prosody is crucial in text-to-speech systems to improve on\nnaturalness and produce more variable syntheses. This paper proposes a new\nneural text-to-speech model that approaches the disentanglement problem by\nconditioning a Tacotron2-like architecture on flow-normalized speaker\nembeddings, and by substituting the reference encoder with a new learned latent\ndistribution responsible for modeling the intra-sentence variability due to the\nprosody. By removing the reference encoder dependency, the speaker-leakage\nproblem typically happening in this kind of systems disappears, producing more\ndistinctive syntheses at inference time. The new model achieves significantly\nhigher prosody variance than the baseline in a set of quantitative prosody\nfeatures, as well as higher speaker distinctiveness, without decreasing the\nspeaker intelligibility. Finally, we observe that the normalized speaker\nembeddings enable much richer speaker interpolations, substantially improving\nthe distinctiveness of the new interpolated speakers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 14:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

Unsigned\ndistance function (UDF) based approaches have been proposed recently as a\npromising alternative to represent both open and closed shapes. However, since\nthe gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate\nlocal (differential) geometric properties like the normals and tangent planes\nwhich are needed for many downstream applications in vision and graphics. There\nare additional challenges in computing these properties efficiently with a\nlow-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such\nsurfaces using a new class of implicit representations called the closest\nsurface-point (CSP) representation. We show that CSP allows us to represent\ncomplex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high fidelity. It also\nallows for accurate and efficient computation of local geometric properties.

In return, the primary\ncommunication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the\nBD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as\nthe backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double\nattenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is\nextremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic\nradio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs.

The possibility to endow the initially flat sheet\nwith a variety of surface-related functionalities provides the means to\nsimultaneously achieve multi-functional performance and a complex 3D\narchitecture. One intrinsic limitation of such a production strategy is the\ncontradictory stiffness requirements for the folding and for subsequent\nload-bearing steps: while a low stiffness is required to allow for the\nsuccessful completion of the intended self-folding process, a high stiffness is\nneeded for the subsequent application of the folded structure as a load-bearing\nmechanical metamaterial. The competition between these two requirements\ndetermines the theoretical limits of 4D printed self-folding mechanical\nmetamaterials, which have not been determined before.

Existing\ntail dependence coefficients (TDCs) are based on an asymptotic analysis of\nrelevant conditional probabilities, and do not provide a complete framework in\nwhich to compare extreme dependence between two random variables. In fact, for\nmany important classes of bivariate distributions, these coefficients take on\nnon-informative boundary values. We propose a new approach by first considering\nglobal measures based on the surface area of the conditional cumulative\nprobability in copula space, normalized with respect to departures from\nindependence and scaled by the difference between the two boundary copulas of\nco-monotonicity and counter-monotonicity. The measures could be approached by\ncumulating probability on either the lower left or upper right domain of the\ncopula space, and offer the novel perspective of being able to differentiate\nasymmetric dependence with respect to direction of conditioning. The resulting\nTDCs produce a smoother and more refined taxonomy of tail dependence. The\nempirical performance of the measures is examined in a simulated data context,\nand illustrated through a case study examining tail dependence between stock\nindices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 15:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

In this paper, we\ntherefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation\nby using methods from machine learning.

The network is then able\nto predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only\nits key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that\napproximates the robustness in constant time.

Since the sEL model and the reduced\nLandau--de Gennes (rLdG) models can be viewed as Ginzburg--Landau functionals,\nwe systematically compute the solution landscapes of the sEL model, for\ndifferent domain sizes, and compare with the solution landscapes of the\ncorresponding rLdG models. There are many similarities, including the stable\ndiagonal and rotated states, bifurcation behaviors, and sub-solution landscapes\nwith low-index saddle solutions. Significant disparities also exist between the\ntwo models. The sEL vector model exhibits the stable solution $C\\pm$ with\ninterior defects, high-index \"fake defects\" solutions, novel tessellating\nsolutions, and certain types of distinctive dynamical pathways.

In this paper, we contribute to\nbridge this gap by designing Femto-Containers, a new architecture which enables\ncontainerization, virtualization and secure deployment of software modules\nembedded on microcontrollers over low-power networks. As proof-of-concept, we\nimplemented and evaluated Femto-Containers on popular microcontroller\narchitectures (Arm Cortex-M, ESP32 and RISC-V), using eBPF virtualization, and\nRIOT, a common operating system in this space. We show that Femto-Containers\ncan virtualize and isolate multiple software modules, executed concurrently,\nwith very small memory footprint overhead (below 10%) and very small startup\ntime (tens of microseconds) compared to native code execution. We show that\nFemto-Containers can satisfy the constraints of both low-level debug logic\ninserted in a hot code path, and high-level business logic coded in a variety\nof common programming languages. Compared to prior work, Femto-Containers thus\noffer an attractive trade-off in terms of memory footprint, energy consumption,\nagility and security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 10:54:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 16:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

The, perhaps, more classical one is\noutlier detection or novelty detection, where, for a single input we ask\nwhether it is an outlier, i.e. exceedingly unlikely to have originated from a\nreference distribution. The second, perhaps more recent approach, is to\nconsider a larger number of inputs and compare its distribution to a reference\ndistribution (e.g. sampled during testing).

In some cases,\nfor example, for the extraction of key information from semi-structured\ndocuments, such as invoice-documents, spatial and formatting information of\ntext are crucial to understand the contextual meaning. Convolutional neural\nnetworks are already common in computer vision models to process and extract\nrelationships in multidimensional data. Therefore, natural language processing\nmodels have already been combined with computer vision models in the past, to\nbenefit from e.g. positional information and to improve performance of these\nkey information extraction models.

An existing information extraction model \"Chargrid\"\n(Katti et al., 2019) was reconstructed and the impact of a bounding box\nregression decoder, as well as the impact of an NLP pre-processing step was\nevaluated for information extraction from documents. The results have shown\nthat NLP based pre-processing is beneficial for model performance.
