Existing Ref-SR methods mostly\nrely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference\nimages to compensate for the information loss in input images. However,\nperforming local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and\nreference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the\nresolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose\nC2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing\ntransformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a\ncontrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust\ncorrespondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution\ngap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills\nknowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR\nmatching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the\npotential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the\nperformance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the\nWebly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly\noutperforms state of the arts by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.\nNotably, it also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as\nrobustness across large scale and rotation transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 16:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

In this survey, we present a brief\nintroduction and history, a survey of previous work and propose directions of\nfuture study. We will begin by looking at the history of optimal transport and\nintroducing the founders of this field. We then give a brief glance into the\nalgorithms related to OT. Then, we will follow up with a mathematical\nformulation and the prerequisites to understand OT. These include Kantorovich\nduality, entropic regularization, KL Divergence, and Wassertein barycenters.\nSince OT is a computationally expensive problem, we then introduce the\nentropy-regularized version of computing optimal mappings, which allowed OT\nproblems to become applicable in a wide range of machine learning problems. In\nfact, the methods generated from OT theory are competitive with the current\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Of the recommendations presented, three main\nproblems are fundamental to allow OT to become widely applicable but rely\nstrongly on its mathematical formulation and thus are hardest to answer.

This enables the\nrendering of novel views of the object under arbitrary environment lighting and\nediting of the object's material properties. The key to our approach, which we\ncall Neural Radiance Factorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric\ngeometry of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020]\nrepresentation of the object into a surface representation and then jointly\nrefine the geometry while solving for the spatially-varying reflectance and\nenvironment lighting. Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of\nsurface normals, light visibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance\nDistribution Functions (BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a\nre-rendering loss, simple smoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior\nlearned from real-world BRDF measurements. By explicitly modeling light\nvisibility, NeRFactor is able to separate shadows from albedo and synthesize\nrealistic soft or hard shadows under arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor\nis able to recover convincing 3D models for free-viewpoint relighting in this\nchallenging and underconstrained capture setup for both synthetic and real\nscenes. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that NeRFactor\noutperforms classic and deep learning-based state of the art across various\ntasks.

Here, we present experimental work on traversing steep,\ngranular slopes with the dynamically walking quadrupedal robot SpaceBok. To\nadapt to the challenging environment, we developed passive-adaptive planar feet\nand optimized grouser pads to reduce sinkage and increase traction on planar\nand inclined granular soil. Single-foot experiments revealed that a large\nsurface area of 110cm2 per foot reduces sinkage to an acceptable level even on\nhighly collapsible soil (ES-1). Implementing several 12mm grouser blades\nincreases traction by 22% to 66% on granular media compared to grouser-less\ndesigns. Together with a terrain-adapting walking controller, we validate - for\nthe first time - static and dynamic locomotion on Mars analog slopes of up to\n25{\\deg}(the maximum of the testbed). We evaluated the performance between\npoint- and planar feet and static and dynamic gaits regarding stability\n(safety), velocity, and energy consumption.

Commonly\nused Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from critical slowing down\nin this limit, restricting the precision of continuum extrapolations. Further\ndifficulties arise when measuring correlation functions of operators widely\nseparated in spacetime: for most correlation functions, an exponentially severe\nsignal-to-noise problem is encountered as the operators are taken to be widely\nseparated. This dissertation details two new techniques to address these\nissues. First, we define a novel MCMC algorithm based on generative flow-based\nmodels. Such models utilize machine learning methods to describe efficient\napproximate samplers for distributions of interest. Independently drawn\nflow-based samples are then used as proposals in an asymptotically exact\nMetropolis-Hastings Markov chain. We address incorporating symmetries of\ninterest, including translational and gauge symmetries. We secondly introduce\nan approach to \"deform\" Monte Carlo estimators based on contour deformations\napplied to the domain of the path integral. The deformed estimators associated\nwith an observable give equivalent unbiased measurements of that observable,\nbut generically have different variances. We define families of deformed\nmanifolds for lattice gauge theories and introduce methods to efficiently\noptimize the choice of manifold (the \"observifold\"), minimizing the deformed\nobservable variance. Finally, we demonstrate that flow-based MCMC can mitigate\ncritical slowing down and observifolds can exponentially reduce variance in\nproof-of-principle applications to scalar $\\phi^4$ theory and $\\mathrm{U}(1)$\nand $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 16:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

However, consumer\nacceptance of load coordination schemes depends on ensuring quality of service\n(QoS), which embodies device-level constraints. Since each device has its own\ninternal energy state, the effect of QoS on the fleet can be cast as fleet-wide\nenergy limits within which the aggregate \"state of charge\" (SoC) must be\nactively maintained. This requires coordination of DERs that is cognizant of\nthe SoC, responsive to grid conditions, and depends on fast communication\nnetworks. To that effect, this paper presents a novel real-time grid-and-DER\nco-simulation platform for validating advanced DER coordination schemes and\ncharacterizing the capability of such a DER fleet. In particular, we present\nhow the co-simulation platform is suitable for: i) testing real-time\nperformance of a large fleet of DERs in delivering advanced grid services,\nincluding frequency regulation; ii) online state estimation to characterize the\ncorresponding SoC of a large fleet of DERs; and iii) incorporating practical\nlimitations of DERs and communications and analyzing the effects on fleet-wide\nperformance. To illustrate these benefits of the presented grid-DER\nco-simulation platform, we employ the advanced DER coordination scheme called\npacketized energy management (PEM), which is a novel device-driven,\nasynchronous, and randomizing control paradigm for DERs. A fleet of thousands\nof PEM-enabled DERs are then added to a realistic and dynamical model of the\nVermont transmission system to complete validation of the co-simulation\nplatform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 17:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

We model an agents update to its belief of the\nworld based on individual observations using a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), a mainstream artificial intelligence (AI) model of\nhow to act rationally according to beliefs formed through observation. On top\nof that, we model pointing as a communicative act between agents who have a\nmutual understanding that the pointed observation must be relevant and\ninterpretable. Our model measures relevance by defining a Smithian Value of\nInformation (SVI) as the utility improvement of the POMDP agent before and\nafter receiving the pointing. We model that agents calculate SVI by using the\ncognitive theory of Smithian helping as a principle of coordinating separate\nbeliefs for action prediction and action evaluation. We then import SVI into\nrational speech act (RSA) as the utility function of an utterance. These lead\nus to a pragmatic model of pointing allowing for contextually flexible\ninterpretations. We demonstrate the power of our Smithian pointing model by\nextending the Wumpus world, a classic AI task where a hunter hunts a monster\nwith only partial observability of the world. We add another agent as a guide\nwho can only help by marking an observation already perceived by the hunter\nwith a pointing or not, without providing new observations or offering any\ninstrumental help.

However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence modeling\nproblem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a\nsequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider\nwhether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other\ndomains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide effective\nsolutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be tackled with\nthe tools of sequence modeling, using a Transformer architecture to model\ndistributions over trajectories and repurposing beam search as a planning\nalgorithm.

One\npossible origin for the excess is accretion onto the newly unshrouded black\nhole (BH) remnant. While fall-back of the bound dynamical ejecta is\ninsufficient to generate the excess luminosity, L_X ~ 5e38 erg/s, fall-back\nfrom the disk wind ejecta-due to their larger mass and lower velocity-remains a\nviable possibility. We present hydrodynamic alpha-viscosity simulations of the\npost-merger disk evolution which extend to an unprecedently long timescale t ~\n35 s post-merger, as necessary to capture the end of photodissociation and the\nasymptotic evolution into the radiatively inefficient regime. Due to\ninefficient neutrino cooling, the BH accretion rate decays rapidly at late\ntimes (Mdot_BH ~ t^(-\\beta_BH), where \\beta_BH ~ 2.4-2.8), seemingly\nincompatible with generating the late-time excess.

By the present epoch, the fall-back rate has become\nsub-Eddington and the disk can again accrete efficiently, i.e. Mdot_BH ~\nMdot_fb, this time as a result of photon cooling instead of neutrino cooling.\nThe predicted X-ray accretion luminosity at the present epoch is L_X ~ 0.1\nMdot_BH c^2 ~ (2-70)e38 erg/s for beta_FB ~ 1.43-1.66, thus supporting (with\ncaveats) an accretion-powered origin for the X-ray excess in GW170817.

These dips have been attributed to dusty warps that form in\nthe inner part of the disk. Our goal is to derive the properties of dipper\nstars in Taurus to assess the physical mechanisms that induce dipper light\ncurves. We used the light curves of K2 C4 and C13 to select a dipper sample\namong 179 members and possible members of the Taurus star-forming region based\non the light-curve morphology. We studied the periodicities by combining\nperiodograms with wavelet analysis and derived the stellar parameters from the\nphotometry. We also studied the morphology of the photometric dips. We find a\ndipper occurrence of ~30% in disk-bearing stars observed with K2 that were\nidentified visually by us. This represents a lower limit to their true\noccurrence. About half of the dippers are aperiodic, and most of these are\ndominated by another type of variability. The chosen sample is of late spectral\ntype (K/M), low mass and moderate mass accretion rates and has periods of a few\ndays. We observed a transient dipper over a few rotation cycles and a dipper\nwith a changing period. The structure of the dips can be complex and varies\nstrongly over timescales of down to one stellar rotation. The corotation radii\nare located at a few stellar radii, and the temperatures at corotation allow\ndust survival. Many of the systems are seen at moderate to high inclination. We\nfind that the angular extension of the dusty structure producing the dips is\ncorrelated with the stellar period. Magnetospheric accretion, which causes an\naccretion column and its base to occult the star, can explain most of the\nobserved light curves. Although compatible with the model, many of the stellar\ninclination angles are moderate and do not exclude mechanisms other than the\noccultation by an inner disk warp to account for dipper light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 18:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

From the comparison between the\ndynamical time of the discovered Hi shell and the analysis of the ages of\nstellar populations in these clusters, we conclude that the expansion of the\nshell could have triggered in the past the formation of stars in some of them.\nWe point out that in order to find physical evidence supporting a genetic\nconnection between stellar clusters, it is necessary not only to study the\nindividual clusters and their stellar populations, but also to investigate\ntheir surrounding ISM at a large spatial scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 19:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

This optimization pattern can lead to early stopping\nprocedures to stop training before the second convergence and consequently\nselect a suboptimal set of parameters for the network, with worse performance\nduring inference. In this work, in addition to confirming that double descent\noccurs with small datasets and noisy labels as evidenced by others, we show\nthat noisy labels must be present both in the training and generalization sets\nto observe a double descent pattern. We also show that the learning rate has an\ninfluence on double descent, and study how different optimizers and optimizer\nparameters influence the apparition of double descent. Finally, we show that\nincreasing the learning rate can create an aliasing effect that masks the\ndouble descent pattern without suppressing it.

While\nperformance drops for all approaches, we surprisingly still see gains of up to\n$17.69\\%$ accuracy for part-of-speech tagging and $6.29$ F1 for NER on average\nover all languages as compared to XLM-R. Another unexpected finding is that\ncontinued pretraining, the simplest approach, performs best. Finally, we\nperform a case study to disentangle the effects of domain and size and to shed\nlight on the influence of the finetuning source language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 20:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

Here we address this problem using a probabilistic discriminative\nmodel implemented as a 5-component mixture density network comprised of a deep\nneural network that predicts the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. We\nshow that discriminative regression models such as deep neural networks and\nGaussian process regression perform poorly on aliased data, only making\naccurate predictions when the sources of aliasing are removed. In contrast, the\nmixture density network identifies aliased data with improved prediction\naccuracy. The uncertain predictions of the model form patterns that are\nconsistent with the various sources of perceptual ambiguity.

One unique\ncharacteristic of the proposed method is that it uses time-derivative damage\naccumulation model compared to the classical cycle-based damage accumulation\nmodel. Thus, damage under arbitrary random loading can be directly obtained\nusing time-domain integration without cycle counting (e.g., rain-flow cycle\ncounting method in classical fatigue analysis). First, a brief review of\nexisting models is given focusing on their applicability to\nuniaxial/multiaxial, constant/random, and high cycle fatigue/low cycle fatigue\nloading regimes. It is observed that most existing models are only applicable\nto certain loading conditions and many of them are not applicable/validated\nunder random loadings. Next, a time-derivative damage accumulation model under\nuniaxial random loading is proposed. The proposed damage function is inspired\nby a time-domain fatigue crack growth model. The fatigue life is obtained by\nintegrating the damage function following random energy loading histories.\nFollowing this, an equivalent energy concept for general multiaxial loading\nconditions is used to convert the random multiaxial loading to an equivalent\nrandom uniaxial loading, where the time-derivative damage model can be used.\nFinally, the proposed model is validated with extensive experimental data from\nopen literature and in-house testing data under various constant and random\nspectrum loadings.

It is essential for reaching high acceptance and usage rates of\nrobotic technologies in society, as well as for enabling effective human-robot\nteaming. Researchers have been trying to model the development of trust in\nrobots to improve the overall rapport between humans and robots. Unfortunately,\nthe miscalibration of trust in automation is a common issue that jeopardizes\nthe effectiveness of automation use. It happens when a user's trust levels are\nnot appropriate to the capabilities of the automation being used. Users can be:\nunder-trusting the automation -- when they do not use the functionalities that\nthe machine can perform correctly because of a lack of trust; or over-trusting\nthe automation -- when, due to an excess of trust, they use the machine in\nsituations where its capabilities are not adequate. The main objective of this\nwork is to examine driver's trust development in the ADS. We aim to model how\nrisk factors (e.g.: false alarms and misses from the ADS) and the short-term\ninteractions associated with these risk factors influence the dynamics of\ndrivers' trust in the ADS. The driving context facilitates the instrumentation\nto measure trusting behaviors, such as drivers' eye movements and usage time of\nthe automated features. Our findings indicate that a reliable characterization\nof drivers' trusting behaviors and a consequent estimation of trust levels is\npossible.

We exemplify the new methodology by exploring twisted\nbilayer graphene (tBLG); its moire periodicity is associated with giant\nunit-cells hosting correlated electrons in flat bands. The resulting behavior\nof tBLG is governed by the coupling between the weakly and strongly correlated\nelectrons in individual monolayers, controlled by twist or applied pressure.\nHere we study the latter scenario.

In the context of economic deregulation, a MaaS system consists\nof a typical two-sided market, where travelers and transportation service\nproviders (TSPs) are two groups of agents interacting with each other through a\nMaaS platform. In this study, we propose a modeling and optimization framework\nfor the regulation of two-sided MaaS markets. We consider a name-your-own-price\n(NYOP)-auction mechanism where travelers submit purchase-bids to accommodate\ntheir travel demand via MaaS platform, and TSPs submit sell-bids to supply\nmobility resources for the MaaS platform in exchange for payments. We cast this\nproblem as a single-leader multi-follower game (SLMFG) where the leader is the\nMaaS regulator and two groups of follower problems represent the travelers and\nthe TSPs. The MaaS regulator aims to maximize its profits by optimizing\noperations. In response to the MaaS regulator's decisions, travelers (resp.\nTSPs) adjust their participation level in the MaaS platform to minimize their\ntravel costs (resp. maximize their profits). We analyze cross-group network\neffects in the MaaS market, and formulate SLMFGs without and with network\neffects leading to mixed-integer linear bilevel programming and mixed-integer\nquadratic bilevel programming problems, respectively.

When fitting data to\nextract the 21-cm signal, a single time-averaged spectrum or independent\nmulti-spectrum fits may be able to compensate for the bias imposed by the\nhorizon.

A significant decrease in\nsignal uncertainty can be achieved by performing multi-spectrum fits in which\nthe spectra are modeled simultaneously with common parameters.

Based on our experimental and theoretical results, we\nsuggest that interpreting LLL as a sandpile model may help understand much of\nits mysterious behavior. In the language of physics, our work presents evidence\nthat LLL and certain 1-d sandpile models with simpler toppling rules belong to\nthe same universality class.\n  This paper consists of three parts. First, we introduce sandpile models whose\nstatistics imitate those of LLL with compelling accuracy, which leads to the\nidea that there must exist a meaningful connection between the two. Indeed, on\nthose sandpile models, we are able to prove the analogues of some of the most\ndesired statements for LLL, such as the existence of the gap between the\ntheoretical and the experimental RHF bounds.

The history of this theory is replete with dubious interpretations\nand controversies, and yet a knowledge of its predictions, however, contributed\nto the amazing technological revolution of the last hundred years. In its very\nbeginning Einstein pointed out that there was something missing, due to\ncontradictions with the relativity theory. So, even though Quantum Mechanics\nexplains all the nanoscale physical phenomena, there were many attempts to find\na way to \"complete\" it, e.g. hidden-variable theories. In this paper, we\ndiscuss some of those enigmas, with special attention to the concepts of\nphysical reality imposed by quantum mechanics, the role of the observer,\nprediction limits, a definition of collapse, and how to deal with correlated\nstates (the basic strategy for quantum computers and quantum teleportation).\nThat discussion is carried out within the framework of accepting that there is\nin fact nothing important missing, rather we are just restricted by the\nlimitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The mysteries are thus explained by a\nproper interpretation of those limitations, which is achieved by introducing\ntwo interpretation rules within the Copenhagen paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 22:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 21:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 22:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 21:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Then, we present the linearized dynamics and modal analysis equations\nwith and without constraints. The developed approach is capable of conducting\nthe following comprehensive dynamics studies for any tensegrity structures\naccurately: 1. Performing rigid body dynamics with acceptable errors, which is\nachieved by setting relatively high stiffness for bars in the simulation. 2.\nSimulating FEM dynamics accurately, where bars and strings can have elastic or\nplastic deformations. 3. Dealing with various kinds of boundary conditions, for\nexample, fixing or applying static/dynamic loads at any nodes in any direction\n(i.e., gravitational force, some specified forces, or arbitrary seismic\nvibrations). 4.

Recent\nwork introduced ranged symbolic execution to distribute the symbolic execution\ntask among different workers with minimal communication overhead using test\ninputs. However, each worker was restricted to perform only a depth-first\nsearch. This paper introduces a new approach to ranging, called test-depth\npartitioning, that allows the workers to employ different search strategies\nwithout compromising the completeness of the overall search. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach provides a more flexible ranging\nsolution for distributed symbolic execution. The core idea behind test-depth\npartitioning is to use a test-depth pair to define a region in the execution\nspace. Such a pair represents a partial path or a prefix, and it obviates the\nneed for complete tests to determine boundaries as was the case in the previous\nranging scheme. Moreover, different workers have the freedom to select the\nsearch strategy of choice without affecting the functioning of the overall\nsystem. Test-depth partitioning is implemented using KLEE, a well-known\nsymbolic execution tool.

Biological processes use different strategies\nto store memory. In the olfactory cortex, synaptic connections form when\nstimulated by an odor, and establish distributed memory that can be retrieved\nupon re-exposure. In contrast, the immune system encodes specialized memory by\ndiverse receptors that recognize a multitude of evolving pathogens. Despite the\nmechanistic differences between the olfactory and the immune memory, these\nsystems can still be viewed as different information encoding strategies. Here,\nwe present a theoretical framework with artificial neural networks to\ncharacterize optimal memory strategies for both static and dynamic (evolving)\npatterns. Our approach is a generalization of the energy-based Hopfield model\nin which memory is stored as a network's energy minima. We find that while\nclassical Hopfield networks with distributed memory can efficiently encode a\nmemory of static patterns, they are inadequate against evolving patterns. To\nfollow an evolving pattern, we show that a distributed network should use a\nhigher learning rate, which in turn, can distort the energy landscape\nassociated with the stored memory attractors. Specifically, narrow connecting\npaths emerge between memory attractors, leading to misclassification of\nevolving patterns. We demonstrate that compartmentalized networks with\nspecialized subnetworks are the optimal solutions to memory storage for\nevolving patterns. We postulate that evolution of pathogens may be the reason\nfor the immune system to encoded a focused memory, in contrast to the\ndistributed memory used in the olfactory cortex that interacts with mixtures of\nstatic odors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 00:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

We prove that\nhaving a few of such similarity queries enables one to get a polynomial-time\napproximation algorithm to an otherwise conjecturally NP-hard problem. In\nparticular, we provide algorithms for fuzzy clustering in this setting that\nasks $O(\\mathsf{poly}(k)\\log n)$ similarity queries and run with\npolynomial-time-complexity, where $n$ is the number of items. The fuzzy\n$k$-means objective is nonconvex, with $k$-means as a special case, and is\nequivalent to some other generic nonconvex problem such as non-negative matrix\nfactorization. The ubiquitous Lloyd-type algorithms (or alternating\nminimization algorithms) can get stuck at a local minimum. Our results show\nthat by making a few similarity queries, the problem becomes easier to solve.\nFinally, we test our algorithms over real-world datasets, showing their\neffectiveness in real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 02:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 03:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

In\nthis paper, we study the combined behavior of two chiral swimmers using the\nwell-known squirmer model taking into account chiral asymmetries. In contrast\nto the simple squirmer model, which has an axisymmetric distribution of slip\nvelocity, the chiral squirmer has additional asymmetries in the surface slip,\nwhich contribute to both translations and rotations of the motion. As a result,\nswimming trajectories can become helical and chiral asymmetries arise in the ow\npatterns. We study the swimming trajectories of a pair of chiral squirmers that\ninteract hydrodynamically. This interaction can lead to attraction and\nrepulsion, and in some cases even to bounded states where the swimmers continue\nto periodically orbit around a common average trajectory. Such bound states are\na signature of the chiral nature of the swimmers.

After a much\nlonger (about 20 times) evolution time, initial states with no \"long-range\"\ncorrelations relax to a steady state, where time-symmetry breaking can be\nunambiguously defined. Quantum revivals also eventually occur. This long-time\nbehavior can be understood via the many-body Floquet quasi-eigenenergy spectrum\nof the two-mode model. A symmetry-breaking edge for DTC formation appears in\nthe spectrum for strong enough interaction, where all quasi-eigenstates below\nthe edge are symmetry-breaking while those above the edge are symmetric. The\nlate-time steady state's time-translational symmetry depends solely on whether\nthe initial energy is above or below the symmetry-breaking edge. A phase\ndiagram showing regions of symmetry-broken and symmetric phases for differing\ninitial energies and interaction strengths is presented.

For its early\ndetection, colposcopic images of the cervix are used for searching for possible\ninjuries or abnormalities. An inherent characteristic of these images is the\npresence of specular reflections (brightness) that make it difficult to observe\nsome regions, which might imply misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new strategy\nbased on neural networks is introduced for eliminating specular reflections and\nestimating the unobserved anatomical cervix portion under the bright zones. For\novercoming the fact that the ground truth corresponding to the specular\nreflection regions is always unknown, the new strategy proposes the supervised\ntraining of a neural network to learn how to restore any hidden regions of\ncolposcopic images. Once the specular reflections are identified, they are\nremoved from the image, and the previously trained network is used to fulfill\nthese deleted areas. The quality of the processed images was evaluated\nquantitatively and qualitatively. In 21 of the 22 evaluated images, the\ndetected specular reflections were eliminated, whereas, in the remaining one,\nthese reflections were almost completely eliminated. The distribution of the\ncolors and the content of the restored images are similar to those of the\noriginals. The evaluation carried out by a specialist in Cervix Pathology\nconcluded that, after eliminating the specular reflections, the anatomical and\nphysiological elements of the cervix are observable in the restored images,\nwhich facilitates the medical diagnosis of cervical pathologies.

A common practice in building compact\non-device recommender systems is to compress their embeddings which are\nnormally the cause of excessive parameterization. However, despite the vast\nvariety of devices and their associated memory constraints, existing\nmemory-efficient recommender systems are only specialized for a fixed memory\nbudget in every design and training life cycle, where a new model has to be\nretrained to obtain the optimal performance while adapting to a smaller/larger\nmemory budget. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight recommendation\nparadigm that allows a well-trained recommender to be customized for arbitrary\ndevice-specific memory constraints without retraining. The core idea is to\ncompose elastic embeddings for each item, where an elastic embedding is the\nconcatenation of a set of embedding blocks that are carefully chosen by an\nautomated search function. Correspondingly, we propose an innovative approach,\nnamely recommendation with universally learned elastic embeddings (RULE). To\nensure the expressiveness of all candidate embedding blocks, RULE enforces a\ndiversity-driven regularization when learning different embedding blocks. Then,\na performance estimator-based evolutionary search function is designed,\nallowing for efficient specialization of elastic embeddings under any memory\nconstraint for on-device recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets reveal the superior performance of RULE under tight memory budgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 02:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent\nadvancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to\nlearn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the\nrelationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in\nnew composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical\nCorrelation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that\nseamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii)\nlearning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in\nmulti-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential\ndomains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for\nprediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69\n3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear\ncomposition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training\ndata is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the\ndiscovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results\nfrom the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property\ncorrelation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The\nbest performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T))\nwherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of\nstates data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical\nabsorption from composition.

However, evaluating the consistency capacity of a chatbot is still\nchallenging. Employing human judges to interact with chatbots on purpose to\ncheck their capacities is costly and low-efficient, and difficult to get rid of\nsubjective bias. In this paper, we propose the Addressing Inquiries about\nHistory (AIH), an efficient and practical framework for the consistency\nevaluation. At the conversation stage, AIH attempts to address appropriate\ninquiries about the dialogue history to induce the chatbot to redeclare the\nhistorical facts or opinions. We carry out the conversation between chatbots,\nwhich is more efficient than the human-bot interaction and can also alleviate\nthe subjective bias. In this way, we manage to rapidly obtain a dialog session\nthat contains responses with high contradiction possibilities. At the\ncontradiction recognition stage, we can either employ human judges or a natural\nlanguage inference (NLI) model to recognize whether the answers to the\ninquiries are contradictory with history. Finally, we are able to rank chatbots\naccording to the contradiction statistics. Experiments on open-domain chatbots\nshow that our approach can efficiently and reliably assess the consistency\ncapacity of chatbots and achieve a high ranking correlation with the human\nevaluation. We release the framework and hope to help improve the consistency\ncapacity of chatbots. \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/ictnlp/AIH}}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 03:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

The spaceborne nature of the experimental setups leads to a\ndegree of subtlety regarding the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise.\nThe cancellation of the latter is accomplished through the time-delay\ninterferometry technique. Moreover, to eventually achieve the desired noise\nlevel, the phase fluctuations of the onboard ultra-stable oscillator must also\nbe suppressed. This can be fulfilled by introducing sideband signals which, in\nturn, give rise to an improved cancellation scheme accounting for the\nclock-jitter noise. Nonetheless, for certain Sagnac-type interferometry\nlayouts, it can be shown that resultant residual clock noise found in the\nliterature can be further improved.

It is shown that for specific Sagnac combinations, the residual\nnoise diminishes significantly to attain the experimentally acceptable\nsensitivity level. Moreover, we argue that the derived combination, in addition\nto the existing ones in the literature, furnishes a general-purpose\ncancellation scheme that serves for arbitrary time-delay interferometry\ncombinations.

Specifically, we find that an external attack robot, who has only\npartial observation over MRNs while not knowing the system dynamics or access,\ncan learn the interaction rules from observations and utilize them to replace a\ntarget robot, destroying the cooperation performance of MRNs. We call this\nnovel attack as sneak, which endows the attacker with the intelligence of\nlearning knowledge and is hard to be tackled by traditional defense techniques.\nThe key insight is to separately reveal the internal interaction structure\nwithin robots and the external interaction mechanism with the environment, from\nthe coupled state evolution influenced by the model-unknown rules and\nunobservable part of the MRN. To address this issue, we first provide general\ninteraction process modeling and prove the learnability of the interaction\nrules. Then, with the learned rules, we design an Evaluate-Cut-Restore (ECR)\nattack strategy considering the partial interaction structure and geometric\npattern. We also establish the sufficient conditions for a successful sneak\nwith maximum control impacts over the MRN. Extensive simulations illustrate the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of the proposed attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 03:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

However, PLMs are\nnotorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life\napplications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this\nproblem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller\nstudent over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key\ncomponents, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial\nto the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage\nprogressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the\nthree components gradually from general level to task-specific level.\nSpecifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with\nguidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss.\nThen, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained\nteacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts\ntraining data from general data to task-specific data. In the end,\nTask-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and\nHard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In\nparticular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over\n98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark,\nsurpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of\nparameters. Moreover, ERNIE-Tiny achieves a new compression SOTA on five\nChinese NLP tasks, outperforming BERT base by 0.4% accuracy with 7.5x fewer\nparameters and9.4x faster inference speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 04:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

It\nis challenging if not impossible to provide AU annotations for large numbers of\nfacial images. Fortunately, AUs appear on all facial images, whether manually\nlabeled or not, satisfy the underlying anatomic mechanisms and human behavioral\nhabits. In this paper, we propose a deep semi-supervised framework for facial\naction unit recognition from partially AU-labeled facial images. Specifically,\nthe proposed deep semi-supervised AU recognition approach consists of a deep\nrecognition network and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network R\nlearns facial representations from large-scale facial images and AU classifiers\nfrom limited ground truth AU labels. The discriminator D is introduced to\nenforce statistical similarity between the AU distribution inherent in ground\ntruth AU labels and the distribution of the predicted AU labels from labeled\nand unlabeled facial images. The deep recognition network aims to minimize\nrecognition loss from the labeled facial images, to faithfully represent\ninherent AU distribution for both labeled and unlabeled facial images, and to\nconfuse the discriminator. During training, the deep recognition network R and\nthe discriminator D are optimized alternately. Thus, the inherent AU\ndistributions caused by underlying anatomic mechanisms are leveraged to\nconstruct better feature representations and AU classifiers from partially\nAU-labeled data during training. Experiments on two benchmark databases\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach successfully captures AU distributions\nthrough adversarial learning and outperforms state-of-the-art AU recognition\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 04:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

They combine advantages of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) with\nthose of neural networks (NNs). Crucially, however, they are tractable\nprobabilistic models, supporting efficient and exact computation of many\nprobabilistic inference queries, such as marginals and MAP. Further, since PCs\nare structured computation graphs, they can take advantage of\ndeep-learning-style parameter updates, which greatly improves their\nscalability. However, this innovation also makes PCs prone to overfitting,\nwhich has been observed in many standard benchmarks. Despite the existence of\nabundant regularization techniques for both PGMs and NNs, they are not\neffective enough when applied to PCs. Instead, we re-think regularization for\nPCs and propose two intuitive techniques, data softening and entropy\nregularization, that both take advantage of PCs' tractability and still have an\nefficient implementation as a computation graph. Specifically, data softening\nprovides a principled way to add uncertainty in datasets in closed form, which\nimplicitly regularizes PC parameters. To learn parameters from a softened\ndataset, PCs only need linear time by virtue of their tractability. In entropy\nregularization, the exact entropy of the distribution encoded by a PC can be\nregularized directly, which is again infeasible for most other density\nestimation models.

In this paper, we study a new\nIRS-aided high-mobility communication system by employing the intelligent\nrefracting surface with a high-speed vehicle to aid its passenger's\ncommunication with a remote base station (BS). Due to the environment's random\nscattering and vehicle's high mobility, a rapidly time-varying channel is\ntypically resulted between the static BS and fast-moving IRS/user, which\nrenders the channel estimation for IRS with a large number of elements more\nchallenging. In order to reap the high IRS passive beamforming gain with low\nchannel training overhead, we propose a new and efficient transmission protocol\nto achieve both IRS channel estimation and refraction optimization for data\ntransmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the\nIRS and user both moving at the same high speed as well as the line-of-sight\n(LoS) dominant channel between the BS and IRS, the user first estimates the LoS\ncomponent of the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel, based on which IRS passive\nrefraction is designed to maximize the corresponding IRS-refracted channel\ngain. Then, the user estimates the resultant IRS-refracted channel as well as\nthe non-IRS-refracted channel for setting an additional common phase shift at\nall IRS refracting elements so as to align these two channels for maximizing\nthe overall channel gain for data transmission.

This flux can be\nexplained with electrons and positrons injected from these sources and their\ninverse Compton Scattering on the interstellar radiation fields. So far the\nsize of such $\\gamma-$ray halos has been interpreted as the result of the\ndiffusion coefficient around the sources being about two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the average in the Galaxy. However, this conclusion is driven by\nthe assumption that particles propagate diffusively right away after the\ninjection without taking into account the ballistic propagation. The\npropagation of cosmic-ray leptons in the proximity of the Geminga, Monogem and\nPSR J0622+3749 pulsars is examined here considering the transition from the\nquasi-ballistic, valid for the most recently injected particles, to the\ndiffusive transport regime. For typical interstellar values of the diffusion\ncoefficient, the quasi-ballistic regime dominates the lepton distribution up to\ndistances of a few tens of parsec from the pulsar for particle energies above\n$\\sim 10$ TeV. In this regime the resulting $\\gamma-$ray source tends to be\nrather compact, despite particles travel a long distance. Indeed, for larger\nvalues of the diffusion coefficient, particles propagate ballistically up to\nlarger distances with the result of a more point-like $\\gamma-$ray source.

However, the advantages of vision Transformers also\ncome with a price: Self-attention, the core part of Transformer, has a\nquadratic complexity to the input sequence length. This leads to a dramatic\nincrease of computation and memory cost with the increase of sequence length,\nthus introducing difficulties when applying Transformers to the vision tasks\nthat require dense predictions based on high-resolution feature maps. In this\npaper, we propose a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer\n(GG-Transformer), to address the aforementioned issues. It is motivated by the\nGlance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural\nscenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and\nlocal context. In GG-Transformer, the Glance and Gaze behavior is realized by\ntwo parallel branches: The Glance branch is achieved by performing\nself-attention on the adaptively-dilated partitions of the input, which leads\nto a linear complexity while still enjoying a global receptive field; The Gaze\nbranch is implemented by a simple depth-wise convolutional layer, which\ncompensates local image context to the features obtained by the Glance\nmechanism.

At the same time, in the wide field of photonic crystals, this\nidea still remains almost untouched, and only some particular problems were\nconsidered. One of the reasons is the computational difficulty of the accurate\nconsideration of Moir\\'e superlattices that appear due to the superimposition\nof misaligned lattices. Indeed, the unit cell of the complex lattice is\ntypically much larger than the original crystals and requires much more\ncomputational resources for the computations.

In the developed numerical scheme, we utilize\nthe fact that each sublattice is only 1D-periodic and therefore simpler than\nthe resulting 2D superlattice, as well as the fact that even a small gap\nbetween the lattices filters out high Fourier harmonics due to their evanescent\norigin. This accelerates the computations from 1 up to 3 and more orders of\nmagnitude for typical structures depending on the number of harmonics.

Thereby, many popular 2D CNN\narchitectures can be easily adapted to process 3D meshes.

We selected a static,\nspherically symmetric electrically charged black hole with an additional scalar\n'hair' for our analysis. The scalar 'hair' is sourced by a scalar field,\nconformally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The scalar field can\nsurvive even in the absence of the black hole's electric charge and is\ncharacterized as a 'primary hair'. This scalar field changes the gravitational\nconstant, and hence modifies the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Missner) mass of the black\nhole. The scalar field's strength is determined by a scalar 'charge' that\nmanifests itself as an additive correction to the square of the electric charge\nin the standard Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m metric. This seemingly simple\nmodification leads to nontrivial physical implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 07:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

We propose a theoretical\nmodel for the curtain in which particle trajectories result from the\ncomposition of two motions: a horizontal component corresponding to the\nevolving axial velocity profile of an axisymmetric viscous jet, and a vertical\ncomponent due to free fall under gravity. The model predicts well the\ntrajectory of the primary jet, but somewhat less well that of the secondary\njet. We suggest that the remaining discrepancy may be explained by surface\ntension-driven (Taylor-Culick) retraction of the secondary jet.

But words can be ordered and among the many\npossible orders a very natural one is the co-lexicographic one. Such\nnaturalness stems from the fact that it suggests a transfer of the order from\nwords to the automaton's states. In a number of papers automata admitting a\ntotal ordering of states coherent with the ordering of the set of words\nreaching them have been proposed. Such class of ordered automata -- the Wheeler\nautomata -- turned out to be efficiently stored/searched using an index.\nUnfortunately not all automata can be totally ordered as previously outlined.\nHowever, automata can always be partially ordered and an intrinsic measure of\ntheir complexity can be defined and effectively determined, as the minimum\nwidth of one of their admissible partial orders. As shown in previous works,\nthis new concept of width of an automaton has useful consequences in the fields\nof graph compression, indexing data structures, and automata theory. In this\npaper we prove that a canonical, minimum-width, partially-ordered automaton\naccepting a language L -- dubbed the Hasse automaton H of L -- can be\nexhibited. H provides, in a precise sense, the best possible way to (partially)\norder the states of any automaton accepting L, as long as we want to maintain\nan operational link with the (co-lexicographic) order of Pf(L(A)). Using H we\nprove that the width of the language can be effectively computed from the\nminimum automaton recognizing the language. Finally, we explore the\nrelationship between two (often conflicting) objectives: minimizing the width\nand minimizing the number of states of an automaton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 07:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

The conventional training paradigm is to\nlearn to make predictions on query images conditioned on the features from\nsupport images. Previous methods only utilized the semantic-level prototypes of\nsupport images as conditional information. These methods cannot utilize all\npixel-wise support information for the query predictions, which is however\ncritical for the segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on utilizing\npixel-wise relationships between support and query images to facilitate the\nfew-shot segmentation task. We design a novel Cycle-Consistent TRansformer\n(CyCTR) module to aggregate pixel-wise support features into query ones. CyCTR\nperforms cross-attention between features from different images, i.e. support\nand query images. We observe that there may exist unexpected irrelevant\npixel-level support features. Directly performing cross-attention may aggregate\nthese features from support to query and bias the query features. Thus, we\npropose using a novel cycle-consistent attention mechanism to filter out\npossible harmful support features and encourage query features to attend to the\nmost informative pixels from support images. Experiments on all few-shot\nsegmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CyCTR leads to remarkable\nimprovement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

This bound is\nindependent of the rank $r$ (maximum cardinality of a hyperedge), and is\nessentially best possible due to a recent bit complexity lower bound of\n$\\Omega(nr)$ for hypergraph sparsification.\n  This result is obtained by introducing two new tools. First, we give a new\nproof of spectral concentration bounds for sparsifiers of graphs; it avoids\nlinear-algebraic methods, replacing e.g.~the usual application of the matrix\nBernstein inequality and therefore applies to the (non-linear) hypergraph\nsetting.

Recently, an Approximate Message Passing (AMP)\nalgorithm has been proposed as an alternative estimator with the potential to\nimprove the accuracy of PCA.

To support plethora of use cases Radio Access Technology (RAT)-based\npositioning has been supported by 3GPP since Release 9 of its specifications\nthat featured basic positioning methods based on Cell Identity (CID) and\nEnhanced-CID (E-CID). Since then, multiple positioning techniques and solutions\nare proposed and integrated in to the 3GPP specifications. When it comes to\nevaluating performance of the positioning techniques, achievable accuracy\n(2-Dimensional or 3-Dimensional) has, so far, been the primary metric. With the\nadvent of Release 16 New Radio (NR) positioning, it is possible to configure\nPositioning Reference Signal (PRS) with wide bandwidth that naturally helps\nimproving the positioning accuracy. However, the improvement is evident when\nthe conditions are ideal for positioning. In practice where the conditions are\nnon-ideal and the positioning accuracy is severely impacted, estimating the\nuncertainty in position estimation becomes important and can provide\nsignificant insight on how reliable a position estimation is. In order to\ndetermine the uncertainty in position estimation we resort to Machine Learning\n(ML) techniques that offer ways to determine the uncertainty/reliability of the\npredictions for a trained model. Hence, in this work we propose to combine ML\nmethods such as Gaussian Process (GP) and Random Forest (RF) with RAT-based\npositioning measurements to predict the location of a UE and in the meantime\nalso assess the uncertainty of the estimated position. The results show that\nboth GP and RF not only achieve satisfactory positioning accuracy but also give\na reliable uncertainty assessment of the predicted position of the UE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 09:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

DMB attackers can be friendly in the consensus process of some chains\ncalled mask-chains to enhance trust value, while on other chains called\nkill-chains they engage in destructive behaviors of network. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-chains consensus scheme named as Proof-of-DiscTrust (PoDT) to\ndefend against DMB attacks. Distinctive trust idea (DiscTrust) is introduced to\nevaluate the trust value of each user concerning different chains. A dynamic\nbehaviors prediction scheme is designed to strengthen DiscTrust to prevent\nintensive DMB attackers who maintain high trust by alternately creating true or\nfalse blocks on kill-chains. On this basis, a trusted miners selection\nalgorithm for multi-chains can be achieved at a round of block creation.\nExperimental results show that PoDT is secure against DMB attacks and more\neffective than traditional consensus schemes in multi-chains environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 09:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 03:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Reinforcement\nlearning methods have achieved great success by creating agents that optimize\nengineered reward functions, but which often struggle to learn in sparse-reward\nenvironments, generally require many environmental interactions to perform\nwell, and are typically computationally very expensive. Active inference is a\nmodel-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while\nadhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an\nactive inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected\nfuture. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high\nsample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed\nexploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very\nlight and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable\nperformance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by\nsolving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration\nproperties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves\nperformance.

Both images and text are represented in scene graph levels and\nformulate the retrieval challenge as a scene graph matching challenge. In this\npaper, we introduce the Local and Global Scene Graph Matching (LGSGM) model\nthat enhances the state-of-the-art method by integrating an extra graph\nconvolution network to capture the general information of a graph.\nSpecifically, for a pair of scene graphs of an image and its caption, two\nseparate models are used to learn the features of each graph's nodes and edges.\nThen a Siamese-structure graph convolution model is employed to embed graphs\ninto vector forms. We finally combine the graph-level and the vector-level to\ncalculate the similarity of this image-text pair.

However, it has remained\nelusive as to how to understand and how to tune the SOTs. Here, utilizing the\nsingle layers of chemically disordered Fe$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$, we unveil the\nmechanism of the \"unexpected\" bulk SOTs by studying their dependence on the\nintroduction of a controlled vertical composition gradient and on temperature.\nWe find that the bulk damping like SOT arises from an imbalanced internal spin\ncurrent that is transversely polarized and independent of the magnetization\norientation. The torque can be strong only in the presence of a vertical\ncomposition gradient and the SOT efficiency per electric field is insensitive\nto temperature but changes sign upon reversal of the orientation of the\ncomposition gradient, which are in analogue to behaviors of the strain. From\nthese characteristics we conclude that the imbalanced internal spin current\noriginates from a bulk spin Hall effect and that the associated inversion\nasymmetry that allows for a non-zero net torque is most likely a strain\nnon-uniformity induced by the composition gradient. The fieldlike SOT is a\nrelatively small bulk effect compared to the dampinglike SOT. This work points\nto the possibility of developing low-power single-layer SOT devices by strain\nengineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 12:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

In this work we prove lower bounds for a much more relaxed family of\ndistributed symmetry breaking problems. As a by-product, we obtain improved\nlower bounds for the distributed MIS problem in trees.\n  For a parameter $k$ and an orientation of the edges of a graph $G$, we say\nthat a subset $S$ of the nodes of $G$ is a $k$-outdegree dominating set if $S$\nis a dominating set of $G$ and if in the induced subgraph $G[S]$, every node in\n$S$ has outdegree at most $k$. Note that for $k=0$, this definition coincides\nwith the definition of an MIS. For a given $k$, we consider the problem of\ncomputing a $k$-outdegree dominating set. We show that, even in regular trees\nof degree at most $\\Delta$, in the standard \\LOCAL model, there exists a\nconstant $\\epsilon>0$ such that for $k\\leq \\Delta^\\epsilon$, for the problem of\ncomputing a $k$-outdegree dominating set, any randomized algorithm requires at\nleast $\\Omega(\\min\\{\\log\\Delta,\\sqrt{\\log\\log n}\\})$ rounds and any\ndeterministic algorithm requires at least $\\Omega(\\min\\{\\log\\Delta,\\sqrt{\\log\nn}\\})$ rounds.\n  The proof of our lower bounds is based on the recently highly successful\nround elimination technique. We provide a novel way to do simplifications for\nround elimination, which we expect to be of independent interest. Our new proof\nis considerably simpler than the lower bound proof in [FOCS '20].

In this work we report on the\nnumerical optimization of the directivity of optical travelling wave antennas\nmade from low-loss dielectric materials using full-wave numerical simulations\nin conjunction with a particle swarm optimization algorithm.

Histopathological examination of gastric cancer is the gold\nstandard for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, computer-aided\ndiagnostic techniques are challenging to evaluate due to the scarcity of\npublicly available gastric histopathology image datasets. Methods: In this\npaper, a noble publicly available Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image\nDatabase (GasHisSDB) is published to identify classifiers' performance.\nSpecifically, two types of data are included: normal and abnormal, with a total\nof 245,196 tissue case images.

Seven classical machine\nlearning classifiers, three Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, and a\nnovel transformer-based classifier are selected for testing on image\nclassification tasks. Results: This study performed extensive experiments using\ntraditional machine learning and deep learning methods to prove that the\nmethods of different periods have discrepancies on GasHisSDB.

Assessing statistical significance has been an area of active\nresearch; however, assessment of statistical power has been hampered by the\nlack of closed form calculations and the need for substantial amounts of\ncomputational simulations. The current work provides a detailed explanation of\nimplementing large scale simulation procedures within a shared computing\ncluster environment. In addition, all results and code for implementing these\nprocedures is publicly available. The resulting power analyses compare the\neffects of sample size and strength and direction of the relationships between\nthe three variables. Comparisons of three confidence interval calculation\nmethods demonstrated that the bias-corrected method is optimal and requires\napproximately ten less participants than the percentile method to achieve\nequivalent power. Differing strengths of distal and proximal effects were\ncompared and did not differentially affect the power to detect mediation\neffects. Suppression effects were explored and demonstrate that in the presence\nof no observed relationship between two variables, entrance of the mediating\nvariable into the model can reveal a suppressed relationship. The power to\ndetect suppression effects is similar to unsuppressed mediation. These results\nand their methods provide important information about the power of mediation\nmodels for study planning.

To remedy this, new methods are required to enable data owners, such\nas hospitals, to share their datasets publicly, while preserving both patient\nprivacy and modeling utility. We propose NeuraCrypt, a private encoding scheme\nbased on random deep neural networks. NeuraCrypt encodes raw patient data using\na randomly constructed neural network known only to the data-owner, and\npublishes both the encoded data and associated labels publicly. From a\ntheoretical perspective, we demonstrate that sampling from a sufficiently rich\nfamily of encoding functions offers a well-defined and meaningful notion of\nprivacy against a computationally unbounded adversary with full knowledge of\nthe underlying data-distribution.

The modern economy is additionally characterized by private\ndebt. The Human and Resources with MONEY (HARMONEY) economic growth model links\nthese features using a stock and flow consistent framework in physical and\nmonetary units. Via an updated version, we explore the interdependence of\ngrowth and three major structural metrics of an economy. First, we show that\nrelative decoupling of gross domestic product (GDP) from resource consumption\nis an expected pattern that occurs because of physical limits to growth, not a\nresponse to avoid physical limits. While an increase in resource efficiency of\noperating capital does increase the level of relative decoupling, so does a\nchange in pricing from one based on full costs to one based only on marginal\ncosts that neglects depreciation and interest payments leading to higher debt\nratios. Second, if assuming full labor bargaining power for wages, when a\npreviously-growing economy reaches peak resource extraction and GDP, wages\nremain high but profits and debt decline to zero. By removing bargaining power,\nprofits can remain positive at the expense of declining wages. Third, the\ndistribution of intermediate transactions within the input-output table of the\nmodel follows the same temporal pattern as in the post-World War II U.S.\neconomy. These results indicate that the HARMONEY framework enables realistic\ninvestigation of interdependent structural change and trade-offs between\neconomic distribution, size, and resources consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 14:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

However, low-cost production cars cannot\nafford such high expenses on sensors and maps. How to reduce costs? How do\nsensor-rich vehicles benefit low-cost cars? In this paper, we proposed a\nlight-weight localization solution, which relies on low-cost cameras and\ncompact visual semantic maps. The map is easily produced and updated by\nsensor-rich vehicles in a crowd-sourced way. Specifically, the map consists of\nseveral semantic elements, such as lane line, crosswalk, ground sign, and stop\nline on the road surface. We introduce the whole framework of on-vehicle\nmapping, on-cloud maintenance, and user-end localization. The map data is\ncollected and preprocessed on vehicles. Then, the crowd-sourced data is\nuploaded to a cloud server. The mass data from multiple vehicles are merged on\nthe cloud so that the semantic map is updated in time. Finally, the semantic\nmap is compressed and distributed to production cars, which use this map for\nlocalization. We validate the performance of the proposed map in real-world\nexperiments and compare it against other algorithms. The average size of the\nsemantic map is $36$ kb/km.

One such application is time domain\nsimulation, which is indispensable for the design, analysis and operation of\nmany engineering systems. Simulating dynamical systems with implicit\nNewton-based solvers is a computationally heavy task, as it requires the\nsolution of a parameterized system of differential and algebraic equations at\neach time step. A variety of NN-based methodologies have been shown to\nsuccessfully approximate the trajectories computed by numerical solvers at a\nfraction of the time. However, few previous works have used NNs to model the\nnumerical solver itself. For the express purpose of accelerating time domain\nsimulation speeds, this paper proposes and explores two complementary\nalternatives for modeling numerical solvers. First, we use a NN to mimic the\nlinear transformation provided by the inverse Jacobian in a single Newton step.\nUsing this procedure, we evaluate and project the exact, physics-based residual\nerror onto the NN mapping, thus leaving physics ``in the loop''. The resulting\ntool, termed the Physics-pRojected Neural-Newton Solver (PRoNNS), is able to\nachieve an extremely high degree of numerical accuracy at speeds which were\nobserved to be up to 31% faster than a Newton-based solver. In the second\napproach, we model the Newton solver at the heart of an implicit Runge-Kutta\nintegrator as a contracting map iteratively seeking a fixed point on a time\ndomain trajectory. The associated recurrent NN simulation tool, termed the\nContracting Neural-Newton Solver (CoNNS), is embedded with training constraints\n(via CVXPY Layers) which guarantee the mapping provided by the NN satisfies the\nBanach fixed-point theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 15:14:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 10:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

A number of\nstudies of this practice bring this assumption, however, into question. In this\npaper, we dig deeper into this issue in order to learn more about the effects\nof the choice of the metric to optimize on the performance of a ranking-based\nrecommender system. We present an extensive experimental study conducted on\ndifferent datasets in both pairwise and listwise learning-to-rank scenarios, to\ncompare the relative merit of four popular IR metrics, namely RR, AP, nDCG and\nRBP, when used for optimization and assessment of recommender systems in\nvarious combinations.

Our results confirm that the best performance is indeed not\nnecessarily achieved when optimizing the same metric being used for evaluation.\nIn fact, we find that RBP-inspired losses perform at least as well as other\nmetrics in a consistent way, and offer clear benefits in several cases.\nInteresting to see is that RBP-inspired losses, while improving the\nrecommendation performance for all uses, may lead to an individual performance\ngain that is correlated with the activity level of a user in interacting with\nitems. The more active the users, the more they benefit. Overall, our results\nchallenge the assumption behind the current research practice of optimizing and\nevaluating the same metric, and point to RBP-based optimization instead as a\npromising alternative when learning to rank in the recommendation context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 15:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

The common trait of these systems is the\noccurrence of large-scale coordination events taking place abruptly, in the\nform of a cascade process, as a consequence of small perturbations of an\napparently stable state. The conditions for the occurrence of cascade\ninstabilities have been largely analysed in the literature, however for the\nsame coordination models no sufficient attention was given to the relation\nbetween structural properties of (Nash) equilibria and possible outcomes of\ndynamical equilibrium selection.

We utilize a methodology for individual data collection from\nvocalists, and personal ground truth labeling by the artist themselves. We\nfound that traditional machine learning algorithms when limited to the features\nof musical prosody (1) achieve high accuracies for a single singer, (2)\nmaintain high accuracy when the dataset is expanded to multiple singers, and\n(3) achieve high accuracies when trained on a reduced subset of the total\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 15:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 19:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

One method of doing so, which is frequently cited to\nsupport the claim that models like BERT encode syntax, is called probing;\nprobes are small supervised models trained to extract linguistic information\nfrom another model's output. If a probe is able to predict a particular\nstructure, it is argued that the model whose output it is trained on must have\nimplicitly learnt to encode it. However, drawing a generalisation about a\nmodel's linguistic knowledge about a specific phenomena based on what a probe\nis able to learn may be problematic: in this work, we show that semantic cues\nin training data means that syntactic probes do not properly isolate syntax. We\ngenerate a new corpus of semantically nonsensical but syntactically well-formed\nJabberwocky sentences, which we use to evaluate two probes trained on normal\ndata.

In\nparticular, it was predicted that the ellipticity $\\epsilon$ converges to a\ncommon equilibrium value for elliptic-like pebbles. Unfortunately, the\nderivation was based on an invalid force expression and a dimensionally\nunsuitable curvature. In this paper, not only force and curvature but also the\ncontact duration with the sand surface during rotations is taken into account\nby fairly simple physical arguments, and it is shown that elliptic pebbles\nneither approach the same ellipticity and nor become more spherical nor more\ndisk-like but rather that the ellipticity $\\epsilon$ increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 14:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Secondly, cognitive-semantics are not evident,\nand important linguistic features are latent in short-text contents. Thirdly,\nit is hard to measure the correlation between the cognitive short-text\nsemantics and the features pertaining various occupations. We argue that the\nmulti-aspect cognitive features are needed to correctly associate short-text\ncontents to a particular job and discover suitable people for the careers. To\nthis end, we devise a novel framework that on the one hand, can infer\nshort-text contents and exploit cognitive features, and on the other hand,\nfuses various adopted novel algorithms, such as curve fitting, support vector,\nand boosting modules to better predict the occupation of the authors.

An interesting phenomenon that has often been\nconsidered too difficult to be included in standard physics studies at bachelor\nand master level, can now be introduced even for second year bachelor students\nand up. In the original Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect the angular size of the\nsource (the star Sirius) was calculated by determining the distance between two\ndetectors that lead to a drop in the cross-correlations in the signals from the\ndetectors. We find that this principle works equally well by sound waves from a\nwaterfall. This is remarkable, since we use a completely different kind of\nwaves from the HBT case, the frequency of the waves differ by a factor $\\sim\n10^{12}$ and the wavelength as well as the angular extension of the source seen\nfrom the observer's position differ by a factor $\\sim 10^{7}$. The original HBT\npapers were based on measurements of \\emph{intensity} fluctuations recorded by\ntwo detectors and correlations between these signals. The starting point for\nthe theory that explained the effect was therefore intensity fluctuations per\nsee, and the theory is not easy to understand, at least not for an\nundergraduate physics student. Our starting point is descriptions of broadband\nwaves at the amplitude level (not at intensity level) by numerical modeling.\nImportant properties of broadband waves can easily be revealed and understood\nby numerical modeling, and time-resolved frequency analysis (TFA) based on\nMorlet wavelets turns out to be a very useful tool. In fact, we think it has\nbeen far too little attention to broadband waves in physics education hitherto,\nbut the growth of use of numerical methods in basic physics courses opens up\nnew possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 13:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The ERA5 product family are the latest and most advanced global\nreanalysis products created by the ECMWF. These data products offer up to 83\nessential climate variables at hourly intervals for the time-period of 1981 to\ntoday with preliminary back-extensions being available for 1950-1981. Spatial\nresolutions range from 30km (ERA5) to 11km (ERA5-Land) and can be statistically\ndownscaled to study-requirements at finer spatial resolutions.

We\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed network and compare it to\ntraditional pixel-based convolution neural network models and feature-based\ngraph convolutional neural networks on multiple large datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 03:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 02:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 17:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}
