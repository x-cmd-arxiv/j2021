However, the label-wise attention\nmechanism is computational redundant and costly. In this paper, we propose a\npseudo label-wise attention mechanism to tackle the problem.

The three types\nof Tsallis statistics are reviewed. Only one of them is consistent with the\nfundamental hypothesis of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The single\nparticle distributions associated with it, namely Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and\nBose-Einstein, are derived. These are not equilibrium solutions to the\nconventional Boltzmann transport equation which must be modified in a rather\nnonintuitive manner for them to be so. Nevertheless the Boltzmann limit of the\nTsallis distribution is extremely efficient in representing a wide variety of\nsingle particle distributions in high energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and\nnucleus-nucleus collisions with only three parameters, one of them being the\nso-called nonextensitivity parameter $q$. This distribution interpolates\nbetween an exponential at low transverse energy, reflecting thermal\nequilibrium, to a power law at high transverse energy, reflecting the\nasymptotic freedom of QCD. It should not be viewed as a fundamental new\nparameter representing nonextensive behavior in these collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 17:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 16:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

A popular approach for digitization is to scan the\ndocuments into images, and then convert images into text using Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR) algorithms.

This study investigates how crowdsourcing can be utilized to\ncorrect OCR errors in historical text collections, and which crowdsourcing\nmethodology is the most effective in different scenarios and for various\nresearch objectives. A series of experiments with different micro-task's\nstructures and text lengths was conducted with 753 workers on the Amazon's\nMechanical Turk platform. The workers had to fix OCR errors in a selected\nhistorical text. To analyze the results, new accuracy and efficiency measures\nhave been devised.

In terms of efficiency, the best\nresults were obtained when using longer text in the single-stage structure with\nno image. The study provides practical recommendations to researchers on how to\nbuild the optimal crowdsourcing task for OCR post-correction. The developed\nmethodology can also be utilized to create golden standard historical texts for\nautomatic OCR post-correction.

An added difficulty to then\novercome for distributed quantum computing is that a complex control system to\norchestrate the various components is required.

Recently, Transformer has been gaining popularity due to\nits parallel computing ability for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Thus, it\nseems to be straightforward to apply the vision Transformer to solve VSR.\nHowever, the typical block design of Transformer with a fully connected\nself-attention layer and a token-wise feed-forward layer does not fit well for\nVSR due to the following two reasons. First, the fully connected self-attention\nlayer neglects to exploit the data locality because this layer relies on linear\nlayers to compute attention maps. Second, the token-wise feed-forward layer\nlacks the feature alignment which is important for VSR since this layer\nindependently processes each of the input token embeddings without any\ninteraction among them. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt\nTransformer for VSR. Specifically, to tackle the first issue, we present a\nspatial-temporal convolutional self-attention layer with a theoretical\nunderstanding to exploit the locality information. For the second issue, we\ndesign a bidirectional optical flow-based feed-forward layer to discover the\ncorrelations across different video frames and also align features.

The GDR algorithm estimates an artifact-free lung template\nimage and a smooth, dense, 4D (space plus time) vector field that deforms the\ntemplate image to each breathing phase to produce an artifact-free 4DCT scan.\nCorrespondences are estimated by accounting for the local tissue density change\nassociated with air entering and leaving the lungs, and using binary artifact\nmasks to exclude regions with artifacts from image regression. The\nartifact-free lung template image is generated by mapping the artifact-free\nregions of each phase volume to a common reference coordinate system using the\nestimated correspondences and then averaging. This procedure generates a fixed\nview of the lung with an improved signal-to-noise ratio.

The proposed\nframework with two-step attention outperforms existing benchmark models by\n22.3%, 12.8%, 5.9% on 0, 10 and 20 dB SNR respectively. We carry out an\nablation study to determine the contribution of the auxiliary task and two-step\nattention pooling to the SED performance improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 20:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

First, complex traits are often\nassociated with many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each with small or\nmoderate effect sizes. Second, our understanding of the functional mechanisms\nthrough which genetic variants are associated with complex traits is still\nlimited. To address these challenges, we propose GPA-Tree and it simultaneously\nimplements association mapping and identifies key combinations of functional\nannotations related to risk-associated SNPs by combining a decision tree\nalgorithm with a hierarchical modeling framework. Results: First, we\nimplemented simulation studies to evaluate the proposed GPA-Tree method and\ncompared its performance with existing statistical approaches. The results\nindicate that GPA-Tree outperforms existing statistical approaches in detecting\nrisk-associated SNPs and identifying the true combinations of functional\nannotations with high accuracy. Second, we applied GPA-Tree to a systemic lupus\nerythematosus (SLE) GWAS and functional annotation data including GenoSkyline\nand GenoSkylinePlus. The results from GPA-Tree highlight the dysregulation of\nblood immune cells, including but not limited to primary B, memory helper T,\nregulatory T, neutrophils and CD8+ memory T cells in SLE.

Given a sequence of\nobservations, a class of parametrized model processes with a prior\ndistribution, and a loss function, we specify the generalized posterior\ndistribution. The problem of frequentist posterior consistency is concerned\nwith whether as more and more samples are observed, the posterior distribution\non parameters will asymptotically concentrate on the \"right\" parameters. We\nshow that posterior consistency can be derived using a combination of classical\nlarge deviation techniques, such as Varadhan's lemma, conditional/quenched\nlarge deviations, annealed large deviations, and exponential approximations. We\nshow that the posterior distribution will asymptotically concentrate on\nparameters that minimize the expected loss and a divergence term, and we\nidentify the divergence term as the Donsker-Varadhan relative entropy rate from\nprocess-level large deviations. As an application, we prove new quenched and\nannealed large deviation asymptotics and new Bayesian posterior consistency\nresults for a class of mixing stochastic processes.

Traditional\nfeature extraction techniques heavily depend on domain experts and adapt poorly\nto new tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method InfoBehavior\nto automatically extract meaningful representations from ultra-long raw\nbehavior sequences instead of the costly feature selection procedure.\nInfoBehavior utilizes Bidirectional Transformer as feature encoder due to its\nexcellent capability in modeling long-term dependency.

To address DG, recent model-agnostic meta-learning\n(MAML) has been introduced, which transfers the knowledge from previous\ntraining tasks to facilitate the learning of novel testing tasks. However, in\nclinical practice, there are usually only a few annotated source domains\navailable, which decreases the capacity of training task generation and thus\nincreases the risk of overfitting to training tasks in the paradigm.

In the LLG equation, the length of\nmagnetization is conserved and the system energy is dissipative. Implicit and\nsemi-implicit schemes have been used in micromagnetics simulations due to their\nunconditional numerical stability. In more details, implicit schemes preserve\nthe properties of the LLG equation, but solve a nonlinear system of equations\nper time step. In contrast, semi-implicit schemes only solve a linear system of\nequations, while additional operations are needed to preserve the length of\nmagnetization. It still remains unclear which one shall be used if both\nimplicit and semi-implicit schemes are available. In this work, using the\nimplicit Crank-Nicolson (ICN) scheme as a benchmark, we propose to make this\nimplicit scheme semi-implicit. It can be proved that both schemes are\nsecond-order accurate in space and time. For the unique solvability of\nnonlinear systems of equations in the ICN scheme, we require that the temporal\nstep size scales quadratically with the spatial mesh size. It is numerically\nverified that the convergence of the nonlinear solver becomes slower for larger\ntemporal step size and multiple magnetization profiles are obtained for\ndifferent initial guesses. The linear systems of equations in the semi-implicit\nCN (SICN) scheme are unconditionally uniquely solvable, and the condition that\nthe temporal step size scales linearly with the spatial mesh size is needed in\nthe convergence of the SICN scheme. In terms of numerical efficiency, the SICN\nscheme achieves the same accuracy as the ICN scheme with less computational\ntime. Based on these results, we conclude that a semi-implicit scheme is\nsuperior to its implicit analog both theoretically and numerically, and we\nrecommend the semi-implicit scheme in micromagnetics simulations if both\nmethods are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 07:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

In the decoder\nmodule, two methods are utilized to enhance the correlation between scene and\ntext feature space. 1) The decoder initialization is guided by the holistic\nfeature and global glimpse vector exported from the encoder. 2) The feature\nenriched glimpse vector produced by the Multi-Head General Attention is used to\nassist the RNN iteration and the character prediction at each time step.\nMeanwhile, we also design a Layernorm-Dropout LSTM cell to improve model's\ngeneralization towards changeable texts. Extensive experiments on the\nbenchmarks demonstrate the advantageous performance of RCEED in scene text\nrecognition tasks, especially the irregular ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 10:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 05:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

For all such spacetimes, the Einstein field equations are integrated\nwith an energy-momentum tensor that does not include a contribution from the\naxial matter; the presence of this matter is inferred instead from the\nexistence of a conical singularity in the spacetime. And for all such\nspacetimes, the axial matter is characterized by a pressure (or tension) equal\nto its linear energy density; the matter is therefore revealed to have a very\nspecific equation of state. Our purpose with this paper is to show that the\naxial matter can be introduced at the very start of the exercise, through the\nspecification of a distributional energy-momentum tensor, and that one can\nchoose for it any equation of state. To evade no-go theorems regarding line\nsources in general relativity, we retreat to a perturbative expansion of the\ngravitational field, using the Schwarzschild metric as a description of the\nbackground spacetime. Instead of a second black hole, our prototypical system\nfeatures a point particle at a fixed position outside the Schwarzschild black\nhole, attached to a string extending to infinity.

Prior methods typically approach this problem by preprocessing\nraw waveform into time-frequency representations, which is more amenable to\nprocess with well-established image processing pipelines. Prior methods also\ndetect in segment-wise manner, leading to incomplete and partial detections.\nSoundDet takes a novel approach and directly consumes the raw, multichannel\nwaveform and treats the spatio-temporal sound event as a complete\n\"sound-object\" to be detected. Specifically, SoundDet consists of a backbone\nneural network and two parallel heads for temporal detection and spatial\nlocalization, respectively. Given the large sampling rate of raw waveform, the\nbackbone network first learns a set of phase-sensitive and frequency-selective\nbank of filters to explicitly retain direction-of-arrival information, whilst\nbeing highly computationally and parametrically efficient than standard 1D/2D\nconvolution. A dense sound event proposal map is then constructed to handle the\nchallenges of predicting events with large varying temporal duration.\nAccompanying the dense proposal map are a temporal overlapness map and a motion\nsmoothness map that measure a proposal's confidence to be an event from\ntemporal detection accuracy and movement consistency perspective. Involving the\ntwo maps guarantees SoundDet to be trained in a spatio-temporally unified\nmanner.

More appropriate decomposition of a low-light image can help\nachieve better image enhancement. In this paper, we propose a new pixel-level\nnon-local Haar transform based illumination and reflectance decomposition\nmethod (NLHD). The unique low-frequency coefficient of Haar transform on each\nsimilar pixel group is used to reconstruct the illumination component, and the\nrest of all high-frequency coefficients are employed to reconstruct the\nreflectance component. The complete similarity of pixels in a matched similar\npixel group and the simple separable Haar transform help to obtain more\nappropriate image decomposition; thus, the image is hardly sharpened in the\nimage brightness enhancement procedure. The exponential transform and\nlogarithmic transform are respectively implemented on the illumination\ncomponent. Then a minimum fusion strategy on the results of these two\ntransforms is utilized to achieve more natural illumination component\nenhancement. It can alleviate the mosaic artifacts produced in the darker\nregions by the exponential transform with a gamma value less than 1 and reduce\ninformation loss caused by excessive enhancement of the brighter regions due to\nthe logarithmic transform. Finally, the Retinex model is applied to the\nenhanced illumination and reflectance to achieve image enhancement.

This solution\nprovides explicit expressions for the surface elevation, free-surface velocity\npotential and velocity potential. The amplitude dispersion relation is also\nprovided. Two approaches are used to derive the third order analytical\nsolution, resulting in two types of approximate solutions: the perturbation\nsolution and the Hamiltonian solution. The perturbation solution is obtained by\nclassical perturbation technique in which the time variable is expanded in\nmultiscale to eliminate secular terms. The Hamiltonian solution is derived from\nthe canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian theory of water waves. By\ncomparing the two types of solutions, it is found that they are completely\nequivalent for the first to second order solutions and the nonlinear\ndispersion, but for the third order part only the sum-sum terms are the same.\nDue to the canonical transformation that could completely separate the dynamic\nand bound harmonics, the Hamiltonian solutions break through the difficulty\nthat the perturbation theory breaks down due to singularities in the transfer\nfunctions when quartet resonance criterion is satisfied. Furthermore, it is\nalso found that some time-averaged quantities based on the Hamiltonian\nsolution, such as mean potential energy and mean kinetic energy, are equal to\nthose in the initial state in which sea surface is assumed to be a Gaussian\nrandom process. This is because there are associated conserved quantities in\nthe Hamiltonian form. All of these show that the Hamiltonian solution is more\nreasonable and accurate to describe the third order steady-state wave field.\nFinally, based on the Hamiltonian solution, some statistics are given such as\nthe volume flux, skewness, and excess kurtosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 13:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

While point process-based generative models have long been in use\nfor estimating cascade growths, deep learning has greatly enhanced diverse\nfeature integration. We observe two significant temporal signals in cascade\ndata that have not been emphasized or reported to our knowledge. First, the\npopularity of the cascade root is known to influence cascade size strongly; but\nthe effect falls off rapidly with time. Second, there is a measurable positive\ncorrelation between the novelty of the root content (with respect to a\nstreaming external corpus) and the relative size of the resulting cascade.\nResponding to these observations, we propose GammaCas, a new cascade growth\nmodel as a parametric function of time, which combines deep influence signals\nfrom content (e.g., tweet text), network features (e.g., followers of the root\nuser), and exogenous event sources (e.g., online news). Specifically, our model\nprocesses these signals through a customized recurrent network, whose states\nthen provide the parameters of the cascade rate function, which is integrated\nover time to predict the cascade size. The network parameters are trained\nend-to-end using observed cascades. GammaCas outperforms seven recent and\ndiverse baselines significantly on a large-scale dataset of retweet cascades\ncoupled with time-aligned online news -- it beats the best baseline with an\n18.98% increase in terms of Kendall's $\\tau$ correlation and $35.63$ reduction\nin Mean Absolute Percentage Error.

It helps to match a photo to the device that\nclicked it. In today's scenario, where millions and millions of images are\nuploaded every hour, it is very easy to compute this unique PRNU pattern from a\ncouple of shared images on social profiles. This endangers the privacy of the\ncamera owner and becomes a cause of major concern for the privacy-aware\nsociety. We propose SSS-PRNU scheme that facilitates the forensic investigators\nto carry out their crime investigation without breaching the privacy of the\npeople. Thus, maintaining a balance between the two. To preserve privacy,\nextraction of camera fingerprint and PRNU noise for a suspicious image is\ncomputed in a trusted execution environment such as ARM TrustZone. After\nextraction, the sensitive information of camera fingerprint and PRNU noise is\ndistributed into multiple obfuscated shares using Shamir secret sharing(SSS)\nscheme. These shares are information-theoretically secure and leak no\ninformation of underlying content. The encrypted information is distributed to\nmultiple third-part servers where correlation is computed on a share basis\nbetween the camera fingerprint and the PRNU noise. These partial correlation\nvalues are combined together to obtain the final correlation value that becomes\nthe basis for a match decision. Transforming the computation of the correlation\nvalue in the encrypted domain and making it well suited for a distributed\nenvironment is the main contribution of the paper. Experiment results validate\nthe feasibility of the proposed scheme that provides a secure framework for\nPRNU based source camera attribution. The security analysis and evaluation of\ncomputational and storage overheads are performed to analysis the practical\nfeasibility of the scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 15:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

Application scenarios include video quality adaptation\nas a function of the 5G network quality at predicted user locations, and\naugmented reality apps that speed up content rendering based on predicted user\nlocations. Such use cases require prediction error in the same range as the GPS\nerror, and no existing works on location prediction can achieve this level of\naccuracy. We present a system for fine-grained location prediction (FGLP) of\nmobile users, based on GPS traces collected on the phones. FGLP has two\ncomponents: a federated learning framework and a prediction model. The\nframework runs on the phones of the users and also on a server that coordinates\nlearning from all users in the system. FGLP represents the user location data\nas relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across\ndifferent physical spaces. The model merges Bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns\nthe speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as\nuser movement preferences. FGLP uses federated learning to protect user privacy\nand reduce bandwidth consumption. Our experimental results, using a dataset\nwith over 600,000 users, demonstrate that FGLP outperforms baseline models in\nterms of prediction accuracy. We also demonstrate that FGLP works well in\nconjunction with transfer learning, which enables model reusability.
