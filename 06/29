For this purpose, we define lambda quantiles on the space of\nportfolio compositions and consider generic (also non-linear) portfolio\noperators.\n  We further derive the Euler decomposition of lambda quantiles for generic\nportfolios and show that lambda quantiles are homogeneous in the space of\nportfolio compositions, with a homogeneity degree that depends on the portfolio\ncomposition and the lambda function.

As such, using a\nwell-structured dataset that has minimum level of bias is always desirable. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel, domain-independent approach, called\nscore-based resampling (SBR), to locate the under-represented samples of the\noriginal training dataset based on the model prediction scores obtained with\nthat training set. In our method, once trained, we use the same CNN model to\ninfer on its own training samples, obtain prediction scores, and based on the\ndistance between predicted and ground-truth, we identify samples that are far\naway from their ground-truth and augment them in the original training set. The\ntemperature term of the Sigmoid function is decreased to better differentiate\nscores. For experimental evaluation, we selected one Kaggle dataset for gender\nclassification. We first used a CNN-based classifier with relatively standard\nstructure, trained on the training images, and evaluated on the provided\nvalidation samples of the original dataset. Then, we assessed it on a totally\nnew test dataset consisting of light male, light female, dark male, and dark\nfemale groups. The obtained accuracies varied, revealing the existence of\ncategorical bias against certain groups in the original dataset. Subsequently,\nwe trained the model after resampling based on our proposed approach. We\ncompared our method with a previously proposed variational autoencoder (VAE)\nbased algorithm. The obtained results confirmed the validity of our proposed\nmethod regrading identifying under-represented samples among original dataset\nto decrease categorical bias of classifying certain groups.

It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference\ndirectly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of\nimages. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable\nrepresentations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a\ndeep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,\nwhich are subsequently used for classification (or regression) at its output\nlayer. This happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised\nor unsupervised loss in common practical regimes of deep learning, unlike the\nneural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In this paper, we study the dynamics of\nsuch implicit nonlinear representation learning, which is beyond the NTK\nregime. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a novel condition, called\nthe common model structure assumption and the data-architecture alignment\ncondition. Under the common model structure assumption, the data-architecture\nalignment condition is shown to be sufficient for the global convergence and\nnecessary for the global optimality. Moreover, our theory explains how and when\nincreasing the network size does and does not improve the training behaviors in\nthe practical regime. Our results provide practical guidance for designing a\nmodel structure: e.g., the common model structure assumption can be used as a\njustification for using a particular model structure instead of others. We also\nderive a new training framework based on the theory.

In the context of SHM, one of the most challenging tasks is damage\nquantification. Current methods face accuracy and/or robustness issues when it\ncomes to varying operating and environmental conditions. In addition, the\ndamage/no-damage paradigm of current frameworks does not offer much information\nto maintainers on the ground for proper decision-making. In this study, a novel\nstructural damage quantification framework is proposed based on widely-used\nDamage Indices (DIs) and Gaussian Process Regression Models (GPRMs). The\nnovelty lies in calculating the probability of an incoming test DI point\noriginating from a specific state, which allows for probability-educated\ndecision-making. This framework is applied to three test cases: a Carbon\nFiber-Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) coupon with attached weights as simulated\ndamage, an aluminum coupon with a notch, and an aluminum coupon with attached\nweights as simulated damage under varying loading states. The state prediction\nmethod presented herein is applied to single-state quantification in the first\ntwo test cases, as well as the third one assuming the loading state is known.\nFinally, the proposed method is applied to the third test case assuming neither\nthe damage size nor the load is known in order to predict both simultaneously\nfrom incoming DI test points. In applying this framework, two forms of GPRMs\n(standard and variational heteroscedastic) are used in order to critically\nassess their performances with respect to the three test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 16:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

To tackle this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that\nperforms joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.\nConsidering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high\ndefinition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient\nestimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The\ncoefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the\ncoefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint\nenhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and\nprogressively performs joint enhancement and denoising. In contrast to existing\nmethods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when being\nadapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts\nrequired to fine-tune our approach for practical usage.

In this paper, we performed a\nparticle-in-cell simulation study to investigate the IEDF in a symmetric\ncapacitive discharge excited by saw-tooth like current waveform at a very high\nfrequency (VHF). At a constant driving frequency of 27.12 MHz, the simulation\nresults predict that the ion energy symmetry scales with the discharge current\namplitude and the IEDF turn into a bi-modal distribution at higher current\ndensity amplitude. Further studies at a constant current density and varying\nthe fundamental excitation frequency, shows that the ion energy asymmetry is\ngreatly reduced with a reduction in the driving frequency. Increase in the\nplasma asymmetry and significant DC self-bias at lower driving frequency is\nobserved to be one of the principal factors responsible for the observed\nasymmetry in the ion energy peaks. An investigation of DC self-bias and plasma\npotential confirm that the powered electrode energy peak corresponds to the DC\nself-bias with respect to the plasma potential, and the grounded electrode peak\ncorresponds to the plasma potential.

As a star ages, it delivers more energy\nto a planet. As a planet ages it produces less internal heat, which leads to\ncooling. For the Earth, interior cooling connects to plate tectonics - the\nsurface manifestation of convection within the Earth's interior. This process\ncycles volatiles (CO2 and water) between surface and interior reservoirs, which\naffects planetary climate. Cycling rates depend on the efficiency of plate\ntectonic cooling. That efficiency remains debated and multiple hypotheses have\nbeen put forth. Geological proxy data allow us to validate these hypotheses\naccounting for model and data uncertainty. Multiple models pass the validation\ntest. Those models define a distribution for terrestrial exoplanets akin to\nEarth, accounting for variations in tectonic efficiency. Feeding this\ndistribution into climate models indicates that the time at which habitable\nconditions are established can vary by billions of years. Planets of the same\nabsolute age and orbital distance can reside and not reside within the classic\nhabitable zone due to differences in plate tectonic cooling efficiencies. The\nfull model population allows a probability distribution to be constructed for\nthe the time at which habitable conditions are established.

We find that learning progress (defined as a change in success\nprobability of a task) is a reliable measure of learnability for automatically\nconstructing an effective curriculum. We introduce a learning-progress based\ncurriculum and test it on a complex reinforcement learning problem (called\n\"Simon Says\") where an agent is instructed to obtain a desired goal item. Many\nof the required skills depend on each other. Experiments demonstrate that: (1)\na within-episode exploration bonus for obtaining new items improves\nperformance, (2) dynamically adjusting this bonus across training such that it\nonly applies to items the agent cannot reliably obtain yet further increases\nperformance, (3) the learning-progress based curriculum elegantly follows the\nlearning curve of the agent, and (4) when the learning-progress based\ncurriculum is combined with the dynamic exploration bonus it learns much more\nefficiently and obtains far higher performance than uniform baselines. These\nresults suggest that combining intra-episode and across-training exploration\nbonuses with learning progress creates a promising method for automated\ncurriculum generation, which may substantially increase our ability to train\nmore capable, generally intelligent agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

In comparison, modern\nconvolutional neural networks are easier to optimize. Why is this the case? In\nthis work, we conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify stem of ViT\nmodels, which is implemented by a stride-p p*p convolution (p=16 by default)\napplied to the input image. This large-kernel plus large-stride convolution\nruns counter to typical design choices of convolutional layers in neural\nnetworks. To test whether this atypical design choice causes an issue, we\nanalyze the optimization behavior of ViT models with their original patchify\nstem versus a simple counterpart where we replace the ViT stem by a small\nnumber of stacked stride-two 3*3 convolutions. While the vast majority of\ncomputation in the two ViT designs is identical, we find that this small change\nin early visual processing results in markedly different training behavior in\nterms of the sensitivity to optimization settings as well as the final model\naccuracy. Using a convolutional stem in ViT dramatically increases optimization\nstability and also improves peak performance (by ~1-2% top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1k), while maintaining flops and runtime. The improvement can be\nobserved across the wide spectrum of model complexities (from 1G to 36G flops)\nand dataset scales (from ImageNet-1k to ImageNet-21k).

For large-scale ion-trap-based quantum\ncomputers and networks, it is critical to have two types of qubits, one for\ncomputation and storage, while the other for auxiliary operations like runtime\nqubit detection, sympathetic cooling, and repetitive entanglement generation\nthrough photon links. Dual-type qubits have previously been realized in hybrid\nsystems using two ion species, which, however, introduces significant\nexperimental challenges for laser setup, gate operations as well as the control\nof the fraction and positioning of each qubit type within an ion crystal. Here\nwe solve these problems by implementing two coherently-convertible qubit types\nusing the same ion species. We encode the qubits into two pairs of clock states\nof the 171Yb+ ions, and achieve fast and high-fidelity conversion between the\ntwo types using narrow-band lasers. We further demonstrate that operations on\none qubit type, including sympathetic laser cooling, gates and qubit detection,\nhave crosstalk errors less than 0.03% on the other type, well below the error\nthreshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

The source is\ncomposed by a compact object (likely a neutron star) orbiting around an\nO8.5Ib-II(f)p star, LM Vel. The X-ray light curve shows a very low level of\nemission, punctuated by a single, faint flare. Analysis of spectra measured\nduring the flare and during quiescence is performed. The quiescent state shows\na continuum spectrum well deconvolved to three spectral models: two components\nare from a collisionally-ionized plasma (with temperatures kT1=0.24 keV and\nkT2=0.76 keV), together with a power law model (photon index of 2.55),\ndominating above 2 keV. The X-ray flux emitted at this lowest level is\n3.2$\\times10^{-13}$ erg/cm2/s (0.5-10 keV, corrected for the interstellar\nabsorption), implying an X-ray luminosity of 1.85$\\times10^{32}$ erg/s (at 2.2\nkpc). The two temperature collisionally-ionized plasma is intrinsic to the\nstellar wind of the donor star, while the power law can be interpreted as\nemission due to residual, low level accretion onto the compact object. The\nX-ray luminosity contributed by the power law component only, in the lowest\nstate, is (4.8$\\pm{1.4})\\times10^{31}$ erg/s, the lowest quiescent luminosity\ndetected from the compact object in an SFXT. Thanks to this very faint X-ray\nstate caught by XMM-Newton, X-ray emission from the wind of the donor star LM\nVel could be well-established and studied in detail for the first time, as well\nas a very low level of accretion onto the compact object. The residual\naccretion rate onto the compact object in IGR J08408-4503 can be interpreted as\nthe Bohm diffusion of (possibly magnetized) plasma entering the neutron star\nmagnetosphere at low Bondi capture rates from the supergiant donor wind at the\nquasi-spherical radiation-driven settling accretion stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 18:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We argue that existence of an anomaly\ncancellation mechanism is a necessary condition for liftability. In addition,\nthe anomaly cancellation and the CS couplings in six and five dimensions\nrespectively determine the central charges of string-like BPS objects that\ncannot be consistently decoupled from gravity, a.k.a. supergravity strings.\nFollowing the completeness conjecture and requiring that their worldsheet\ntheory is unitary imposes bounds on the admissible theories.

The unitarity constraints (UC) are in general weaker than\nKPC, and maybe useful in understanding the consistent models without\nF-theoretic realisation.

There are two\nmajor drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes\ncan introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority\nclass is not necessarily a hard class.

Aubry et al. [N. Aubry, P. Holmes, J. Lumley,\nand E. Stone, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 192, 115-173 (1988)] pioneered\ndata-driven proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modeling. In early POD\nmodeling, available data was used to build an optimal basis, which was then\nutilized in a classical Galerkin procedure to construct the ROM. But data has\nmade a profound impact on ROMs beyond the Galerkin expansion. In this paper, we\ntake a modest step and illustrate the impact of data-driven modeling on one\nsignificant ROM area. Specifically, we focus on ROM closures, which are\ncorrection terms that are added to classical ROMs in order to model the effect\nof the discarded ROM modes in under-resolved simulations. Through simple\nexamples, we illustrate the main modeling principles used to construct\nclassical ROMs, motivate and introduce modern ROM closures, and show how\ndata-driven modeling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have\nchanged the standard ROM methodology over the last two decades. Finally, we\noutline our vision on how state-of-the-art data-driven modeling can continue to\nreshape the field of reduced order modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 19:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 06:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Here in the first paper of our series we\npresent the broadband continuum modelling of the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) for NGC 3227, extending from near infrared (NIR) to hard X-rays. We use\nour new spectra taken with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST/COS in 2019, together\nwith archival unobscured XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST/STIS data, in order to\ndisentangle various spectral components of NGC 3227 and recover the underlying\ncontinuum. We find the observed NIR-optical-UV continuum is explained well by\nan accretion disk blackbody component (Tmax = 10 eV), which is internally\nreddened by E(B-V) = 0.45 with a Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law.\nWe derive the inner radius (12 Rg) and the accretion rate (0.1 solar mass per\nyear) of the disk by modelling the thermal disk emission. The internal\nreddening in NGC 3227 is most likely associated with outflows from the dusty\nAGN torus. In addition, an unreddened continuum component is also evident,\nwhich likely arises from scattered radiation, associated with the extended\nnarrow-line region (NLR) of NGC 3227. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) continuum,\nand the 'soft X-ray excess', can be explained with a 'warm Comptonisation'\ncomponent. The hard X-rays are consistent with a power-law and a neutral\nreflection component.

A desirable\nproperty of these routes is a small number of hops, which makes them more\nreliable, and reduces the transmission costs. Following the overwhelming\nsuccess of stochastic tree embeddings for algorithmic design, Haeupler,\nHershkowitz, and Zuzic (STOC'21) studied hop-constrained Ramsey-type metric\nembeddings into trees. Specifically, embedding $f:G(V,E)\\rightarrow T$ has\nRamsey hop-distortion $(t,M,\\beta,h)$ (here $t,\\beta,h\\ge1$ and $M\\subseteq V$)\nif $\\forall u,v\\in M$, $d_G^{(\\beta\\cdot h)}(u,v)\\le d_T(u,v)\\le t\\cdot\nd_G^{(h)}(u,v)$. $t$ is called the distortion, $\\beta$ is called the\nhop-stretch, and $d_G^{(h)}(u,v)$ denotes the minimum weight of a $u-v$ path\nwith at most $h$ hops.

In the limit of\nsmall flag mass, flags perform traveling wave motions that move at nearly the\nspeed of the oncoming flow. The flag mode number scales as the -1/4 power of\nbending stiffness. The flapping frequency has the same scaling, with an\nadditional slight increase with flag mass in the small-mass regime. The\nflapping amplitude scales approximately as flag mass to the 1/2 power. For\nlarge flag mass, the dominant mode number is low (0 or 1), the flapping\nfrequency tends to zero, and the amplitude saturates in the neighborhood of its\nupper limit (the flag length).

A natural example is medium-range forecasting, which\nis inherently probabilistic because it lies beyond the deterministic\npredictability time of the atmosphere, but for which statistically significant\nprediction can be made which depend on the current state of the system.\nSimilarly, one may ask the probability of occurrence of an El Ni\\~no event\nseveral months ahead of time. In this paper, we introduce a quantity which\ncorresponds precisely to this type of prediction problem: the committor\nfunction is the probability that an event takes place within a given time\nwindow, as a function of the initial condition. We explain the main\nmathematical properties of this probabilistic concept, and compute it in the\ncase of a low-dimensional stochastic model for El-Ni\\~no, the Jin and Timmerman\nmodel.

These direct interactions and human-readable table representations\nform a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what\nthe data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables\nare an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data\ninteraction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and\nthat sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than\nis currently supported in visual analytics tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 22:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The\napproach is based on a phase space representation of the space-time matter\nfields after a careful $n+1$ decomposition into spatial fields $B$ and\nconjugate momenta $\\Pi_B$, which are specified directly and are conformally\ninvariant quantities. We show that if the Einstein-matter field theory is\nspecified by a Lagrangian which is diffeomorphism invariant and involves no\ndependence on derivatives of the space-time metric in the matter portion of the\nLagrangian, then fixing $B$ and $\\Pi_B$ results in conformal constraint\nequations that, for constant-mean curvature initial data, semi-decouple just as\nthey do for the vacuum Einstein conformal constraint equations. We prove this\nresult by establishing a structural property of the Einstein momentum\nconstraint that is independent of the conformal method: For an Einstein-matter\nfield theory which satisfies the conditions just stated, if $B$ and $\\Pi_B$\nsatisfy the matter Euler-Lagrange equations, then (in suitable form) the\nright-hand side of the momentum constraint on each spatial slice depends only\non $B$ and $\\Pi_B$ and is independent of the space-time metric.

In CVRP, introduced by\nDantzig and Ramser (1959), we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with metric edges\ncosts, a depot $r\\in V$, and a vehicle of bounded capacity $Q$. The goal is to\nfind minimum cost collection of tours for the vehicle that returns to the\ndepot, each visiting at most $Q$ nodes, such that they cover all the nodes.\nThis generalizes classic TSP and has been studied extensively. In the more\ngeneral setting, each node $v$ has a demand $d_v$ and the total demand of each\ntour must be no more than $Q$. Either the demand of each node must be served by\none tour (unsplittable) or can be served by multiple tour (splittable). The\nbest known approximation algorithm for general graphs has ratio\n$\\alpha+2(1-\\epsilon)$ (for the unsplittable) and $\\alpha+1-\\epsilon$ (for the\nsplittable) for some fixed $\\epsilon>\\frac{1}{3000}$, where $\\alpha$ is the\nbest approximation for TSP.

Since these propellers rotate at a high-speed, they are generally\nthe fastest moving parts of an image and cannot be directly \"seen\" by a\nclassical camera without severe motion blur. We utilize a class of sensors that\nare particularly suitable for such scenarios called event cameras, which have a\nhigh temporal resolution, low-latency, and high dynamic range.\n  In this paper, we model the geometry of a propeller and use it to generate\nsimulated events which are used to train a deep neural network called EVPropNet\nto detect propellers from the data of an event camera. EVPropNet directly\ntransfers to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining.

However, existing statistical\nmodels for such data either do not adequately account for the dependency among\nthe microbial taxa or lack computational scalability with respect to the number\nof taxa. This presents challenges in important applications such as association\nanalysis between microbiome compositions and disease risk in which valid\nstatistical analysis requires appropriately incorporating the \"variance\ncomponents\" or \"random effects\" in the microbiome composition. We introduce a\ngenerative model, called the \"logistic-tree normal\" (LTN) model, that addresses\nthis need. LTN marries two popular classes of models-namely, log-ratio normal\n(LN) and Dirichlet-tree (DT)-and inherits the key benefits of each. LTN\nincorporates the tree-based binomial decomposition as the DT does, but it\njointly models the corresponding binomial probabilities using a (multivariate)\nlogistic-normal distribution as in LN models. It therefore allows rich\ncovariance structures as LN, along with computational efficiency realized\nthrough a Polya-Gamma augmentation on the binomial models associated with the\ntree splits. Accordingly, Bayesian inference on LTN can readily proceed by\nGibbs sampling. LTN also allows common techniques for effective inference on\nhigh-dimensional data to be readily incorporated. We construct a general\nmixed-effects model using LTN to characterize compositional random effects,\nwhich allows flexible taxa covariance.

Most\npractical approaches require determining and measuring a suitable entanglement\nwitness which provides some level of information about the entanglement\nstructure of the probed state. A fundamental quantity of quantum metrology is\nthe quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a rigorous witness of\nmultipartite entanglement that can be evaluated from linear response functions\nfor certain states. In this work, we explore measuring the QFI of molecular\nexciton states of the first-excitation subspace from spectroscopy. In\nparticular, we utilize the fact that the linear response of a pure state\nsubject to a weak electric field over all possible driving frequencies encodes\nthe variance of the collective dipole moment in the probed state, which is a\nvalid measure for QFI. The systems that are investigated include the molecular\ndimer, $N$-site linear aggregate with nearest-neighbor coupling, and $N$-site\ncircular aggregate, all modeled as a collection of interacting qubits. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the variance of the collective dipole moment in\nthe brightest dipole-allowed eigenstate is the maximum QFI. The optical\nresponse of a thermally equilibrated state in the first-excitation subspace is\nalso a valid QFI. Theoretical predictions of the measured QFI for realistic\nlinear dye aggregates as a function of temperature and energetic disorder due\nto static variations of the host matrix show that 2- to 3-partite entanglement\nis realizable.

It shows that besides a\nsmall source error, both the discrepancy between the feature distributions and\nthe discrepancy between the labeling functions should be small across domains.\nThe discrepancy between the labeling functions is essentially the cross-domain\nerrors which are ignored by existing methods. To overcome this issue, in this\npaper, a novel method is proposed to integrate all the objectives into a\nunified optimization framework. Moreover, the incorrect pseudo labels widely\nused in previous methods can lead to error accumulation during learning. To\nalleviate this problem, the pseudo labels are obtained by utilizing structural\ninformation of the target domain besides source classifier and we propose a\ncurriculum learning based strategy to select the target samples with more\naccurate pseudo-labels during training. Comprehensive experiments are\nconducted, and the results validate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 02:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

B20-type CoSi is a prototypal material that accommodates such an\nexotic quasiparticle. To date, the spin transport properties in the spin-1\nchiral semimetals, have not been explored yet. In this work, we fabricated\nB20-CoSi thin films on sapphire c-plane substrates by magnetron sputtering and\nstudied the spin Hall effect (SHE) by combining experiments and\nfirst-principles calculations. The SHE of CoSi using CoSi/CoFeB/MgO\nheterostructures was investigated via spin Hall magnetoresistance and harmonic\nHall measurements. First-principles calculations yield an intrinsic spin Hall\nconductivity (SHC) at the Fermi level that is consistent with the experiments\nand reveal its unique Fermi-energy dependence. Unlike the Dirac and Weyl\nfermion-mediated Hall conductivities that exhibit a peak-like structure\ncentering around the topological node, SHC of B20-CoSi is odd and crosses zero\nat the node with two antisymmetric local extrema of opposite sign situated\nbelow and above in energy. Hybridization between Co d-Si p orbitals and\nspin-orbit coupling are essential for the SHC, despite the small (~1%) weight\nof Si p-orbital near the Fermi level.

Since several given topics\nonly provide limited source information, utilizing various topic-related\nknowledge is essential for improving essay generation performance. However,\nprevious works cannot sufficiently use that knowledge to facilitate the\ngeneration procedure. This paper aims to improve essay generation by extracting\ninformation from both internal and external knowledge. Thus, a topic-to-essay\ngeneration model with comprehensive knowledge enhancement, named TEGKE, is\nproposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays\nare fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features\nwould be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network\nwhich only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared\nwith the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge\ngraph encoder is proposed.

Based on\nthe HID, the source was in the soft banana state during these observations.\nSpectral modeling was performed using the full reflection framework and an\ninner disk radii of 14 Rg was obtained. A hard powerlaw tail was noticed in the\nsoft state and hot component fluxes and varying powerlaw indices point towards\na varying corona/sub-keplerian flow. Based on the spectral fits the boundary\nlayer radius and magnetospheric radius were constrained to be $\\sim$ 14-18 km\nand $\\sim$ 9-19 km respectively. Cross- Correlation Function studies were\nperformed between the 0.8-3 keV soft SXT lightcurve and 10-20 keV hard LAXPC\nlightcurve and correlated and anticorrelated lags were found, which was used to\nconstrain the coronal height to 0.6-20 km (\\b{eta}=0.1). Since the inner disk\nradius is not varying during the observations, we conclude that the detected\nlags are possibly caused by a varying structure of corona/boundary layer in the\ninner region of the accretion disk.

Therefore, this paper proposes\na novel VLP algorithm and addresses the problems in terms of practicality and\ncomplexity by using one non-point transmitter based on a monocular. Because the\nshape of the transmitter is considered, the proposed algorithm is easy for\npractice and has wide applicability. Besides, it decreases the computation for\nsimple geometric model and expands the coverage for there is a greater chance\nof receiving signals from one light than that of receiving signals from\nmultiple lights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 08:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Due to the\ndependence of the energy spectrum of the EQS on the position of the massive\nparticle (via the redshift) at zero temperature, our model predicts\ngravitational decoherence of the massive particle in the position basis. We\nshow that the decoherence effect is multiplicative, in the sense that the\nincrease in number of EQS gravitationally interacting with a single massive\nparticle leads to an increase in its decoherence. If the considered model of\ngravitational redshift holds alongside the linearity of quantum mechanics (as\nan appropriate limit of an accepted theory for coupling quantum matter with\ngravity) to allow for a spatial superposition of the source mass, we propose\nthat the same methodology can be applied to continuous fields, which are\nessentially EQS. This could provide an upper limit on the number of\nundiscovered fields by observing coherent superpositions of masses, e.g., in a\nmatter wave interferometer.

We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named\nTUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers\nand capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every\nsingle image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by\nskip and residual connections. We pose the problem as a per pixel colour\nclassification task that identifies colours as a bin in a quantized space. To\ntrain the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we\npropose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by\nonly manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this\nscheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images\nand progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training\nphase.

A Dyson Sphere, a spherical structure that surrounds a star\nand transports its radiative energy outward as an energy source for an advanced\ncivilisation, is one of the main targets of SETI. In this study, we discuss\nwhether building a Dyson Sphere around a black hole is effective. We consider\nsix energy sources: (i) the cosmic microwave background, (ii) the Hawking\nradiation, (iii) an accretion disk, (iv) Bondi accretion, (v) a corona, and\n(vi) relativistic jets. To develop future civilisations (for example, a Type II\ncivilisation), $4\\times10^{26}\\,{\\rm W}$($1\\,{\\rm L_{\\odot}}$) is expected to\nbe needed. Among (iii) to (vi), the largest luminosity can be collected from an\naccretion disk, reaching $10^{5}\\,{\\rm L_{\\odot}}$, enough to maintain a Type\nII civilisation. Moreover, if a Dyson Sphere collects not only the\nelectromagnetic radiation but also other types of energy (e.g., kinetic energy)\nfrom the jets, the total collected energy would be approximately 5 times\nlarger.

Hard\nMREs, whose coercivities are large, have been receiving particular attention\nbecause the programmed magnetization remains unchanged upon actuation. Hence,\nonce a structure made of a hard MRE is magnetized, it can be regarded as\nmagnetized permanently. Motivated by a new realm of applications, there have\nbeen significant theoretical developments in the continuum description of hard\nMREs.

In\nprecisely this spirit, here we consider a multi-interacting dark energy model\nwith two complementary interaction channels: one with the dark matter and one\nwith the photons. The former most significantly affects the matter dominated\nepoch as well as the very late universe, and has been shown to be able to\nsignificantly resolve the $S_8$ tension. The latter has been introduced in this\nwork to allow for a larger and natural time dependence of the evolution of the\nuniverse since it mostly impacts the radiation dominated epoch as well as the\ntemperature scaling of the photons, as extensively explained in the text. As a\nresult, considering data from Planck+BAO+Pantheon+KV450+DES (which can be\ncombined since the $S_8$ value is lowered even neglecting the weak lensing\ndata) we find that the significance of the $H_0$ tension only reduces to about\n3.5$\\sigma$, while that of the $S_8$ tension falls below the 2$\\sigma$ level.\nAlso, the statistical analysis we perform strongly favors $\\Lambda$CDM in all\nconsidered cases.

As the operation on the power grid must consider its impact\non future stability, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to provide\nsequential decision-making in power grid management. However, existing methods\nhave not considered the environmental constraints. As a result, the learned\npolicy has risk of selecting actions that violate the constraints in\nemergencies, which will escalate the issue of overloaded power lines and lead\nto large-scale blackouts. In this work, we propose a novel method for this\nproblem, which builds on top of the search-based planning algorithm. At the\nplanning stage, the search space is limited to the action set produced by the\npolicy. The selected action strictly follows the constraints by testing its\noutcome with the simulation function provided by the system. At the learning\nstage, to address the problem that gradients cannot be propagated to the\npolicy, we introduce Evolutionary Strategies (ES) with black-box policy\noptimization to improve the policy directly, maximizing the returns of the long\nrun.

While deep learning has set the\nstate of the art in many machine learning tasks, it is only recently that it\nhas proven effective on small-sized datasets, primarily thanks to pre-training,\na semi-supervised learning technique that leverages abundant unlabelled data\nalongside scarce labelled data.In this work, we evaluate pre-trained\nTransformer models on a selection of 13 smaller datasets from the SE\nliterature, covering both,source code and natural language. Our results suggest\nthat pre-trained Transformers are competitive and in some cases superior to\nprevious models, especially for tasks involving natural language; whereas for\nsource code tasks, in particular for very small datasets,traditional machine\nlearning methods often has the edge.In addition, we experiment with several\ntechniques that ought to aid training on small datasets, including active\nlearning, data augmentation, soft labels, self-training and intermediate-task\nfine-tuning, and issue recommendations on when they are effective.

Our analysis is based on\nthe standard non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS), and allows for heterogeneous local data distributions and unbalanced\nlocal datasets. We prove that the estimation errors, measured in either the\nempirical norm or the RKHS norm, decay with a rate of 1/t in general and\nexponentially for finite-rank kernels.

To\ntackle the problem of exponentially large space, we propose two approximation\nmethods, top region evaluation along with an exact top-$k$ decoding algorithm,\nwhich finds top-ranked hypotheses in the whole hypothesis space, and Monte\nCarlo sampling evaluation, which simulates hypothesis space from a broader\nperspective. To quantify errors, we define our NMT model errors by measuring\ndistance between the hypothesis array ranked by the model and the ideally\nranked hypothesis array. After confirming the strong correlation with human\njudgment, we apply our evaluation to various NMT benchmarks and model\narchitectures.

We propose a generic on-manifold MPC\nformulation based on a canonical representation of the system evolving on\nmanifolds. Then, we present a method that solves the on-manifold MPC\nformulation by linearizing the system along the trajectory under tracking.\nThere are two main advantages of the proposed scheme. The first is that the\nlinearized system leads to an equivalent error system represented by a set of\nminimal parameters without any singularity. Secondly, the process of system\nmodeling, error-system derivation, linearization and control has the manifold\nconstraints completely decoupled from the system descriptions, enabling the\ndevelopment of a symbolic MPC framework that naturally encapsulates the\nmanifold constraints. In this framework, users need only to supply\nsystem-specific descriptions without dealing with the manifold constraints.

Overall, the SN appears as a \"transitional\" event between \"normal\"\nSNe Ia and very dim SNe Ia such as 91bg-like SNe. Its peculiarity is that two\nlate-time spectra taken at +84 and +142 days after the peak show a narrow line\nof Halpha (with full width at half-maximum of ~650 and 1000 kms-1,\nrespectively).

The updating mode then determines how the configuration of the\nnetwork evolves over time. Many of updating modes from the literature,\nincluding synchronous and asynchronous modes, can be defined as the composition\nof elementary deterministic configuration updates, i.e., by functions mapping\nconfigurations of the network. Nevertheless, alternative dynamics have been\nintroduced using ad-hoc auxiliary objects, such as that resulting from binary\nprojections of Memory Boolean networks, or that resulting from additional\npseudo-states for Most Permissive Boolean networks. One may wonder whether\nthese latter dynamics can still be classified as updating modes of finite\nBoolean networks, or belong to a different class of dynamical systems. In this\npaper, we study the extension of updating modes to the composition of\nnon-deterministic updates, i.e., mapping sets of finite configurations. We show\nthat the above dynamics can be expressed in this framework, enabling a better\nunderstanding of them as updating modes of Boolean networks.

Without disorder, the Creutz ladder exhibits flat-band many-body\nlocalization (FMBL). In this work, we find that disorder generates drastic\neffects on the system, i.e., addition of it induces a thermal phase first and\nfurther increase of it leads the system to the conventional many-body-localized\n(MBL) phase. The competition gives novel localization properties and\nunconventional quench dynamics to the system. We first draw the global sketch\nof the localization phase diagram by focusing on the two-particle system. The\nthermal phase intrudes between the FMBL and MBL phases, the regime of which\ndepends on the strength of disorder and interactions. Based on the two-particle\nphase diagram and the properties of the quench dynamics, we further investigate\nfinite-filling cases in detail. At finite-filling fractions, we again find that\nthe interplay/competition between the interactions and disorder in the original\nflat-band Creutz ladder induces thermal phase, which separates the FMBL and MBL\nphases.

Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to re-construct\nthe high-resolution (HR) thin-slice MR images from those low-resolution (LR)\ncases, which we refer to as the slice interpolation task in this work. However,\nsince it is generally difficult to sample abundant paired LR-HR MR images, the\nclassical fully supervised DL-based models cannot be effectively trained to get\nrobust performance. To this end, we propose a novel Two-stage Self-supervised\nCycle-consistency Network (TSCNet) for MR slice interpolation, in which a\ntwo-stage self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy is developed for unsupervised\nDL network training. The paired LR-HR images are synthesized along the sagittal\nand coronal directions of input LR images for network pretraining in the\nfirst-stage SSL, and then a cyclic in-terpolation procedure based on triplet\naxial slices is designed in the second-stage SSL for further refinement. More\ntraining samples with rich contexts along all directions are exploited as\nguidance to guarantee the improved in-terpolation performance. Moreover, a new\ncycle-consistency constraint is proposed to supervise this cyclic procedure,\nwhich encourages the network to reconstruct more realistic HR images.

The rotation is supplied by the bacterial flagellar motor, a\nparticularly powerful rotary molecular machine. At the base of each flagellum\nis the hook, a soft helical polymer that acts as a universal joint, coupling\nrotation of the rigid membrane-spanning rotor to rotation of the rigid\nextra-cellular flagellum. In multi-flagellated bacterial species, where thrust\nis provided by a hydrodynamically coordinated bundle of flagella, the\nflexibility of the hook is particularly crucial, as many of the flagella within\nthe bundle rotate significantly off-axis from their motor. But, consequently,\nthe thrust produced by a single rotating flagellum applies a significant\nbending moment to the hook. So, the hook needs to simultaneously provide the\ncompliance necessary for off-axis bundle formation and the rigidity necessary\nto withstand the large hydrodynamical forces of swimming. To elucidate how the\nhook can fulfill this double functionality, measurements of the mechanical\nbehavior of individual hooks under dynamical conditions are needed. Here, via\nnew high-resolution measurements and a novel analysis of hook fluctuations\nduring in vivo motor rotation in bead assays, we resolve the elastic response\nof single hooks under increasing torsional stress, revealing a clear dynamic\nincrease in their bending stiffness. Accordingly, the persistence length of the\nhook increases by more than one order of magnitude with applied torque. Such\nstrain-stiffening allows the system to be flexible when needed yet reduce\ndeformation under high loads, allowing cellular motility at high speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

They comprise a collection of scalar functions such that birth and\ndeath times of topological features in persistence diagrams map to extrema of\nfunctions and intervals where they are non-zero. As a consequence, variation in\npersistence diagrams is encoded in both amplitude and phase components of\npersistence landscapes. Through functional data analysis of persistence\nlandscapes, under an elastic Riemannian metric, we show how meaningful\nstatistical summaries of persistence landscapes (e.g., mean, dominant\ndirections of variation) can be obtained by decoupling their amplitude and\nphase variations. This decoupling is achieved via optimal alignment, with\nrespect to the elastic metric, of the persistence landscapes.

Despite opening up new market opportunities\nand use cases for the future, the novel impairments caused by the signal\npropagation over the NTN channel compromises several procedures of the current\ncellular standards. One of the first and most important procedures impacted is\nthe random access (RA) procedure, which is mainly utilized for achieving uplink\nsynchronization among users in several standards, such as the fourth and fifth\ngeneration of mobile communication (4 & 5G) and narrowband internet of things\n(NB-IoT). In this work, we analyse the challenges imposed by the considerably\nincreased delay in the communication link on the RA procedure and propose new\nsolutions to overcome those challenges. A trade-off analysis of various\nsolutions is provided taking into account also the already existing ones in the\nliterature. In order to broaden the scope of applicability, we keep the\nanalysis general targeting 4G, 5G and NB-IoT systems since the RA procedure is\nquasi-identical among these technologies. Last but not least, we go one step\nfurther and validate our techniques in an experimental setup, consisting of a\nuser and a base station implemented in open air interface (OAI), and an NTN\nchannel implemented in hardware that emulates the signal propagation delay. The\nlaboratory test-bed built in this work, not only enables us to validate various\nsolutions, but also plays a crucial role in identifying novel challenges not\npreviously treated in the literature. Finally, an important key performance\nindicator (KPI) of the RA procedure over NTN is shown, which is the time that a\nsingle user requires to establish a connection with the base station.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

For NGC 2243 the Li abundances are from the catalogues released by the\nGaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey, while for NGC 104 we measured the Li\nabundance using FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra, which include archival data and new\nobservations. We took the initial Li of NGC 2243 to be the lithium measured in\nstars on the hot side of the Li dip. We used the difference between the initial\nabundances and the post first dredge-up Li values of NGC 2243, and by adding\nthis amount to the post first dredge-up stars of NGC~104 we were able to infer\nthe initial Li of this cluster. Moreover, we compared our observational results\nto the predictions of theoretical stellar models for the difference between the\ninitial Li abundance and that after the first dredge-up. The initial lithium\ncontent of NGC 2243 was found to be A(Li)_i = 2.85dex by taking the average Li\nabundance measured from the five hottest stars with the highest lithium\nabundance. This value is 1.69 dex higher than the lithium abundance derived in\npost first dredge-up stars. By adding this number to the lithium abundance\nderived in the post first dredge-up stars in NGC~104, we infer a lower limit of\nits initial lithium content of A(Li)_i= 2.30dex.

Such emission has commonly been shown to be\ncoherent emission, generally attributed to electron-cyclotron maser emission,\nand has usually been detected from main-sequence M dwarfs. Here we report the\nfirst detection of coherent emission at low frequencies from T Tauri stars,\nwhich are known to be associated with high levels of stellar activity. Using\nLOFAR, we have detected several bright radio bursts at 150 MHz from two\nweak-line T Tauri stars: KPNO-Tau 14 and LkCa 4. All of the bursts have high\nbrightness temperatures ($10^{13} - 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{K}$) and high circular\npolarization fractions (60 - 90 \\%), indicating that they must be due to a\ncoherent emission mechanism. This could be either plasma emission or\nelectron-cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. Due to the exceptionally high\nbrightness temperatures seen in at least one of the bursts ($\\geq 10^{14}\\\n\\mathrm{K}$), and the high circular polarization levels, it seems unlikely that\nplasma emission could be the source and so ECM is favoured as the most likely\nemission mechanism. Assuming this is the case, the required magnetic field in\nthe emission regions would be 40 - 70 G. We determine that the most likely\nmethod of generating ECM emission is plasma co-rotation breakdown in the\nstellar magnetosphere. There remains the possibility, however, it could be due\nto an interaction with an orbiting exoplanet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The interest in these decays lies in\nthe fact that the physics beyond the Standard Model does not need to be\naffected by the same suppression mechanism and therefore can naturally manifest\nin these decays. Their interest is reinforced by the recent report of several\nmeasurements of $b$-flavoured rare decays, showing deviations with respect to\nthe Standard Model predictions. We will show how the FCC-ee project has unique\ncapabilities to address these scientific questions and will consider the\nrelated detector design challenges to meet.

Most previous studies either only focus on the frequent ICD codes or\ntreat rare and frequent ICD codes in the same way. These methods perform well\non frequent ICD codes but due to the extremely unbalanced distribution of ICD\ncodes, the performance on rare ones is far from satisfactory. We seek to\nimprove the performance for both frequent and rare ICD codes by using a\ncontrastive graph-based EHR coding framework, CoGraph, which re-casts EHR\ncoding as a few-shot learning task. First, we construct a heterogeneous EHR\nword-entity (HEWE) graph for each EHR, where the words and entities extracted\nfrom an EHR serve as nodes and the relations between them serve as edges. Then,\nCoGraph learns similarities and dissimilarities between HEWE graphs from\ndifferent ICD codes so that information can be transferred among them. In a\nfew-shot learning scenario, the model only has access to frequent ICD codes\nduring training, which might force it to encode features that are useful for\nfrequent ICD codes only. To mitigate this risk, CoGraph devises two graph\ncontrastive learning schemes, GSCL and GECL, that exploit the HEWE graph\nstructures so as to encode transferable features. GSCL utilizes the\nintra-correlation of different sub-graphs sampled from HEWE graphs while GECL\nexploits the inter-correlation among HEWE graphs at different clinical stages.\nExperiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that CoGraph significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on EHR coding, not only on frequent ICD\ncodes, but also on rare codes, in terms of several evaluation indicators. On\nfrequent ICD codes, GSCL and GECL improve the classification accuracy and F1 by\n1.31% and 0.61%, respectively, and on rare ICD codes CoGraph has more obvious\nimprovements by 2.12% and 2.95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

This motivates the work in this\npaper, where we report on a five-month measurement study of the wireless access\nlatency between connected vehicles and a fog/cloud computing system supported\nby commercially available LTE networks. We propose AdaptiveFog, a novel\nframework for autonomous and dynamic switching between different LTE networks\nthat implement a fog/cloud infrastructure. AdaptiveFog's main objective is to\nmaximize the service confidence level, defined as the probability that the\nlatency of a given service type is below some threshold. To quantify the\nperformance gap between different LTE networks, we introduce a novel\nstatistical distance metric, called weighted Kantorovich-Rubinstein (K-R)\ndistance. Two scenarios based on finite- and infinite-horizon optimization of\nshort-term and long-term confidence are investigated. For each scenario, a\nsimple threshold policy based on weighted K-R distance is proposed and proved\nto maximize the latency confidence for smart vehicles.

A recent work brought out a\npeculiar property of the popular completely random measures (CRMs) as prior\nmodels in Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) inference for the unseen-features\nproblem: for fixed prior's parameters, they all lead to a Poisson posterior\ndistribution for the number of unseen features, which depends on the sampling\ninformation only through the sample size. CRMs are thus not a flexible prior\nmodel for the unseen-features problem and, while the Poisson posterior\ndistribution may be appealing for analytical tractability and ease of\ninterpretability, its independence from the sampling information makes the BNP\napproach a questionable oversimplification, with posterior inferences being\ncompletely determined by the estimation of unknown prior's parameters. In this\npaper, we introduce the stable-Beta scaled process (SB-SP) prior, and we show\nthat it allows to enrich the posterior distribution of the number of unseen\nfeatures arising under CRM priors, while maintaining its analytical\ntractability and interpretability. That is, the SB-SP prior leads to a negative\nBinomial posterior distribution, which depends on the sampling information\nthrough the sample size and the number of distinct features, with corresponding\nestimates being simple, linear in the sampling information and computationally\nefficient. We apply our BNP approach to synthetic data and to real cancer\ngenomic data, showing that: i) it outperforms the most popular parametric and\nnonparametric competitors in terms of estimation accuracy; ii) it provides\nimproved coverage for the estimation with respect to a BNP approach under CRM\npriors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 15:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 11:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Personalized federated\nlearning (PFL) further extends this setup to handle data heterogeneity between\nclients by learning personalized models. A key challenge in this setting is to\nlearn effectively across clients even though each client has unique data that\nis often limited in size. Here we present pFedGP, a solution to PFL that is\nbased on Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernel learning. GPs are highly\nexpressive models that work well in the low data regime due to their Bayesian\nnature. However, applying GPs to PFL raises multiple challenges. Mainly, GPs\nperformance depends heavily on access to a good kernel function, and learning a\nkernel requires a large training set. Therefore, we propose learning a shared\nkernel function across all clients, parameterized by a neural network, with a\npersonal GP classifier for each client. We further extend pFedGP to include\ninducing points using two novel methods, the first helps to improve\ngeneralization in the low data regime and the second reduces the computational\ncost. We derive a PAC-Bayes generalization bound on novel clients and\nempirically show that it gives non-vacuous guarantees. Extensive experiments on\nstandard PFL benchmarks with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10, and on a new\nsetup of learning under input noise show that pFedGP achieves well-calibrated\npredictions while significantly outperforming baseline methods, reaching up to\n21% in accuracy gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 15:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 08:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Assuming that the\neigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of the linear systems of equations can be\nrepresented perfectly by finite binary number strings, three hybrid iterative\nphase estimation algorithms (HIPEA) are designed based on the iterative phase\nestimation algorithm in this paper. The complexity is transferred to the\nmeasurement operation in an iterative way, and thus the demand of qubit\nresources is reduced in our hybrid algorithms. Moreover, the solution is stored\nin a classical register instead of a quantum register, so the exact\nunnormalized solution can be obtained.

We find the ion flow to\nconsistently be much faster than the neutral gas over the entire mission,\nlending further evidence that the ions are collisionally decoupled from the\nneutrals in the coma. RPC measurements of ion speeds are therefore not\nconsistent with the assumptions made in previously published plasma density\nmodels of the comet ionosphere at the start and end of the mission.

This problem, known as the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem\n(GOPP), plays a fundamental role in several scientific disciplines including\nstatistics, imaging science and computer vision. Despite its tremendous\npractical importance, it is still a challenging computational problem due to\nthe inherent nonconvexity. In this paper, we study the semidefinite programming\n(SDP) relaxation of the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problems and prove\nthat the tightness of the SDP relaxation holds, i.e., the SDP estimator exactly\nequals the least squares estimator, if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is\nrelatively large. We also prove that an efficient generalized power method with\na proper initialization enjoys global linear convergence to the least squares\nestimator. In addition, we analyze the Burer-Monteiro factorization and show\nthe corresponding optimization landscape is free of spurious local optima if\nthe SNR is large. This explains why first-order Riemannian gradient methods\nwith random initializations usually produce a satisfactory solution despite the\nnonconvexity. One highlight of our work is that the theoretical guarantees are\npurely algebraic and do not require any assumptions on the statistical property\nof the noise. Our results partially resolve one open problem posed in\n[Bandeira, Khoo, Singer, 2014] on the tightness of the SDP relaxation in\nsolving the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem.

This is due to\nthe fact that, while the objective function is insensitive to updates in\nunlikely states, the agent may still need improvements in those states in order\nto reach a nearly optimal payoff. For this reason, wide coverage is used in\nsome form when analyzing theoretical properties of practical policy gradient\nmethods. However, this assumption can be unfeasible in certain environments,\nfor instance when learning is online, or when restarts are possible only from a\nfixed initial state. In these cases, classical policy gradient algorithms can\nhave very poor convergence properties and sample efficiency. In this paper, we\ndevelop Curious Explorer, a novel and simple iterative state space exploration\nstrategy that can be used with any starting distribution $\\rho$. Curious\nExplorer starts from $\\rho$, then using intrinsic rewards assigned to the set\nof poorly visited states produces a sequence of policies, each one more\nexploratory than the previous one in an informed way, and finally outputs a\nrestart model $\\mu$ based on the state visitation distribution of the\nexploratory policies. Curious Explorer is provable, in the sense that we\nprovide theoretical upper bounds on how often an optimal policy visits poorly\nvisited states. These bounds can be used to prove PAC convergence and sample\nefficiency results when a PAC optimizer is plugged in Curious Explorer. This\nallows to achieve global convergence and sample efficiency results without any\ncoverage assumption for REINFORCE, and potentially for any other policy\ngradient method ensuring PAC convergence with wide coverage. Finally, we plug\n(the output of) Curious Explorer into REINFORCE and TRPO, and show empirically\nthat it can improve performance in MDPs with challenging exploration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 15:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The methods are favoured because their intervals have\na shorter average length than the Clopper-Pearson (gold-standard) method, whose\nintervals really are confidence intervals. Comparison of such methods is tricky\n-- the best method should perhaps be the one that gives the shortest intervals\n(on average), but when is the coverage of a method so poor that it should not\nbe classed as a means of forming confidence intervals?\n  As the definition of a confidence interval is not being adhered to, another\ncriterion for forming interval estimates for a binomial proportion is needed.\nIn this paper we suggest a new criterion; methods which meet the criterion are\nsaid to yield $\\textit{locally correct confidence intervals}$. We propose a\nmethod that yields such intervals and prove that its intervals have a shorter\naverage length than those of any other method that meets the criterion.\nCompared with the Clopper-Pearson method, the proposed method gives intervals\nwith an appreciably smaller average length.

Often, the cyber physical architecture\nand infrastructure is focused on functionality and the delivery of the specific\napplications.\n  But we find that technologies and approaches have arisen from other fields\nthat, if used within SLES, could support the flexibility, scalability and\nreusability vital to their success. As these can improve the operational data\nsystems then they can also be used to enhance predictive functions If used and\ndeployed effectively, these new approaches can offer longer term improvements\nin the use and effectiveness of SLES, while allowing the concepts and designs\nto be capitalised upon through wider roll-out and the offering of commercial\nservices or products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

While recent works demonstrated limited success on domain-specific\nlanguages (DSL), it remains highly challenging to apply them to real-world\nprogramming languages, such as C. Due to complicated syntax and token\nvariation, there are three major challenges: (1) unlike many DSLs, programs in\nlanguages like C need to compile first and are not executed via interpreters;\n(2) the program search space grows exponentially when the syntax and semantics\nof the programming language become more complex; and (3) collecting a\nlarge-scale dataset of real-world programs is non-trivial. As a first step to\naddress these challenges, we propose LaSynth and show its efficacy in a\nrestricted-C domain. More specifically, LaSynth learns the latent\nrepresentation to approximate the execution of partially generated programs,\neven if they are incomplete in syntax (addressing (1)). The learned execution\nsignificantly improves the performance of next token prediction over existing\napproaches, facilitating search (addressing (2)). Finally, once trained with\nrandomly generated ground-truth programs and their IO pairs, LaSynth can\nsynthesize more concise programs that resemble human-written code. Furthermore,\nretraining our model with these synthesized programs yields better performance\nwith fewer samples for both Karel and C program synthesis, indicating the\npromise of leveraging the learned program synthesizer to improve the dataset\nquality for input-output program synthesis (addressing (3)). When evaluating on\nwhether the program execution outputs match the IO pairs, LaSynth achieves\n55.2% accuracy on generating simple C code with tens of tokens including loops\nand branches, outperforming existing approaches without executors by around\n20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 02:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 12:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

The materials are assumed to\nbe possibly intertwined in space, but at any given location there is only one\nmaterial present. Further, two X-ray energies are chosen so that there is a\nclear difference in the spectral dependence of the attenuation coefficients of\nthe two materials. A novel regularizer is presented for the inverse problem of\nreconstructing separate tomographic images for the two materials. A combination\nof two things, (a) non-negativity constraint, and (b) penalty term containing\nthe inner product between the two material images, promotes the presence of at\nmost one material in a given pixel. A preconditioned interior point method is\nderived for the minimization of the regularization functional. Numerical tests\nwith digital phantoms suggest that the new algorithm outperforms the baseline\nmethod, Joint Total Variation regularization, in terms of correctly\nmaterial-characterized pixels. While the method is tested only in a\ntwo-dimensional setting with two materials and two energies, the approach\nreadily generalizes to three dimensions and more materials. The number of\nmaterials just needs to match the number of energies used in imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 19:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Analytical\ncontrollers often fail in the presence of dense configurations, due to the\ndifficulty of grasping between adjacent cable segments. We present two\nalgorithms that enhance robust cable untangling, LOKI and SPiDERMan, which\noperate alongside HULK, a high-level planner from prior work. LOKI uses a\nlearned model of manipulation features to refine a coarse grasp keypoint\nprediction to a precise, optimized location and orientation, while SPiDERMan\nuses a learned model to sense task progress and apply recovery actions. We\nevaluate these algorithms in physical cable untangling experiments with 336\nknots and over 1500 actions on real cables using the da Vinci surgical robot.\nWe find that the combination of HULK, LOKI, and SPiDERMan is able to untangle\ndense overhand, figure-eight, double-overhand, square, bowline, granny,\nstevedore, and triple-overhand knots. The composition of these methods\nsuccessfully untangles a cable from a dense initial configuration in 68.3% of\n60 physical experiments and achieves 50% higher success rates than baselines\nfrom prior work.

It uses Fourier basis patterns as structured patterns for spatial\ninformation acquisition in the Fourier domain. However, the spatial resolution\nof the image reconstructed by FSI mainly depends on the number of Fourier\ncoefficients sampled. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image typically\nrequires a number of Fourier coefficients to be sampled, and therefore takes a\nlong data acquisition time. Here we propose a new sampling strategy for FSI. It\nallows FSI to reconstruct a clear and sharp image with a reduced number of\nmeasurements. The core of the proposed sampling strategy is to perform a\nvariable density sampling in the Fourier space and, more importantly, the\ndensity with respect to the importance of Fourier coefficients is subject to a\none-dimensional Gaussian function. Combined with compressive sensing, the\nproposed sampling strategy enables better reconstruction quality than\nconventional sampling strategies, especially when the sampling ratio is low. We\nexperimentally demonstrate compressive FSI combined with the proposed sampling\nstrategy is able to reconstruct a sharp and clear image of 256-by-256 pixels\nwith a sampling ratio of 10%.

The variation of the\npressure of the fluid, which represents detected signals, are indeed much\nhigher than the correspondent values of GWs amplitudes.
