In\nthis regard, several recent studies have employed state-of-the-art regression\nmodels in order to achieve a good prediction model, employing available\nexperimental data sets. Nevertheless, while each of the employed models can\nbetter adapt to a specific nature of the input data, the accuracy of each\nindividual model is limited due to the sensitivity to the choice of\nhyperparameters and the learning strategy. In the present work, we take a\nfurther step towards improving the accuracy of the prediction model via the\nweighted combination of multiple regression methods. Moreover, a (GA)-based\nmulti-objective mixture optimization is proposed, building on the obtained\nmulti-regression model. In particular, we present a data aided framework where\nthe regression methods based on artificial neural network, random forest\nregression, and polynomial regression are jointly implemented to predict the\ncompressive strength of concrete. The outcome of the individual regression\nmodels are then combined via a linear weighting strategy and optimized over the\ntraining data set as a quadratic convex optimization problem. It is worth\nmentioning that due to the convexity of the formulated problem, the globally\noptimum weighting strategy is obtained via standard numerical solvers.\nEmploying the proposed GA-based optimization, a Pareto front of the cost-CS\ntrade-of has been obtained employing the available data set. Moreover, the\nresulting accuracy of the proposed multi-model prediction method is shown to\noutperform the available single-model regression methods in the literature by a\nvaluable margin, via numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 16:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

However, interpreting the outputs of these\nmodels remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be\nachieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the\noutput, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection\nmodels can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of\nmalignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and\nrequires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised\nlocalization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to\noutput saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the\nclassification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only\nimage-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during\ntraining. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce\nlow-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which\nsuspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised\nsegmentation of high-resolution images.

Today's fashionable heuristic formulations pose non-convex\noptimization problems which are then attacked heuristically as well. The fact\nthat blind deconvolution can be solved under some repeatable and\nnaturally-occurring circumstances poses a theoretical puzzle.\n  To bridge the gulf between reported successes and theory's limited\nunderstanding, we exhibit a convex optimization problem that -- assuming signal\nsparsity -- can convert a crude approximation to the true filter into a\nhigh-accuracy recovery of the true filter. Our proposed formulation is based on\nL1 minimization of inverse filter outputs. We give sharp guarantees on\nperformance of the minimizer assuming sparsity of signal, showing that our\nproposal precisely recovers the true inverse filter, up to shift and rescaling.\nThere is a sparsity/initial accuracy tradeoff: the less accurate the initial\napproximation, the greater we rely on sparsity to enable exact recovery. To our\nknowledge this is the first reported tradeoff of this kind. We consider it\nsurprising that this tradeoff is independent of dimension.\n  We also develop finite-$N$ guarantees, for highly accurate reconstruction\nunder $N\\geq O(k \\log(k) )$ with high probability.

Moreover, the three-qubit\nstate has a cyclic steering property in the sense, that by arranging the system\nin a triangular configuration the neighboring parties can steer each others'\nstates only in the same (e.g. clockwise) direction. That is, Alice can steer\nBob's state, Bob can steer Charlie's state, and Charlie can steer Alice's\nstate, but not the other way around.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 20:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

In this\noptimization process, benchmark circuits are an essential component; the QoR\nachieved on a set of benchmarks is the main driver for architecture and CAD\ndesign choices. However, current academic benchmark suites are inadequate, as\nthey do not capture any designs from the DL domain. This work presents a new\nsuite of DL acceleration benchmark circuits for FPGA architecture and CAD\nresearch, called Koios. This suite of 19 circuits covers a wide variety of\naccelerated neural networks, design sizes, implementation styles, abstraction\nlevels, and numerical precisions. These designs are larger, more data parallel,\nmore heterogeneous, more deeply pipelined, and utilize more FPGA architectural\nfeatures compared to existing open-source benchmarks. This enables researchers\nto pin-point architectural inefficiencies for this class of workloads and\noptimize CAD tools on more realistic benchmarks that stress the CAD algorithms\nin different ways. In this paper, we describe the designs in our benchmark\nsuite, present results of running them through the Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)\nflow using a recent FPGA architecture model, and identify key insights from the\nresulting metrics. On average, our benchmarks have 3.7x more netlist\nprimitives, 1.8x and 4.7x higher DSP and BRAM densities, and 1.7x higher\nfrequency with 1.9x more near-critical paths compared to the widely-used VTR\nsuite.

In particular, policy search using\nsuch non-parametric policies as Gaussian process regression can learn optimal\nactions with high-dimensional and redundant sensors as input. However, previous\nmethods implicitly assume that the optimal action becomes unique for each\nstate. This assumption can severely limit such practical applications as robot\nmanipulations since designing a reward function that appears in only one\noptimal action for complex tasks is difficult. The previous methods might have\ncaused critical performance deterioration because the typical non-parametric\npolicies cannot capture the optimal actions due to their unimodality. We\npropose novel approaches in non-parametric policy searches with multiple\noptimal actions and offer two different algorithms commonly based on a sparse\nGaussian process prior and variational Bayesian inference. The following are\nthe key ideas: 1) multimodality for capturing multiple optimal actions and 2)\nmode-seeking for capturing one optimal action by ignoring the others. First, we\npropose a multimodal sparse Gaussian process policy search that uses multiple\noverlapped GPs as a prior.

The resulting distance is broadly useful\nfor improving various distance-based downstream tasks, even when no information\nfrom downstream tasks is utilized in the metric learning stage. To gain\ninsights into this approach, we develop a statistical framework to\ntheoretically study how self-supervised metric learning can benefit downstream\ntasks in the context of multi-view data. Under this framework, we show that the\ntarget distance of metric learning satisfies several desired properties for the\ndownstream tasks. On the other hand, our investigation suggests the target\ndistance can be further improved by moderating each direction's weights.

The CFedAvg\nalgorithm can achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(1 / \\sqrt{mKT} + 1 / T)$ convergence rate\nwith a constant learning rate, implying a linear speedup for convergence as the\nnumber of workers increases, where $K$ is the number of local steps, $T$ is the\nnumber of total communication rounds, and $m$ is the total worker number. This\nmatches the convergence rate of distributed/federated learning without\ncompression, thus achieving high communication efficiency while not sacrificing\nlearning accuracy in FL. Furthermore, we extend CFedAvg to cases with\nheterogeneous local steps, which allows different workers to perform a\ndifferent number of local steps to better adapt to their own circumstances. The\ninteresting observation in general is that the noise/variance introduced by\ncompressors does not affect the overall convergence rate order for non-i.i.d.\nFL. We verify the effectiveness of our CFedAvg algorithm on three datasets with\ntwo gradient compression schemes of different compression ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 04:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

The segmentation\nbranch reuses the object features as guidance to separate target object from\nthe neighboring ones within the same bounding box region. To further improve\nthe segmentation quality, we design an auxiliary feature refinement module that\ndensely samples and refines point-wise features in the boundary regions.\nExperimental results on three biological image datasets demonstrate the\nadvantages of our method.

Considering the future deployment of SNN models to\nconstrained neuromorphic devices, many studies have applied techniques\noriginally used for ANN model compression, such as network quantization,\npruning, and knowledge distillation, to SNNs. Among them, existing works on\nknowledge distillation reported accuracy improvements of student SNN model.\nHowever, analysis on energy efficiency, which is also an important feature of\nSNN, was absent. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the performance of the\ndistilled SNN model in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency. In the process,\nwe observe a substantial increase in the number of spikes, leading to energy\ninefficiency, when using the conventional knowledge distillation methods. Based\non this analysis, to achieve energy efficiency, we propose a novel knowledge\ndistillation method with heterogeneous temperature parameters. We evaluate our\nmethod on two different datasets and show that the resulting SNN student\nsatisfies both accuracy improvement and reduction of the number of spikes. On\nMNIST dataset, our proposed student SNN achieves up to 0.09% higher accuracy\nand produces 65% less spikes compared to the student SNN trained with\nconventional knowledge distillation method.

Over several decades, research on anomaly\nmining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these\noccurrences in a wide range of disciplines. Anomaly detection, which aims to\nidentify rare observations, is among the most vital tasks in the world, and has\nshown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud,\nnetwork intrusion, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by\nidentifying outlying data points in the feature space and inherently overlooks\nthe relational information in real-world data. Graphs have been prevalently\nused to represent the structural information, which raises the graph anomaly\ndetection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and\nsub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a database/set of graphs.\nHowever, conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem\nwell because of the complexity of graph data. For the advent of deep learning,\ngraph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention\nrecently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive\nreview of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly\ndetection.

In both\napproaches, Stokes' drag is treated by an approximate ``linear filter'' which\nreplaces the particle position entering the fluid velocity field by the\ncorresponding ideal tracer position. Effects of preferential concentration of\ninertial particles are taken into account in terms of an effective Stokes\nnumber that is determined from the zero crossing of the acceleration\ncorrelation function from DNS. This approximation thus allows the modeling of\ninertial particle statistics through stochastic methods and models for the\nLagrangian velocity; the particle velocity is effectively decoupled from the\nparticle position. In contrast to the ordinary filtering technique [Cencini et\nal., J. Turbul.

We study four variants of the problem\ndepending on whether the transmitter and/or adversary have access to the fading\ngains; we assume the receiver always knows the fading gains. In two variants\nthe adversary does not have access to the gains, we show that the capacity\ncorresponds to the capacity of a standard point-to-point fading channel with\nincreased noise variance. The capacity of the other two cases, in which the\nadversary has knowledge of the channel gains, are determined by the worst-case\nnoise variance as a function of the channel gain subject to the jammer's power\nconstraint; if the jammer has enough power, then it can imitate the legitimate\nuser's channel, causing the capacity to drop to zero.

The key challenge for VSR lies in the\neffective exploitation of spatial correlation in an intra-frame and temporal\ndependency between consecutive frames. However, most of the previous methods\ntreat different types of the spatial features identically and extract spatial\nand temporal features from the separated modules. It leads to lack of obtaining\nmeaningful information and enhancing the fine details. In VSR, there are three\ntypes of temporal modeling frameworks: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN),\n3D CNN, and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Among them, the RNN-based approach\nis suitable for sequential data. Thus the SR performance can be greatly\nimproved by using the hidden states of adjacent frames. However, at each of\ntime step in a recurrent structure, the RNN-based previous works utilize the\nneighboring features restrictively. Since the range of accessible motion per\ntime step is narrow, there are still limitations to restore the missing details\nfor dynamic or large motion.

In this work, scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP)\nis used to image quasiparticle flow around engineered electrostatic barriers in\ngraphene/hBN heterostructures.

Our results reveal distinctly non-Ohmic flow\nprofiles, with charge dipoles forming across barriers due to carrier scattering\nand accumulation on the upstream side, and depletion downstream.

The relative increase in the cost, the ''price of\nfairness,'' can indeed be unbounded. Therefore, in this paper we propose to\ntreat an upper bound on the clustering objective as a constraint on the\nclustering problem, and to maximize equality of representation subject to it.\nWe consider two fairness objectives: the group utilitarian objective and the\ngroup egalitarian objective, as well as the group leximin objective which\ngeneralizes the group egalitarian objective.

In particular, a status\nupdate may arrive at the destination later than its generation time due to\nprocessing and communication delays. The freshness of the status update at the\ndestination is captured by the notion of age of information. In this study, we\nanalyze a multiple sensing network with multiple sources, multiple servers, and\na monitor (destination). Each source corresponds to an independent piece of\ninformation and its age is measured individually. Given a particular source,\nthe servers independently sense the source of information and send the status\nupdate to the monitor. We assume that updates arrive at the servers according\nto Poisson random processes. Each server sends its updates to the monitor\nthrough a direct link, which is modeled as a queue. The service time to\ntransmit an update is considered to be an exponential random variable. We\nexamine both homogeneous and heterogeneous service and arrival rates for the\nsingle-source case, and only homogeneous arrival and service rates for the\nmultiple-source case. We derive a closed-form expression for the average age of\ninformation under a last-come-first-serve (LCFS) queue for a single source and\narbitrary number of homogeneous servers. Using a recursive method, we derive\nthe explicit average age of information for any number of sources and\nhomogeneous servers.

First, the eigenfunctions of solar Rossby waves are measured\nfrom helioseismic ring-diagram flow maps with a correlation method and a\nspectral analysis. Down to $9$ Mm below the surface, the dependence of the\nradial vorticity with radius $r$ is consistent with $r^{m-1}$, for a given\nlongitudinal wavenumber $m$.

Recent advances in efficient planning in deterministic or\nstochastic high-dimensional domains with continuous action spaces leverage\nbackpropagation through a model of the environment to directly optimize\nactions. However, existing methods typically not take risk into account when\noptimizing in stochastic domains, which can be incorporated efficiently in MDPs\nby optimizing the entropic utility of returns. We bridge this gap by\nintroducing Risk-Aware Planning using PyTorch (RAPTOR), a novel framework for\nrisk-sensitive planning through end-to-end optimization of the entropic utility\nobjective. A key technical difficulty of our approach lies in that direct\noptimization of the entropic utility by backpropagation is impossible due to\nthe presence of environment stochasticity. The novelty of RAPTOR lies in the\nreparameterization of the state distribution, which makes it possible to apply\nstochastic backpropagatation through sufficient statistics of the entropic\nutility computed from forward-sampled trajectories. The direct optimization of\nthis empirical objective in an end-to-end manner is called the risk-averse\nstraight-line plan, which commits to a sequence of actions in advance and can\nbe sub-optimal in highly stochastic domains. We address this shortcoming by\noptimizing for risk-aware Deep Reactive Policies (RaDRP) in our framework. We\nevaluate and compare these two forms of RAPTOR on three highly stochastic\ndo-mains, including nonlinear navigation, HVAC control, and linear reservoir\ncontrol, demonstrating the ability to manage risk in complex MDPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 09:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

When outputs are structured as\nsequences, linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) are a widely used\nmodel class which can learn \\textit{local} dependencies in the output. However,\nthe CRF's Markov assumption makes it impossible for CRFs to represent\ndistributions with \\textit{nonlocal} dependencies, and standard CRFs are unable\nto respect nonlocal constraints of the data (such as global arity constraints\non output labels). We present a generalization of CRFs that can enforce a broad\nclass of constraints, including nonlocal ones, by specifying the space of\npossible output structures as a regular language $\\mathcal{L}$. The resulting\nregular-constrained CRF (RegCCRF) has the same formal properties as a standard\nCRF, but assigns zero probability to all label sequences not in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nNotably, RegCCRFs can incorporate their constraints during training, while\nrelated models only enforce constraints during decoding. We prove that\nconstrained training is never worse than constrained decoding, and show\nempirically that it can be substantially better in practice.

These\nmethods need to solve an atomic $l_0$ norm (i.e., the continuous analog of\n$l_0$ norm) minimization problem to estimate frequencies and model order. Since\nthis problem is NP-hard to compute, relaxations of atomic $l_0$ norm, such as\nnuclear norm and reweighted atomic norm, have been employed for promoting\nsparsity. However, the relaxations give rise to a resolution limit,\nsubsequently leading to biased model order and convergence error. To overcome\nthe above shortcomings of relaxation, we propose a novel idea of simultaneously\nestimating the frequencies and model order by means of the atomic $l_0$ norm.\nTo accomplish this idea, we build a multiobjective optimization model. The\nmeasurment error and the atomic $l_0$ norm are taken as the two optimization\nobjectives. The proposed model directly exploits the model order via the atomic\n$l_0$ norm, thus breaking the resolution limit. We further design a\nvariable-length evolutionary algorithm to solve the proposed model, which\nincludes two innovations. One is a variable-length coding and search strategy.\nIt flexibly codes and interactively searches diverse solutions with different\nmodel orders. These solutions act as steppingstones that help fully exploring\nthe variable and open-ended frequency search space and provide extensive\npotentials towards the optima. Another innovation is a model order pruning\nmechanism, which heuristically prunes less contributive frequencies within the\nsolutions, thus significantly enhancing convergence and diversity.

Compact objects\nevolving from massive stars are unavoidably enshrouded by a massive envelope to\nform accretion-modified stars (AMSs) in the dense gaseous environment of a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk.

We find that Bondi accretion leads to\nefficient removal of orbital angular momentum of the binary, whose final merger\nproduces a GW burst. Meanwhile, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism pumps the spin\nenergy of the merged BH to produce an electromagnetic counterpart (EMC).\nMoreover, hyper-Eddington accretion onto the BBH develops powerful outflows and\ntriggers a Bondi explosion, which manifests itself as a EMC of the GW burst,\ndepending on the viscosity of the accretion flow.

Yet, AMMs and\ntheir forks compete on the same blockchain, incurring unnecessary network and\nblock-space overhead, by attracting sandwich attackers and arbitrage\ncompetitions. Moreover, conceptually speaking, a blockchain is one database,\nand we find little reason to partition this database into multiple competing\nexchanges, which then necessarily require price synchronization through\narbitrage.\n  This paper shows that DEX arbitrage and trade routing among similar AMMs can\nbe performed efficiently and atomically on-chain within smart contracts.

A2MM aims to unite multiple AMMs to reduce overheads,\ncosts and increase blockchain security.

A2MM reduces the network\nlayer overhead of competitive transactions, improves network propagation,\nleading to less stale blocks and better blockchain security.

Suppose $f$ is a mapping\nfrom the vertex set of $G$ to $\\{1,2,\\dots, k\\}$. If, for any vertex $u$ of\n$G$, the number of neighbors $v$ of $u$ with $f(v)=f(u)$ is less than or equal\nto $t$, then $f$ is called a $t$-relaxed $k$-coloring of $G$. And $G$ is said\nto be $(k,t)$-colorable. The $t$-relaxed chromatic number of $G$, denote by\n$\\chi_t(G)$, is defined as the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ is\n$(k,t)$-colorable. A set $S$ of vertices in $G$ is $t$-sparse if $S$ induces a\ngraph with a maximum degree of at most $t$. Thus $G$ is $(k,t)$-colorable if\nand only if the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into $k$ $t$-sparse sets.\nIt was proved by Belmonte, Lampis and Mitsou (2017) that the problem of\ndeciding if a complete multi-partite graph is $(k,t)$-colorable is NP-complete.\nIn this paper, we first give tight lower and up bounds for the $t$-relaxed\nchromatic number of complete multi-partite graphs. And then we design an\nalgorithm to compute maximum $t$-sparse sets of complete multi-partite graphs\nrunning in $O((t+1)^2)$ time.

As opposed to previous one-level I/O caching\nschemes in virtualized platforms, our proposed architecture 1) provides two\nlevels of cache by employing both Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) and SSD\nin the I/O caching layer of virtualized platforms and 2) effectively partitions\nthe cache space between running VMs to achieve maximum performance and minimum\ncache size. To manage the two-level cache, unlike the previous reuse distance\ncalculation schemes such as Useful Reuse Distance (URD), which only consider\nthe request type and neglect the impact of cache write policy, we propose a new\nmetric, Policy Optimized reuse Distance (POD). The key idea of POD is to\neffectively calculate the reuse distance and estimate the amount of two-level\nDRAM+SSD cache space to allocate by considering both 1) the request type and 2)\nthe cache write policy. Doing so results in enhanced performance and reduced\ncache size due to the allocation of cache blocks only for the requests that\nwould be served by the I/O cache. ETICA maintains the reliability of\nwrite-pending data blocks and improves performance by 1) assigning an effective\nand fixed write policy at each level of the I/O cache hierarchy and 2)\nemploying effective promotion and eviction methods between cache levels. Our\nextensive experiments conducted with a real implementation of the proposed\ntwo-level storage caching architecture show that ETICA provides 45% higher\nperformance, compared to the state-of-the-art caching schemes in virtualized\nplatforms, while improving both cache size and SSD endurance by 51.7% and\n33.8%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

Due to the inherently weak optical nonlinearity and limited\ninteraction volume, considerable pump power is typically needed to obtain\nefficient interactions to generate squeezed light in bulk crystals. Integrated\nphotonics offers an elegant way to increase the nonlinearity by confining light\nstrictly inside the waveguide. For the construction of large-scale quantum\nsystems performing many-photon operations, it is essential to integrate various\nfunctional modules on a chip. However, fabrication imperfections and\ntransmission crosstalk may add unwanted diffraction and coupling to other\nphotonic elements, reducing the quality of squeezing.

We measure the cross-correlations at different\nevolution distances for various topological sites and verify the non-classical\nfeatures with high fidelity. The squeezing parameters are measured to certify\nthe protection of cavity-free, strongly squeezed states. The demonstration of\ntopological protection for squeezed light on a chip brings new opportunities\nfor quantum integrated photonics, opening novel approaches for the design of\nadvanced multi-photon circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

The red nova outbursts\nare thought to be caused by stellar mergers. The merger in V838 Mon took place\nin a triple or higher system involving two B-type stars. We mapped the merger\nsite with ALMA at a resolution of 25 mas in continuum dust emission and in\nrotational lines of simple molecules, including CO, SiO, SO, SO$_2$, AlOH, and\nH$_2$S. We use radiative transfer calculations to reproduce the remnant's\narchitecture at the epoch of the ALMA observations. For the first time, we\nidentify the position of the B-type companion relative to the outbursting\ncomponent of V838 Mon. The stellar remnant is surrounded by a clumpy wind with\ncharacteristics similar to winds of red supergiants. The merger product is also\nassociated with an elongated structure, $17.6 \\times 7.6$ mas, seen in\ncontinuum emission, and which we interpret as a disk seen at a moderate\ninclination. Maps of continuum and molecular emission show also a complex\nregion of interaction between the B-type star (its gravity, radiation, and\nwind) and the flow of matter ejected in 2002. The remnant's molecular mass is\nabout 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ and the dust mass is 8.3$\\cdot$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The\nmass of the atomic component remains unconstrained. The most interesting region\nfor understanding the merger of V838 Mon remains unresolved but appears\nelongated. To study it further in more detail will require even higher angular\nresolutions. ALMA maps show us an extreme form of interaction between the\nmerger ejecta with a distant (250 au) companion. This interaction is similar to\nthat known from the Antares AB system but at a much higher mass loss rate. The\nB-type star not only deflects the merger ejecta but also changes its chemical\ncomposition with an involvement of circumstellar shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

The organic electrochemical transistor,\nwhich features large transconductance values at low operation voltages, is\nideal for monitoring small signals. Its large transconductance translates small\ngate voltage variations into significant changes in the drain current. However,\na current-to-voltage conversion is further needed to allow proper data\nacquisition and signal processing. Low power consumption, high amplification,\nand manufacturability on flexible and low-cost carriers are also crucial and\nhighly anticipated for targeted applications. Here, we report low-power and\nhigh-gain flexible circuits based on printed complementary organic\nelectrochemical transistors (OECTs). We leverage the low threshold voltage of\nboth p-type and n-type enhancement-mode OECTs to develop complementary voltage\namplifiers that can sense voltages as low as 100 $\\mu$V, with gains of 30.4 dB\nand at a power consumption < 2.7 $\\mu$W (single-stage amplifier). At the\noptimal operating conditions, the voltage gain normalized to power consumption\nreaches 169 dB/$\\mu$W, which is > 50 times larger than state-of-the-art\nOECT-based amplifiers. In a two-stage configuration, the complementary voltage\namplifiers reach a DC voltage gain of 193 V/V, which is the highest among\nemerging CMOS-like technologies operating at supply voltages below 1 volt. Our\nfindings demonstrate that flexible complementary circuits based on printed\nOECTs define a power-efficient platform for sensing and amplifying\nlow-amplitude voltage signals in several emerging beyond-silicon applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 14:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

Our\nproposed framework PI-GNN contributes two novel components: (1) a\nconfidence-aware PI estimation model that adaptively estimates the PI labels,\nwhich are defined as whether the two nodes share the same node labels, and (2)\na decoupled training approach that leverages the estimated PI labels to\nregularize a node classification model for robust node classification.\nExtensive experiments on different datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of PI-GNN, yielding a promising improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The classical theory established by P. D. Lax in\n1964 (J. Math.

These harsh\nstructural assumptions mean that it is highly non-trivial to apply this theory\nto archetypal systems of conservation laws, such as the (1+1)-dimensional\nrelativistic Euler equations. Actually, in the (1+1)-dimensional spacetime\nsetting, if the mass-energy density does not vanish initially at any finite\npoint, the essential difficulty in considering the possible break-down is to\nobtain sharp enough control on the lower bound of the mass-energy density. To\nthis end, based on introducing several key artificial quantities and some\nelaborate analysis on the difference of the two Riemann invariants, we\ncharacterized the decay of mass-energy density lower bound in time. On the one\nhand, for the classical solutions with large data and possible far field vacuum\nto the isentropic flow, we verified the theory obtained by P. D. Lax in 1964.\nOn the other hand, for the classical solutions with large data and strictly\npositive initial mass-energy density to the non-isentropic flow, we exhibit a\nnumerical value N, thought of as representing the strength of an initial\ncompression, above which all initial data lead to a finite-time singularity\nformation.

In\nparticular, we survey how ideas from signal processing of data supported on\nregular domains, such as time series or images, can be extended to graphs and\nsimplicial complexes. We discuss Fourier analysis, signal denoising, signal\ninterpolation, and nonlinear processing through neural networks based on\nsimplicial complexes.

To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises\nan additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves\npromising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset.

Due to the high cost of collecting labeled\ngraph-structured data, domain adaptation is important to supervised graph\nlearning tasks with limited samples. However, current graph domain adaptation\nmethods are generally adopted from traditional domain adaptation tasks, and the\nproperties of graph-structured data are not well utilized. For example, the\nobserved social networks on different platforms are controlled not only by the\ndifferent crowd or communities but also by the domain-specific policies and the\nbackground noise. Based on these properties in graph-structured data, we first\nassume that the graph-structured data generation process is controlled by three\nindependent types of latent variables, i.e., the semantic latent variables, the\ndomain latent variables, and the random latent variables. Based on this\nassumption, we propose a disentanglement-based unsupervised domain adaptation\nmethod for the graph-structured data, which applies variational graph\nauto-encoders to recover these latent variables and disentangles them via three\nsupervised learning modules. Extensive experimental results on two real-world\ndatasets in the graph classification task reveal that our method not only\nsignificantly outperforms the traditional domain adaptation methods and the\ndisentangled-based domain adaptation methods but also outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art graph domain adaptation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 15:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

A popular approach to\nachieve long simulation time scales for large system sizes is to incorporate\nthe effect of the solvent in a mean-field fashion with implicit solvent models.\nHowever, a challenge with existing implicit solvent models is that they often\nlack accuracy or certain physical properties compared to explicit solvent\nmodels, as the many-body effects of the neglected solvent molecules is\ndifficult to model as a mean field. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) and\nmulti-scale coarse graining (CG) in order to learn implicit solvent models that\ncan approximate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of a given explicit\nsolvent model with arbitrary accuracy, given enough training data. Following\nthe previous ML--CG models CGnet and CGSchnet, we introduce ISSNet, a graph\nneural network, to model the implicit solvent potential of mean force. ISSNet\ncan learn from explicit solvent simulation data and be readily applied to MD\nsimulations.

Raussendorf's three-dimensional cluster states (RTCSs) based on the\nsurface codes are mainly considered for topological MBQC. In such schemes,\nhowever, the fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard, phase\n($Z^{1/2}$), and $T$ ($Z^{1/4}$) gates which are essential for building up\narbitrary logical gates has not been achieved to date without using state\ndistillation, while the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate does not require it, to best\nof our knowledge. State distillation generally consumes many ancillary logical\nqubits, thus it is a severe obstacle against practical quantum computing. To\nsolve this problem, we suggest an MBQC scheme via a family of cluster states\ncalled color-code-based cluster states (CCCSs) based on the two-dimensional\ncolor codes instead of the surface codes.

The goal is to create a new comprehensive\nsource of first-principles molecular spectra, thus bridging the gap for missing\ndata to help drive future high-resolution studies. Our primary application\ndomain is for molecules identified as signatures of life in planetary\natmospheres (biosignatures), but our approach is general and can be applied to\nother systems. In this work we evaluate the accuracy of our method by studying\nfour diatomic molecules H$_2$, O$_2$, N$_2$ and CO, all of which have\nwell-known spectra. Prometheus uses the Transition-Optimised Shifted Hermite\n(TOSH) theory to account for anharmonicity for the fundamental $\\nu=0\n\\rightarrow \\nu=1$ band, along with thermal profile modeling for the rotational\ntransitions. To this end, we expand TOSH theory to enable the modeling of\nrotational constants. We show that our simple model achieves results that are a\nbetter approximation of the real spectra than those produced through a harmonic\napproach. We compare our results with high-resolution HITRAN and ExoMol\nspectral data. We find that modelling accuracy tends to diminish for\nrovibrational transition away from the band origin, thus highlighting the need\nfor the theory to be further adapted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 12:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

In this paper, we proposed a novel UV map generation model that\npredicts the UV map from a single face image. The model consists of a UV\nsampler and a UV generator. By selectively sampling the input face image's\npixels and adjusting their relative locations, the UV sampler generates an\nincomplete UV map that could faithfully reconstruct the original face. Missing\ntextures in the incomplete UV map are further full-filled by the UV generator.\nThe training is based on pseudo ground truth blended by the 3DMM texture and\nthe input face texture, thus weakly supervised.

In\nbioinformatics, localization of short DNA sequences (reads) within large\ngenomic sequences is commonly facilitated by constructing index data structures\nwhich allow for efficient querying of substrings. Recent metagenomic\nclassification pipelines annotate reads with taxonomic labels by analyzing\ntheir $k$-mer histograms with respect to a reference genome database. CPU-based\nindex construction is often performed in a preprocessing phase due to the\nrelatively high cost of building irregular data structures such as hash maps.\nHowever, the rapidly growing amount of available reference genomes establishes\nthe need for index construction and querying at interactive speeds. In this\npaper, we introduce MetaCache-GPU -- an ultra-fast metagenomic short read\nclassifier specifically tailored to fit the characteristics of CUDA-enabled\naccelerators. Our approach employs a novel hash table variant featuring\nefficient minhash fingerprinting of reads for locality-sensitive hashing and\ntheir rapid insertion using warp-aggregated operations. Our performance\nevaluation shows that MetaCache-GPU is able to build large reference databases\nin a matter of seconds, enabling instantaneous operability, while popular\nCPU-based tools such as Kraken2 require over an hour for index construction on\nthe same data. In the context of an ever-growing number of reference genomes,\nMetaCache-GPU is the first metagenomic classifier that makes analysis pipelines\nwith on-demand composition of large-scale reference genome sets practical.

The two major proposed simultaneity frameworks are differential\nsimultaneity, in which time is offset with distance in \"moving\" or rotating\nframes for each \"stationary\" observer, and absolute simultaneity, in which time\nis not offset with distance. We use the Mansouri and Sexl test theory to\nanalyze the simultaneity framework in rotating frames in the absence of\nspacetime curvature. The Mansouri and Sexl test theory has four parameters.\nThree parameters describe relativistic effects. The fourth parameter, $\\epsilon\n(v)$, was described as a convention on clock synchronization. We show that\n$\\epsilon (v)$ is not a convention, but is instead a descriptor of the\nsimultaneity framework whose value can be determined from the extent of\nanisotropy in the unidirectional one-way speed of light. In rotating frames,\none-way light speed anisotropy is described by the Sagnac effect equation. We\nshow that four published Sagnac equations form a relativistic series based on\nrelativistic kinematics and simultaneity framework. Only the conventional\nSagnac effect equation, and its associated isotropic two-way speed of light, is\nfound to match high-resolution optical data. Using the conventional Sagnac\neffect equation, we show that $\\epsilon (v)$ has a null value in rotating\nframes, which implies absolute simultaneity. Introducing the empirical Mansouri\nand Sexl parameter values into the test theory equations generates the\nrotational form of the absolute Lorentz transformation, implying that this\ntransformation accurately describes rotational relativistic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 15:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

In order to analyze the emotional content of\nspeech in such a massive dataset, an automatic speech emotion recognition (SER)\nsystem is required. However, there are no emotion labels or existing indomain\nSER systems to be used for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce this\ninitially unannotated large-scale real-world audio dataset and describe the\ndevelopment of a functional SER system for the Finnish subset of the data. We\nexplore the effectiveness of alternative state-of-the-art techniques to deploy\na SER system to a new domain, comparing cross-corpus generalization, WGAN-based\ndomain adaptation, and active learning in the task. As a result, we show that\nthe best-performing models are able to achieve a classification performance of\n73.4% unweighted average recall (UAR) and 73.2% UAR for a binary classification\nfor valence and arousal, respectively.

Low maintenance cost, small size and dimensions, as well\nas high convective heat transfer coefficients, make micro-scale heat sinks an\nefficient and reliable cooling solution for applications with high heat\ndissipation rates.

The results of an NMA depend critically on the quality of\nevidence being pooled. In assessing the validity of an NMA, it is therefore\nimportant to know the proportion contributions of each direct treatment\ncomparison to each network treatment effect. The construction of proportion\ncontributions is based on the observation that each row of the hat matrix\nrepresents a so-called 'evidence flow network' for each treatment comparison.\nHowever, the existing algorithm used to calculate these values is associated\nwith ambiguity according to the selection of paths. In this work we present a\nnovel analogy between NMA and random walks. We use this analogy to derive\nclosed-form expressions for the proportion contributions. A random walk on a\ngraph is a stochastic process that describes a succession of random 'hops'\nbetween vertices which are connected by an edge. The weight of an edge relates\nto the probability that the walker moves along that edge. We use the graph\nrepresentation of NMA to construct the transition matrix for a random walk on\nthe network of evidence. We show that the net number of times a walker crosses\neach edge of the network is related to the evidence flow network. By then\ndefining a random walk on the directed evidence flow network, we derive\nanalytically the matrix of proportion contributions. The random-walk approach,\nin addition to being computationally more efficient, has none of the associated\nambiguity of the existing algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}
