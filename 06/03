Current empirical studies provide shreds of evidence that attention\nweights are not explanations by proving that they are not unique. A recent\nstudy showed theoretical justifications to this observation by proving the\nnon-identifiability of attention weights. For a given input to a head and its\noutput, if the attention weights generated in it are unique, we call the\nweights identifiable. In this work, we provide deeper theoretical analysis and\nempirical observations on the identifiability of attention weights. Ignored in\nthe previous works, we find the attention weights are more identifiable than we\ncurrently perceive by uncovering the hidden role of the key vector. However,\nthe weights are still prone to be non-unique attentions that make them unfit\nfor interpretation. To tackle this issue, we provide a variant of the encoder\nlayer that decouples the relationship between key and value vector and provides\nidentifiable weights up to the desired length of the input.

Recently,\nData resemblance detection is a novel technology to detect redundancy among\nsimilarity.

However, popular\nresemblance methods such as \"N-transform\" and \"Finesse\" use only the chunk data\nfor feature extraction. A minor modification on the data chunk could seriously\ndeteriorate its capability for resemblance detection. In this paper, we\nproposes a novel chunk-context aware resemblance detection algorithm, called\nCARD, to mitigate this issue.

Here, we present\nthe results of a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with inputs\nconstrained by spectropolarimetric data, HST/STIS Far UV, X-ray data data and\nstellar magnetic maps reconstructed at two epochs separated by 11 months. The\nsimulations show that over the course of the year, the global stellar corona\nhad undergone a drastic transition from a simple dipole-like to a tilted dipole\nwith multipole field components, and thus, provided favorable conditions for\nCorotating Interaction Events (CIRs) that drive strong shocks. The dynamic\npressure exerted by CIRs are 1300 times larger than those observed from the Sun\nand can contribute to the atmospheric erosion of early Venus, Earth, Mars and\nyoung Earth-like exoplanets. Our data-constrained MHD model provides the\nframework to model coronal environments of G-M planet hosting dwarfs. The model\noutputs can serve as a realistic input for exoplanetary atmospheric models to\nevaluate the impact of stellar coronal emission, stellar winds and CIRs on\ntheir atmospheric escape and chemistry that can be tested in the upcoming JWST\nand ground-based observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 16:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Several Nash solvers\nexist, yet none scale to normal-form games with many actions and many players,\nespecially those with payoff tensors too big to be stored in memory. In this\nwork, we propose an approach that iteratively improves an approximation to a\nNash equilibrium through joint play. It accomplishes this by tracing a\npreviously established homotopy that defines a continuum of equilibria for the\ngame regularized with decaying levels of entropy. This continuum asymptotically\napproaches the limiting logit equilibrium, proven by McKelvey and Palfrey\n(1995) to be unique in almost all games, thereby partially circumventing the\nwell-known equilibrium selection problem of many-player games. To encourage\niterates to remain near this path, we efficiently minimize average deviation\nincentive via stochastic gradient descent, intelligently sampling entries in\nthe payoff tensor as needed. Monte Carlo estimates of the stochastic gradient\nfrom joint play are biased due to the appearance of a nonlinear max operator in\nthe objective, so we introduce additional innovations to the algorithm to\nalleviate gradient bias. The descent process can also be viewed as repeatedly\nconstructing and reacting to a polymatrix approximation to the game. In these\nways, our proposed approach, average deviation incentive descent with adaptive\nsampling (ADIDAS), is most similar to three classical approaches, namely\nhomotopy-type, Lyapunov, and iterative polymatrix solvers. The lack of local\nconvergence guarantees for biased gradient descent prevents guaranteed\nconvergence to Nash, however, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the\nability of this approach to approximate a unique Nash in normal-form games with\nas many as seven players and twenty one actions (several billion outcomes) that\nare orders of magnitude larger than those possible with prior algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 16:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 22:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 18:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

In the inertial range of turbulence that emerges\nfollowing the breakdown, the effective Reynolds number based on the turbulent\nviscosity, Rlambda* assumes this same constant value of about 9. This scenario\nworks also for the emergence of turbulence from an initially non-turbulent\nstate. Second, we derive expressions for the anomalous scaling exponents of\nstructure functions and moments of spatial derivatives, by analyzing the\nNavier-Stokes equations in the form developed by Hopf. We present a novel\nprocedure to close the Hopf equation, resulting in expressions for zetan in the\nentire range of allowable moment-order, n, and demonstrate that accounting for\nthe temporal dynamics changes the scaling from normal to anomalous. For large\nn, the theory predicts the saturation of zetan with n, leading to two\ninferences: (a) the smallest length scale etan = LRe-1 << LRe-3/4, where Re is\nthe large-scale Reynolds number, and (b) velocity excursions across even the\nsmallest length scales can sometimes be as large as the large scale velocity\nitself.

We\nperform Singular Value Decompositions of nucleon-nucleon interactions in\npartial wave representation and study the dependence of the singular value\nspectrum on interaction characteristics like regularization scheme and\nresolution scales.\n  We develop and implement the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) evolution\nof the factorized interaction, and demonstrate that this SVD-SRG approach\naccurately preserves two-nucleon observables.\n  We find that low-resolution interactions allow the truncation of the SVD at\nlow rank, and that a small number of relevant components is sufficient to\ncapture the nuclear interaction and perform an accurate SRG evolution, while\nthe Coulomb interaction requires special consideration. The rank is uniform\nacross all partial waves, and almost independent of the basis choice in the\ntested cases.

This\napplies to both particle (e.g. $p$-wave suppressed or Sommerfeld-enhanced\nannihilation, scattering off atoms, etc.) and macroscopic DM candidates (e.g.\nmicrolensing of primordial black holes). As experiments and observations\nimprove in precision, better assessing theoretical uncertainties becomes\npressing in the prospect of deriving reliable constraints on DM candidates or\ntrustworthy hints for detection. Most reliable predictions of DFs in halos are\nbased on solving the steady-state collisionless Boltzmann equation (e.g.\nEddington-like inversions, action-angle methods, etc.) consistently with\nobservational constraints. One can do so starting from maximal symmetries and a\nminimal set of degrees of freedom, and then increasing complexity. Key issues\nare then whether adding complexity, which is computationally costy, improves\npredictions, and if so where to stop. Clues can be obtained by making\npredictions for zoomed-in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in which one\ncan access the true (coarse-grained) phase-space information. Here, we test an\naxisymmetric extension of the Eddington inversion to predict the full DM DF\nfrom its density profile and the total gravitational potential of the system.\nThis permits to go beyond spherical symmetry, and is a priori well suited for\nspiral galaxies. We show that axisymmetry does not necessarily improve over\nspherical symmetry because the (observationally unconstrained) angular momentum\nof the DM halo is not generically aligned with the baryonic one. Theoretical\nerrors are similar to those of the Eddington inversion though, at the 10-20%\nlevel for velocity-dependent predictions related to particle DM searches in\nspiral galaxies.

We perform the first dedicated study\nof this interaction, making use of a two-dimensional simulation that follows\nthe transverse gas evolution inside a given section of stream. This numerical\napproach circumvents the lack of resolution encountered near pericenter passage\nin global three-dimensional simulations using particle-based methods. As it\nmoves inward, we find that the gas motion is purely ballistic, which near\npericenter causes strong vertical compression that squeezes the stream into a\nthin sheet. Dissipation takes place at the resulting nozzle shock, inducing a\nrise in pressure that causes the collapsing gas to bounce back, although\nwithout imparting significant net expansion. As it recedes to larger distances,\nthis matter continues to expand while remaining thin despite the influence of\npressure forces.

Examples are variational quantum eigensolvers,\nquantum approximate optimization algorithms as well as various algorithms in\nthe context of quantum-assisted machine learning. A common bottleneck of any\nsuch algorithm is constituted by the optimization of the variational\nparameters. A popular set of optimization methods work on the estimate of the\ngradient, obtained by means of circuit evaluations. We will refer to the way in\nwhich one can combine these circuit evaluations as gradient rules. This work\nprovides a comprehensive picture of the family of gradient rules that vary\nparameters of quantum gates individually. The most prominent known members of\nthis family are the parameter shift rule and the finite differences method. To\nunite this family, we propose a generalized parameter shift rule that expresses\nall members of the aforementioned family as special cases, and discuss how all\nof these can be seen as providing access to a linear combination of exact\nfirst- and second-order derivatives. We further prove that a parameter shift\nrule with one non-shifted evaluation and only one shifted circuit evaluation\ncan not exist does not exist, and introduce a novel perspective for approaching\nnew gradient rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

We describe the system which has been developed to enable\nthe discovery and publication of transient photometric events as seen by Gaia.\n  Methods: We outline the data handling, timings, and performances, and we\ndescribe the transient detection algorithms and filtering procedures needed to\nmanage the high false alarm rate. We identify two classes of events: (1)\nsources which are new to Gaia and (2) Gaia sources which have undergone a\nsignificant brightening or fading. Validation of the Gaia transit astrometry\nand photometry was performed, followed by testing of the source environment to\nminimise contamination from Solar System objects, bright stars, and fainter\nnear-neighbours.\n  Results: We show that the Gaia Science Alerts project suffers from very low\ncontamination, that is there are very few false-positives. We find that the\nexternal completeness for supernovae, $C_E=0.46$, is dominated by the Gaia\nscanning law and the requirement of detections from both fields-of-view. Where\nwe have two or more scans the internal completeness is $C_I=0.79$ at 3 arcsec\nor larger from the centres of galaxies, but it drops closer in, especially\nwithin 1 arcsec.\n  Conclusions: The per-transit photometry for Gaia transients is precise to 1\nper cent at $G=13$, and 3 per cent at $G=19$. The per-transit astrometry is\naccurate to 55 milliarcseconds when compared to Gaia DR2.

Whereas black hole+O (BH+O)\nbinaries are thought to evolve from the former, only one such system is known\nin the Milky Way. To resolve this disparity, it was suggested that upon core\ncollapse, the WR stars receive large kicks such that most of the binaries are\ndisrupted. We reassess this issue, with emphasis on the uncertainty in the\nformation of an accretion disk around wind-accreting BHs in BH+O binaries,\nwhich is key to identifying such systems. We follow the methodology of previous\nwork and apply an improved analytic criterion for the formation of an accretion\ndisk around wind accreting BHs. We then use stellar models to predict the\nproperties of the BH+O binaries which are expected to descend from the observed\nWR+O binaries, if the WR stars would form BHs without a natal kick. We find\nthat disk formation depends sensitively on the O stars' wind velocity, the\nspecific angular momentum carried by the wind, the efficiency of angular\nmomentum accretion by the BH, and the spin of the BH. We show that the\nassumption of a low wind velocity may lead to predicting that most of the BH+O\nstar binaries will have an extended X-ray bright period. However, this is not\nthe case when typical wind velocities of O stars are considered. We find that a\nhigh spin of the BH can boost the duration of the X-ray active phase as well as\nthe X-ray brightness during this phase, producing a strong bias for detecting\nhigh mass BH binaries in X-rays with high BH spin parameters. We conclude that\nlarge BH formation kicks are not required to understand the sparsity of X-ray\nbright BH+O stars in the Milky Way. Probing for a population of X-ray silent\nBH+O systems with alternative methods can inform us about BH kicks and the\nconditions for high energy emission from high mass BH binaries.

The average profile and single pulse emission in\neach pulsar were calibrated using the estimated flux density. We have used the\nflux calibrated average profile to study the variation of the spectral index\nacross the emission beam in 21 pulsars where the core, inner cone and the outer\nconal components could be clearly identified. The central core component showed\na steeper increase in emission at the lower frequency compared with conal\nemission, with an average difference in spectral index\n$\\delta\\alpha_{core-cone}\\sim-0.7$ between the core and the conal components in\nthis frequency range. In contrast the inner conal components had positive\ndifference in their spectral index compared to the outer cones with average\ndifference $\\delta\\alpha_{in-out}\\sim+0.3$. The variation in the spectral index\nacross the pulse window should provide valuable inputs for constraining the\nradio emission processes.

The avalanches in this model correspond to the\ninter-record intervals in a modified record process of I.I.D variables, defined\nby a single parameter $c>0$. This parameter characterizes the record formation\nvia the recursive process $R_k > R_{k-1}-c$, where $R_k$ denotes the value of\nthe $k$-th record. We show that for $c>0$, if $f(x)$ decays slower than an\nexponential for large $x$, the record process is nonstationary as in the\nstandard $c=0$ case.

For an input given by a location in the model space,\nthe network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its\npartial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation,\nto fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation.

In this paper, the underlying\nintra-and-interdependencies between entities for a given SGS is captured using\na dependency model called Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM)\n[1]. Given an integer K, the K-contingency list problem gives the list of\nK-most critical entities, failure of which maximizes the network damage at the\ncurrent time. The problem being NP complete [2] and owing to the higher running\ntime of the given Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based solution [3], a much\nfaster heuristic solution to generate an event driven self-updating\nK-contingency list [4] is also given in this paper. Based on the contingency\nlists obtained from both the solutions, this paper proposes an adaptive entity\nhardening technique based on a leader-follower game theoretic approach that\narrests the cascading failure of entities in the SGS after an initial failure\nof entities. The validation of the work is done by comparing the contingency\nlists using both types of solutions, obtained for different K values using the\nMIIM model on a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system with that obtained by\nsimulating the smart grid using a co-simulation system formed by MATPOWER and\nJava Network Simulator (JNS).

In contrast, at room temperature,\ndepending on the nature of the ion the radial distribution in the droplet core\nis nearly uniform or elevated towards the center. We analyze the spatial\ndistribution of a single ion in terms of a reference electrostatic model. The\nenergy of the system in the analytical model is expressed as the sum of the\nelectrostatic and surface energy of a deformable droplet. The model predicts\nthat the ion is subject to a harmonic potential centered at the droplet's\ncenter of mass. We name this effect \"electrostatic confinement\". The model's\npredictions are consistent with the simulation findings for a single ion at\nroom temperature but not at supercooling. We anticipate this study to be the\nstarting point for investigating the structure of supercooled (electro)sprayed\ndroplets that are used to preserve the conformations of macromolecules\noriginating from the bulk solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 21:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Commodity networking systems\nbased on software stacks and peripheral NICs introduce high overheads when it\ncomes to delivering small messages.\n  We present Dagger, a hardware acceleration fabric for cloud RPCs based on\nFPGAs, where the accelerator is closely-coupled with the host processor over a\nconfigurable memory interconnect. The three key design principle of Dagger are:\n(1) offloading the entire RPC stack to an FPGA-based NIC, (2) leveraging memory\ninterconnects instead of PCIe buses as the interface with the host CPU, and (3)\nmaking the acceleration fabric reconfigurable, so it can accommodate the\ndiverse needs of microservices. We show that the combination of these\nprinciples significantly improves the efficiency and performance of cloud RPC\nsystems while preserving their generality. Dagger achieves 1.3-3.8x higher\nper-core RPC throughput compared to both highly-optimized software stacks, and\nsystems using specialized RDMA adapters. It also scales up to 84 Mrps with 8\nthreads on 4 CPU cores, while maintaining state-of-the-art us-scale tail\nlatency. We also demonstrate that large third-party applications, like\nmemcached and MICA KVS, can be easily ported on Dagger with minimal changes to\ntheir codebase, bringing their median and tail KVS access latency down to 2.8 -\n3.5us and 5.4 - 7.8us, respectively. Finally, we show that Dagger is beneficial\nfor multi-tier end-to-end microservices with different threading models by\nevaluating it using an 8-tier application implementing a flight check-in\nservice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 21:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

In modern settings, the\ncompression of high-dimensional neural representations to low-dimensional\nbinary codes is a challenging task and often require large bit-codes to be\naccurate. In this work, we propose a novel method for Learning Low-dimensional\nbinary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not\nrequire any side-information, like annotated attributes or label meta-data, and\nlearns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K).

We\nimplement the Physically Evolved Wind (PhEW) model of Huang et al.

PhEW adopts an\nexplicit subgrid model that treats each wind particle as a collection of clouds\nthat exchange mass, metals, and momentum with their surroundings and evaporate\nby conduction and hydrodynamic instabilities as calibrated on much higher\nresolution cloud scale simulations. In contrast to a conventional wind\nalgorithm, we find that PhEW results are robust to numerical resolution and\nimplementation details because the small scale interactions are defined by the\nmodel itself. Compared to conventional wind simulations with the same\nresolution, our PhEW simulations produce similar galaxy stellar mass functions\nat $z\\geq 1$ but are in better agreement with low-redshift observations at $M_*\n< 10^{11}M_\\odot$ because PhEW particles shed mass to the CGM before escaping\nlow mass halos. PhEW radically alters the CGM metal distribution because PhEW\nparticles disperse metals to the ambient medium as their clouds dissipate,\nproducing a CGM metallicity distribution that is skewed but unimodal and is\nsimilar between cold and hot gas. While the temperature distributions and\nradial profiles of gaseous halos are similar in simulations with PhEW and\nconventional winds, these changes in metal distribution will affect their\npredicted UV/X-ray properties in absorption and emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 00:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 04:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 03:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Controlling the fluid flow, species transport,\nand reactive environment is critical to attaining high performance. However,\nconventional electrode materials like felts and papers provide few\nopportunities for precise engineering of the electrode and its microstructure.\nTo address these limitations, architected electrodes composed of unit cells\nwith spatially varying geometry determined via computational optimization are\nproposed. Resolved simulation is employed to develop a homogenized description\nof the constituent unit cells. These effective properties serve as inputs to a\ncontinuum model for the electrode when used in the negative half cell of a\nvanadium redox flow battery. Porosity distributions minimizing power loss are\nthen determined via computational design optimization to generate architected\nporosity electrodes. The architected electrodes are compared to bulk, uniform\nporosity electrodes and found to lead to increased power efficiency across\noperating flow rates and currents. The design methodology is further used to\ngenerate a scaled-up electrode with comparable power efficiency to the\nbench-scale systems. The variable porosity architecture and computational\ndesign methodology presented here thus offers a novel pathway for automatically\ngenerating spatially engineered electrode structures with improved power\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 00:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

First, a necessary and\nsufficient rank criterion for the equality of two conditional Gaussian\ndistributions is proved. Assuming a partial finite-order Markov property, a\ncharacterization of Granger causality in terms of the rank of a matrix\ninvolving the covariances is presented. We call this the causality matrix. The\nsmallest singular value of the causality matrix gives a lower bound on the\ndistance between the two conditional Gaussian distributions appearing in the\ndefinition of Granger causality and yields a new measure of causality. Then,\nconditions are derived under which Granger causality between jointly Gaussian\nprocesses can be reliably inferred from the second order moments of quantized\nmeasurements. A necessary and sufficient condition is proposed for Granger\ncausality inference under binary quantization. Furthermore, sufficient\nconditions are introduced to infer Granger causality between jointly Gaussian\nsignals through measurements quantized via non-uniform, uniform or high\nresolution quantizers. Apart from the assumed partial Markov order and joint\nGaussianity, this approach does not require the parameters of a system model to\nbe identified. No assumptions are made on the identifiability of the jointly\nGaussian random processes through the quantized observations. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method is illustrated by simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 00:17:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 08:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

After isolating decisions that do\ndepend on the input, we explore interpreting these decisions using several\ndifferent attribution methods. We compare these techniques based on their\nability to select content and reconstruct the model's predicted token from\nperturbations of the input, thus revealing whether highlighted attributions are\ntruly important for the generation of the next token.

In this essay we argue in the opposite\ndirection, discussing theoretical evidence for the existence of strong\ncorrelations between the physics inside and outside non-singular black holes.\nWe conclude that astronomical tests of the surroundings of black holes can\nprovide invaluable information about their so-far unexplored interiors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 01:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

In this article we present theoretical results from the\nSupernova Neutrino Amino Acid Processing (SNAAP) model, which uses electron\nanti-neutrinos and the magnetic fields from source objects such as supernovae\nor colliding neutron stars to selectively destroy one amino acid chirality and\nto create isotopic abundance shifts. For plausible magnetic fields and electron\nanti-neutrino fluxes, non-zero, positive enantiomeric excesses, $ee$s, defined\nto be the relative left/right asymmetry in an amino acid population, are\nreviewed for two amino acids, and conditions are suggested that would produce\n$ee>0$ for all of the $\\alpha$-amino acids. The relatively high energy\nanti-neutrinos that produce the $ee$s would inevitably also produce isotopic\nanomalies. A nuclear reaction network was developed to describe the reactions\nresulting from them and the nuclides in the meteorites. At similar\nanti-neutrino fluxes, assumed recombination of the detritus from the\nanti-neutrino interactions is shown to produce appreciable isotopic anomalies\nin qualitative agreement with those observed for D/$^1$H and $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N.\nThe isotopic anomalies for $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C are predicted to be small, as are\nalso observed. Autocatalysis may be necessary for any model to produce the\nlargest $ee$s observed in meteorites. This allows the constraints of the\noriginal SNAAP model to be relaxed, increasing the probability of meteoroid\nsurvival in sites where amino acid processing is possible. These results have\nobvious implications for the origin of life on Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 01:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Existing methods\nprimarily model the matching relationship between query and moment by complex\ncross-modal interactions. Despite their effectiveness, current models mostly\nexploit dataset biases while ignoring the video content, thus leading to poor\ngeneralizability. We argue that the issue is caused by the hidden confounder in\nVMR, {i.e., temporal location of moments}, that spuriously correlates the model\ninput and prediction. How to design robust matching models against the temporal\nlocation biases is crucial but, as far as we know, has not been studied yet for\nVMR.\n  To fill the research gap, we propose a causality-inspired VMR framework that\nbuilds structural causal model to capture the true effect of query and video\ncontent on the prediction. Specifically, we develop a Deconfounded Cross-modal\nMatching (DCM) method to remove the confounding effects of moment location. It\nfirst disentangles moment representation to infer the core feature of visual\ncontent, and then applies causal intervention on the disentangled multimodal\ninput based on backdoor adjustment, which forces the model to fairly\nincorporate each possible location of the target into consideration.

Since the discovery of this intriguing vulnerability, many\ndefence methods have been proposed that attempt to improve robustness to\nadversarial noise. Fast and accurate attacks are required to compare various\ndefence methods. However, evaluating adversarial robustness has proven to be\nextremely challenging. Existing norm minimisation adversarial attacks require\nthousands of iterations (e.g. Carlini & Wagner attack), are limited to the\nspecific norms (e.g. Fast Adaptive Boundary), or produce sub-optimal results\n(e.g. Brendel & Bethge attack). On the other hand, PGD attack, which is fast,\ngeneral and accurate, ignores the norm minimisation penalty and solves a\nsimpler perturbation-constrained problem. In this work, we introduce a fast,\ngeneral and accurate adversarial attack that optimises the original non-convex\nconstrained minimisation problem.

By promoting smoothness with\na recently proposed sharpness-aware optimizer, we substantially improve the\naccuracy and robustness of ViTs and MLP-Mixers on various tasks spanning\nsupervised, adversarial, contrastive, and transfer learning (e.g., +5.3\\% and\n+11.0\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for ViT-B/16 and Mixer-B/16, respectively,\nwith the simple Inception-style preprocessing). We show that the improved\nsmoothness attributes to sparser active neurons in the first few layers. The\nresultant ViTs outperform ResNets of similar size and throughput when trained\nfrom scratch on ImageNet without large-scale pre-training or strong data\naugmentations.

However, the joint radar sensing and\ncommunication (JRC) system faces considerable challenges in the mmWave and\nlow-THz scale, due to the peculiarities of the propagation channel and\nradio-frequency (RF) front ends. To this end, the waveform design for the JRC\nsystems in mmWave and low-THz bands with ultra-broad bandwidth is investigated\nin this paper. Firstly, by considering the JRC design based on the co-existence\nconcept, where both functions operate in a time-domain duplex (TDD) manner, a\nnovel multi-subband quasi-perfect (MS-QP) sequence, composed of multiple\nperfect subsequences on different subbands, is proposed for target sensing,\nwhich achieves accurate target ranging and velocity estimation, whilst only\nrequiring cost-efficient low-rate analog-to-digital converters (A/Ds) for\nsequence detection. Furthermore, the root index of each perfect subsequence is\ndesigned to eliminate the influence of strong Doppler shift on radar sensing.\nFinally, a data-embedded MS-QP (DE-MS-QP) waveform is constructed through\ntime-domain extension of the MS-QP sequence, generating null frequency points\non each subband for data transmission. Unlike the co-existence-based JRC system\nin TDD manner, the proposed DE-MS-QP waveform enables simultaneous\ninterference-free sensing and communication, whilst inheriting all the merits\nfrom MS-QP sequences. Numerical results validate the superiority of the\nproposed waveforms regarding the communication and sensing performances,\nhardware cost as well as flexibility of the resource allocation between the\ndual functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 02:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 02:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 08:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Traditional voltage control algorithms are inadequate to\nhandle fast voltage variations. Therefore, new dynamic control methods are\nbeing developed that can significantly benefit from the knowledge of dominant\nvoltage influencer (DVI) nodes. DVI nodes for a particular node of interest\nrefer to nodes that have a relatively high impact on the voltage fluctuations\nat that node. Conventional power flow-based algorithms to identify DVI nodes\nare computationally complex, which limits their use in real-time applications.\nThis paper proposes a novel information theoretic voltage influencing score\n(VIS) that quantifies the voltage influencing capacity of nodes with\nDERs/active loads in a three phase unbalanced distribution system. VIS is then\nemployed to rank the nodes and identify the DVI set. VIS is derived\nanalytically in a computationally efficient manner and its efficacy to identify\nDVI nodes is validated using the IEEE 37-node test system. It is shown through\nexperiments that KL divergence and Bhattacharyya distance are effective\nindicators of DVI nodes with an identifying accuracy of more than 90%.

Each\nmachine incurs a cost, which is a function of the total load assigned to it,\nand some cost-sharing mechanism distributes this cost among the machine's\nusers. The users choose a machine aiming to minimize their own share of the\ncost, so the cost-sharing mechanism induces a game among them. We approach this\nproblem from the perspective of a designer who can select which cost-sharing\nmechanism to use, aiming to minimize the price of anarchy (PoA) of the induced\ngames.\n  Recent work introduced the class of \\emph{resource-aware} cost-sharing\nmechanisms, whose decisions can depend on the set of machines in the system,\nbut are oblivious to the total number of users. These mechanisms can guarantee\nlow PoA bounds for instances where the cost functions of the machines are all\nconvex or concave, but can suffer from very high PoA for cost functions that\ndeviate from these families.\n  In this paper we show that if we enhance the class of resource-aware\nmechanisms with some prior information regarding the users, then they can\nachieve low PoA for a much more general family of cost functions. We first show\nthat, as long as the mechanism knows just two of the participating users, then\nit can assign special roles to them and ensure a constant PoA. We then extend\nthis idea to settings where the mechanism has access to the probability with\nwhich each user is present in the system. For all these instances, we provide a\nmechanism that achieves an expected PoA that is logarithmic in the expected\nnumber of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 04:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

Unfortunately, most approaches fail to achieve a\npreferable balance between convolutional efficiency and feature-interaction\nsufficiency. For this reason, we propose a concise and novel Channel\nTensorization Network (CT-Net), by treating the channel dimension of input\nfeature as a multiplication of K sub-dimensions. On one hand, it naturally\nfactorizes convolution in a multiple dimension way, leading to a light\ncomputation burden. On the other hand, it can effectively enhance feature\ninteraction from different channels, and progressively enlarge the 3D receptive\nfield of such interaction to boost classification accuracy. Furthermore, we\nequip our CT-Module with a Tensor Excitation (TE) mechanism. It can learn to\nexploit spatial, temporal and channel attention in a high-dimensional manner,\nto improve the cooperative power of all the feature dimensions in our\nCT-Module. Finally, we flexibly adapt ResNet as our CT-Net. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on several challenging video benchmarks, e.g.,\nKinetics-400, Something-Something V1 and V2.

In order to pursue\ndetails of the activity, we have undertaken a kinematic analysis of the ALMA\narchive data of $^{12}$CO($J$=3-2) emission at the highest resolution $\\sim$3\npc.

However, the interpretation of\ninverted images can sometimes be difficult, due to the inherent limitations of\nexisting inversion algorithms, which produce smoothed sections. In order to\nimprove and automate the processing and interpretation of inverted geophysical\nmodels, we propose an approach inspired from data mining. We selected an\nalgorithm known as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\nwith Noise) to perform clustering of inverted geophysical sections. The\nmethodology relies on the automatic sorting and clustering of data. DBSCAN\ndetects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity values, with no prior\nknowledge of the number of clusters. This algorithm has the advantage of being\ndefined by only two parameters: the neighbourhood of a point in the data space,\nand the minimum number of data points in this neighbourhood. We propose an\nobjective procedure for the determination of these two parameters. The proof of\nconcept described here is applied to simulated ERT (electrical resistivity\ntomography) sections, for the following three cases: two layers with a step,\ntwo layers with a rebound, and two layers with an anomaly embedded in the upper\nlayer. To validate this approach, sensitivity studies were carried out on both\nof the above parameters, as well as to assess the influence of noise on the\nalgorithm's performance. Finally, this methodology was tested on real field\ndata. DBSCAN detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity models,\nand the former are then associated with various types of earth materials, thus\nallowing the structure of the prospected area to be determined. The proposed\ndata-mining algorithm is shown to be effective, and to improve the\ninterpretation of the inverted ERT sections. This new approach has considerable\npotential, as it can be applied to any geophysical data represented in the form\nof sections or maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 08:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

CGS systematically\ncomputes the fixed points of a target graph system and decodes them to estimate\nthe stationary properties of the system without the prior knowledge of existing\nsolvers or intermediate solutions. The forward propagation of CGS proceeds in\nthree steps: (1) constructing the input dependent linear contracting iterative\nmaps, (2) computing the fixed-points of the linear maps, and (3) decoding the\nfixed-points to estimate the properties. The contractivity of the constructed\nlinear maps guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the fixed points\nfollowing the Banach fixed point theorem. To train CGS efficiently, we also\nderive a tractable analytical expression for its gradient by leveraging the\nimplicit function theorem.

The results indicate\nthat CGS has competitive capabilities for predicting the stationary properties\nof graph systems, irrespective of whether the target systems are linear or\nnon-linear.

Reading preprints is one of the effective ways to do this. By having\njournal clubs where people can read and discuss journals together, the benefits\nof reading journals become more prevalent. We present an investigative study of\nunderstanding the factors that affect the success of preprint journal clubs in\nastronomy, more commonly known as Astro-ph/Astro-Coffee (hereafter called AC).\nA survey was disseminated to understand how institutions from different\ncountries implement AC. We interviewed 9 survey respondents and from their\nresponses we identified four important factors that make AC successful:\ncommitment (how the organizer and attendees participate in AC), environment\n(how conducive and comfortable AC is conducted), content (the discussed topics\nin AC and how they are presented), and objective (the main goal/s of conducting\nAC). We also present the format of our AC, an elective class which was\nevaluated during the Spring Semester 2020 (March 2020 - June 2020). Our\nevaluation with the attendees showed that enrollees (those who are enrolled and\nare required to present papers regularly) tend to be more committed in\nattending compared to audiences (those who are not enrolled and are not\nrequired to present papers regularly). In addition, participants tend to find\npapers outside their research field harder to read. Finally, we showed an\nimprovement in the weekly number of papers read after attending AC of those who\npresent papers regularly, and a high satisfaction rating of our AC. We\nsummarize the areas of improvement in our AC implementation, and we encourage\nother institutions to evaluate their own AC in accordance with the four\naforementioned factors to assess the effectiveness of their AC in reaching\ntheir goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 08:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

To this end, we\nintroduce an audio-visual loss that aligns the contributions from the two\nmodalities by acting on the magnitude of their feature norm representations.\nThis new loss, plugged into a minimal multi-modal action recognition\narchitecture, leads to strong results in cross-domain first person action\nrecognition, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on the popular\nEPIC-Kitchens dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 08:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

Emotion recognition\nfrom brief contents should embrace the contrast between authors where the\ndifferences in personality and cognition can be traced within emotional\nexpressions. To tackle this challenge, we devise a framework that, on the one\nhand, infers latent individual aspects, from brief contents and, on the other\nhand, presents a novel ensemble classifier equipped with dynamic dropout\nconvnets to extract emotions from textual context.

This paper investigates epoch-wise\ndouble descent, i.e., the test error of a DNN also shows double descent as the\nnumber of training epoches increases. By extending the bias-variance analysis\nto epoch-wise double descent of the zero-one loss, we surprisingly find that\nthe variance itself, without the bias, varies consistently with the test error.\nInspired by this result, we propose a novel metric, optimization variance (OV),\nto measure the diversity of model updates caused by the stochastic gradients of\nrandom training batches drawn in the same iteration.

One method involves understanding human\nintentions and decision-making to estimate the human's present and near-future\nactions whilst interacting with a robot.

In\nlifelong learning, many tasks are presented in sequence and learners must\nefficiently transfer knowledge between tasks while avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting over long lifetimes. On these problems, policy reuse and other\nmulti-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn many tasks. However,\nthey can generate many temporary or permanent policies, resulting in memory\nissues. Consequently, there is a need for lifetime-scalable methods that\ncontinually refine a policy library of a pre-defined size. This paper presents\na first approach to lifetime-scalable policy reuse. To pre-select the number of\npolicies, a notion of task capacity, the maximal number of tasks that a policy\ncan accurately solve, is proposed. To evaluate lifetime policy reuse using this\nmethod, two state-of-the-art single-actor base-learners are compared: 1) a\nvalue-based reinforcement learner, Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Deep Recurrent\nQ-Network (DRQN); and 2) an actor-critic reinforcement learner, Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) with or without Long Short-Term Memory layer. By selecting\nthe number of policies based on task capacity, D(R)QN achieves near-optimal\nperformance with 6 policies in a 27-task MDP domain and 9 policies in an\n18-task POMDP domain; with fewer policies, catastrophic forgetting and negative\ntransfer are observed.

Due to the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager's high-cadence Doppler measurements, power absorption can be\ninvestigated at frequencies beyond the acoustic cutoff frequency. We perform an\nFHD on five sunspot regions and two quiet-Sun control regions and study the\nresulting absorption spectra $\\alpha_\\ell(\\nu)$, specifically at frequencies\n$\\nu$ > 5.3 mHz. We observe an unreported high-frequency absorption feature,\nwhich only appears in the presence of a sunspot. This feature is confined to\nphase speeds of one-skip waves whose origins coincide with the sunspot's\ncenter, with $v_{ph}$ = 85.7 km/s in this case. By employing a fit to the\nabsorption spectra at a constant phase speed, we find that the peak absorption\nstrength $\\alpha_{max}$ lies between 0.166 and 0.222 at a noise level of about\n0.009 (5%). The well-known absorption along ridges at lower frequencies can\nreach up to $\\alpha_{max}\\approx$ 0.5. Thus our finding in the absorption\nspectrum is weaker, but nevertheless significant. From first considerations\nregarding the energy budget of high-frequency waves, this observation can\nlikely be explained by the reduction of emissivity within the sunspot.

Whether the planet can be habitable or not depends on the\npossibility to maintain liquid water on its surface, and therefore on the\nluminosity of its host stars and on the dynamical properties of the planetary\norbit. The trajectory of a planet in a double star system can be determined,\napproximating stars and planets with point masses, by solving numerically the\nequations of motion of the classical three-body system. In this study, we\nanalyze a large data set of planetary orbits, made up with high precision long\nintegration at varying: the mass of the planet, its distance from the primary\nstar, the mass ratio for the two stars in the binary system, and the\neccentricity of the star motion. To simulate the gravitational dynamics, we use\na 15th order integration scheme (IAS15, available within the REBOUND\nframework), that provides an optimal solution for long-term integration.

Concerning\nthe stability, we find a significant number of orbits that are only marginally\nstable, according to the classification introduced by Musielak et al. 2005.

This analysis could help\nclinicians and stakeholders define precise guidelines for improving the\nmanagement of fetuses and newborns, particularly to reduce the potential\nadverse environmental impacts on ANS development that may lead to persistent\nlong-term consequences. Since the development of ANS and the vagus influence\nhave been shown to be reflected in cardiac variability, this paper will rely in\nparticular on studies using fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) to monitor the\ncontinued growth and health of both animal and human fetuses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 11:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Constraints are obtained by requiring the\nphysical viability of the solutions. A comparison is made between the viscous\nand non-viscous models, and between the models in GR and in f(R,T) gravity. The\nmetric potentials remain the same in GR and in f(R,T) gravity. Consequently,\nthe geometrical behavior of the $f(R,T)$ gravity models remains the same as the\nmodels in GR. It is found that f(R,T) gravity or bulk viscosity does not affect\nthe behavior of effective matter which acts as a stiff fluid in all models. The\nindividual fluids have very rich behavior.

Our aim is the validation\nof these measurements to support future studies of the Sun's AM loss. Methods:\nWe combine 60-minute averages of the proton bulk moments and the magnetic field\nmeasured by the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and the magnetometer (MAG) onboard\nSolar Orbiter. We calculate the AM flux per solid-angle element using data from\nthe first orbit of the mission's cruise phase during 2020. We separate the\ncontributions from protons and from magnetic stresses to the total AM flux.\nResults: The AM flux varies significantly over time. The particle contribution\ntypically dominates over the magnetic-field contribution during our measurement\ninterval. The total AM flux shows the largest variation and is typically\nanti-correlated with the radial solar-wind speed. We identify a compression\nregion, potentially associated with a co-rotating interaction region or a\ncoronal mass ejection, that leads to a significant localised increase in the AM\nflux, yet without a significant increase in the AM per unit mass. We repeat our\nanalysis using the density estimate from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW)\ninstrument. Using this independent method, we find a decrease in the peaks of\npositive AM flux but otherwise consistent results. Conclusions: Our results\nlargely agree with previous measurements of the solar-wind AM flux in terms of\namplitude, variability, and dependence on radial solar-wind bulk speed. Our\nanalysis highlights the potential for future, more detailed, studies of the\nsolar wind's AM and its other large-scale properties with data from Solar\nOrbiter.

In response to recent\ncontroversies about the harms of digital technology, discourses and practices\nof \"tech ethics\" have proliferated across the tech industry, academia, civil\nsociety, and government. Yet despite the seeming promise of ethics, tech ethics\nin practice suffers from several significant limitations: tech ethics is vague\nand toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology\ndesign, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations\nsuggest that tech ethics enables corporate \"ethics-washing\": embracing the\nlanguage of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation,\nwithout committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech\nethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether\nethics is desirable, but what \"ethics\" entails and who gets to define it.\nCurrent approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and\ntechnology companies to label themselves as \"ethical\" without substantively\naltering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural improvements in\ndigital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of\nnormative inquiry and ethics as a practical endeavor.

We consider different corruption schemes. In the most basic one, all\nwinning bidders lower their bid to the highest losing bid. We show that this\nsetting is equivalent to a $\\gamma$-hybrid auction in which the payments are a\nconvex combination of first-price and the second-price payments.

While interacting with a CSP,\ncentral to their concerns is the process of cost-effectively utilizing\ndifferent purchase options possibly in addition to self-owned instances. A job\nin data-intensive applications is typically represented by a directed acyclic\ngraph which can further be transformed into a chain of tasks. The key to\nachieving cost efficiency is determining the allocation of a specific deadline\nto each task, as well as the allocation of different types of instances to the\ntask. In this paper, we propose a framework that determines the optimal\nallocation of deadlines to tasks. The framework also features an optimal policy\nto determine the allocation of spot and on-demand instances in a predefined\ntime window, and a near-optimal policy for allocating self-owned instances.

Analyzing system\ndesign can help engineers understand how a compromised sensor could impact the\nsystem's behavior; however, designing security analyses for cyber-physical\nsystems is difficult due to their combination of discrete dynamics, continuous\ndynamics, and nondeterminism.\n  This paper contributes a framework for modeling and analyzing sensor attacks\non cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of hybrid programs. We formalize\nand analyze two relational properties of a system's robustness. These\nrelational properties respectively express (1) whether a system's safety\nproperty can be influenced by sensor attacks, and (2) whether a system's\nhigh-integrity state can be affected by sensor attacks. We characterize these\nrelational properties by defining an equivalence relation between a system\nunder attack and the original unattacked system. That is, the system satisfies\nthe robustness properties if executions of the attacked system are\nappropriately related to executions of the unattacked system.\n  We present two techniques for reasoning about the equivalence relation and\nthus proving the relational properties for a system.

The other\nproof technique adapts the self-composition technique from the literature on\nsecure information-flow, allowing us to reduce reasoning about the equivalence\nof two systems to reasoning about properties of a single system.

In the monolithic\ncollapse scheme of high mass star formation, a compact dense core of 100\n$M_\\odot$ within a volume of 0.1 pc radius is assumed as the initial condition,\nwhereas the formation of such a core remained unexplained in the previous\nworks. We argue that the proposed collision is a step which efficiently\ncollects the gas of 100 $M_\\odot$ into 0.1 pc radius. This lends support for\nthat the cloud-cloud collision is an essential process in forming the compact\nhigh-mass dense core, IRAS 05358+3543.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 13:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods\nof solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying\nmathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of\nunknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an\nappropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators\nthat map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid\nsolver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have\nbeen developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is\npossible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators,\ngiven a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary\nproblem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, a necessary step\nin developing fully learnable AMG methods.

Emerging rotating spirals\ncomposed by the competing species are frequently observed character of the\nresulting patterns.

Recently Ghaffari,\nKuhn and Uitto (FOCS 2019) introduced the class of component-stable low-space\nMPC algorithms, which are, informally, defined as algorithms for which the\noutputs reported by the nodes in different connected components are required to\nbe independent. This very natural notion was introduced to capture most (if not\nall) of the known efficient MPC algorithms to date, and it was the first\ngeneral class of MPC algorithms for which one can show non-trivial conditional\nlower bounds. In this paper we enhance the framework of component-stable\nalgorithms and investigate its effect on the complexity of randomized and\ndeterministic low-space MPC. Our key contributions include:\n  1) We revise and formalize the lifting approach of Ghaffari, Kuhn and Uitto.\nThis requires a very delicate amendment of the notion of component stability,\nwhich allows us to fill in gaps in the earlier arguments.\n  2) We also extend the framework to obtain conditional lower bounds for\ndeterministic algorithms and fine-grained lower bounds that depend on the\nmaximum degree $\\Delta$.\n  3) We demonstrate a collection of natural graph problems for which\nnon-component-stable algorithms break the conditional lower bound obtained for\ncomponent-stable algorithms. This implies that, for both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, component-stable algorithms are conditionally weaker\nthan the non-component-stable ones.\n  Altogether our results imply that component-stability might limit the\ncomputational power of the low-space MPC model, at least in certain contexts,\npaving the way for improved upper bounds that escape the conditional lower\nbound setting of Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Uitto.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 14:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

Taking the perspective that horizontal\ndetection is a special case for rotated object detection, in this paper, we are\nmotivated to change the design of rotation regression loss from induction\nparadigm to deduction methodology, in terms of the relation between rotation\nand horizontal detection. We show that one essential challenge is how to\nmodulate the coupled parameters in the rotation regression loss, as such the\nestimated parameters can influence to each other during the dynamic joint\noptimization, in an adaptive and synergetic way. Specifically, we first convert\nthe rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution, and then calculate\nthe Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian distributions as the\nregression loss. By analyzing the gradient of each parameter, we show that KLD\n(and its derivatives) can dynamically adjust the parameter gradients according\nto the characteristics of the object. It will adjust the importance (gradient\nweight) of the angle parameter according to the aspect ratio. This mechanism\ncan be vital for high-precision detection as a slight angle error would cause a\nserious accuracy drop for large aspect ratios objects. More importantly, we\nhave proved that KLD is scale invariant. We further show that the KLD loss can\nbe degenerated into the popular $l_{n}$-norm loss for horizontal detection.\nExperimental results on seven datasets using different detectors show its\nconsistent superiority, and codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection and\nhttps://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 14:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 09:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 05:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

In terms of interpolation, the GAN-based medical image\naugmentation is reliable because medical modalities can display the human\nbody's strong anatomical consistency at fixed position while clearly reflecting\ninter-subject variability; thus, we propose to use noise-to-image GANs (e.g.,\nrandom noise samples to diverse pathological images) for (i) medical Data\nAugmentation (DA) and (ii) physician training. Regarding the DA, the\nGAN-generated images can improve Computer-Aided Diagnosis based on supervised\nlearning. For the physician training, the GANs can display novel desired\npathological images and help train medical trainees despite\ninfrastructural/legal constraints. This thesis contains four GAN projects\naiming to present such novel applications' clinical relevance in collaboration\nwith physicians. Whereas the methods are more generally applicable, this thesis\nonly explores a few oncological applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 15:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

Wave-EPI involves playing sinusoidal gradients during the EPI\nreadout while employing interslice shifts as in blipped-CAIPI acquisitions.\nThis spreads the aliasing in all spatial directions, thereby taking better\nadvantage of 3D coil sensitivity profiles. The amount of voxel spreading that\ncan be achieved by the wave gradients during the short EPI readout period is\nconstrained by the slew rate of the gradient coils and peripheral nerve\nstimulation (PNS) monitor.

Extending wave-EPI to multi-shot\nacquisition minimizes geometric distortion and voxel blurring at high in-plane\nresolution, while structured low-rank regularization mitigates shot-to-shot\nphase variations without additional navigators. We propose to use different\npoint spread functions (PSFs) for the k-space lines with positive and negative\npolarities, which are calibrated with a FLEET-based reference scan and allow\nfor addressing gradient imperfections.

AOLME project provides a collaborative learning environment for\nmiddle school students to explore mathematics, computer science, and\nengineering by processing digital images and videos. As part of this project,\naround 2200 hours of video data was collected for analysis. Because of the size\nof the dataset, it is hard to analyze all the videos of the dataset manually.\nThus, there is a huge need for reliable computer-based methods that can detect\nactivities of interest. My thesis is focused on the development of accurate\nmethods for detecting and tracking objects in long videos. All the models are\nvalidated on videos from 7 different sessions, ranging from 45 minutes to 90\nminutes. The keyboard detector achieved a very high average precision (AP) of\n92% at 0.5 intersection over union (IoU). Furthermore, a combined system of the\ndetector with a fast tracker KCF (159fps) was developed so that the algorithm\nruns significantly faster without sacrificing accuracy. For a video of 23\nminutes having resolution 858X480 @ 30 fps, the detection alone runs at 4.7Xthe\nreal-time, and the combined algorithm runs at 21Xthe real-time for an average\nIoU of 0.84 and 0.82, respectively. The hand detector achieved average\nprecision (AP) of 72% at 0.5 IoU. The detection results were improved to 81%\nusing optimal data augmentation parameters. The hand detector runs at 4.7Xthe\nreal-time with AP of 81% at 0.5 IoU. The hand detection method was integrated\nwith projections and clustering for accurate proposal generation. This approach\nreduced the number of false-positive hand detections by 80%.

Gaussian distributions on manifolds are harder\nto make use of in applications since the normalisation factors, which we will\nrefer to as partition functions, are complicated, intractable integrals in\ngeneral that depend in a highly non-linear way on the mean of the given\ndistribution. Nonetheless, on Riemannian symmetric spaces, the partition\nfunctions are independent of the mean and reduce to integrals over finite\ndimensional vector spaces. These are generally still hard to compute\nnumerically when the dimension (more precisely the rank $N$) of the underlying\nsymmetric space gets large. On the space of positive definite Hermitian\nmatrices, it is possible to compute these integrals exactly using methods from\nrandom matrix theory and the so-called Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials. In other\ncases of interest to applications, such as the space of symmetric positive\ndefinite (SPD) matrices or the Siegel domain (related to block-Toeplitz\ncovariance matrices), these methods seem not to work quite as well.\nNonetheless, it remains possible to compute leading order terms in a large $N$\nlimit, which provide increasingly accurate approximations as $N$ grows. This\nlimit is inspired by realizing a given partition function as the partition\nfunction of a zero-dimensional quantum field theory or even Chern-Simons\ntheory.

In our work, we propose a steerable\nfeed-forward learning-based approach that consists of neurons with spherical\ndecision surfaces and operates on point clouds. Such spherical neurons are\nobtained by conformal embedding of Euclidean space and have recently been\nrevisited in the context of learning representations of point sets. Focusing on\n3D geometry, we exploit the isometry property of spherical neurons and derive a\n3D steerability constraint. After training spherical neurons to classify point\nclouds in a canonical orientation, we use a tetrahedron basis to quadruplicate\nthe neurons and construct rotation-equivariant spherical filter banks. We then\napply the derived constraint to interpolate the filter bank outputs and, thus,\nobtain a rotation-invariant network. Finally, we use a synthetic point set and\nreal-world 3D skeleton data to verify our theoretical findings.

Mathematical analysis of the NDR\nproblem is done and the so-called defocus removal (DR) algorithm for solving it\nis proposed. Global convergence of the DR algorithm is established without\nimposing any unverifiable assumption. Numerical results on simulation data show\nsignificant features of DR including solvability, noise robustness,\nconvergence, model insensitivity and computational efficiency. Physical\nrelevance of the NDR problem and practicability of the DR algorithm are tested\non experimental data. Back to the application that originally motivated the\ninvestigation of the NDR problem, we show that the DR algorithm can improve the\naccuracy of classifying distorted images using convolutional neural networks.\nThe key difference of this paper compared to most existing works on\nsingle-frame anisoplanatic deconvolution is that the new method does not\nrequire the data image to be decomposable into isoplanatic subregions.\nTherefore, solution approaches partitioning the image into isoplanatic zones\nare not applicable to the NDR problem and those handling the entire image such\nas the DR algorithm need to be developed and analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 15:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

To\nensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile\nusers and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint\n(CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are\nexploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the\nwireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a\nsequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users'\nfeeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption\nconstraints on access points (APs) and users' head-mounted displays (HMDs). The\nproblem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users'\naccurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer\ncharacteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state\nnetwork (ESN) learning method to predict users' tracking information by\ntraining fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs.\nWith the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based\noptimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we\nimplement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer\ndecision variables and solving a continuous power control problem to criticize\nthe integer decision variables. Finally, the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the impact of\ndifferent design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% energy-efficient than the benchmark\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 08:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 13:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}
