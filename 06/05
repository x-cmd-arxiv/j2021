Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic\nthe operations in the human brain, have been studied as prominent\nenergy-efficient neural networks. Due to their event-driven and\nspatiotemporally sparse operations, SNNs show possibilities for\nenergy-efficient processing. To unlock their potential, deep SNNs have adopted\ntemporal coding such as time-to-first-spike (TTFS)coding, which represents the\ninformation between neurons by the first spike time. With TTFS coding, each\nneuron generates one spike at most, which leads to a significant improvement in\nenergy efficiency. Several studies have successfully introduced TTFS coding in\ndeep SNNs, but they showed restricted efficiency improvement owing to the lack\nof consideration for efficiency during training. To address the aforementioned\nissue, this paper presents training methods for energy-efficient deep SNNs with\nTTFS coding. We introduce a surrogate DNN model to train the deep SNN in a\nfeasible time and analyze the effect of the temporal kernel on training\nperformance and efficiency. Based on the investigation, we propose\nstochastically relaxed activation and initial value-based regularization for\nthe temporal kernel parameters. In addition, to reduce the number of spikes\neven further, we present temporal kernel-aware batch normalization. With the\nproposed methods, we could achieve comparable training results with\nsignificantly reduced spikes, which could lead to energy-efficient deep SNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 16:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

The prediction is based on the wave\nturbulence theory of internal gravity waves and on a new methodology devised\nfor the computation of the associated energy fluxes. In the standard spectral\nrepresentation of the wave energy density, in the two-dimensional vertical\nwavenumber - frequency domain, the energy fluxes associated with the steady\nstate are found to be directed downscale in both coordinates, closely matching\nthe Finescale-Parameterization formula in functional form and in magnitude.\nThese energy transfers are composed of a `local' and a `scale-separated'\ncontributions; while the former is quantified numerically, the latter is\ndominated by the Induced Diffusion process and is amenable to analytical\ntreatment.

Direct observation of gamma-ray emission from the decay of $^{18}$F\nejected in classical nova outbursts remains a major focus of the nuclear\nastrophysics community. However, modeling the abundance of ejected $^{18}$F,\nand thus the predicted detectability distance of a gamma-ray signal near 511\nkeV emitted from these transient thermonuclear episodes, is hampered by\nsignificant uncertainties in our knowledge of the key $^{18}$F(p,$\\alpha$)\nreaction rate. Aims. We analyze uncertainties in the most recent nuclear\nphysics experimental results employed to calculate the $^{18}$F(p,$\\alpha$)\nreaction rate. Our goal is to determine which uncertainties have the most\nprofound influence on the predicted abundance of $^{18}$F ejected from novae,\nin order to guide future experimental works. Methods. We calculated a wide\nrange of $^{18}$F(p,$\\alpha$) reaction rates using R-Matrix formalism, allowing\nus to take into account all interference effects. Using a selection of 16\nevenly-spaced rates over the full range, we performed 16 new hydrodynamic nova\nsimulations. Results. We performed one of the most thorough theoretical studies\nof the impact of the $^{18}$F(p,$\\alpha$) reaction in classical novae to date.\nThe $^{18}$F(p,$\\alpha$) rate remains highly uncertain at nova temperatures,\nresulting in a factor ~10 uncertainty in the predicted abundance of $^{18}$F\nejected from nova explosions. We also found that the abundance of $^{18}$F may\nbe strongly correlated with that of $^{19}$F. Conclusions. Despite numerous\nnuclear physics uncertainties affecting the $^{18}$F(p,$\\alpha$) reaction rate,\nwhich are dominated by unknown interference signs between 1/2$^+$ and 3/2$^+$\nresonances, future experimental work should focus on firmly and precisely\ndetermining the directly measurable quantum properties of the subthreshold\nstates in the compound nucleus $^{19}$Ne near 6.13 and 6.29 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 17:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 15:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

This particular mode of collective neutrino\noscillations has a deep connection to the angular structure of neutrinos in\nmomentum space; for instance, the appearance of electron neutrinos lepton\nnumber (ELN) angular crossings in momentum space is a good indicator of\noccurrences of the flavor conversions. However, many multi-dimensional\n(multi-D) CCSN simulations are carried out with approximate neutrino transport\n(such as two-moment methods), which limits the access to the angular\ndistributions of neutrinos, i.e., inhibits ELN-crossing searches. In this\npaper, we develop a new method of ELN-crossing search in these CCSN\nsimulations. The required data is the zero-th and first angular moments of\nneutrinos and matter profile, all of which are available in CCSN models with\ntwo-moment method. One of the novelties of our new method is to use a\nray-tracing neutrino transport to determine ELNs in the direction of the\nstellar center. It is designed to compensate for shortcomings of the crossing\nsearches only with the two angular moments. We assess the capability of the\nmethod by carrying out a detailed comparison to results of full Boltzmann\nneutrino transport in 1D and 2D CCSN models. We find that the ray-tracing\nneutrino transport improves the accuracy of crossing searches; indeed, the\nappearance/disappearance of the crossings is accurately detected even in the\nregion of forward-peaked angular distributions. The new method is\ncomputationally cheap and has a benefit of efficient parallelization; hence, it\nwill be useful for ELN-crossing searches in any CCSN models employed two-moment\nneutrino transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 22:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this context, the Nash social\nwelfare-defined as the geometric mean of agents' valuations for their assigned\nbundles-stands as a fundamental measure that quantifies the extent of fairness\nof an allocation. Focusing on instances in which the agents' valuations have\nbinary marginals, we develop essentially tight results for (approximately)\nmaximizing Nash social welfare under two of the most general classes of\ncomplement-free valuations, i.e., under binary XOS and binary subadditive\nvaluations.\n  For binary XOS valuations, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that finds\na constant-factor (specifically $288$) approximation for the optimal Nash\nsocial welfare, in the standard value-oracle model. The allocations computed by\nour algorithm also achieve constant-factor approximation for social welfare and\nthe groupwise maximin share guarantee. These results imply that-in the case of\nbinary XOS valuations-there necessarily exists an allocation that\nsimultaneously satisfies multiple (approximate) fairness and efficiency\ncriteria. We complement the algorithmic result by proving that Nash social\nwelfare maximization is APX-hard under binary XOS valuations.\n  Furthermore, this work establishes an interesting separation between the\nbinary XOS and binary subadditive settings.

In this response we highlight important errors in their position.\n  Study Design and Setting: We counter Doi et al.'s arguments by further\nexamining the correlations of odds ratios, and risk ratios, with baseline risks\nin 20,198 meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.\n  Results: Doi et al.'s claim that odds ratios are portable is invalid because\n1) their reasoning is circular: they assume a model under which the odds ratio\nis constant and show that under such a model the odds ratio is portable; 2) the\nmethod they advocate to convert odds ratios to risk ratios is biased; 3) their\nempirical example is readily-refuted by counter-examples of meta-analyses in\nwhich the risk ratio is portable but the odds ratio isn't; and 4) they fail to\nconsider the causal determinants of meta-analytic inclusion criteria: Doi et\nal. mistakenly claim that variation in odds ratios with different baseline\nrisks in meta-analyses is due to collider bias. Empirical comparison between\nthe correlations of odds ratios, and risk ratios, with baseline risks show that\nthe portability of odds ratios and risk ratios varies across settings.\n  Conclusion: The suggestion to replace risk ratios with odds ratios is based\non circular reasoning and a confusion of mathematical and empirical results.

For\nprovably learning the parameters of a generative model, the method of moments\nis the standard workhorse of theoretical machine learning. It turns out that\nthere is a natural incarnation of the method of moments for orbit recovery\nbased on invariant theory. Bandeira et al.

To address the challenge that available tasks may not\ndensely sample the space of tasks, we propose to augment the task set through\ninterpolation. By meta-learning with task interpolation (MLTI), our approach\neffectively generates additional tasks by randomly sampling a pair of tasks and\ninterpolating the corresponding features and labels.

In industrial\napplications, these models operate at extreme scales, where every bit of\nperformance is critical. Memory constraints at extreme scales also require that\nmodels be sparse, hence tree-based models are often back-ended by sparse matrix\nalgebra routines. However, there are currently no sparse matrix techniques\nspecifically designed for the sparsity structure one encounters in tree-based\nmodels for extreme multi-label ranking/classification (XMR/XMC) problems. To\naddress this issue, we present the masked sparse chunk multiplication (MSCM)\ntechnique, a sparse matrix technique specifically tailored to XMR trees. MSCM\nis easy to implement, embarrassingly parallelizable, and offers a significant\nperformance boost to any existing tree inference pipeline at no cost. We\nperform a comprehensive study of MSCM applied to several different sparse\ninference schemes and benchmark our methods on a general purpose extreme\nmulti-label ranking framework. We observe that MSCM gives consistently dramatic\nspeedups across both the online and batch inference settings, single- and\nmulti-threaded settings, and on many different tree models and datasets. To\ndemonstrate its utility in industrial applications, we apply MSCM to an\nenterprise-scale semantic product search problem with 100 million products and\nachieve sub-millisecond latency of 0.88 ms per query on a single thread -- an\n8x reduction in latency over vanilla inference techniques. The MSCM technique\nrequires absolutely no sacrifices to model accuracy as it gives exactly the\nsame results as standard sparse matrix techniques. Therefore, we believe that\nMSCM will enable users of XMR trees to save a substantial amount of compute\nresources in their inference pipelines at very little cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 20:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 23:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 22:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Most\nexisting fairness literature focuses on learning a single task more fairly,\nwhile how ML fairness interacts with multiple tasks in the joint learning\nsetting is largely under-explored. In this paper, we are concerned with how\ngroup fairness (e.g., equal opportunity, equalized odds) as an ML fairness\nconcept plays out in the multi-task scenario. In multi-task learning, several\ntasks are learned jointly to exploit task correlations for a more efficient\ninductive transfer.

In this\npaper, we define the Spreading Potential (SP) problem in which different sets\nof agents need to evaluated and compared based on their social influence. A\ntypical application of SP is choosing locations for a series of marketing\nevents. The SP problem is different from the well-known Influence Maximization\n(IM) problem in two aspects. Firstly, it deals with sets rather than nodes.\nSecondly, the sets are diverse, composed by a mixture of influential and\nordinary agents. Thus, SP needs to assess the contribution of ordinary agents\ntoo, while IM only aims to find top spreaders. We provide a systemic test for\nranking influence measures in the SP problem based on node sampling and on a\nnovel statistical method, the Sum of Ranking Differences. Using a Linear\nThreshold diffusion model on an online social network, we evaluate seven\nnetwork measures of social influence. We demonstrate that the statistical\nassessment of these influence measures is remarkably different in the SP\nproblem, when low-ranked individuals are present, from the IM problem, when we\nfocus on the algorithm's top choices exclusively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 20:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 23:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

We provide\nan efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for computing the Frechet\nmean from a sample of or distribution on unlabelled ranked tree shapes and\nunlabelled ranked genealogies. We show the applicability of our summary\nstatistics for studying popular tree distributions and for comparing the\nSARS-CoV-2 evolutionary trees across different locations during the COVID-19\nepidemic in 2020.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 21:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

As all the channels remain stable\nwithin the channel coherence time, Mallory's injected packets cause Alice and\nBob to measure similar RSS, which allows Mallory to successfully predict the\nderived key bits. To defend against such a MitM attack, we propose to utilize a\nreconfigurable antenna at one of the legitimate transceivers to proactively\nrandomize the channel state across different channel probing rounds. The\nrandomization of the antenna mode at every probing round breaks the temporal\ncorrelation of the channels from the adversary to the legitimate devices, while\npreserving the reciprocity of the channel between the latter.

State-of-the-art DBA attacks relying on zeroth-order\ngradient estimation require an excessive number of queries. Recently, Bayesian\noptimization (BO) has shown promising in reducing the number of queries in\nscore-based attacks (SBA), in which attackers need to observe real-valued\nprobability scores as outputs. However, extending BO to the setting of DBA is\nnontrivial because in DBA only output labels instead of real-valued scores, as\nneeded by BO, are available to attackers. In this paper, we close this gap by\nproposing an efficient DBA attack, namely BO-DBA. Different from existing\napproaches, BO-DBA generates adversarial examples by searching so-called\n\\emph{directions of perturbations}. It then formulates the problem as a BO\nproblem that minimizes the real-valued distortion of perturbations. With the\noptimized perturbation generation process, BO-DBA converges much faster than\nthe state-of-the-art DBA techniques. Experimental results on pre-trained\nImageNet classifiers show that BO-DBA converges within 200 queries while the\nstate-of-the-art DBA techniques need over 15,000 queries to achieve the same\nlevel of perturbation distortion.

We analyze the behavior of the Pauli potential of\nnon-relativistic neutral atoms under Lieb-Simon scaling -- the process of\ntaking nuclear charge and particle number to infinity, in which the kinetic\nenergy tends to the Thomas-Fermi limit.

NGC 4151 is one of those rare galaxies for\nwhich multiple methods can be used: stellar and gas dynamical modeling because\nof its proximity ($D=15.8\\pm0.4$ Mpc from Cepheids), and reverberation mapping\nbecause of its active accretion. In this work, we re-analyzed $H-$band integral\nfield spectroscopy of the nucleus of NGC 4151 from Gemini NIFS, improving the\nanalysis at several key steps. We then constructed a wide range of axisymmetric\ndynamical models with the new orbit-superposition code Forstand. One of our\nprimary goals is to quantify the systematic uncertainties in $M_\\mathrm{BH}$\narising from different combinations of the deprojected density profile,\ninclination, intrinsic flattening, and mass-to-light ratio. As a consequence of\nuncertainties on the stellar luminosity profile arising from the presence of\nthe AGN, our constraints on \\mbh are rather weak. Models with a steep central\ncusp are consistent with no black hole; however, in models with more moderate\ncusps, the black hole mass lies within the range of $0.25\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot\n\\lesssim M_\\mathrm{BH} \\lesssim 3\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot$.

The vast majority of triangle\ncounting algorithms are targeted to static graphs. Yet, many real-world graphs\nare directed and temporal, where edges come with timestamps. Temporal triangles\nyield much more information, since they account for both the graph topology and\nthe timestamps.\n  Temporal triangle counting has seen a few recent results, but there are\nvarying definitions of temporal triangles. In all cases, temporal triangle\npatterns enforce constraints on the time interval between edges (in the\ntriangle). We define a general notion $(\\delta_{1,3}, \\delta_{1,2},\n\\delta_{2,3})$-temporal triangles that allows for separate time constraints for\nall pairs of edges.\n  Our main result is a new algorithm, DOTTT (Degeneracy Oriented Temporal\nTriangle Totaler), that exactly counts all directed variants of $(\\delta_{1,3},\n\\delta_{1,2}, \\delta_{2,3})$-temporal triangles.

The standard ``in the clear'' algorithm to grow decision trees on\ndata with continuous values requires sorting of training examples for each\nfeature in the quest for an optimal cut-point in the range of feature values in\neach node. Sorting is an expensive operation in MPC, hence finding secure\nprotocols that avoid such an expensive step is a relevant problem in\nprivacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper we propose three more\nefficient alternatives for secure training of decision tree based models on\ndata with continuous features, namely: (1) secure discretization of the data,\nfollowed by secure training of a decision tree over the discretized data; (2)\nsecure discretization of the data, followed by secure training of a random\nforest over the discretized data; and (3) secure training of extremely\nrandomized trees (``extra-trees'') on the original data.

Given\n$\\textsf{poly}(k/\\epsilon)$ samples from a distribution that is\n$\\epsilon$-close in TV distance to a GMM with $k$ components, we can construct\na GMM with $\\widetilde{O}(k)$ components that approximates the distribution to\nwithin $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon)$ in $\\textsf{poly}(k/\\epsilon)$ time. Thus we\nare able to approximately determine the minimum number of components needed to\nfit the distribution within a logarithmic factor. Prior to our work, the only\nknown algorithms for learning arbitrary univariate GMMs either output\nsignificantly more than $k$ components (e.g. $k/\\epsilon^2$ components for\nkernel density estimates) or run in time exponential in $k$. Moreover, by\nadapting our techniques we obtain similar results for reconstructing\nFourier-sparse signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 01:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 02:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Then a graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between\nreal nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes\nand majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network.

In studies related to viscoelastic droplets\nfalling/raising in an immiscible Newtonian fluids, it is well known that by\nincreasing the Deborah number (the ratio of the relaxation time of the interior\nfluid to a reference time scale) the droplet might lose its sphericity and\nobtain a dimple at the rear end.

We will\nshow that as the contribution of elastic and inertial forces are increased, the\nstagnation points at the rear and front sides of the droplet are expanded to\ncreate a region of elongational dominated flows. At this stage, due to a\ncombined effect of the shear thickening behavior of the elongational viscosity\nin viscoelastic fluids and the contribution of the inertial force, the interior\nphase is squeezed and consequently the droplet finds a shape similar to an\noblate. As these non-linear forces are increased further, an additional\ncircular stagnation line appears on the droplet surface in the external field,\npulling the droplet surface outward and therefore creating a dimple shape at\nthe rear end.

The zonal\nflow relaxation properties obtained in different flux tubes are found to differ\nwith each other and with the radially global result, except for sufficiently\nlong flux tubes, in general. The flux tube length required for convergence is\nconfiguration-dependent. Similarly, for ITG instabilities, different flux tubes\nprovide different results, but the discrepancy between them diminishes with\nincreasing flux tube length. Full-flux-surface and flux tube simulations show\ngood agreement in the calculation of the growth rate and frequency of the most\nunstable modes in LHD, while for W7-X differences in the growth rates are found\nbetween the flux tube and the full-flux-surface domains.

However, annotating a few target samples is usually very\nmanageable and worthwhile especially if it improves the adaptation performance\nsubstantially. This paper presents SSDAS, a Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptive\nimage Segmentation network that employs a few labeled target samples as anchors\nfor adaptive and progressive feature alignment between labeled source samples\nand unlabeled target samples. We position the few labeled target samples as\nreferences that gauge the similarity between source and target features and\nguide adaptive inter-domain alignment for learning more similar source\nfeatures. In addition, we replace the dissimilar source features by\nhigh-confidence target features continuously during the iterative training\nprocess, which achieves progressive intra-domain alignment between confident\nand unconfident target features. Extensive experiments show the proposed SSDAS\ngreatly outperforms a number of baselines, i.e., UDA-based semantic\nsegmentation and SSDA-based image classification. In addition, SSDAS is\ncomplementary and can be easily incorporated into UDA-based methods with\nconsistent improvements in domain adaptive semantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 09:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

RNN based models eliminate the limitation of sequence\nsize by allowing the modelling of variable size images within a deep learning\nmodel. We have also incorporated the effect of spatial continuity by exploring\ndifferent scanning techniques used to sample patches. To establish the\nefficiency of our approach, we trained and tested our model on two datasets,\nmicroscopy images and WSI tumour regions. After comparing with contemporary\nliterature we achieved the better performance with accuracy of 90% for\nmicroscopy image dataset. For WSI tumour region dataset, we compared the\nclassification results with deep learning networks such as ResNet, DenseNet,\nand InceptionV3 using maximum voting technique.

Additionally, the variable dimensions of WSI tumour\nregions were used for classification without the need for resizing.

We call this process last\nprogeny modified branching random walk (LPM-BRW). Depending on the value of a\nparameter, $\\theta$, we classify the model in three distinct cases, namely, the\nboundary case, below the boundary case, and above the boundary case. Under very\nminimal assumptions on the underlying point process of the increments, we show\nthat at the boundary case, $\\theta=\\theta_0$, where $\\theta_0$ is a parameter\nvalue associated with the displacement point process, the maximum displacement\nconverges to a limit after only an appropriate centering, which is of the form\n$c_1 n - c_2 \\log n$.

To alleviate the\nexpensive costs of deploying them on mobile devices, recent works have made\nhuge efforts for excavating redundancy in pre-defined architectures.\nNevertheless, the redundancy on the input resolution of modern CNNs has not\nbeen fully investigated, i.e., the resolution of input image is fixed. In this\npaper, we observe that the smallest resolution for accurately predicting the\ngiven image is different using the same neural network. To this end, we propose\na novel dynamic-resolution network (DRNet) in which the input resolution is\ndetermined dynamically based on each input sample. Wherein, a resolution\npredictor with negligible computational costs is explored and optimized jointly\nwith the desired network. Specifically, the predictor learns the smallest\nresolution that can retain and even exceed the original recognition accuracy\nfor each image. During the inference, each input image will be resized to its\npredicted resolution for minimizing the overall computation burden. We then\nconduct extensive experiments on several benchmark networks and datasets. The\nresults show that our DRNet can be embedded in any off-the-shelf network\narchitecture to obtain a considerable reduction in computational complexity.\nFor instance, DR-ResNet-50 achieves similar performance with an about 34%\ncomputation reduction, while gaining 1.4% accuracy increase with 10%\ncomputation reduction compared to the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 13:48:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 03:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 04:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

We utilize existing\nknowledge base completion tasks (LAMA) to probe every layer of pre-trained as\nwell as fine-tuned BERT models(ranking, question answering, NER). Our findings\nshow that knowledge is not just contained in BERT's final layers. Intermediate\nlayers contribute a significant amount (17-60%) to the total knowledge found.\nProbing intermediate layers also reveals how different types of knowledge\nemerge at varying rates.

Several methods with non-diagonal\npreconditioning matrices, including KFAC, Shampoo, and K-BFGS, have been\nproposed and shown to be effective. Based on the so-called tensor normal (TN)\ndistribution, we propose and analyze a brand new approximate natural gradient\nmethod, Tensor Normal Training (TNT), which like Shampoo, only requires\nknowledge of the shape of the training parameters. By approximating the\nprobabilistically based Fisher matrix, as opposed to the empirical Fisher\nmatrix, our method uses the block-wise covariance of the sampling based\ngradient as the pre-conditioning matrix.

Traditional approaches like community detection require\nstrong links between fraudulent attempts like shared attributes to find\ncommunities and the supervised solutions require large amount of training data\nwhich may not be available in fraud scenarios and work best to provide binary\nseparation between fraudulent and non fraudulent activities. Our approach\novercomes the drawbacks of traditional methods as GCNs simply learn\nsimilarities between fraudulent nodes to identify clusters of similar attempts\nand require much smaller dataset to learn. We demonstrate our results on linked\naccounts with both strong and weak links to identify fraud rings with high\nconfidence. Our results outperform label propagation community detection and\nsupervised GBTs algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 09:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The power curve of a wind turbine, which exhibits the\nrelationship between generated power and wind speed, plays a major role in\nassessing the performance of a wind farm. Neural networks have been used for\npower curve estimation. However, they do not produce a confidence measure for\ntheir output, unless computationally prohibitive Bayesian methods are used. In\nthis paper, a probabilistic neural network with Monte Carlo dropout is\nconsidered to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty of the power curve\nestimation. This approach offers a minimal increase in computational complexity\nover deterministic approaches. Furthermore, by incorporating a probabilistic\nloss function, the noise or aleatoric uncertainty in the data is estimated. The\ndeveloped network captures both model and noise uncertainty which is found to\nbe useful tools in assessing performance. Also, the developed network is\ncompared with existing ones across a public domain dataset showing superior\nperformance in terms of prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 19:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

By leveraging auto-curricula to induce a population of distinct\nemergent strategies, PB-MARL has achieved impressive success in tackling\nmulti-agent tasks. Despite remarkable prior arts of distributed RL frameworks,\nPB-MARL poses new challenges for parallelizing the training frameworks due to\nthe additional complexity of multiple nested workloads between sampling,\ntraining and evaluation involved with heterogeneous policy interactions. To\nsolve these problems, we present MALib, a scalable and efficient computing\nframework for PB-MARL. Our framework is comprised of three key components: (1)\na centralized task dispatching model, which supports the self-generated tasks\nand scalable training with heterogeneous policy combinations; (2) a programming\narchitecture named Actor-Evaluator-Learner, which achieves high parallelism for\nboth training and sampling, and meets the evaluation requirement of\nauto-curriculum learning; (3) a higher-level abstraction of MARL training\nparadigms, which enables efficient code reuse and flexible deployments on\ndifferent distributed computing paradigms. Experiments on a series of complex\ntasks such as multi-agent Atari Games show that MALib achieves throughput\nhigher than 40K FPS on a single machine with $32$ CPU cores; 5x speedup than\nRLlib and at least 3x speedup than OpenSpiel in multi-agent training tasks.\nMALib is publicly available at https://github.com/sjtu-marl/malib.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 03:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

However, for strongly non-linear and higher order\npartial differential equations PINN's accuracy reduces significantly. To\nresolve this problem, we propose a novel PINN scheme that solves the PDE\nsequentially over successive time segments using a single neural network. The\nkey idea is to re-train the same neural network for solving the PDE over\nsuccessive time segments while satisfying the already obtained solution for all\nprevious time segments.

In this article, we introduce\na new open-source parallel DEM software with load balancing: Lethe-DEM.\nLethe-DEM, a module of Lethe, consists of solvers for two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional DEM simulations.

This ability is of\ngreat importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by\nplanners, geo-designers, and architects. In this research, we implemented a\nnovel approach to 3D building models for such matter, which included the\nintegration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer Graphics\n(3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints\n(polygons), and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries\nfor rapid roof area damage reporting. These polygons (footprints) are usually\northogonal. A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of\nrectangles. The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal\nbuilding polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and\nbox-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing\nthese polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all\nbuilding polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of boxes as\nbuilding bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps\nbetween these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our\nproposal, after approximately orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and\nrectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles, each rectangle knows\nwhich rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,\nwhich will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building\nbodies combined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 22:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}
