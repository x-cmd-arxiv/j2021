They split every 2D image into a fixed number of patches,\neach of which is treated as a token. Generally, representing an image with more\ntokens would lead to higher prediction accuracy, while it also results in\ndrastically increased computational cost. To achieve a decent trade-off between\naccuracy and speed, the number of tokens is empirically set to 16x16 or 14x14.\nIn this paper, we argue that every image has its own characteristics, and\nideally the token number should be conditioned on each individual input. In\nfact, we have observed that there exist a considerable number of \"easy\" images\nwhich can be accurately predicted with a mere number of 4x4 tokens, while only\na small fraction of \"hard\" ones need a finer representation. Inspired by this\nphenomenon, we propose a Dynamic Transformer to automatically configure a\nproper number of tokens for each input image. This is achieved by cascading\nmultiple Transformers with increasing numbers of tokens, which are sequentially\nactivated in an adaptive fashion at test time, i.e., the inference is\nterminated once a sufficiently confident prediction is produced. We further\ndesign efficient feature reuse and relationship reuse mechanisms across\ndifferent components of the Dynamic Transformer to reduce redundant\ncomputations. Extensive empirical results on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the competitive baselines\nin terms of both theoretical computational efficiency and practical inference\nspeed.

Why does contrastive learning usually need much stronger\ndata augmentations than supervised learning to ensure good representations?\nThese questions involve both the optimization and statistical aspects of deep\nlearning, but can hardly be answered by analyzing supervised learning, where\nthe target functions are the highest pursuit. Indeed, in self-supervised\nlearning, it is inevitable to relate to the optimization/generalization of\nneural networks to how they can encode the latent structures in the data, which\nwe refer to as the feature learning process.\n  In this work, we formally study how contrastive learning learns the feature\nrepresentations for neural networks by analyzing its feature learning process.\nWe consider the case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the\nmore semantically aligned sparse features which we want to learn from, and the\nother dense features we want to avoid. Theoretically, we prove that contrastive\nlearning using $\\mathbf{ReLU}$ networks provably learns the desired sparse\nfeatures if proper augmentations are adopted.

However, tracer release experiments show that\nvertical diffusivity in the mid-depth ocean is an order of magnitude too small\nto explain the observed 1 km exponential scale. Alternative mechanisms\nsuggested that the overturning is mostly adiabatic, that interior diapycnal\nupwelling is negligible, and that nearly all mid-depth water upwells\nadiabatically in the Southern Ocean (SO). In this picture, SO eddies and wind\nset isopycnal slopes in the SO and therefore determine a non-vanishing\nmid-depth interior stratification even in the adiabatic limit. The effect of SO\neddies on SO isopycnal slopes can be understood via either a marginal\ncriticality condition or via a near-vanishing residual overturning conditions\nin the adiabatic limit. We examine the role of SO eddies vs interior mixing in\nsetting the mid-depth stratification by using eddy-permitting numerical\nsimulations, in which we artificially change the diapycnal mixing only away\nfrom the SO. We find that SO isopycnal slopes change in response to changes of\nthe interior diapycnal mixing even when the wind forcing is constant,\nconsistent with previous studies. However, in the limit of small interior\nmixing, the interior stratification is far from exponential, suggesting that SO\nprocesses alone do not lead to the observed stratification. The results suggest\nthat while SO eddies contribute to the non-vanishing mid-depth interior\nstratification, the exponential shape of the stratification must also involve\ninterior diapycnal mixing. Both SO eddies and interior diapycnal mixing are\ntherefore important in determining the interior mid-depth exponential\nstratification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 16:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 18:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 20:03:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 19:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

One of the principal benefits of\ncounterfactual explanations is allowing users to explore \"what-if\" scenarios\nthrough what does not and cannot exist in the data, a quality that many other\nforms of explanation such as heatmaps and influence functions are inherently\nincapable of doing. However, most previous work on generative explainability\ncannot disentangle important concepts effectively, produces unrealistic\nexamples, or fails to retain relevant information. We propose a novel approach,\nDISSECT, that jointly trains a generator, a discriminator, and a concept\ndisentangler to overcome such challenges using little supervision. DISSECT\ngenerates Concept Traversals (CTs), defined as a sequence of generated examples\nwith increasing degrees of concepts that influence a classifier's decision. By\ntraining a generative model from a classifier's signal, DISSECT offers a way to\ndiscover a classifier's inherent \"notion\" of distinct concepts automatically\nrather than rely on user-predefined concepts. We show that DISSECT produces CTs\nthat (1) disentangle several concepts, (2) are influential to a classifier's\ndecision and are coupled to its reasoning due to joint training (3), are\nrealistic, (4) preserve relevant information, and (5) are stable across similar\ninputs. We validate DISSECT on several challenging synthetic and realistic\ndatasets where previous methods fall short of satisfying desirable criteria for\ninterpretability and show that it performs consistently well and better than\nexisting methods.

When translating the change of gas fraction to the cosmic\nevolution of galaxies, this transition marks the end of the clumpy phase of\ndisc galaxies, and allows for the onset of spiral structures, as commonly found\nin the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 09:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

We propose an\napproach to build such systems by relying on the concepts of multiagent\nsystems, Peer to Peer (P2P) architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\nand structured documents (artifacts) cooperative edition. Indeed, we develop\nmathematical tools that allow any workflow systems designer, to express each\nadministrative process in the form of an attributed grammar whose symbols\nrepresent tasks to be executed, productions specify a scheduling of these\ntasks, and instances (the derivation trees that conform to it) represent the\ndifferent execution scenarios leading to business goal states. The obtained\ngrammatical model is then introduced into a proposed P2P system which is in\ncharge of carrying out the completely decentralised execution of the underlying\nprocess's instances. The said system orchestrates a process's instance\nexecution as a choreography during which, various software agents driven by\nhuman agents (actors), coordinate themselves through artifacts that they\ncollectively edit. The exchanged artifacts represent the system's memory: they\nprovide information on already executed tasks, on those ready to be executed\nand on their executors. The software agents are autonomous and identical: they\nexecute the same unique protocol each time they receive an artifact. This\nprotocol allows them to identify the tasks they must immediately execute, to\nexecute them, to update the artifact and to disseminate it if necessary, for\nthe continuation of the execution. Moreover, actors potentially have only a\npartial perception of processes in which they are involved. In practice, this\nmeans that certain tasks can be carried out confidentially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 18:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

This is validated with multiple models on\nKinetics-400 and Charades with remarkable results: CoX3D models attain\nstate-of-the-art complexity/accuracy trade-offs on Kinetics-400 with 12.1-15.3x\nreductions of FLOPs and 2.3-3.8% improvements in accuracy compared to regular\nX3D models while reducing peak memory consumption by up to 48%. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the transient response of Co3D CNNs at start-up and perform\nextensive benchmarks of on-hardware processing characteristics for publicly\navailable 3D CNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 18:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 08:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 07:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The most popular dictionary learning\nalgorithm alternates between sparse coding and dictionary update steps, and a\nrich literature has studied its theoretical convergence. The success of\ndictionary learning relies on access to a \"good\" initial estimate of the\ndictionary and the ability of the sparse coding step to provide an unbiased\nestimate of the code. The growing popularity of unrolled sparse coding networks\nhas led to the empirical finding that backpropagation through such networks\nperforms dictionary learning. We offer the theoretical analysis of these\nempirical results through PUDLE, a Provable Unrolled Dictionary LEarning\nmethod. We provide conditions on the network initialization and data\ndistribution sufficient to recover and preserve the support of the latent code.\nAdditionally, we address two challenges; first, the vanilla unrolled sparse\ncoding computes a biased code estimate, and second, gradients during\nbackpropagated learning can become unstable. We show approaches to reduce the\nbias of the code estimate in the forward pass, and that of the dictionary\nestimate in the backward pass. We propose strategies to resolve the learning\ninstability by tuning network parameters and modifying the loss function.\nOverall, we highlight the impact of loss, unrolling, and backpropagation on\nconvergence. We complement our findings through synthetic and image denoising\nexperiments.

The TA detector uses the output of\nan existing method to detect inter-bursts. Features are extracted from a\nprocessed output and then combined in a support vector machine (SVM). Next, we\ndevelop an HIE grading system using the TA detector by combining different\nfeatures from the temporal organisation of the detected TA mask, again using an\nSVM.

For example, after a customer saw a white dress, she/he\nwants to buy a similar one but more floral on it. The extent of \"more floral\"\nis subjective, thus prompting one floral dress is hard to satisfy the\ncustomer's needs. A better way is to present a sequence of products with\nincreasingly floral attributes based on the white dress, and allow the customer\nto select the most satisfactory one from the sequence. Existing item retrieval\nmethods mainly focus on whether the target items appear at the top of the\nretrieved sequence, but ignore the demand for retrieving a sequence of products\nwith gradual change on a certain attribute. To deal with this problem, we\npropose a weakly-supervised method that can learn a disentangled item\nrepresentation from user-item interaction data and ground the semantic meaning\nof attributes to dimensions of the item representation.

Nevertheless, there are still key aspects of the derivations\nthat are lacking, particularly for non-separable systems in the low temperature\nregime, and further explorations of the physical factors affecting the\ntunneling rate are warranted. In this work we obtain a closed-form rate\nexpression for the tunneling rate constant that is a direct analog of the\nrigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator expression. This expression introduces a novel\n\"entanglement factor\" that modulates the reaction rate. Furthermore, we are\nable to extend this expression, which is valid for non-separable systems at low\ntemperatures, to properly account for the conservation of angular momentum. In\ncontrast, previous calculations have considered only vibrational transverse\nmodes and so effectively employ a decoupled rotational partition function for\nthe orientational modes. We also suggest a simple theoretical model to describe\nthe tunneling effects in the vicinity of the crossover temperature (the\ntemperature where tunneling becomes the dominating mechanism). This model\nallows one to naturally classify, interpret, and predict experimental data.\nAmong other things, it quantitatively explains in simple terms the so-called\n\"quantum bobsled\" effect, also known as the negative centrifugal effect, which\nis related to curvature of the reaction path.

However, the exact shape of the frequency content created by nonlinear\nfunctions is not known and cannot be learned. In this work, we use node-variant\ngraph filters (NVGFs) -- which are linear filters capable of creating\nfrequencies -- as a means of investigating the role that frequency creation\nplays in GNNs. We show that, by replacing nonlinear activation functions by\nNVGFs, frequency creation mechanisms can be designed or learned. By doing so,\nthe role of frequency creation is separated from the nonlinear nature of\ntraditional GNNs.

The method is based on a new form of Lagrangian function\nwith a quadratic approximation. First, we reformulate a GNEP as a saddle point\ncomputation problem using the new Lagrangian and establish equivalence between\na saddle point of the Lagrangian and an equilibrium of the GNEP. We then\npropose a simple algorithm that is convergent to the saddle point. Furthermore,\nwe establish global convergence by assuming that the Lagrangian function\nsatisfies the Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz property.

We observe strong\nimprovement due to larger pre-training scale for intra-domain natural-natural\nand medical-medical transfer. For inter-domain natural-medical transfer, we\nfind improvements due to larger pre-training scale on larger X-Ray targets in\nfull shot regime, while for smaller targets and for few-shot regime the\nimprovement is not visible. Remarkably, large networks pre-trained on very\nlarge natural ImageNet-21k are as good or better than networks pre-trained on\nlargest available medical X-Ray data when performing transfer to large X-Ray\ntargets.

Our ability to model nonlinear effects in late\ntime matter perturbations will be a key to unlock the full potential of these\ndatasets, and the area of initial condition reconstruction is attracting\ngrowing attention. Iterative reconstruction developed in Ref. [1] is a\ntechnique designed to reconstruct the displacement field from the observed\ngalaxy distribution. The nonlinear displacement field and initial linear\ndensity field are highly correlated. Therefore, reconstructing the nonlinear\ndisplacement field enables us to extract the primordial cosmological\ninformation better than from the late time density field at the level of the\ntwo-point statistics. This paper will test to what extent the iterative\nreconstruction can recover the true displacement field and construct a\nperturbation theory model for the postreconstructed field. We model the\niterative reconstruction process with Lagrangian perturbation theory~(LPT) up\nto third order for dark matter in real space and compare it with $N$-body\nsimulations. We find that the simulated iterative reconstruction does not\nconverge to the nonlinear displacement field, and the discrepancy mainly\nappears in the shift term, i.e., the term correlated directly with the linear\ndensity field. On the contrary, our 3LPT model predicts that the iterative\nreconstruction should converge to the nonlinear displacement field. We discuss\nthe sources of discrepancy, including numerical noise/artifacts on small\nscales, and present an ad hoc phenomenological model that improves the\nagreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 23:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In contrast, standard data-driven methods count solely on supervised\nlearning on the training data pairs leading to massive network parameters for\nunnecessary physical model relearning which might not be consistent with the\ngoverning physical models of the imaging system. Fusing the physical forward\nmodel and noise statistics with data-adaptive priors leads to a united\nreconstruction framework that guarantees the learned reconstruction agrees with\nthe physical models while coping with the limited training data. In this paper,\nwe propose a new methodology for estimating the elasticity image by solving a\nregularized optimization problem which benefits from the physics-based modeling\nvia a data-fidelity term and adversarially learned priors via a regularization\nterm. In this method, the regularizer is trained based on the Wasserstein\nGenerative Adversarial Network (WGAN) objective function which tries to\ndistinguish the distribution of clean and noisy images. Leveraging such an\nadversarial regularizer for parameterizing the distribution of latent images\nand using gradient descent (GD) for solving the corresponding regularized\noptimization task leads to stability and convergence of the reconstruction\ncompared to pixel-wise supervised learning schemes.

The main encoding granule cells (GCs) are grouped into\nlamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell\n(BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs, and they form the E-I loop. Winner-take-all\ncompetition, leading to sparse activation of the GCs, occurs in each GC\ncluster. Such sparsity has been thought to enhance pattern separation performed\nin the DG. During the winner-take-all competition, SSRs are found to appear in\neach population of the GCs and the BCs through interaction of excitation of the\nGCs with inhibition of the BCs. Sparsely synchronized spiking stripes appear\nsuccessively with the population frequency $f_p~ (= 13$ Hz) in the raster plots\nof spikes. We also note that excitatory hilar mossy cells (MCs) control the\nfiring activity of the GC-BC loop by providing excitation to both the GCs and\nthe BCs. SSR also appears in the population of MCs via interaction with the GCs\n(i.e., GC-MC loop). Population behaviors in the SSRs are quantitatively\ncharacterized in terms of the synchronization measures. In addition, we\ninvestigate individual firing activity of GCs, BCs, and MCs in the SSRs.\nIndividual GCs exhibit random spike skipping, leading to a multi-peaked\ninter-spike-interval histogram, which is well characterized in terms of the\nrandom phase-locking degree. On the other hand, both BCs and MCs show\n\"intrastripe\" burstings within stripes, together with \"interstripe\" random\nspike skipping. MC loss may occur during epileptogenesis.

Therefore we propose a new concept, Sounding Object, to reduce the\nambiguity of the visual location of sound, making it possible to annotate the\nlocation of the wide range of sound sources. With newly proposed metrics for\nquantitative evaluation, we formulate the problem of Audio-Visual Sounding\nObject Localization (AVSOL). We also created the evaluation dataset (AVSOL-E\ndataset) by manually annotating the test set of well-known Audio-Visual Event\n(AVE) dataset. To tackle this new AVSOL problem, we propose a novel multitask\ntraining strategy and architecture called Dual Normalization Multitasking\n(DNM), which aggregates the Audio-Visual Correspondence (AVC) task and the\nclassification task for video events into a single audio-visual similarity map.\nBy efficiently utilize both supervisions by DNM, our proposed architecture\nsignificantly outperforms the baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 02:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

However, most SSL algorithms work\nunder the assumption that the class distributions are balanced in both training\nand test sets. In this work, we consider the problem of SSL on class-imbalanced\ndata, which better reflects real-world situations. In particular, we decouple\nthe training of the representation and the classifier, and systematically\ninvestigate the effects of different data re-sampling techniques when training\nthe whole network including a classifier as well as fine-tuning the feature\nextractor only. We find that data re-sampling is of critical importance to\nlearn a good classifier as it increases the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, in\nparticular for the minority classes in the unlabeled data. Interestingly, we\nfind that accurate pseudo-labels do not help when training the feature\nextractor, rather contrariwise, data re-sampling harms the training of the\nfeature extractor. This finding is against the general intuition that wrong\npseudo-labels always harm the model performance in SSL. Based on these\nfindings, we suggest to re-think the current paradigm of having a single data\nre-sampling strategy and develop a simple yet highly effective Bi-Sampling\n(BiS) strategy for SSL on class-imbalanced data. BiS implements two different\nre-sampling strategies for training the feature extractor and the classifier\nand integrates this decoupled training into an end-to-end framework. In\nparticular, BiS progressively changes the data distribution during training\nsuch that in the beginning the feature extractor is trained effectively, while\ntowards the end of the training the data is re-balanced such that the\nclassifier is trained reliably.

An important contributor to the\nsuccess rates of these systems is their ability to fully understand the\nconsumers' questions. However, these questions are frequently longer than\nneeded and mention peripheral information that is not useful in finding\nrelevant answers. Question summarization is one of the potential solutions to\nsimplifying long and complex consumer questions before attempting to find an\nanswer. In this paper, we study the task of abstractive summarization for\nreal-world consumer health questions.

Towards this, we propose multiple Cloze tasks (i.e. the\ntask of filing missing words in a given context) to identify the key medical\nentities that enforce the model to have better coverage in question-focus\nrecognition.

Current methods usually use extensive\ndata augmentation to increase the batch size, but we found the performance gain\nwith data augmentation decreases as batch size increases, and data augmentation\nwill become insufficient after certain point. In this paper, we propose to use\nadversarial learning to increase the batch size in large-batch training.\nDespite being a natural choice for smoothing the decision surface and biasing\ntowards a flat region, adversarial learning has not been successfully applied\nin large-batch training since it requires at least two sequential gradient\ncomputations at each step, which will at least double the running time compared\nwith vanilla training even with a large number of processors.

This opens up many avenues for simulation of\na large variety of phenomena and algorithms, which have hitherto been\nconsidered quantum mechanical. In this paper, we propose two such applications.\nIn the first, we introduce a new class of beams, called equivalent optical\nbeams, in parallel with equivalent states introduced in [Bharath & Ravishankar,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.89.062110]. These beams have the same\ninformation content for all practical purposes. Employing them, we show how to\ntransfer information from one degree of freedom of classical light to another,\nwithout any need for classically entangled beams. Next, we show that quantum\nmachine learning can be performed with OAM beams through the implementation of\na quantum classifier circuit.

Although deep neural\nnetworks greatly improve the performance of NER, due to the requirement of\nlarge amounts of training data, deep neural networks can hardly scale out to\nmany languages in an industry setting. To tackle this challenge, cross-lingual\nNER transfers knowledge from a rich-resource language to languages with low\nresources through pre-trained multilingual language models. Instead of using\ntraining data in target languages, cross-lingual NER has to rely on only\ntraining data in source languages, and optionally adds the translated training\ndata derived from source languages. However, the existing cross-lingual NER\nmethods do not make good use of rich unlabeled data in target languages, which\nis relatively easy to collect in industry applications. To address the\nopportunities and challenges, in this paper we describe our novel practice in\nMicrosoft to leverage such large amounts of unlabeled data in target languages\nin real production settings. To effectively extract weak supervision signals\nfrom the unlabeled data, we develop a novel approach based on the ideas of\nsemi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The empirical study on\nthree benchmark data sets verifies that our approach establishes the new\nstate-of-the-art performance with clear edges.

In order to provide better response against threats and improve the\nresilience of power grid, proactive plans and operational schemes are required\nby system operators to minimize the damages caused by CPH threats. To that end,\nthis paper proposes a proactive plan for DN operation by using hydrogen (H2)\nsystems to enhance the resilience through cost-effective long-term energy\nstorage.

The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per\nplant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9%\nhigher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the\nincrease in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per\nplant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which\ncould be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There\nwas a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield\nper plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were\nsignificant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants\nand the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two\nmutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two\nmutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a\nsignificant difference.

All the\nexisting approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge\nfor adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know\nthe exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This\nwork is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing\nthe specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models\n(SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the\ninputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work\nregards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial\ndefense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial\ndefense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2)\nadversarial perturbation detection. Experimental results show that our\ndetection module effectively shields the ASV by detecting adversarial samples\nwith an accuracy of around 80%. Moreover, since there is no common metric for\nevaluating the adversarial defense performance for ASV, this work also\nformalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both\npurification and detection based approaches into account.

PSD factorizations are\nfundamentally linked to understanding the expressiveness of semidefinite\nprograms as well as the power and limitations of quantum resources in\ninformation theory. The PSD factorization task generalizes the Non-negative\nMatrix Factorization (NMF) problem where we seek a collection of\n$r$-dimensional nonnegative vectors $\\{a_i\\}$ and $\\{b_j\\}$ satisfying $X_{ij}=\na_i^\\top b_j$, for all $i\\in [m],\\ j\\in [n]$ -- one can recover the latter\nproblem by choosing matrices in the PSD factorization to be diagonal. The most\nwidely used algorithm for computing NMFs of a matrix is the Multiplicative\nUpdate algorithm developed by Lee and Seung, in which nonnegativity of the\nupdates is preserved by scaling with positive diagonal matrices. In this paper,\nwe describe a non-commutative extension of Lee-Seung's algorithm, which we call\nthe Matrix Multiplicative Update (MMU) algorithm, for computing PSD\nfactorizations. The MMU algorithm ensures that updates remain PSD by congruence\nscaling with the matrix geometric mean of appropriate PSD matrices, and it\nretains the simplicity of implementation that Lee-Seung's algorithm enjoys.\nBuilding on the Majorization-Minimization framework, we show that under our\nupdate scheme the squared loss objective is non-increasing and fixed points\ncorrespond to critical points.

To be able to deal with underspecified datasets while still\nleveraging contextual clues during classification, we propose ProtoProp, a\nnovel prototype propagation graph method. First we learn prototypical\nrepresentations of objects (e.g., zebra) that are conditionally independent\nw.r.t. their attribute labels (e.g., stripes) and vice versa. Next we propagate\nthe independent prototypes through a compositional graph, to learn\ncompositional prototypes of novel attribute-object combinations that reflect\nthe dependencies of the target distribution. The method does not rely on any\nexternal data, such as class hierarchy graphs or pretrained word embeddings. We\nevaluate our approach on AO-Clever, a synthetic and strongly visual dataset\nwith clean labels, and UT-Zappos, a noisy real-world dataset of fine-grained\nshoe types.

In fact, we show\nthat on perfectly imputed data the best regression function will generally be\ndiscontinuous, which makes it hard to learn.

These graphs constitute an important data-structure for languages,\nsince they allow a very efficient storage mechanism for the transition function\nof an automaton, while providing a fast support to all sorts of substring\nqueries. This is possible as a consequence of a property -- the so-called\n\\emph{path coherence} -- valid on Wheeler graphs and consisting in an ordering\non nodes that \"propagates\" to (collections of) strings. By looking at a Wheeler\ngraph as an automaton, the ordering on strings corresponds to the\nco-lexicographic order of the words entering each state.

Each agent's type is\ncharacterized by her own action costs and action-outcome distributions.

Researchers and practitioners have considered building\npersistent memory by placing NVM on the memory bus for CPU to directly load and\nstore data. As a result, cache-friendly data structures have been developed for\nNVM. One of them is the prevalent B+-tree. State-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees\nmainly focus on the optimization of write operations (insertion and deletion).\nHowever, search is of vital importance for B+-tree. Not only search-intensive\nworkloads benefit from an optimized search, but insertion and deletion also\nrely on a preceding search operation to proceed. In this paper, we attentively\nstudy a sorted B+-tree node that spans over contiguous cache lines. Such cache\nlines exhibit a monotonically increasing trend and searching a target key\nacross them can be accelerated by estimating a range the key falls into. To do\nso, we construct a probing Sentinel Array in which a sentinel stands for each\ncache line of B+-tree node. Checking the Sentinel Array avoids scanning\nunnecessary cache lines and hence significantly reduces cache misses for a\nsearch. A quantitative evaluation shows that using Sentinel Arrays boosts the\nsearch performance of state-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees by up to 48.4% while the\ncost of maintaining of Sentinel Array is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 08:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

State-of-the-art registration techniques still struggle when the\noverlap region between the two point clouds is small, and completely fail if\nthere is no overlap between the scan pairs. In this paper, we present a\nlearning-based technique that alleviates this problem, and allows registration\nbetween point clouds, presented in arbitrary poses, and having little or even\nno overlap, a setting that has been referred to as tele-registration. Our\ntechnique is based on a novel neural network design that learns a prior of a\nclass of shapes and can complete a partial shape. The key idea is combining the\nregistration and completion tasks in a way that reinforces each other. In\nparticular, we simultaneously train the registration network and completion\nnetwork using two coupled flows, one that register-and-complete, and one that\ncomplete-and-register, and encourage the two flows to produce a consistent\nresult.

To further reduce the qubit footprint, we place one of the\nqubit pads and a single Josephson junction on the bottom chip and the other pad\non the top chip which is galvanically connected with the single Josephson\njunction through an indium bump. The electric field participation ratio can\narrive at nearly 53% in air when the vacuum-gap is about 5 microns, and thus\npotentially leading to a lower dielectric loss. The coherence times of the\nflipmons are measured in the range of 30-60 microseconds, which are comparable\nwith that of traditional transmons with similar fabrication processes. The\nelectric field simulation indicates that the metal-air interface's\nparticipation ratio increases significantly and may dominate the qubit's\ndecoherence.

We compared our model against\nvarious state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared\nerror. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The\nimprovement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons\nbetween 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of\nconventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is\nsuperior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the\nspread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work\ncontributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system\nfor decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of\ninfectious diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 10:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Our proposed scheme not only\nexploits the properties of content-centric communications and local caching at\nthe base stations (BSs), but also incorporates RSMA to better manage\ninterference in multigroup multicast transmission with statistical channel\nstate information (CSI) known at the central processor (CP) and the BSs.

For a given $n$-vertex graph $G$ and a\nbound $f$ on the number of faults, an $f$-FT connectivity labeling scheme is a\ndistributed data structure that assigns each of the graph edges and vertices a\nshort label, such that given the labels of the vertices $s$ and $t$, and at\nmost $f$ failing edges $F$, one can determine if $s$ and $t$ are connected in\n$G \\setminus F$. The primary complexity measure is the length of the individual\nlabels. Since their introduction by [Courcelle, Twigg, STACS '07], compact FT\nlabeling schemes have been devised only for a limited collection of graph\nfamilies. In this work, we fill in this gap by proposing two (independent) FT\nconnectivity labeling schemes for general graphs, with a nearly optimal label\nlength. This serves the basis for providing also FT approximate distance\nlabeling schemes, and ultimately also routing schemes. Our main results for an\n$n$-vertex graph and a fault bound $f$ are:\n  -- There is a randomized FT connectivity labeling scheme with a label length\nof $O(f+\\log n)$ bits, hence optimal for $f=O(\\log n)$. This scheme is based on\nthe notion of cycle space sampling [Pritchard, Thurimella, TALG '11].\n  -- There is a randomized FT connectivity labeling scheme with a label length\nof $O(\\log^3 n)$ bits (independent of the number of faults $f$). This scheme is\nbased on the notion of linear sketches of [Ahn et al., SODA '12].\n  -- For $k\\geq 1$, there is a randomized routing scheme that routes a message\nfrom $s$ to $t$ in the presence of a set $F$ of faulty edges, with stretch\n$O(|F|^2 k)$ and routing tables of size $\\tilde{O}(f^3 n^{1/k})$.\n  This significantly improves over the state-of-the-art bounds by [Chechik,\nICALP '11], providing the first scheme with sub-linear FT labeling and routing\nschemes for general graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 10:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these\nmodels contain only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and\ny terms. It has long been noticed that the basic reproduction number R has a\nvery simple formula (3.3) in terms of the matrices which define the model, and\nan explicit first integral formula (3.8) is also available. These results can\nbe traced back at least to [ABvdD+07] and [Fen07], respectively, and may be\nviewed as the \"basic laws of SIR-type epidemics\"; however many papers continue\nto reprove them in particular instances (by the next-generation matrix method\nor by direct computations, which are unnecessary). This motivated us to redraw\nthe attention to these basic laws and provide a self-contained reference of\nrelated formulas for (x, y, z) models. We propose to rebaptize the class to\nwhich they apply as matrix SIR epidemic models, abbreviated as SYR, to\nemphasize the similarity to the classic SIR case. For the case of one\nsusceptible class, we propose to use the name SIR-PH, due to a simple\nprobabilistic interpretation as SIR models where the exponential infection time\nhas been replaced by a PH-type distribution. We note that to each SIR-PH model,\none may associate a scalar quantity Y(t) which satisfies \"classic SIR\nrelations\", see (3.8). In the case of several susceptible classes, this\ngeneralizes to (5.10); in a future paper, we will show that (3.8), (5.10) may\nbe used to obtain approximate control policies which compare well with the\noptimal control of the original model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 11:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

We find in experiments that traditional quantile\nregression can have poor conditional coverage. To remedy this, we modify the\nloss function to promote independence between the size of the intervals and the\nindicator of a miscoverage event. For the true conditional quantiles, these two\nquantities are independent (orthogonal), so the modified loss function\ncontinues to be valid. Moreover, we empirically show that the modified loss\nfunction leads to improved conditional coverage, as evaluated by several\nmetrics. We also introduce two new metrics that check conditional coverage by\nlooking at the strength of the dependence between the interval size and the\nindicator of miscoverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 11:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 07:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

To utilize such information,\nwe propose sub-character (SubChar for short) tokenization.

So far, NA has not\nbeen used extensively in studies of medication use. Only a handful of papers\nhave used NA in Drug Prescription Networks (DPN). We provide an introduction to\nNA terminology alongside a guide to creating and extracting results from the\nmedication networks. Objective: To introduce the readers to NA as a tool to\nstudy medication use by demonstrating how to apply different NA measures on 3\ngenerated medication networks. Methods: We used the Norwegian Prescription\nDatabase (NorPD) to create a network that describes the co-medication in\nelderly persons in Norway on January 1, 2013. We used the Norwegian Electronic\nPrescription Support System (FEST) to create another network of severe\ndrug-drug interactions (DDIs). Lastly, we created a network combining the two\nnetworks to show the actual use of drugs with severe DDIs. We used these\nnetworks to elucidate how to apply and interpret different network measures in\nmedication networks. Results: Interactive network graphs are made available\nonline, Stata and R syntaxes are provided. Various useful network measures for\nmedication networks were applied such as network topological features,\nmodularity analysis and centrality measures. Edge lists data used to generate\nthe networks are openly available for readers in an open data repository to\nexplore and use. Conclusion: We believe that NA can be a useful tool in\nmedication use studies. We have provided information and hopefully inspiration\nfor other researchers to use NA in their own projects. While network analyses\nare useful for exploring and discovering structures in medication use studies,\nit also has limitations. It can be challenging to interpret and it is not\nsuitable for hypothesis testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 11:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

However, even for linear dynamical systems it is\nnot possible to analytically determine time and amplitude of the maximal\nresponse of a unit to a perturbation.

An ATSG is a graph describing the assembly task procedure\nby detecting types of parts included in the instruction images, completing the\nmissing information automatically, and correcting the detection errors\nautomatically. To build an ATSG, the proposed method first extracts the\ninformation of the parts contained in each image of the graphical instruction\nmanual. Then, by using the extracted part information, it estimates the proper\nwork motions and tools for the assembly task. After that, the method builds an\nATSG by considering the relationship between the previous and following images,\nwhich makes it possible to estimate the undetected parts caused by occlusion\nusing the information of the entire image series. Finally, by collating the\ntotal number of each part with the generated ATSG, the excess or deficiency of\nparts are investigated, and task procedures are removed or added according to\nthose parts. In the experiment section, we build an ATSG using the proposed\nmethod to a graphical instruction manual for a chair and demonstrate the action\nsequences found in the ATSG can be performed by a dual-arm robot execution.

Recently, several methods and\ntechniques have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus using different\nimages and data. However, this is the first study that will explore the\npossibility of using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect\nCOVID-19 from electrocardiogram (ECG) trace images. In this work, COVID-19 and\nother cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were detected using deep-learning\ntechniques. A public dataset of ECG images consists of 1937 images from five\ndistinct categories, such as Normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI),\nabnormal heartbeat (AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used\nin this study. Six different deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101,\nInceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2) were used to investigate three\ndifferent classification schemes: two-class classification (Normal vs\nCOVID-19); three-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, and Other CVDs), and\nfinally, five-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI).

Here, assuming that a rubble-pile\nasteroid is scattered inside a WD's Roche lobe by a planet, we study its tidal\ndisruption and the long-term evolution of the resulting fragments. We find that\nafter a few pericentric passages, the asteroid is shredded into its constituent\nparticles, forming a flat, thin ring. On a timescale of Myr, tens of per cent\nof the particles are scattered onto the WD, and are therefore directly accreted\nwithout first passing through a circularised close-in disk. Fragment mutual\ncollisions are most effective for coplanar fragments, and are thus only\nimportant in $10^3-10^4$ yr before the orbital coplanarity is broken by the\nplanet.

In this paper, we present a generalised\ndrift-correcting (gDC) scheme that accounts for Brownian drift for suspensions\nof rigid particles with arbitrary shape.

The state-of-the-art methods thus employ the sample selection\napproach to handle open-set noisy labels, which tries to select clean data from\nnoisy data for network parameters updates.

Hence, this paper\nproposes a spatio-temporal model to analyse ambulance dispatches focusing on\nthe interventions that occurred in the road network of Milan (Italy) from 2015\nto 2017.

The temporal dimension is estimated semi-parametrically\nusing a Poisson regression model, while the spatial dimension is estimated\nnon-parametrically using a network kernel function. A set of weights is\nincluded in the spatial term to capture space-time interactions, inducing\nnon-separability in the intensity function.

We propose an alternative framework to construct and solve a serial\nof sequential Defend-Attack models, that incorporates the adversarial risk\nanalysis approach, but uses a new class of influence diagrams algorithm, called\nhybrid Bayesian network inference, to identify optimal decision strategies.\nCompared to Monte Carlo simulation the proposed hybrid Bayesian network\ninference is more versatile because it provides an automated way to compute\nhybrid Defend-Attack models and extends their use to involve mixtures of\ncontinuous and discrete variables, of any kind. More importantly, the hybrid\nBayesian network approach is novel in that it supports dynamic decision making\nwhereby new real-time observations can update the Defend-Attack model in\npractice. We also extend the Defend-Attack model to support cases involving\nextra variables and longer decision sequence. Examples are presented,\nillustrating how the proposed framework can be adjusted for more complicated\nscenarios, including dynamic decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 13:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

This is a significant limitation,\nespecially for semantic segmentation algorithms mounted on intelligent\nautonomous systems, deployed in realistic settings. Regardless of how many\nclasses the system has seen at training time, it is inevitable that unexpected,\nunknown objects will appear at test time. The failure in identifying such\nanomalies may lead to incorrect, even dangerous behaviors of the autonomous\nagent equipped with such segmentation model when deployed in the real world.\nCurrent state of the art of anomaly segmentation uses generative models,\nexploiting their incapability to reconstruct patterns unseen during training.\nHowever, training these models is expensive, and their generated artifacts may\ncreate false anomalies. In this paper we take a different route and we propose\nto address anomaly segmentation through prototype learning. Our intuition is\nthat anomalous pixels are those that are dissimilar to all class prototypes\nknown by the model. We extract class prototypes from the training data in a\nlightweight manner using a cosine similarity-based classifier. Experiments on\nStreetHazards show that our approach achieves the new state of the art, with a\nsignificant margin over previous works, despite the reduced computational\noverhead.

Previous work in adding strong privacy\nprotection to GPs via differential privacy (DP) has been limited to protecting\nonly the privacy of the prediction targets (model outputs) but not inputs. We\nbreak this limitation by introducing GPs with DP protection for both model\ninputs and outputs. We achieve this by using sparse GP methodology and\npublishing a private variational approximation on known inducing points. The\napproximation covariance is adjusted to approximately account for the added\nuncertainty from DP noise. The approximation can be used to compute arbitrary\npredictions using standard sparse GP techniques. We propose a method for\nhyperparameter learning using a private selection protocol applied to\nvalidation set log-likelihood.

In such a scheme, each file in the data center\nor library is usually divided into a number of packets to pursue a low\nbroadcasting rate based on the designed placements at each user's cache.\nHowever, the implementation complexity of this scheme increases as the number\nof packets increases. It is crucial to design a scheme with a small\nsubpacketization level, while maintaining a relatively low transmission rate.\nIt is known that the design of caches in users (i.e., the placement phase) and\nbroadcasting (i.e., the delivery phase) can be unified in one matrix, namely\nthe placement delivery array (PDA). This paper proposes a novel PDA\nconstruction by selecting proper orthogonal arrays (POAs), which generalizes\nsome known constructions but with a more flexible memory size.

Using the public and authoritative dataset, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed CL framework has three advantages, namely, the\ncapability of adapting to the dynamic environment and tasks, the self-learning\ncapability and the capability of 'good money driving out bad money' by taking\nmodulation recognition as an example. The proposed CL framework can enrich the\ncurrent learning frameworks and widen the applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The study used\nthe results of the winter 2020 semester final OSPE from McMaster University's\nanatomy and physiology course in the Faculty of Health Sciences (HTHSCI\n2FF3/2LL3/1D06) as the data set. Ninety percent of the data set was used in a\n10-fold validation algorithm to train a DT for each of the 54 questions. Each\nDT was comprised of unique words that appeared in correct, student-written\nanswers. The remaining 10% of the data set was marked by the generated DTs.\nWhen the answers marked by the DT were compared to the answers marked by staff\nand faculty, the DT achieved an average accuracy of 94.49% across all 54\nquestions. This suggests that machine learning algorithms such as DTs are a\nhighly effective option for OSPE grading and are suitable for the development\nof an intelligent, online OSPE tutoring system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

However, existing\nmetrics have two major limitations: (a) they are mostly trained in a simplified\ntwo-level setting (coherent vs. incoherent), while humans give Likert-type\nmulti-level coherence scores, dubbed as \"quantifiable\"; (b) their predicted\ncoherence scores cannot align with the actual human rating standards due to the\nabsence of human guidance during training. To address these limitations, we\npropose Quantifiable Dialogue Coherence Evaluation (QuantiDCE), a novel\nframework aiming to train a quantifiable dialogue coherence metric that can\nreflect the actual human rating standards. Specifically, QuantiDCE includes two\ntraining stages, Multi-Level Ranking (MLR) pre-training and Knowledge\nDistillation (KD) fine-tuning. During MLR pre-training, a new MLR loss is\nproposed for enabling the model to learn the coarse judgement of coherence\ndegrees. Then, during KD fine-tuning, the pretrained model is further finetuned\nto learn the actual human rating standards with only very few human-annotated\ndata. To advocate the generalizability even with limited fine-tuning data, a\nnovel KD regularization is introduced to retain the knowledge learned at the\npre-training stage. Experimental results show that the model trained by\nQuantiDCE presents stronger correlations with human judgements than the other\nstate-of-the-art metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

In this framework, we stabilize the simplified collinear\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering (suggested by the Goodenough-Kanamori rule)\nthat is commonly used as an approximation to the experimentally-observed\nnoncollinear screw-type spiral magnetic ordering. A detailed investigation of\nthe ferromagnetic and of other three collinear AFM spin configurations is also\npresented. The findings from Hubbard-corrected DFT are discussed using two\nkinds of Hubbard manifolds - nonorthogonalized and orthogonalized atomic\norbitals - showing that special attention must be given to the choice of the\nHubbard projectors, with orthogonalized manifolds providing more accurate\nresults than nonorthogonalized ones within DFT+$U$+$V$.

Reducing the spatial coverage to the DGM\nvicinity can substantially shorten the scan time or enhance the spatial\nresolution without increasing scan time; however, this may lead to significant\nDGM susceptibility underestimation. Method: A recently proposed deep\nlearning-based QSM method, namely xQSM, is investigated to assess the accuracy\nof dipole inversion on reduced brain coverages. Pre-processed magnetic field\nmaps are extended symmetrically from the centre of globus pallidus in the\ncoronal plane to simulate QSM acquisitions of difference spatial\ncoverages.Results: The proposed xQSM network led to the lowest DGM contrast\nlost with the smallest susceptibility variation range across all spatial\ncoverages. For the digital brain phantom simulation, xQSM improved the DGM\nsusceptibility underestimation more than 20% in small spatial coverages. For\nthe in vivo acquisition, less than 5% DGM susceptibility error was achieved in\n48 mm axial slabs using the xQSM network, while a minimum of 112 mm coverage\nwas required for conventional methods. It is also shown that the background\nfield removal process performed worse in reduced brain coverages, which further\ndeteriorated the subsequent dipole inversion. Conclusion: The recently proposed\ndeep learning-based xQSM method significantly improves the accuracy of DGM QSM\nfrom small spatial coverages as compared with conventional QSM algorithms,\nwhich can shorten DGM QSM acquisition time substantially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Recent studies advocated adopting\niterative steps to improve the recovery much beyond that of the standard\ntechnique. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a few selected\niterative reconstruction techniques focusing on the BAO and the broadband-shape\nof the two-point clustering. We include redshift-space distortions, halo bias,\nand shot noise and inspect the components of the reconstructed field in Fourier\nspace and in configuration space using both density field-based reconstruction\nand displacement field-based reconstruction. We find that the displacement\nfield reconstruction becomes quickly challenging in the presence of\nnon-negligible shot noise and therefore present surrogate methods that can be\npractically applied to a much more sparse field such as galaxies. For a galaxy\nfield, implementing a debiasing step to remove the Lagrangian bias appears\ncrucial for the displacement field reconstruction. We show that the iterative\nreconstruction does not substantially improve the BAO feature beyond an\naggressively optimized standard reconstruction with a small smoothing kernel.\nHowever, we find taking iterative steps allows us to use a small smoothing\nkernel more `stably', i.e., without causing a substantial deviation from the\nlinear power spectrum on large scales.

Generally,\nthis problem makes the pre-training models cannot sufficiently describe the\nmulti-grained information inside images, which further limits the upper bound\nof their transfer performance. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a\nsimple but effective mechanism, called Exploring the Diversity and Invariance\nin Yourself E-DIY.

This is based on the basic IID assumption for real data in machine\nlearning. However, though the source samples $\\{\\mathbf{z}\\}$ obey IID, the\ngenerations $\\{G(\\mathbf{z})\\}$ may not necessarily be IID from the target\ndistribution.

The logic is\nthat the inverse samples from target data should also be IID in the source\ndistribution.

For this\nscheme, our results show that the local DP performance is mainly improved due\nto injecting noise of greater variance on each dimension while keeping the\nsensitivity of the projected vectors unchanged. This is while the convergence\nrate is slowed down compared to the case without dimensionality reduction.

Using the stellar evolutionary code MESA we find that the\nwave energy causes an expansion within few years by tens to hundreds solar\nradii.

Accordingly, many\nsimulation-based tools are available, and this poses huge interoperability\nchallenges. To overcome them, in 2010 the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)\nwas proposed as an open standard to support both Model Exchange (ME) and\nCo-Simulation (CS). Models adhering to such a standard are called Functional\nMock-up Units (FMUs). FMUs play an essential role in defining complex CPSs\nthrough, e.g., the SSP standard. Simulation-based V&V of CPSs typically\nrequires exploring different scenarios (i.e., exogenous CPS input sequences),\nmany of them showing a shared prefix. Accordingly, the simulator state at the\nend of a shared prefix is saved and then restored and used as a start state for\nthe simulation of the next scenario. In this context, an important FMI feature\nis the capability to save and restore the internal FMU state on demand.\nUnfortunately, the implementation of this feature is not mandatory and it is\navailable only within some commercial software. This motivates developing such\na feature for open-source CPS simulation environments.

Here, we explain an asymmetry\nemerging upon repeating identical isotropic (uniformly random) operations.\nSpecifically, in two dimensions, repeating an isotropic rotation twice maps a\ngiven point on the two-dimensional unit sphere (the unit circle) uniformly at\nrandom to any point on the unit sphere, reflecting a statistical symmetry as\nexpected. In contrast, in three and higher dimensions, a point is mapped more\noften closer to the original point than a uniform distribution predicts.\nCuriously, in the limit of the dimension $d \\rightarrow \\infty$, a symmetric\ndistribution is approached again. We intuitively explain the emergence of this\nasymmetry and why it disappears in higher dimensions by disentangling isotropic\nrotations into a sequence of partial actions. The asymmetry emerges in two\nqualitatively different forms and for a wide range of general random operations\nrelevant in complex systems modeling, including repeated continuous and\ndiscrete rotations, roto-reflections and general orthogonal transformations\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 10:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

Symplectic geometry is known to be suitable for describing Hamiltonian\nmechanics, and contact geometry is known as an odd-dimensional counterpart of\nsymplectic geometry. Moreover, a procedure, called symplectization, is a known\nway to construct a symplectic manifold from a contact manifold, yielding\nHamiltonian systems from contact ones. It is found in this paper that a\npreviously investigated non-autonomous ODE can be written as a contact\nHamiltonian system. Then, by symplectization of a non-autonomous contact\nHamiltonian vector field expressing the non-autonomous ODE, novel symplectic\nintegrators are derived. Because the proposed symplectic integrators preserve\nhidden symplectic and contact structures in the ODE, they should be more stable\nthan the Runge-Kutta method.

Time crystals have been increasingly explored more recently, where\ntime is disconnected from space. Periodic relativistic spacetime crystals on\nthe other hand need to account for the mixing of space and time in special\nrelativity through Lorentz transformation, and have been listed only in\n2-dimensions. This work shows that there exists a transformation between the\nconventional Minkowski spacetime (MS) and what is referred to here as\nrenormalized blended spacetime (RBS); they are shown to be equivalent\ndescriptions of relativistic physics in flat spacetime. There are two elements\nto this reformulation of MS, namely, blending and renormalization. One can now\nenumerate the RBS point and space groups in various dimensions with their\nmapping to the well-known space crystal groups. The RBS point group for flat\nisotropic RBS spacetime is identified to be that of cylinders in various\ndimensions. An antisymmetry operation is introduced that can swap between\nspace-like and time-like directions, leading to color spacetime groups. The\nformalism reveals RBS symmetries that are not readily apparent in the\nconventional MS formulation.
