Those constraints require rational\nplanning of the robot motion. In this work, we derived the compressible\ncurvature kinematics of a cable-driven soft robot which takes the compressible\nsoft segment into account. The motion planning of the soft robot for a\ntrajectory tracking task in constrained conditions, including fixed orientation\nend-effector and manipulator-obstacle collision avoidance, has been\ninvestigated. The inverse solution of cable actuation was formulated as a\ndamped least-square optimization problem and iteratively computed off-line. The\nperformance of trajectory tracking and the obedience to constraints were\nevaluated via the simulation we made open-source, as well as the prototype\nexperiments. The method can be generalized to the similar multisegment\ncable-driven soft robotic systems by customizing the robot parameters for the\nprior motion planning of the manipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 16:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 04:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 04:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 07:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Recent APR techniques use deep learning,\nparticularly the encoder-decoder architecture, to generate patches. Though\nexisting DL-based APR approaches have proposed different encoder architectures,\nthe decoder remains to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of\ntokens one by one to replace the faulty statement. This decoder has multiple\nlimitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs, 2)\ninefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to generate\nproject-specific identifiers.\n  In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder with\nplaceholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects: 1) Recoder\ngenerates edits rather than modified code, allowing efficient representation of\nsmall edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided, with the novel provider/decider\narchitecture to ensure the syntactic correctness of the patched program and\naccurate generation; 3) Recoder generates placeholders that could be\ninstantiated as project-specific identifiers later.\n  We conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2\nand 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0. Our results show that Recoder\nrepairs 53 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves 21.4% improvement over the\nprevious state-of-the-art approach for single-hunk bugs (TBar).

Once the population of disrupted subhalos -- which may host\norphan galaxies -- are taken into account, satellite galaxy populations in CDM\nand SIDM models can be reconciled.

Traditional methods that simply aggregate past\nincidents over space and time fail to make useful short-term predictions when\nthe spatial region is large and focused on fine-grained spatial entities like\ninterstate highway networks. This is partially due to the sparsity of incidents\nwith respect to the area in consideration.

In this work we\ninvestigate for the first time the relative role of these three seed\npopulations in the formation of $z>6$ SMBHs within an Eddington-limited gas\naccretion scenario.

In general, Mach numbers obtained from radio\nobservations are larger than the corresponding X-ray measurements. In this\nwork, we investigate this Mach number discrepancy. For this purpose, we used\nthe cosmological code ENZO to simulate a sample of galaxy clusters that host\nbright radio relics. For each relic, we computed the radio Mach number from the\nintegrated radio spectrum and the X-ray Mach number from the X-ray surface\nbrightness and temperature jumps. Our analysis suggests that the differences in\nthe Mach number estimates follow from the way in which different observables\nare related to different parts of the underlying Mach number distribution:\nradio observations are more sensistive to the high Mach numbers present only in\na small fraction of a shock's surface, while X-ray measurements reflect the\naverage of the Mach number distribution. Moreover, X-ray measurements are very\nsensitive to the relic's orientation. If the same relic is observed from\ndifferent sides, the measured X-ray Mach number varies significantly.

In particular,\ndeep-learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: a little change in\nthe input harms the model's output.\n  In this work, we examine adversarial attacks on transaction records data and\ndefences from these attacks. The transaction records data have a different\nstructure than the canonical NLP or time series data, as neighbouring records\nare less connected than words in sentences, and each record consists of both\ndiscrete merchant code and continuous transaction amount. We consider a\nblack-box attack scenario, where the attack doesn't know the true decision\nmodel, and pay special attention to adding transaction tokens to the end of a\nsequence.

Our\nresults show that a couple of generated transactions are sufficient to fool a\ndeep-learning model. Further, we improve model robustness via adversarial\ntraining or separate adversarial examples detection.

In this work, we shed light on this debate by considering different types\nof underlying noise. Thereby, we significantly advance the general theory of\nwarning signs for nonlinear stochastic dynamics. A key scenario deals with\nstochastic systems approaching a bifurcation point dynamically upon slow\nparameter variation. The stochastic fluctuations are generically able to probe\nthe dynamics near a deterministic attractor to reveal critical slowing down.\nUsing scaling laws near bifurcations, one can then anticipate the distance to a\nbifurcation.

The former are mostly\ndue to severe congenital malformations of one or a small number of specific\norgans. On the contrary, old age deaths are largely the outcome of a long\nprocess of deterioration which starts in the 20s and affects almost all organs.\nIn terms of age-specific death rates, there is also a clear distinction: the\ninfant death rate falls off with age, whereas the adult and old age death rate\nincreases exponentially with age in conformity with Gompertz's law.\n  Clearly, it would be satisfactory to explain the two phenomena as being two\nvariants within the same explanatory framework. In other words, a mechanism\nproviding a combined explanation for the two forms of mortality would be\nwelcome. This is the purpose of the present paper.\n  We show here that the same biological effects can account for the two cases\nprovided there is a difference in their severity: death triggered by isolated\nlethal anomalies in one case and widespread wear-out anomalies in the second.\nWe show that quite generally this mechanism leads indeed, respectively, to a\ndeclining and an upgoing death rate. Moreover, this theoretical framework leads\nto the conjecture that the severity of the death effects, whether in infancy or\nold age, are higher for organisms which are comprised of a larger number of\norgans. Finally, let us observe that the main focus of the paper is the drastic\ndifference of the age-specific death rates (i.e. decreasing versus increasing)\nbecause this difference is found in many species, whereas the question of the\nbest fit (e.g. Gompertz versus Weibull) is rather specific to human mortality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 19:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

The simulations produce\ntime-dependent flows permeated by strong shocks; we identify a new linear\ninstability of sound waves that sources these shocks. The shocks substantially\nmodify the wind dynamics, invalidating previous steady state models: the CR\npressure $p_c$ has a staircase-like structure with $dp_c/dr \\simeq 0$ in most\nof the volume, and the time-averaged CR energetics are in many cases better\napproximated by $p_c \\propto \\rho^{1/2}$, rather than the canonical $p_c\n\\propto \\rho^{2/3}$. Accounting for this change in CR energetics, we\nanalytically derive new expressions for the mass-loss rate, momentum flux, wind\nspeed, and wind kinetic power in galactic winds driven by CR streaming. We show\nthat streaming CRs are ineffective at directly driving cold gas out of\ngalaxies, though CR-driven winds in hotter ISM phases may entrain cool gas. For\nthe same physical conditions, diffusive CR transport (Paper I) yields mass-loss\nrates that are a few-100 times larger than streaming transport, and asymptotic\nwind powers that are a factor of $\\simeq 4$ larger. We discuss the implications\nof our results for galactic wind theory and observations; strong shocks driven\nby CR-streaming-induced instabilities produce gas with a wide range of\ndensities and temperatures, consistent with the multiphase nature of observed\nwinds. We also quantify the applicability of the isothermal gas approximation\nfor modeling streaming CRs and highlight the need for calculations with more\nrealistic thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 20:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Premixed hydrogen-air flames are\ncharacterized by significantly higher laminar flame speed compared to other\nconventional fuels. Furthermore, in the presence of turbulence, $S_d$ is\nenhanced much beyond its corresponding unstretched, planar laminar value $S_L$.\nIn this study, the effect of high Karlovitz number ($Ka$) turbulence on\ndensity-weighted flame displacement speed, $\\widetilde{S_d}$, in a H$_2$-air\nflame is investigated. Recently, it has been identified that flame-flame\ninteractions in regions of large negative curvature govern large deviations of\n$\\widetilde{S_d}$ from $S_L$, for moderately turbulent flames.

Moreover, for timed graph-based\nruntime monitoring, Metric Temporal Graph Logic (MTGL) has been developed for\nstating metric temporal properties on identified subgraphs and their structural\nchanges over time. In this paper, we (a) extend MTGL to the Probabilistic\nMetric Temporal Graph Logic (PMTGL) by allowing for the specification of\nprobabilistic properties, (b) adapt our MTGL satisfaction checking approach to\nPTGTSs, and (c) combine the approaches for PTCTL model checking and MTGL\nsatisfaction checking to obtain a Bounded Model Checking (BMC) approach for\nPMTGL. In our evaluation, we apply an implementation of our BMC approach in\nAutoGraph to a running example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 20:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

This seems to be a strategy\nadopted by biological systems, in particular primates, as evidenced by the\nexistence of mirror neurons that seem to be involved in multi-modal action\nunderstanding. How to benefit from the interaction experience of the robots to\nenable understanding actions and goals of other agents is still a challenging\nquestion. In this study, we propose a novel method, deep modality blending\nnetworks (DMBN), that creates a common latent space from multi-modal experience\nof a robot by blending multi-modal signals with a stochastic weighting\nmechanism. We show for the first time that deep learning, when combined with a\nnovel modality blending scheme, can facilitate action recognition and produce\nstructures to sustain anatomical and effect-based imitation capabilities. Our\nproposed system, can be conditioned on any desired sensory/motor value at any\ntime-step, and can generate a complete multi-modal trajectory consistent with\nthe desired conditioning in parallel avoiding accumulation of prediction\nerrors. We further showed that given desired images from different\nperspectives, i.e. images generated by the observation of other robots placed\non different sides of the table, our system could generate image and joint\nangle sequences that correspond to either anatomical or effect based imitation\nbehavior. Overall, the proposed DMBN architecture not only serves as a\ncomputational model for sustaining mirror neuron-like capabilities, but also\nstands as a powerful machine learning architecture for high-dimensional\nmulti-modal temporal data with robust retrieval capabilities operating with\npartial information in one or multiple modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 20:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Assuming that $f$ is transitive and that $Df$ is H\\\"older\ncontinuous, we show that there exists $ t_{0} \\in (0 , 1]$ such that the\ntransfer operator $\\mathcal{L}_{f, -t\\log|Df|}$, acting on the space of\nH\\\"older continuous functions, has the spectral gap property for all $t <\nt_{0}$ and has not the spectral gap property for all $t \\geq t_{0}$. Similar\nresults are also obtained when the transfer operator acts on the space of\nbounded variations functions and smooth functions. In particular, we show that\nin the transitive case $f$ has a unique thermodynamic phase transition and it\noccurs in $t_{0}$. In addition, if the loss of expansion of the dynamics occurs\nbecause of an indifferent fixed point or the dynamics admits an absolutely\ncontinuous invariant probability with positive Lyapunov exponent then $t_0 =\n1.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 21:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

This extension enables us to\nstudy the galaxy-halo connection via a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)\nframework for the two lens samples used in the cosmology analysis: a luminous\nred galaxy sample (redMaGiC) and a magnitude-limited galaxy sample (MagLim). We\nfind that redMaGiC (MagLim) galaxies typically live in dark matter halos of\nmass $\\log_{10}(M_{h}/M_{\\odot}) \\approx 13.7$ which is roughly constant over\nredshift ($13.3-13.5$ depending on redshift).

For instance,\nsome substructural type theories augment variables' typing judgments with the\ninformation of their usage. That is, they allow one to explicitly state how\nmany times - 0, 1, or many - a variable can be used. This solves the problem of\nresource usage control and allows us to treat variables as resources.\n  What's more, it often happens that this attributed information is interpreted\n(used) during the same compilation and erased before we run a program. A case\nin the point is that in the same substructural type theories, their type\ncheckers use these 0, 1, or many, to ensure that all variables are used as many\ntimes as these attributions say them to be.\n  Yet, there wasn't any programming language concept whose concern would be to\nallow a programmer to express these attributions in the language itself. That\nis, to let the programmer express which data the one wants to attribute to what\nexpressions and, most importantly, the meaning of the attributed data in their\nprogram.\n  As it turned out, the presence of such a concept allows us to express many\npractical ideas in the language itself. For instance, with appropriate means\nfor assigning the meaning of these attributions, this concept would allow one\nto express linear types as functionality in a separate program module, without\nthe need to refine the whole type system to add them.\n  In this paper, we present such a concept - we propose type properties. It\nallows a programmer to express these attributions while fulfilling the\nrequirement of being fully on the static level. That is, it allows one to\nexpress how to interpret these attributions during compilation and erases them\nbefore a program is passed to the runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 22:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

The community is largely\nunprepared to address these overheads, as the source of slowdown in PI stems\nfrom the ReLU operator whereas optimizations for plaintext inference focus on\noptimizing FLOPs. In this paper we re-think the ReLU computation and propose\noptimizations for PI tailored to properties of neural networks.

These optimizations result in a specific type of stochastic ReLU. The key\nobservation is that the stochastic fault behavior is well suited for the\nfault-tolerant properties of neural network inference. Thus, we provide\nsignificant savings without impacting accuracy.

In this paper, we systematically\nreview computational models for hospital readmission prediction, and propose a\ntaxonomy of challenges featuring four main categories: (1) data variety and\ncomplexity; (2) data imbalance, locality and privacy; (3) model\ninterpretability; and (4) model implementation. The review summarizes methods\nin each category, and highlights technical solutions proposed to address the\nchallenges. In addition, a review of datasets and resources available for\nhospital readmission modeling also provides firsthand materials to support\nresearchers and practitioners to design new approaches for effective and\nefficient hospital readmission prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 00:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

As a result, a small\nperturbation in the initial conditions results in deviation in state trajectory\nafter a few time steps. The algorithms and computational resources needed to\naccurately identify the system states vary depending on whether the solution is\nin transition region or not. We refer to the transition and non-transition\nregions as unstable and stable regions respectively. We label a system state to\nbe stable if it's immediate past and future states reside in the same regime.\nHowever, at a given time step we don't have the prior knowledge about whether\nsystem is in stable or unstable region. In this paper, we develop and train a\nfeed forward (multi-layer perceptron) Neural Network to classify the system\nstates of a Lorenz system as stable and unstable. We pose this task as a\nsupervised learning problem where we train the neural network on Lorenz system\nwhich have states labeled as stable or unstable. We then test the ability of\nthe neural network models to identify the stable and unstable states on a\ndifferent Lorenz system that is generated using different initial conditions.\nWe also evaluate the classification performance in the mismatched case i.e.,\nwhen the initial conditions for training and validation data are sampled from\ndifferent intervals. We show that certain normalization schemes can greatly\nimprove the performance of neural networks in especially these mismatched\nscenarios. The classification framework developed in the paper can be a\npreprocessor for a larger context of sequential decision making framework where\nthe decision making is performed based on observed stable or unstable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 00:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

GTNs learn important metapaths in the graph, create\nweighted edges for these metapaths, and use the resulting graph in a GCN.\nCurrently, the only available implementation of GTNs uses dense matrix\nmultiplication to find metapaths. Unfortunately, the space overhead of this\napproach can be large, so in practice it is used only for small graphs. In\naddition, the matrix-based implementation is not fine-grained enough to use\nrandom-walk based methods to optimize metapath finding. In this paper, we\npresent a graph-based formulation and implementation of the GTN metapath\nfinding problem. This graph-based formulation has two advantages over the\nmatrix-based approach. First, it is more space efficient than the original GTN\nimplementation and more compute-efficient for metapath sizes of practical\ninterest. Second, it permits us to implement a sampling method that reduces the\nnumber of metapaths that must be enumerated, allowing the implementation to be\nused for larger graphs and larger metapath sizes.

In a\nprevious paper by Kimura, Osaki, and Kato (2020), we analyzed its Kepler light\ncurves and found that its orbital light curves during the brightening stage\nwere dominated by the reflection effect of the secondary star and varied with\nthe orientation of the tilted disk; the amplitude was maximized at the minimum\nof the super-orbital signal and the phase of the light maximum shifted to an\nearlier one with the advance of the super-orbital phase. We argued there that\nthis was the direct evidence of the retrogradely precessing tilted disk as the\nsecondary star acts like a reflecting object. In order to confirm this\ninterpretation, we have performed numerical modeling of orbital light curves in\nthis paper.

Experiment with 8 real-world datasets shows the MLP derived\nfrom LinkDist can predict the label of a node without knowing its adjacencies\nbut achieve comparable accuracy against GNNs in the contexts of semi- and\nfull-supervised node classification. Moreover, LinkDist benefits from its\nNon-Message Passing paradigm that we can also distil self-knowledge from\narbitrarily sampled node pairs in a contrastive way to further boost the\nperformance of LinkDist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 03:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

To detect\nmorphing attacks, we propose a method which is based on a discriminative 2D\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT). A discriminative wavelet sub-band can\nhighlight inconsistencies between a real and a morphed image. We observe that\nthere is a salient discrepancy between the entropy of a given sub-band in a\nbona fide image, and the same sub-band's entropy in a morphed sample.\nConsidering this dissimilarity between these two entropy values, we find the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions, namely the entropy\nof the bona fide and the corresponding morphed images. The most discriminative\nwavelet sub-bands are those with the highest corresponding KL-divergence\nvalues. Accordingly, 22 sub-bands are selected as the most discriminative ones\nin terms of morph detection. We show that a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained\non the 22 discriminative sub-bands can detect morphed samples precisely.

Secondly, training sets contain only video-level\nlabels indicating the existence of an abnormal event during the full video\nwhile lacking annotations of precise time durations. To tackle these problems,\nwe contribute a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the\nbenchmark for anomaly detection in video sequences, which is featured in two\naspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal and abnormal\nvideo clips with 14 anomaly categories including crash, fire, violence, etc.\nwith large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to\ndate. 2) It provides the annotation data, including video-level labels\n(abnormal/normal video, anomaly type) and frame-level labels (abnormal/normal\nvideo frame) to facilitate anomaly detection.

With this design, the total inference steps will be\nrestricted to the number of mixed speakers. Besides, we also adopt the\nConformer and incorporate an intermediate CTC loss to improve the performance.\nExperiments on WSJ0-Mix and LibriMix corpora show that our model outperforms\nother NAR models with only a slight increase of latency, achieving WERs of\n22.3% and 24.9%, respectively.

The core idea behind OESense is the joint use of the occlusion effect\n(i.e., the enhancement of low-frequency components of bone-conducted sounds in\nan occluded ear canal) and inward-facing microphone, which naturally boosts the\nsensing signal and suppresses external interference.

Four different FEM\nsolvers, including conventional linear and quadratic FEMs as well as their\ncorresponding XFEM versions with local enrichment by singular basis functions\nat sharp edges, are implemented and compared.

A numerical model\nbased on a higher-order boundary element is applied to solve the resulting\nboundary-value problems in the time domain. A recently developed new set of\nexplicit time-integration methods, which do not necessitate the use of upwind\nschemes for spatial derivatives, are adopted to deal with the convective-type\nfree-surface conditions. To suppress the weak saw-tooth instabilities on the\nfree surface in time marching, we also present novel low-pass filters based on\noptimized weighted-least-squares, which are in principle applicable for both\nstructured and unstructured meshes. The presented schemes for the convection\nequation and the low-pass filter are also relevant for other engineering fields\ndealing with similar mathematical problems. For ship seakeeping and added\nresistance analyses, we show that the present computational model does not need\nto use soft-springs for surge and sway, in contrast to the traditional models.\nFor a floating monopile, the importance of consistently taking into account the\neffects of large horizontal motions is demonstrated considering the\nbi-chromatic incident waves. The present model is considered as a complete 2nd\norder wave-load model, as all the 2nd order wave loads, including the\nsum-frequency and difference-frequency components, are solved simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 08:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 10:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as\nthere exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and\ncollecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive\ncomputational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose\nHardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the\ndevice-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such\nthat we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on\nan unseen device with a few samples.

Its well-known representative,\nthe quasi-one-dimensional SrNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ shows both conventional as well as\nunconventional magnetic Raman scattering. The former is observed as one- and\ntwo-triplet excitations with small linewidths and energies corresponding to the\nHaldane gap $\\Delta_H$ and the exchange coupling $J_c$ along the chain,\nrespectively. Well-defined magnetic quasiparticles are assumed to be stabilized\nby interchain interactions and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy.

The first variant, in which dormant\nindividuals do not move in space and instead form \"localized seed banks\", has\nrecently been introduced in Blath, Hammer and Nie (2020). However, there, only\na relatively crude upper bound for the critical speed of potential travelling\nwave solutions has been provided. The second model variant is new and describes\na situation in which the dormant forms of individuals are subject to motion,\nwhile the \"active\" individuals remain spatially static instead. This can be\nmotivated e.g. by spore dispersal of fungi, where the \"dormant\" spores are\ndistributed by wind, water or insects, while the \"active\" fungi are locally\nfixed. For both models, we establish the existence of monotone travelling wave\nsolutions, determine the corresponding critical wave-speed in terms of the\nmodel parameters, and characterize aspects of the asymptotic shape of the waves\ndepending on the decay properties of the initial condition. Interestingly, the\nslow-down effect of dormancy on the speed of propagation of beneficial alleles\nis often more serious in model variant II (the \"spore model\") than in variant I\n(the \"seed bank model\"), and this can be understood mathematically via\nprobabilistic representations of solutions in terms of (two variants of)\n\"on/off branching Brownian motions\". Our proofs make rather heavy use of\nprobabilistic tools in the tradition of McKean (1975), Bramson (1978), Neveu\n(1987), Lalley and Sellke (1987), Champneys et al (1995) and others. However,\nthe two-compartment nature of the model and the special forms of dormancy also\npose obstacles to the classical formalism, giving rise to a variety of open\nresearch questions that we briefly discuss at the end of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 09:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

It constitutes a novel law that\nrules the build-up of the reactive helicity through its zero time-average flow.\nIts imaginary Poynting momentum accounts for the accretion of reactive power,\nare illustrated in: evanescent waves and fields scattered from\nmagnetodielectric dipolar nanoparticles. As for the former, we show that its\nreactive helicity may be experimentally observed as we introduce a reactive\nspin momentum and a reactive orbital momentum in terms of which we express the\nimaginary field momentum, whose transversal component produces an optical force\non a magnetoelectric particle that, as we illustrate, may surpass and can be\ndiscriminated from, the known force due to the so-called extraordinary\nmomentum. We also uncover a non-conservative force on such a magnetoelectric\nparticle, acting in the decay direction of the evanescent wave, and that may\nalso be discriminated from the standard gradient force; thus making the\nreactive power of the wavefield also observable. Concerning the light scattered\nby magnetoelectric nanoparticles, we establish two optical theorems that govern\nthe accretion of reactive helicity and reactive power on extinction of incident\nwave helicity and energy. Like a nule total -- internal plus external --\nreactive power is at the root of a resonant scattered power, we show that a\nzero total reactive helicity underlies a resonant scattered helicity.

In our work, we attempt to evaluate and quantify the gender bias\nwithin a Hindi-English machine translation system. We implement a modified\nversion of the existing TGBI metric based on the grammatical considerations for\nHindi. We also compare and contrast the resulting bias measurements across\nmultiple metrics for pre-trained embeddings and the ones learned by our machine\ntranslation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 10:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

These algorithms employ a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) and a\nquantum-classical feedback loop. A classical device is used to optimize the\nparameters in order to minimize a cost function that can be computed far more\nefficiently on a quantum device. The cost function is constructed such that\nfinding the ansatz parameters that minimize its value, solves some problem of\ninterest. We focus specifically on the Variational Quantum Linear Solver\n(VQLS), and examine the effect of several gradient-free and gradient-based\nclassical optimizers on performance. We focus on both the average rate of\nconvergence of the classical optimizers studied, as well as the distribution of\ntheir average termination cost values, and how these are affected by noise. Our\nwork demonstrates that realistic noise levels on NISQ devices present a\nchallenge to the optimization process. All classical optimizers appear to be\nvery negatively affected by the presence of realistic noise.

However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap.

This is\nmainly because it is considered as one of the major tools to decarbonize,\ndigitalize, and democratize the electricity grid. The economic viability and\ntechnical reliability of projects with batteries require appropriate assessment\nbecause of high capital expenditures, deterioration in charging/discharging\nperformance and uncertainty with regulatory policies. Most of the power system\neconomic studies employ a simple power-energy representation coupled with an\nempirical description of degradation to model the lithium-ion battery. This\napproach to modelling may result in violations of the safe operation and\nmisleading estimates of the economic benefits. Recently, the number of\npublications on techno-economic analysis of BESS with more details on the\nlithium-ion battery performance has increased. The aim of this review paper is\nto explore these publications focused on the grid-scale BESS applications and\nto discuss the impacts of using more sophisticated modelling approaches.

The outbursts triggered by these\ninstabilities, however, always have too low $\\dot M_*$, and are one to several\norders of magnitude too long compared to those observed from HMYSOs so far. On\nthe other hand, bursts generated by tidal disruptions of gaseous giant planets\nformed by the gravitational instability of the protoplanetary discs yield\nproperties commensurate with observations, provided that the clumps are in the\npost-collapse configuration with planet radius $R_{\\rm p} \\gtrsim 10 $ Jupiter\nradii. Furthermore, if observed bursts are caused by disc ionisation\ninstabilities then they should be periodic phenomena with the duration of the\nquiescent phase comparable to that of the bursts. This may yield potentially\nobservable burst periodicity signatures in the jets, the outer disc, or the\nsurrounding diffuse material of massive HMYSOs.

Most of the reported works mapped images of both\nthe source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then\nreduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or\nexplicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we\npropose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven\ntowards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional\ndistribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks\nbased on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this\nvariational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a\nsegmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised\nmanner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the\nproposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e.,\nthe cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence\ncardiac MR segmentation.

Furthermore, the proposed explicit\nregularization was shown to be effective and efficient in narrowing down the\ndistribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain\nadaptation.

A spatially dependent mass term for the N=2 hypermultiplet can be\narranged to isolate distinct two component fermions on two 2+1 dimensional\ndomain walls. We argue that the system shows condensation/mass generation\nanalogous to the D3/probe D5 anti-D5 system. The chiral condensate and pion\nmass can be directly computed on the domain wall. We provide evidence that\nthese systems with the domains separated by a width w have a bare (current)\nquark mass that scales as 1/w when the spatial dependent mass is large. Adding\na magnetic field does not induce chiral symmetry breaking between the separated\ndomain wall fermions, but a similar phenomenological dilaton factor can be made\nstrong enough to introduce spontaneous symmetry breaking.

The total\nenergy and helicity budgets of flare-productive ARs (extensive parameters)\ncover a broad range of magnitudes, with no obvious relation to the eruptive\npotential of the individual ARs, i.e., whether or not a CME is produced in\nassociation with the flare. The intensive eruptivity proxies,\n$E_{\\mathrm{F}}/{E}$ and $|H_{\\mathrm{J}}|/|{H_{V}}|$, and\n$|H_{\\mathrm{J}}|/{\\phi^{\\prime}}^{2}$, however, seem to be distinctly\ndifferent for ARs that produced CME-associated large flares compared to those\nwhich produced confined flares. For the majority of ARs in our sample, we are\nable to identify characteristic pre-flare magnitudes of the intensive\nquantities, clearly associated to subsequent CME-productivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 13:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Recent approximate\nadders have significantly extended the design space of accuracy-power\nconfigurable approximate adders, and find optimal designs by exploring the\ndesign space. In this paper, a new energy-efficient heterogeneous block-based\napproximate adder (HBBA) is proposed; which is a generic/configurable model\nthat can be transformed to a particular adder by defining some configurations.\nAn HBBA, in general, is composed of heterogeneous sub-adders, where each\nsub-adder can have a different configuration. A set of configurations of all\nthe sub-adders in an HBBA defines its configuration. The block-based adders are\napproximated through inexact logic configuration and truncated carry chains.\nHBBA increases design space providing additional design points that fall on the\nPareto-front and offer better power-accuracy trade-off compared to other\nconfigurations. Furthermore, to avoid Mont-Carlo simulations, we propose an\nanalytical modelling technique to evaluate the probability of error and\nProbability Mass Function (PMF) of error value. Moreover, the estimation method\nestimates delay, area and power of heterogeneous block-based approximate\nadders. Thus, based on the analytical model and estimation method, the optimal\nconfiguration under a given error constraint can be selected from the whole\ndesign space of the proposed adder model by exhaustive search. The simulation\nresults show that our HBBA provides improved accuracy in terms of error metrics\ncompared to some state-of-the-art approximate adders. HBBA with 32 bits length\nserves about 15% reduction in area and up to 17% reduction in energy compared\nto state-of-the-art approximate adders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 14:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by\n(almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks.\nNonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such\nas participant's age, viewed as prior knowledge.

This problem is formulated as an optimization\nproblem whose goal is to minimize the FL training loss via optimizing user\nscheduling. To find how the factors such as transmit power and number of\nscheduled users affect the training loss, the convergence rate of the FL\nalgorithm is first analyzed.

In this paper, we characterize the\ninherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression\nsetting by providing a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our\nlower bound is sharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple\ninterpretation: when the moments of the target differ between groups, any fair\nalgorithm has to make an error on at least one of the groups. We further extend\nthis result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately)\nfair algorithm, using the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the\napproximation. With our novel lower bound, we also show that the price paid by\na fair regressor that does not take the protected attribute as input is less\nthan that of a fair regressor with explicit access to the protected attribute.\nOn the upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness,\naccuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is\nindividually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where\nthe gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups.

Nevertheless, due to\nvarious special challenges in UAV tracking, \\textit{e.g.}, severe occlusion and\nfast motion, most existing Siamese-based trackers hardly combine superior\nperformance with high efficiency. To this concern, in this paper, a novel\nattentional Siamese tracker (SiamAPN++) is proposed for real-time UAV tracking.\nBy virtue of the attention mechanism, we conduct a special attentional\naggregation network (AAN) consisting of self-AAN and cross-AAN for raising the\nrepresentation ability of features eventually. The former AAN aggregates and\nmodels the self-semantic interdependencies of the single feature map via\nspatial and channel dimensions. The latter aims to aggregate the\ncross-interdependencies of two different semantic features including the\nlocation information of anchors. In addition, the anchor proposal network based\non dual features is proposed to raise its robustness of tracking objects with\nvarious scales. Experiments on two well-known authoritative benchmarks are\nconducted, where SiamAPN++ outperforms its baseline SiamAPN and other SOTA\ntrackers. Besides, real-world tests onboard a typical embedded platform\ndemonstrate that SiamAPN++ achieves promising tracking results with real-time\nspeed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 14:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

The problem is to plan a path for one, or more, agents to\nreach a target without being detected by enemy sensors.\n  Agents are not passive, rather they can initiate actions which aid evasion.\nThey can knockout sensors. Here to knockout a sensor means to completely\ndisable the sensor. They can also confuse sensors. Here to confuse a sensor\nmeans to reduce the probability that the sensor can detect an agent.\n  Agent actions are path dependent and time limited. By path dependent we mean\nthat an agent needs to be sufficiently close to a sensor to knock it out. By\ntime limited we mean that a limit is imposed on how long a sensor is knocked\nout or confused before it reverts back to its original operating state.\n  The approach adopted breaks the continuous space in which agents move into a\ndiscrete space. This enables the problem to be formulated as a zero-one integer\nprogram with linear constraints.

After the disruption of a star by a\nSMBH, the highly elliptical orbit of the debris stream will be gradually\ncircularized due to the self-crossing, and then the circularized debris will\nform an accretion disk. The recent TDE candidate AT 2019avd has double peaks in\nits optical light curve, and the X-ray emerges near the second peak. The\ndurations of the peaks are ~400 and 600 days, respectively, and the separation\nbetween them is ~700 days. We fit its spectral energy distribution (SED) and\nanalyze its light curves in the optical/UV, mid-infrared, and X-ray bands. We\nfind that this source can be interpreted as a two-phase scenario in which the\nfirst phase is dominated by the stream circularization, and the second phase is\nthe delayed accretion. We use the succession of the self-crossing model and the\ndelayed accretion model to fit the first and the second peaks, respectively.\nThe fitting result implies that AT 2019avd can be interpreted by the partial\ndisruption of a 0.9 M_sun star by a 7 * 10^6 M_sun SMBH, but this result is\nsensitive to the stellar model.

To seek good performance in POMDPs, one strategy is to endow\nthe agent with a finite memory, whose update is governed by the policy.\nHowever, policy optimization is non-convex in that case and can lead to poor\ntraining performance for random initialization. The performance can be\nempirically improved by constraining the memory architecture, then sacrificing\noptimality to facilitate training. Here we study this trade-off in a\ntwo-hypothesis testing problem, akin to the two-arm bandit problem.

The possible plane of satellites is only 31\nkpc thick with the minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.14. Four out of five galaxies\nwith measured velocities follow a common velocity trend similar to those\nobserved in the planes of satellites around the Andromeda and Centaurus A\ngalaxies. However, the small number of galaxies with known velocities prevents\nto reach a definitive conclusion about the formation scenario of the structure\nand its possible relation to the surrounding cosmic web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 15:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Instead,\nenabling sustainable clouds will require applications to adapt to when and\nwhere unreliable low-carbon energy is available.

The effect of DP on the fairness of the resulting trained\nmodels is not yet well understood. In this contribution, we systematically\nstudy the effects of differentially private synthetic data generation on\nclassification. We analyze disparities in model utility and bias caused by the\nsynthetic dataset, measured through algorithmic fairness metrics. Our first set\nof results show that although there seems to be a clear negative correlation\nbetween privacy and utility (the more private, the less accurate) across all\ndata synthesizers we evaluated, more privacy does not necessarily imply more\nbias. Additionally, we assess the effects of utilizing synthetic datasets for\nmodel training and model evaluation. We show that results obtained on synthetic\ndata can misestimate the actual model performance when it is deployed on real\ndata. We hence advocate on the need for defining proper testing protocols in\nscenarios where differentially private synthetic datasets are utilized for\nmodel training and evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 21:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}
