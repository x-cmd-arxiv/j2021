Boosting the resilience of\ndistribution systems is another major benefit of microgrids. This is because\nthey can also serve as a backup power source when the utility grid operations\nare interrupted due to either high-probability low-impact events like a\ncomponent failure or low-probability high-impact events - be it a natural\ndisaster or a planned cyberattack. However, the degree to which any particular\nsystem can defend, adapt, and restore normal operation depends on various\nfactors including the type and severity of events to which a microgrid is\nsubjected. These factors, in turn, are dependent on the geographical location\nof the deployed microgrid as well as the cyber risk profile of the site where\nthe microgrid is operating.

But in practice, precise graph\nannotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this\nissue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which\npulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes\naway negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are\nuniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical\nsampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic\nstructure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this\nsampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive\nLearning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic\nstructure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the\nsame group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for\ndifferent augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs\nnegative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from\nthe cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and\nits negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its\nnegative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster\ncentroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate\nprototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is\nproved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on\nvarious graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The device\nunder test consists of a racetrack microresonator, with an embedded S-shaped\nwaveguide, coupled to an external bus waveguide (BW). This geometry of the\nmicroresonator, known as \"taiji\" microresonator (TJMR), allows to selectively\ncouple counter-propagating modes depending on the propagation direction of the\nincident light and, at the nonlinear level, leads to an effective breaking of\nLorentz reciprocity.

At sufficiently low\npowers the asymmetric loss does not affect the unidirectional behavior, but the\nFP interference fringes can cancel the effect of the S-shaped waveguide.\nHowever, at high input power, both the asymmetric loss and the FPOs contribute\nto the redistribution of the energy between the clockwise and counterclockwise\nmodes within the TJMR.

As a continuation to this series, we here\nfocus on the quasinormal modes of nonrotating black holes in scalar\nGauss-Bonnet gravity assuming a small-coupling expansion. We show that the\naxial perturbations are purely tensorial and are described by a modified\nRegge-Wheeler equation, while the polar perturbations are of mixed\nscalar-tensor character and are described by a system of two coupled wave\nequations.

While early works\nconcentrated on specific object priors such as a human face or body, recent\nwork considered the unsupervised case. When the source and target videos,\nhowever, are of different shapes, current methods fail. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce JOKR - a JOint Keypoint Representation that captures the\nmotion common to both the source and target videos, without requiring any\nobject prior or data collection. By employing a domain confusion term, we\nenforce the unsupervised keypoint representations of both videos to be\nindistinguishable. This encourages disentanglement between the parts of the\nmotion that are common to the two domains, and their distinctive appearance and\nmotion, enabling the generation of videos that capture the motion of the one\nwhile depicting the style of the other. To enable cases where the objects are\nof different proportions or orientations, we apply a learned affine\ntransformation between the JOKRs. This augments the representation to be affine\ninvariant, and in practice broadens the variety of possible retargeting pairs.\nThis geometry-driven representation enables further intuitive control, such as\ntemporal coherence and manual editing. Through comprehensive experimentation,\nwe demonstrate the applicability of our method to different challenging\ncross-domain video pairs.

In the optimisation approach, the choice of the cost function affects\nthe predictions made by the algorithm.

Humans are very experienced in physical\nreasoning while it remains a major challenge for AI. To facilitate research\naddressing this problem, several benchmarks have been proposed recently.\nHowever, these benchmarks do not enable us to measure an agent's granular\nphysical reasoning capabilities when solving a complex reasoning task. In this\npaper, we propose a new benchmark for physical reasoning that allows us to test\nindividual physical reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire\nthese capabilities, we propose a general hierarchy of physical reasoning\ncapabilities with increasing complexity. Our benchmark tests capabilities\naccording to this hierarchy through generated physical reasoning tasks in the\nvideo game Angry Birds. This benchmark enables us to conduct a comprehensive\nagent evaluation by measuring the agent's granular physical reasoning\ncapabilities. We conduct an evaluation with human players, learning agents, and\nheuristic agents and determine their capabilities. Our evaluation shows that\nlearning agents, with good local generalization ability, still struggle to\nlearn the underlying physical reasoning capabilities and perform worse than\ncurrent state-of-the-art heuristic agents and humans. We believe that this\nbenchmark will encourage researchers to develop intelligent agents with\nadvanced, human-like physical reasoning capabilities.

The design of cities\ncan not be abstracted from the design of its mobility system, and, therefore,\nefficient solutions must be found to transport people and goods throughout the\ncity in an ecological way. An autonomous bicycle-sharing system would combine\nthe most relevant benefits of vehicle sharing, electrification, autonomy, and\nmicro-mobility, increasing the efficiency and convenience of bicycle-sharing\nsystems and incentivizing more people to bike and enjoy their cities in an\nenvironmentally friendly way. Due to the uniqueness and radical novelty of\nintroducing autonomous driving technology into bicycle-sharing systems and the\ninherent complexity of these systems, there is a need to quantify the potential\nimpact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience. This paper\npresents an ad-hoc agent-based simulator that provides an in-depth\nunderstanding of the fleet behavior of autonomous bicycle-sharing systems in\nrealistic scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction.\nIn addition, this work describes the impact of different parameters on system\nefficiency and service quality and quantifies the extent to which an autonomous\nsystem would outperform current bicycle-sharing schemes. The obtained results\nshow that with a fleet size three and a half times smaller than a station-based\nsystem and eight times smaller than a dockless system, an autonomous system can\nprovide overall improved performance and user experience even with no\nrebalancing. These findings indicate that the remarkable efficiency of an\nautonomous bicycle-sharing system could compensate for the additional cost of\nautonomous bicycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 17:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition.

In this\npaper, we introduce a large-scale in-the-wild visual attribute prediction\ndataset consisting of over 927K attribute annotations for over 260K object\ninstances.

Instead, a more desirable approach is to have a\nsingle model that can dynamically adjust its latency based on different\nconstraints, which we refer to as Multi-mode ASR. A Multi-mode ASR model can\nfulfill various latency requirements during inference -- when a larger latency\nbecomes acceptable, the model can process longer future context to achieve\nhigher accuracy and when a latency budget is not flexible, the model can be\nless dependent on future context but still achieve reliable accuracy.

Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare, random sampling of\ntweets to annotate is very inefficient in finding hate speech. To address this,\nprior datasets often include only tweets matching known \"hate words\". However,\nrestricting data to a pre-defined vocabulary may exclude portions of the\nreal-world phenomenon we seek to model. A second challenge is that definitions\nof hate speech tend to be highly varying and subjective. Annotators having\ndiverse prior notions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but\nalso struggle to conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is\nthat the rarity and subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance\nin information retrieval (IR). This connection suggests that well-established\nmethodologies for creating IR test collections can be usefully applied to\ncreate better benchmark datasets for hate speech. To intelligently and\nefficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply standard IR techniques of\n{\\em pooling} and {\\em active learning}.

In this setting,\neach silo (e.g. hospital) has data from different people (e.g. patients) and\nmust maintain the privacy of each person's data (e.g. medical record), even if\nthe server or other silos act as adversarial eavesdroppers. This requirement\nmotivates the study of Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP),\nwhich requires silo i's communications to satisfy record/item-level\ndifferential privacy (DP). ISRL-DP ensures that the data of each person (e.g.\npatient) in silo i (e.g. hospital i) cannot be leaked. ISRL-DP is different\nfrom well-studied privacy notions. Central and user-level DP assume that people\ntrust the server/other silos. On the other end of the spectrum, local DP\nassumes that people do not trust anyone at all (even their own silo). Sitting\nbetween central and local DP, ISRL-DP makes the realistic assumption (in\ncross-silo FL) that people trust their own silo, but not the server or other\nsilos. In this work, we provide tight (up to logarithms) upper and lower bounds\nfor ISRL-DP FL with convex/strongly convex loss functions and homogeneous\n(i.i.d.) silo data. Remarkably, we show that similar bounds are attainable for\nsmooth losses with arbitrary heterogeneous silo data distributions, via an\naccelerated ISRL-DP algorithm. We also provide tight upper and lower bounds for\nISRL-DP federated empirical risk minimization, and use acceleration to attain\nthe optimal bounds in fewer rounds of communication than the state-of-the-art.\nFinally, with a secure \"shuffler\" to anonymize silo messages (but without a\ntrusted server), our algorithm attains the optimal central DP rates under more\npractical trust assumptions.

In terms of\nthe $a$ and $c$ central charges, this condition implies that IHS theories\nsatisfying $a<{1\\over24}(15r+2f)$ and $c<{1\\over6}(3r+f)$ (where $r$ is the\ncomplex dimension of the Coulomb branch, and $f$ is the rank of the continuous\n0-form flavor symmetry) have no 1-form symmetry. After reviewing the 1-form\nsymmetries of other classes of theories, we are motivated to conjecture that\ngeneral interacting 4D $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs with all Coulomb branch chiral\nring generators of dimension less than two have no 1-form symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 20:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 16:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

However, between these two limiting cases there is a less well\nunderstood intermediate regime where polarons are present but transport does\nnot occur via hopping.

However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently\ndemonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI\nbrain images with high accuracy.

Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work\nto fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows:\nin Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural\nlanguage processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to\ntrain a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.\n  Methods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions.\nWe then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In\nPart 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q\nlearning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90\nimages. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes\npredicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1.

Intentional disturbances in the system, such as in the case of\ncyberattacks, can compromise reachability of control goals, and in several\ncases jeopardize safety. The increasing connectivity and exposure of networked\ncontrol to external networks has enabled attackers to compromise these systems\nby exploiting security vulnerabilities. Attacks against safety-critical control\nloops can not only drive the system over a trajectory different from the\ndesired, but also cause fatal consequences to humans. In this paper we present\na physics-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aimed at increasing the\nsecurity in control systems. In addition to conventional process state\nestimation for intrusion detection, since the controller cannot be trusted, we\nintroduce a controller state estimator. Additionally, we make our detector\ncontext-aware by utilizing sensor measurements from other control loops, which\nallows to distinguish and characterize disturbances from attacks. We introduce\nadaptive thresholding and adaptive filtering as means to achieve\ncontext-awareness. Together, these methodologies allow detection and\nlocalization of attacks in closed-loop controls. Finally, we demonstrate\nfeasibility of the approach by mounting a series of attacks against a networked\nDirect Current (DC) motor closed-loop speed control deployed on an ECU testbed,\nas well as on a simulated automated lane keeping system.

This\nharm may manifest as a gradual degradation of public discourse; but it can also\ntake the form of sudden dramatic events such as the 2021 insurrection on\nCapitol Hill. The platforms themselves are in the best position to prevent the\nspread of disinformation, as they have the best access to relevant data and the\nexpertise to use it. However, mitigating disinformation is costly, not only for\nimplementing detection algorithms or employing manual effort, but also because\nlimiting such highly viral content impacts user engagement and potential\nadvertising revenue. Since the costs of harmful content are borne by other\nentities, the platform will therefore have no incentive to exercise the\nsocially-optimal level of effort. This problem is similar to that of\nenvironmental regulation, in which the costs of adverse events are not directly\nborne by a firm, the mitigation effort of a firm is not observable, and the\ncausal link between a harmful consequence and a specific failure is difficult\nto prove. For environmental regulation, one solution is to perform costly\nmonitoring to ensure that the firm takes adequate precautions according to a\nspecified rule. However, a fixed rule for classifying disinformation becomes\nless effective over time, as bad actors can learn to sequentially and\nstrategically bypass it. Encoding our domain as a Markov decision process, we\ndemonstrate that no penalty based on a static rule, no matter how large, can\nincentivize optimal effort. Penalties based on an adaptive rule can incentivize\noptimal effort, but counter-intuitively, only if the regulator sufficiently\noverreacts to harmful events by requiring a greater-than-optimal level of\neffort.

The next recognized challenge is the realization of room-temperature\nsuperconductivity at significantly lower pressures.

In this paper, we explore a large class of\nadversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a\nblack-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to\ninputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the\nhuman eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web\nsearch engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection --\nrepresenting one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an\nattacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and\nwith three injections most models can be functionally broken.

We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10\nand SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently\nimprove the quality of generated data.

The results show that the calibrated model replicates the\ndriving behavior with an average error of 0.45 m/sec, indicating the high\npotential for using this framework for automated, large-scale calibration of\ncar-following models from roadside traffic video data, which can lead to\nsubstantial improvements in traffic modeling via microscopic simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 06:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

A popular data-driven method to detect incipient failures and\nanomalies is the training of normal behaviour models by applying a machine\nlearning technique like feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or extreme learning\nmachines (ELM). However, the performance of any of these modelling techniques\ncan be deteriorated by the unexpected rise of non-stationarities in the dynamic\nenvironment in which industrial assets operate. This unpredictable statistical\nchange in the measured variable is known as concept drift. In this article a\nwind turbine maintenance case is presented, where non-stationarities of various\nkinds can happen unexpectedly.

Under the lack of information in\nthis regard, a methodology for labelling concept drift events in the lifetime\nof wind turbines is proposed.

By focusing on\nthe final fate of this liquid bridge, we observe that the breakup occurs once\nan effective length ($\\tilde{L}$) is reached. This effective length increases\nlinearly with the applied voltage, implying a threshold electric field to\nsustain the liquid bridge. Moreover, by an introduced external flow, the\nlifetime of the liquid bridge can be controlled, while the effective length\nassociated with the breakup is independent on the external flow rate.

Previous methods attempt to\nlearn the representation of the normal samples via generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs). However, they will suffer from instability training, mode\ndropping, and low discriminative ability. Recently, various pretext tasks (e.g.\nrotation prediction and clustering) have been proposed for self-supervised\nlearning in novelty detection. However, the learned latent features are still\nlow discriminative. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel\ndecoder-encoder framework. Firstly, a generative network (a.k.a. decoder)\nlearns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image.\nIn particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire\ndistribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly,\na contrastive network (a.k.a. encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through\nmutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to\nobtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data\naugmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has\nsignificant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on some novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and\nDCASE.

This is because, to access the unsecure\nnon-Keystone memory, Keystone needs support of the OS.

Following the review of the literature,\nseveral conclusions are reached. Among them, Human Vulnerability Assessment has\nbeen included in various frameworks aiming to assess the cyber security\ncapacity of organizations, but it concerns a one time assessment rather than a\ncontinuous practice. Moreover, human maliciousness is still neglected from\ncurrent Human Vulnerability Assessment frameworks; thus, insider threat actors\nevade identification, which may lead to an increased cyber security risk.\nFinally, this work proposes a user susceptibility profile according to the\nfactors stemming from our research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 08:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 13:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

In this\npaper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted\nstructural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system\ntermed OddBall.

We propose a method of using empirical\nrelations between Teff, log g and line-depth ratios, for which we meticulously\nselect pairs of FeI and FeII lines and pairs of CaI and CaII lines.

Conventionally, each layer in the stack\nhas its own parameters which leads to a significant increase in the number of\nmodel parameters. In this paper, we propose to share parameters across all\nlayers thereby leading to a recurrently stacked neural network model. We report\non an extensive case study on neural machine translation (NMT), where we apply\nour proposed method to an encoder-decoder based neural network model, i.e., the\nTransformer model, and experiment with three Japanese--English translation\ndatasets. We empirically demonstrate that the translation quality of a model\nthat recurrently stacks a single layer 6 times, despite having significantly\nfewer parameters, approaches that of a model that stacks 6 layers where each\nlayer has different parameters. We also explore the limits of recurrent\nstacking where we train extremely deep NMT models.

However, the improvement is still limited by the training data in\nboth target styles and speakers. Inadequate style transfer performance occurs\nwhen the trained TTS tries to transfer the speech to a target style from a new\nspeaker with an unknown, arbitrary style. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach to style transfer for both seen and unseen styles, with disjoint,\nmulti-style datasets, i.e., datasets of different styles are recorded, each\nindividual style is by one speaker with multiple utterances. To encode the\nstyle information, we adopt an inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) structure to\nimprove the variational inference. The whole system is optimized to minimize a\nweighed sum of four different loss functions: 1) a reconstruction loss to\nmeasure the distortions in both source and target reconstructions; 2) an\nadversarial loss to \"fool\" a well-trained discriminator; 3) a style distortion\nloss to measure the expected style loss after the transfer; 4) a cycle\nconsistency loss to preserve the speaker identity of the source after the\ntransfer. Experiments demonstrate, both objectively and subjectively, the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach for seen and unseen style transfer\ntasks. The performance of the new approach is better and more robust than those\nof four baseline systems of the prior art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 08:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

A\nfully-nonlinear numerical model is established based on the boundary element\nmethod for a systematic investigation on dynamic properties of the proposed\nS-WEC. A motion decoupling algorithm based on auxiliary functions is developed\nto solve the nonlinear interaction of sloshing waves and floating buoys in the\ntank. An artificial damping model is introduced to reflect viscous effects of\nthe sloshing liquid. Physical experiments are carried out on a scaled S-WEC\nmodel to validate the mathematical and numerical methodologies. Natural\nfrequencies of the S-WEC system are first investigated through spectrum\nanalyses on motion histories of the buoy and sloshing liquid.

An optimal PTO damping can be found for each\nexcitation frequency, leading to the maximisation of both the power generation\nand conversion efficiency of the buoy. To determine a constant PTO damping for\nengineering design, a practical approach based on diagram analyses is proposed.\nEffects of the buoy's geometry on power generation characteristics of the S-WEC\nare also investigated.

However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer\nfrom inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D\nbuilds an efficient 4D Feature-Consistency Embedding (FCE) space for the\nintermediate representation of object without depth supervision. FCE space\nsplits the entire object region into 3D uniform grid latent space for feature\nsampling point generation, which ignores the importance of different object\nregions. However, we argue that, compared with the inner region, the outer\nregion plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To encode more\ninformation from the outer region, we propose a shape prior non-uniform\nsampling strategy that performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse\nsampling in inner region. As a result, more points are sampled from the outer\nregion and more useful features are extracted for 3D detection. Further, to\nenhance the feature discrimination of each sampling point, we propose a\nhigh-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information\nand suppress noise better.

Hence, their structures have been\ninvestigated in great detail. However, much less is known about their chemical\nfeatures, owing to the experimental difficulties to probe these features at the\natomic length scale inside bulk material specimens. Atom probe tomography (APT)\nis a tool capable of accomplishing this task, with an ability to quantify\nchemical characteristics at near-atomic scale. Using APT data sets, we present\nhere a machine-learning-based approach for the automated quantification of\nchemical features of GBs. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) using\ntwenty thousand synthesized images of grain interiors, GBs, or triple\njunctions. Such a trained CNN automatically detects the locations of GBs from\nAPT data. Those GBs are then subjected to compositional mapping and analysis,\nincluding revealing their in-plane chemical decoration patterns. We applied\nthis approach to experimentally obtained APT data sets pertaining to three case\nstudies, namely, Ni-P, Pt-Au, and Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys. In the first case, we\nextracted GB-specific segregation features as a function of misorientation and\ncoincidence site lattice character.

Lastly, we tracked the temporal evolution of chemical\ndecoration from early-stage solute GB segregation in the dilute limit to\ninterfacial phase separation, characterized by the evolution of complex\ncomposition patterns. This machine-learning-based approach provides\nquantitative, unbiased, and automated access to GB chemical analyses, serving\nas an enabling tool for new discoveries related to interface thermodynamics,\nkinetics, and the associated chemistry-structure-property relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 10:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

Thus, I define a Universal Risk Budgeting scheme that\nweights each risk budget (instead of each capital budget) by its historical\nperformance record (a la Cover). I prove that my scheme is mathematically\nequivalent to a novel type of Cover and Ordentlich 1996 universal portfolio\nthat uses a new family of prior densities that have hitherto not appeared in\nthe literature on universal portfolio theory.

While every\nnon-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little is known about structural\nproperties of graphs with a bounded number of moplexes. The study of these\ngraphs is, in part, motivated by the parallel between moplexes in general\ngraphs and simplicial modules in chordal graphs: unlike in the moplex setting,\nproperties of chordal graphs with a bounded number of simplicial modules are\nwell understood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two simplicial\nmodules are interval.\n  In this work, we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex graphs, which are\ndefined as graphs containing at most $k$ moplexes. Of particular interest is\nthe smallest nontrivial case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to the class of\ninterval graphs. As our main structural result, we show that, when restricted\nto connected graphs, the class of $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the\nclasses of proper interval graphs and cocomparability graphs; moreover, both\ninclusions are tight for hereditary classes. From a complexity theoretic\nviewpoint, this leads to the natural question of whether the presence of at\nmost two moplexes guarantees a sufficient amount of structure to efficiently\nsolve problems that are known to be intractable on cocomparability graphs, but\nnot on proper interval graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this\nquestion negatively for two prominent problems fitting this profile, namely\nGraph Isomorphism and Max-Cut.

First,\nmost existing vertical federated learning methods have a strong assumption that\nat least one party holds the complete set of labels of all data samples, while\nthis assumption is not satisfied in many practical scenarios, where labels are\nhorizontally partitioned and the parties only hold partial labels. Existing\nvertical federated learning methods can only utilize partial labels, which may\nlead to inadequate model update in end-to-end backpropagation.

We report the first STIX observations of\nmicroflares recorded during the instrument commissioning phase in order to\ninvestigate the STIX performance at its detection limit. This first result\npaper focuses on the temporal and spectral evolution of STIX microflares\noccuring in the AR12765 in June 2020, and compares the STIX measurements with\nGOES/XRS, SDO/AIA, and Hinode/XRT. For the observed microflares of the GOES A\nand B class, the STIX peak time at lowest energies is located in the impulsive\nphase of the flares, well before the GOES peak time. Such a behavior can either\nbe explained by the higher sensitivity of STIX to higher temperatures compared\nto GOES, or due to the existence of a nonthermal component reaching down to low\nenergies. The interpretation is inconclusive due to limited counting statistics\nfor all but the largest flare in our sample. For this largest flare, the\nlow-energy peak time is clearly due to thermal emission, and the nonthermal\ncomponent seen at higher energies occurs even earlier. This suggests that the\nclassic thermal explanation might also be favored for the majority of the\nsmaller flares. In combination with EUV and SXR observations, STIX corroborates\nearlier findings that an isothermal assumption is of limited validity. Future\ndiagnostic efforts should focus on multi-wavelength studies to derive\ndifferential emission measure distributions over a wide range of temperatures\nto accurately describe the energetics of solar flares. Commissioning\nobservations confirm that STIX is working as designed. As a rule of thumb, STIX\ndetects flares as small as the GOES A class. For flares above the GOES B class,\ndetailed spectral and imaging analyses can be performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 11:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 08:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 13:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

As a result, one often resorts to subjective\nquality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating\nimage enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually\npre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three\nsources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of\nthe selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential\noverfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential\ncherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world\nimage enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards\ndebiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of\nadaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting\nsample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the\nenhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual\ninspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the\nenhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using\nthree popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing,\nsuper-resolution, and low-light enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 12:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 03:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

In this work, complementary to these previous studies, we\nanalyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is\nreversed. We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled\nphase of a quantum spin$-1/2$ chain, while competing single-particle or\ninteracting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the\nsingle-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an\nentanglement transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the\ncompetition ratio between the unitary evolution and the non-unitary dynamics\nincreases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent\nobservables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement\ndynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state\ndynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative\ndynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian\ncontribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase.

However, embodied cognition has not been\nconsidered in the existing visual processing models.

To address this question, we use\nreinforcement learning to train neural network models to play a 3D computer\ngame and we find that these reinforcement learning models achieve neural\nresponse prediction accuracy scores in the early visual areas (e.g., V1 and V2)\nin the levels that are comparable to those accomplished by the supervised\nneural network model.

Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available\nresources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is\npoorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of\ngenerated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design\nproblem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic\nmeasures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic\nsimilarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict\nthe success of generated ideas.

This iterative process combines solutions\nlocated by inexpensive (coarse resolution) and expensive (fine resolution)\nnumerical integrators. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic parareal\nalgorithm aimed at accelerating the convergence of the deterministic parareal\nalgorithm. Instead of providing the predictor-corrector with a\ndeterministically located set of initial values, the stochastic algorithm\nsamples initial values from dynamically varying probability distributions in\neach temporal sub-interval. All samples are then propagated in parallel using\nthe expensive integrator. The set of sampled initial values yielding the most\ncontinuous (smoothest) trajectory across consecutive sub-intervals are fed into\nthe predictor-corrector, converging in fewer iterations than the deterministic\nalgorithm with a given probability. The performance of the stochastic\nalgorithm, implemented using various probability distributions, is illustrated\non low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We\nprovide numerical evidence that when the number of sampled initial values is\nlarge enough, stochastic parareal converges almost certainly in fewer\niterations than the deterministic algorithm, maintaining solution accuracy.\nGiven its stochastic nature, we also highlight that multiple simulations of\nstochastic parareal return a distribution of solutions that can represent a\nmeasure of uncertainty over the ODE solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 14:12:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 11:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 09:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

However, despite enormous effort, these adversarial examples\nremained a counterintuitive phenomenon with no simple testable explanation. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new conceptual framework for how the decision\nboundary between classes evolves during training, which we call the {\\em\nDimpled Manifold Model}. In particular, we demonstrate that training is divided\ninto two distinct phases. The first phase is a (typically fast) clinging\nprocess in which the initially randomly oriented decision boundary gets very\nclose to the low dimensional image manifold, which contains all the training\nexamples. Next, there is a (typically slow) dimpling phase which creates\nshallow bulges in the decision boundary that move it to the correct side of the\ntraining examples. This framework provides a simple explanation for why\nadversarial examples exist, why their perturbations have such tiny norms, and\nwhy they look like random noise rather than like the target class. This\nexplanation is also used to show that a network that was adversarially trained\nwith incorrectly labeled images might still correctly classify most test\nimages, and to show that the main effect of adversarial training is just to\ndeepen the generated dimples in the decision boundary. Finally, we discuss and\ndemonstrate the very different properties of on-manifold and off-manifold\nadversarial perturbations. We describe the results of numerous experiments\nwhich strongly support this new model, using both low dimensional synthetic\ndatasets and high dimensional natural datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 14:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 10:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Beginning from a first-principles\ncomponent-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate\ndescription of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer\niteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the\npredictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with\nthe depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from\nthe infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep\nnetworks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly\nanalyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a\nnearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models'\npredictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple\nand universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of\nrepresentation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals\nthrough the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical\nsolution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain\nhow RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks\nbuilt from different activation functions into universality classes.\nAltogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model\ncomplexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic\ntechniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network\nto be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to\npush this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail\nabout the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 15:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 17:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

It also presents comparative results on several publicly\navailable datasets, with insightful observations and inspiring future research\ndirections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 14:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 06:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

In this paper, we present a 3.5-THz,\nx6-harmonic, integrated Schottky diode mixer operating at room temperature. The\ndesigned frequency converter is based on a single-ended, planar Schottky diode\nwith a sub-micron anode contact area defined on a suspended 2-$\\mu$m ultra-thin\nGaAs substrate. The dc-grounded anode pad was combined with the radio frequency\nE-plane probe, which resulted in an electrically compact circuit. At 200 MHz\nintermediate frequency, a mixer conversion loss of about 59 dB is measured and\nresulting in a 40 dB signal-to-noise ratio for phase locking 3.5-THz\nquantum-cascade laser. Using a quasi-static diode model combined with\nelectromagnetic simulations, good agreement with the measured results was\nobtained. Harmonic frequency converters without the need of cryogenic cooling\nwill help in the realization of highly sensitive space and air-borne heterodyne\nreceivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 19:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 15:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

Pro-Social Rule Breaking as a Moral Enhancement\n  Approach for Ethical AI","comments":"15 pages, 2 figures, Accepted version for AI & SOCIETY - Special\n  Issue on AI for People","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.CY cs.AI","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"  We are moving towards a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) based\nagents make many decisions on behalf of humans. From healthcare decision making\nto social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with\nethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical\ncharacteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation\nin human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that\ntheir professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons.\nThis behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI\nagents more human centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that\nhelps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To\nunderstand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under\nwhich humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a\nstudy that introduces a 'vaccination strategy dilemma' to human participants\nand analyses their responses. In this dilemma, one needs to decide whether they\nwould distribute Covid-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow\nthe enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few\nsocial influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater\nbenefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship\nbetween stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which\nneither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the\npaper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB\nand the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm. We hope that this\nwill inform the design of future AI agents, and their decision-making\nbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 18:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 11:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}
