Since they are\nnot always available, they are typically substituted with software\nimplementations. A prominent condition relating these implementations to their\natomic specifications is linearizability, which preserves safety properties of\nthe programs using them. However linearizability does not preserve\nhyper-properties, which include probabilistic guarantees of randomized\nprograms: an adversary can greatly amplify the probability of a bad outcome.\nThis unwelcome behavior prevents modular reasoning, which is the key benefit\nprovided by the use of linearizable object implementations. A more restrictive\nproperty, strong linearizability, does preserve hyper-properties but it is\nimpossible to achieve in many situations.\n  This paper suggests a novel approach to blunting the adversary's additional\npower that works even in cases where strong linearizability is not achievable.\nWe show that a wide class of linearizable implementations, including well-known\nones for registers and snapshots, can be modified to approximate the\nprobabilistic guarantees of randomized programs when using atomic objects. The\ntechnical approach is to transform the algorithm of each method of an existing\nlinearizable implementation by repeating a carefully chosen prefix of the\nmethod several times and then randomly choosing which repetition to use\nsubsequently. We prove that the probability of a bad outcome decreases with the\nnumber of repetitions, approaching the probability attained when using atomic\nobjects.

The central question here is: how much\ndoes the explainability constraint increase the value of the cost function?\n  Given $d$-dimensional data points, we show an efficient algorithm that finds\nan explainable clustering whose $k$-means cost is at most $k^{1 -\n2/d}\\,\\mathrm{poly}(d\\log k)$ times the minimum cost achievable by a clustering\nwithout the explainability constraint, assuming $k,d\\ge 2$.

Three shortcomings of previous works on light\nspanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't be\napplied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always\nsub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal\nin the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into\naccount a wider range of involved parameters.\n  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified\nframework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the\nframework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light\nspanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced\nthan that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework\nis developed in two papers. The current paper is the first of the two -- it\nlays the basis of the unified framework and then applies it to design fast\nconstructions with optimal lightness for several graph classes.\n  Among various applications and implications of our framework, we highlight\nhere the following:\n  _ In low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, we present an $O(n\\log n)$-time\nconstruction of $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners with lightness and degree both bounded\nby constants in the algebraic computation tree (ACT). Our construction resolves\na major problem in the area of geometric spanners, which was open for three\ndecades.\n  _ In general graphs, for any $k \\geq 2$, we construct a\n$(2k-1)(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness $O(n^{1/k})$ in $O(m \\alpha(m,n))$\ntime. This result for light spanners in general weighted graphs is surprising,\nas it outperforms the analog one for sparse spanners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 21:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 19:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 20:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

The widespread usage of human classifiers to\nvisually assess whether galaxies are in merging systems remains a fundamental\ncomponent of many morphology studies. Studies that employ human classifiers\nusually construct a control sample, and rely on the assumption that the bias\nintroduced by using humans will be evenly applied to all samples. In this work,\nwe test this assumption and develop methods to correct for it. Using the\nstandard binomial statistical methods employed in many morphology studies, we\nfind that the merger fraction, error, and the significance of the difference\nbetween two samples are dependent on the intrinsic merger fraction of any given\nsample. We propose a method of quantifying merger biases of individual human\nclassifiers and incorporate these biases into a full probabilistic model to\ndetermine the merger fraction and the probability of an individual galaxy being\nin a merger.

Exactly zero resistivity is related to conservation laws\nthat prevent the current from degrading. In this paper, we carefully examine\nthe situations in which such a circumstance can occur. We find that exactly\nzero resistivity requires either continuous translation symmetry, or an\ninternal symmetry that has a certain kind of \"mixed anomaly\" with the electric\ncharge. (The symmetry could be a generalized global symmetry associated with\nthe emergence of unbreakable loop or higher dimensional excitations.) However,\neven if one of these is satisfied, we show that there is still a mechanism to\nget nonzero resistivity, through critical fluctuations that drive the\nsusceptibility of the conserved quantity to infinity; we call this mechanism\n\"critical drag\". Critical drag is thus a mechanism for resistivity that, unlike\nconventional mechanisms, is unrelated to broken symmetries. We furthermore\nargue that an emergent symmetry that has the appropriate mixed anomaly with\nelectric charge is in fact an inevitable consequence of compressibility in\nsystems with lattice translation symmetry. Critical drag therefore seems to be\nthe only way (other than through irrelevant perturbations breaking the emergent\nsymmetry, that disappear at the renormalization group fixed point) to get\nnonzero resistivity in such systems. Finally, we present a very simple and\nconcrete model -- the \"Quantum Lifshitz Model\" -- that illustrates the critical\ndrag mechanism as well as the other considerations of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 21:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 19:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

In this work, the connection between QAOA and\nadiabaticity is made explicit by inspecting the regime of $p$ large but finite.\nBy connecting QAOA to counterdiabatic (CD) evolution, we construct CD-QAOA\nangles which mimic a counterdiabatic schedule by matching Trotter \"error\" terms\nto approximate adiabatic gauge potentials which suppress diabatic excitations\narising from finite ramp speed. In our construction, these \"error\" terms are\nhelpful, not detrimental, to QAOA.

However, one of the active research challenge\nstill remains to sustain manipulation capabilities in situation of a mechanical\nfailure. Ideally, like biological creatures, a robotic agent should be able to\nreconfigure its control policy by adapting to dynamic adversaries. In this\npaper, we propose a method that allows an agent to survive in a situation of\nmechanical loss, and adaptively learn manipulation with compromised degrees of\nfreedom -- we call our method Survivable Robotic Learning (SRL). Our key idea\nis to leverage Bayesian policy gradient by encoding knowledge bias in posterior\nestimation, which in turn alleviates future policy search explorations, in\nterms of sample efficiency and when compared to random exploration based policy\nsearch methods. SRL represents policy priors as Gaussian process, which allows\ntractable computation of approximate posterior (when true gradient is\nintractable), by incorporating guided bias as proxy from prior replays. We\nevaluate our proposed method against off-the-shelf model free learning\nalgorithm (DDPG), testing on a hexapod robot platform which encounters\nincremental failure emulation, and our experiments show that our method\nimproves largely in terms of sample requirement and quantitative success ratio\nin all failure modes.

So far auditory models\nhave often focused on either monaural or binaural experiments in isolation.\nAlthough binaural models typically build upon stages of (existing) monaural\nmodels, only a few attempts have been made to extend a monaural model by a\nbinaural stage using a unified decision stage for monaural and binaural cues.\nIn such approaches, a typical prototype of binaural processing has been the\nclassical equalization-cancelation mechanism, which either involves\nsignal-adaptive delays and provides a single channel output or can be\nimplemented with tapped delays providing a high-dimensional multichannel\noutput. This contribution extends the (monaural) generalized envelope power\nspectrum model by a non-adaptive binaural stage with only a few, fixed output\nchannels. The binaural stage resembles features of physiologically motivated\nhemispheric binaural processing, as simplified signal processing stages,\nyielding a 5-channel monaural and binaural matrix feature \"decoder\" (BMFD). The\nback end of the existing monaural model is applied to the 5-channel BMFD output\nand calculates short-time envelope power and power features.

However,\nobservations by the Kepler mission show that the oscillation amplitudes\nincrease dramatically as stars ascend the red giant branch. The importance of\nnonlinear effects should therefore be assessed. In previous work, we found that\nmixed modes in red giants are unstable to nonlinear three-wave interactions\nover a broad range of stellar mass and evolutionary state. Here we solve the\namplitude equations that describe the mode dynamics for large networks of\nnonlinearly coupled modes. The networks consist of stochastically driven parent\nmodes coupled to resonant secondary modes (daughters, granddaughters, etc.). We\nfind that nonlinear interactions can lower the energy of gravity-dominated\nmixed modes by $\\gtrsim 80\\%$ compared to linear theory. However, they have\nonly a mild influence on the energy of pressure-dominated mixed modes.\nExpressed in terms of the dipole mode visibility $V^2$, i.e., the summed\namplitudes of dipole modes relative to radial modes, we find that $V^2$ can be\nsuppressed by $50-80\\%$ relative to the linear value for highly-evolved red\ngiants whose frequency of maximum power $\\nu_{\\rm max} \\lesssim\n100\\,\\mu\\textrm{Hz}$. However, for less evolved red giants with $150\\lesssim\n\\nu_{\\rm max} \\lesssim 200\\,\\mu\\textrm{Hz}$, $V^2$ is suppressed by only\n$10-20\\%$. We conclude that resonant mode coupling can have a potentially\ndetectable effect on oscillations at $\\nu_{\\rm max} \\lesssim\n100\\,\\mu\\textrm{Hz}$ but it cannot account for the population of red giants\nthat exhibit dipole modes with unusually small amplitudes at high $\\nu_{\\rm\nmax}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 18:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Our results put forward\nquantum dot arrays as a platform for engineering non-Hermitian many-body\ntopological modes, and highlight the resilience of non-Hermitian topology to\nelectronic interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 19:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

The\ncombination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has gained\nincreased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from\nsingle-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is\ninherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on multiple players'\njoint actions and (b) the computational complexity increases. We present the\nmost common multiagent problem representations and their main challenges, and\nidentify five research areas that address one or more of these challenges:\ncentralised training and decentralised execution, opponent modelling,\ncommunication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping. We find that many\ncomputational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are not generalisable\nto other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of dimensionality or\nnonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology capture promising\nrelevant behaviours, such as communication and coordination, to help agents\nachieve better performance in multiagent settings.

We\nfocus on Germany and the appearance of the new right wing party \"Alternative\nfor Germany\" (AfD). Many scholars of politics discuss the rise of the new\npopulism in Western Europe and the US with respect to a new political cleavage\nrelated to globalization, which is assumed to mainly affect the cultural\ndimension of the political space. As such, it might replace the older economic\ncleavage based on class divisions in defining the dominant dimension of\npolitical conflict. An explanation along these lines suggests a reconfiguration\nof the political space in the sense that (1) the main cleavage within the\npolitical space changes its direction from the economic axis towards the\ncultural axis, but (2) also the semantics of the cultural axis itself is\nchanging towards globalization related topics. Using the electoral manifestos\nfrom the Manifesto project database, we empirically address this\nreconfiguration of the political space by comparing political spaces for\nGermany built using topic modeling with the spaces based on the content\nanalysis of the Manifesto project and the corresponding categories of political\ngoals. We find that both spaces have a similar structure and that the AfD\nappears on a new dimension. In order to characterize this new dimension we\nemploy a novel technique, inter-issue consistency networks (IICN) that allow to\nanalyze the evolution of the correlations between the political positions on\ndifferent issues over several elections. We find that the new dimension\nintroduced by the AfD can be related to the split off of a new \"cultural right\"\nissue bundle from the previously existing center-right bundle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 20:43:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 17:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Grandoni and Vassilevska Williams [FOCS 2012, TALG 2020]\ngave an algebraic, randomized $\\widetilde{O}(Mn^\\omega)$ time SSRP algorithm\nfor graphs with integer edge weights in the range $[1,M]$, where $\\omega<2.373$\nis the matrix multiplication exponent. We derandomize both algorithms for\nundirected graphs in the same asymptotic running time and apply our compression\nto obtain deterministic Single-Source DSOs. The $\\widetilde{O}(m\\sqrt{n}+n^2)$\nand $\\widetilde{O}(Mn^\\omega)$ preprocessing times are polynomial improvements\nover previous $o(n^2)$-space oracles.\n  On sparse graphs with $m=O(n^{5/4-\\varepsilon}/M^{7/4})$ edges, for any\nconstant $\\varepsilon > 0$, we reduce the preprocessing to randomized\n$\\widetilde{O}(M^{7/8}m^{1/2}n^{11/8})=O(n^{2-\\varepsilon/2})$ time. This is\nthe first truly subquadratic time algorithm for building Single-Source DSOs on\nsparse graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 21:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

The SR-Cox regression approximates the\nshape-restricted functions using a spline basis expansion with data driven\nchoice of knots. The underlying minimization of negative log-likelihood\nfunction is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which is solved with\nan active-set optimization algorithm.

However, this object has entered a quite anomalous\nevent in 2021, which at first appeared to be standstill, i.e., an almost\nconstant luminosity state, observed in Z Cam-type dwarf novae. This unexpected\nevent gives us a great opportunity to reconsider the nature of standstill in\ncataclysmic variables. We have observed this anomalous event and its\nforerunner, a gradual and simultaneous increase in the optical and X-ray flux\nduring quiescence, through many optical telescopes and the X-ray telescopes\nNICER and NuSTAR. We have not found any amplification of the orbital hump\nduring quiescence before the anomalous event, which suggests that the mass\ntransfer rate did not significantly fluctuate on average. The estimated X-ray\nflux was not enough to explain the increment of the optical flux during\nquiescence via X-ray irradiation of the disk and the secondary star. It would\nbe natural to consider that viscosity in the quiescent disk was enhanced before\nthe anomalous event, which increased mass accretion rates in the disk and\nraised not only the optical flux but also the X-ray flux. We suggest that\nenhanced viscosity also triggered the standstill-like phenomenon in SS Cyg,\nwhich is considered to be a series of small outbursts. The inner part of the\ndisk would always stay in the outburst state and only its outer part would be\nunstable against the thermal-viscous instability during this phenomenon, which\nis consistent with the observed optical color variations. This scenario is in\nline with our X-ray spectral analyses which imply that the X-ray emitting inner\naccretion flow became hotter than usual and vertically expanded and that it\nbecame denser and was cooled down after the onset of the standstill-like state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Typically, in\nthe VQAs, a parametrized ansatz circuit is used to generate a trial wave\nfunction, and the parameters are optimized to minimize a cost function. On the\nother hand, blind quantum computing (BQC) has been studied in order to provide\nthe quantum algorithm with security by using cloud networks. A client with a\nlimited ability to perform quantum operations hopes to have access to a quantum\ncomputer of a server, and BQC allows the client to use the server's computer\nwithout leakage of the client's information (such as input, running quantum\nalgorithms, and output) to the server. However, BQC is designed for\nfault-tolerant quantum computing, and this requires many ancillary qubits,\nwhich may not be suitable for NISQ devices. Here, we propose an efficient way\nto implement the NISQ computing with guaranteed security for the client. In our\narchitecture, only N+ 1 qubits are required, under an assumption that the form\nof ansatzes is known to the server, where N denotes the necessary number of the\nqubits in the original NISQ algorithms. The client only performs single-qubit\nmeasurements on an ancillary qubit sent from the server, and the measurement\nangles can specify the parameters for the ansatzes of the NISQ algorithms.\nNo-signaling principle guarantees that neither parameters chosen by the client\nnor the outputs of the algorithm are leaked to the server.

However, when\ntested on attacks different from the given attack simulated in training, the\nrobustness may drop significantly (e.g., even worse than no reweighting). In\nthis paper, we study this problem and propose our solution--locally reweighted\nadversarial training (LRAT). The rationale behind IRAT is that we do not need\nto pay much attention to an instance that is already safe under the attack. We\nargue that the safeness should be attack-dependent, so that for the same\ninstance, its weight can change given different attacks based on the same\nmodel. Thus, if the attack simulated in training is mis-specified, the weights\nof IRAT are misleading. To this end, LRAT pairs each instance with its\nadversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while\nperforming no global reweighting--the rationale is to fit the instance itself\nif it is immune to the attack, but not to skip the pair, in order to passively\ndefend different attacks in future. Experiments show that LRAT works better\nthan both IRAT (i.e., global reweighting) and the standard AT (i.e., no\nreweighting) when trained with an attack and tested on different attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 02:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

One is based\non noise injection, and the other is to adopt the generative model Variational\nAuto-encoder (VAE).

Second, the VAE based models are\nnot expressive enough to capture the true preference since VAE often yields an\nembedding space of a single modal, while in real world, user-item interactions\nusually exhibit multi-modality on user preference distribution. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel model called Dual Adversarial Variational Embedding (DAVE)\nfor robust recommendation, which can provide personalized noise reduction for\ndifferent users and items, and capture the multi-modality of the embedding\nspace, by combining the advantages of VAE and adversarial training between the\nintroduced auxiliary discriminators and the variational inference networks.

However, without high-resolution spectroscopy, the spectra of outburst\ncandidates can be confused with the late-type stars since they have similar\nspectral features. For the protostar IRAS 16316-1540, the near-IR spectrum has\nline equivalent widths that are consistent with M-dwarf photospheres. However,\nour high-resolution IGRINS spectra reveal that the absorption lines have boxy\nand/or double-peaked profiles, as expected from a disk and not the star.

Here, we demonstrate how simply adding a set of edges,\nwhich we call a \\emph{proposal set}, to the graph as a pre-processing step can\nimprove the performance of several link prediction algorithms. The underlying\nidea is that if the edges in the proposal set generally align with the\nstructure of the graph, link prediction algorithms are further guided towards\npredicting the right edges; in other words, adding a proposal set of edges is a\nsignal-boosting pre-processing step.

The Wandzura-Wilczek (WW) relation and the\nBurkhardt-Cottingham (BC) sum rule are such examples for the polarized\nstructure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$. Recently, new twist-3 and twist-4 parton\ndistribution functions were proposed for spin-1 hadrons, so that it became\npossible to investigate spin-1 structure functions including higher-twist ones.\nWe show in this work that an analogous twist-2 relation and a sum rule exist\nfor the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions $f_{1LL}$ and $f_{LT}$,\nwhere $f_{1LL}$ is a twist-2 function and $f_{LT}$ is a twist-3 one.

If the parton-model sum rule for $f_{1LL}$ ($b_1$) is applied by\nassuming vanishing tensor-polarized antiquark distributions, another sum rule\nalso exists for $f_{LT}$ itself. These relations should be valuable for\nstudying tensor-polarized distribution functions of spin-1 hadrons and for\nseparating twist-2 components from higher-twist terms, as the WW relation and\nBC sum rule have been used for investigating $x$ dependence and higher-twist\neffects in $g_2$.

The absorption is enhanced by the (i) broadband\nangle and polarization-independent reflectivity in the 3D photonic band gap,\nand (ii) the excitation of many guided modes in the film by the crystal's\nsurface diffraction leading to enhanced path lengths. At $L_{Si} = 80$ nm, the\nphotonic crystal back reflector yields a striking average absorption\nenhancement of $9.15$x, much more than $0.83$x for a perfect metal, which is\ndue to a remarkable guided mode confined within the combined thickness of the\nthin film and the photonic crystal's Bragg attenuation length. The broad\nbandwidth of the 3D photonic band gap leads to the back reflector's Bragg\nattenuation length being much shorter than the silicon absorption length.\nConsequently, light is confined inside the thin film and the absorption\nenhancements are not due to the additional thickness of the photonic crystal\nback reflector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 11:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

To exploit this property,\nthe early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of\ntraining, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early\nstopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be\nconsidered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter\nlayers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former\ncounterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the\nwhole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each\nother, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to\nseparate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address\nthis problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at\nonce, we initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a\nrelatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the\nlatter DNN layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers\nfixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as\nprogressive early stopping (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the\nearly stopping, PES can help to obtain more promising and stable results.\nFurthermore, by combining PES with existing approaches on noisy label training,\nwe achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 01:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

We show how\nNRES-Oriented RL (neoRL) agents are possible before verifying our theoretical\nfindings by experiments. Ultimately, neoRL agents are capable of behavior\nsynthesis across state spaces -- allowing for decomposition of the problem into\nsmaller spaces, alleviating the curse of dimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

We improve the fast\niterative method for Eikonal equation in two novel ways, in the value update\nand in the error correction. The new value update is very similar to the fast\niterative method in that we selectively update the points, chosen by a\nconvergence measure, in the active list. However, in order to reduce running\ntime, the improved algorithm does not run a convergence check of the\nneighboring points of the narrow band as the fast iterative method usually\ndoes. The additional error correction step is to correct the errors that the\nprevious value update step may cause. The error correction step consists of\nfinding and recalculating the point values in a separate remedy list which is\nquite easy to implement on a GPU. In contrast to the fast marching method and\nthe fast sweeping method for the Eikonal equation, our improved method does not\nneed to compute the solution with any special ordering in neither the remedy\nlist nor the active list. Therefore, our algorithm can be implemented in\nparallel. In our experiments, we implemente our new algorithm in parallel on a\nGPU and compare the elapsed time with other current algorithms.

Such simplifications are desired for interactive,\nreal-time virtual acoustic environments with applications in hearing research\nand for the evaluation of hearing supportive devices. In this context, the\nnumber and spatial arrangement of loudspeakers used for playback additionally\naffect spatial resolution. The current study assessed the minimum number of\nspatially evenly distributed virtual late reverberation sources required to\nperceptually approximate spatially highly resolved isotropic and anisotropic\nlate reverberation and to technically approximate a spherically isotropic\ndiffuse sound field. The spatial resolution of the rendering was systematically\nreduced by using subsets of the loudspeakers of an 86-channel spherical\nloudspeaker array in an anechoic chamber.

Such solutions have also\nbeen considered as a crucial approach to aim at SAE Level 5 systems, where the\npassengers in such vehicles do not have to interact with the system at all\nanymore. Already in 2016, Nvidia demonstrated a complete end-to-end approach\nfor training the complete software stack covering perception, planning and\ndecision making, and the actual vehicle control. While such approaches show the\ngreat potential of such ML-enabled systems, there have also been demonstrations\nwhere already changes to single pixels in a video frame can potentially lead to\ncompletely different decisions with dangerous consequences. In this paper, a\nstructured analysis has been conducted to explore video degradation effects on\nthe performance of an ML-enabled pedestrian detector. Firstly, a baseline of\napplying YOLO to 1,026 frames with pedestrian annotations in the KITTI Vision\nBenchmark Suite has been established. Next, video degradation candidates for\neach of these frames were generated using the leading video codecs libx264,\nlibx265, Nvidia HEVC, and AV1: 52 frames for the various compression presets\nfor color and gray-scale frames resulting in 104 degradation candidates per\noriginal KITTI frame and 426,816 images in total. YOLO was applied to each\nimage to compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric to compare the\nperformance with the original baseline. While aggressively lossy compression\nsettings result in significant performance drops as expected, it was also\nobserved that some configurations actually result in slightly better IoU\nresults compared to the baseline. The findings show that carefully chosen lossy\nvideo configurations preserve a decent performance of particular ML-enabled\nsystems while allowing for substantial savings when storing or transmitting\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

This\ncutting-edge technology enables individuals to track and control their\nintegrated environment in real-time and remotely via a thousand IoT devices\ncomprised of sensors and actuators that actively participate in sensing,\nprocessing, storing, and sharing information. Nonetheless, IoT devices are\nfrequently deployed in hostile environments, wherein adversaries attempt to\ncapture and breach them in order to seize control of the entire network. One\nsuch example of potentially malicious behaviour is the cloning of IoT devices,\nin which an attacker can physically capture the devices, obtain some sensitive\ninformation, duplicate the devices, and intelligently deploy them in desired\nlocations to conduct various insider attacks. A device cloning attack on IoT\nnetworks is a significant security concern since it allows for selective\nforwarding, sink-hole, and black-hole attacks. To address this issue, this\npaper provides an efficient scheme for detecting clone node attacks on IoT\nnetworks that makes use of semantic information about IoT devices known as\ncontext information sensed from the deployed environment to locate them\nsecurely. We design a location proof mechanism by combining location proofs and\nbatch verification of the extended elliptic curve digital signature technique\nto accelerate the verification process at selected trusted nodes. We\ndemonstrate the security of our scheme and its resilience to secure clone node\nattack detection by conducting a comprehensive security analysis. The\nperformance of our proposed scheme provides a high degree of detection accuracy\nwith minimal detection time and significantly reduces the computation,\ncommunication and storage overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

This was attributed to the\ntransit of a ring system filling a large fraction of the Hill sphere of an\nunseen substellar companion. Subsequent photometric monitoring has not found\nany other deep transits from this candidate ring system, but if there are more\nsubstellar companions and they are coplanar with the potential ring system,\nthere is a chance that they will transit the star as well. This young star is\nactive and the light curves show a 5% modulation in amplitude with a dominant\nrotation period of 3.2 days due to star spots rotating in and out of view. We\nmodel and remove the rotational modulation of the J1407 light curve and search\nfor additional transit signatures of substellar companions orbiting around\nJ1407. We combine the photometry of J1407 from several observatories, spanning\na 19 year baseline. We remove the rotational modulation by modeling the\nvariability as a periodic signal, whose periodicity changes slowly with time\nover several years due to the activity cycle of the star. A Transit Least\nSquares (TLS) analysis searches for any periodic transiting signals within the\ncleaned light curve. We identify an activity cycle of J1407 with a period of\n5.4 years. A Transit Least Squares search does not find any plausible periodic\neclipses in the light curve, from 1.2% amplitude at 5 days up to 1.9% at 20\ndays. This sensitivity is confirmed by injecting artificial transits into the\nlight curve and determining the recovery fraction as a function of transit\ndepth and orbital period. J1407 is confirmed as a young active star with an\nactivity cycle consistent with a rapidly rotating solar mass star. With the\nrotational modulation removed, the TLS analysis rules out transiting companions\nwith radii larger than about 1 Jupiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Successfully deploying federated learning requires ensuring\nthat agents (e.g., mobile devices) faithfully execute the intended algorithm,\nwhich has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this study, we first\nuse risk bounds to analyze how the key feature of federated learning,\nunbalanced and non-i.i.d. data, affects agents' incentives to voluntarily\nparticipate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms. To\nbe more specific, our analysis reveals that agents with less typical data\ndistributions and relatively more samples are more likely to opt out of or\ntamper with federated learning algorithms. To this end, we formulate the first\nfaithful implementation problem of federated learning and design two faithful\nfederated learning mechanisms which satisfy economic properties, scalability,\nand privacy. Further, the time complexity of computing all agents' payments in\nthe number of agents is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. First, we design a Faithful Federated\nLearning (FFL) mechanism which approximates the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)\npayments via an incremental computation.

Studies on\ncaste-based digital inequality are still scanty in India. Using nationally\nrepresentative survey data, this paper analyzes the first-level digital divide\n(ownership of computer and access to the internet) and the second-level digital\ndivide (individual's skill to use computer and the internet) between the\ndisadvantaged caste group and the others. Further, this paper identifies the\ncaste group-based differences in socioeconomic factors that contribute to the\ndigital divide between these groups using a non-linear decomposition method.\nThe results show that there exists a large first-level and second-level digital\ndivide between the disadvantaged caste groups and others in India. The\nnon-linear decomposition results indicate that the caste-based digital divide\nin India is rooted in historical socioeconomic deprivation of disadvantaged\ncaste groups. More than half of the caste-based digital gap is attributable to\ndifferences in educational attainment and income between the disadvantaged\ncaste groups and others. The findings of this study highlight the urgent need\nfor addressing educational and income inequality between the different caste\ngroups in India in order to bridge the digital divide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved,\nwhere positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their\nreliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest,\nthat are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a\nlack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply\ntreat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during\nnetwork training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this\nwork, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the\ntraining of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem.\nSpecifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take\ninto account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative\nsamples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples\nof which the labels are unknown.

It permits on-chain interactions to\nachieve trustworthy properties such as traceability, transparency, and\naccountability. However, current blockchain trustworthiness is only confined to\non-chain, creating a \"trust gap\" to the physical, off-chain environment. This\nis due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world\nin a real-time and consistent manner. Such an absence hinders further\nreal-world blockchain applications, especially for security-sensitive ones.\n  In this paper, we propose a scheme to extend blockchain trust from on-chain\nto off-chain, and take trustworthy vaccine transportation as an example.

We carry out an experiment to record the internal\nstatus of a vaccine shipping box during transportation, and the results\nindicate that the proposed system incurs an average latency of 84 ms in local\nsensing and processing followed by an average latency of 130 ms to have the\nsensed data transmitted to and available in the blockchain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 15:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

It is shown that the\npolarization relations between fluctuations of wave parameters (velocity,\ndensity, temperature, and pressure) for freely propagating waves, as well as\nevanescent wave modes, differ significantly, which makes it possible to\nidentify different types of atmospheric waves in experimental data. A\ndiagnostic diagram is proposed, with the help of which, from the phase shifts\nof the observed parameters, it is possible to determine the type of wave, as\nwell as the direction of its movement relative to the vertical. Using phase\nshifts between fluctuations of the velocity and thermodynamic parameters of the\natmosphere, not only the type of the wave, but also its spectral\ncharacteristics can be determined. The verification of the proposed method for\nidentification of polar wave disturbances in measurements from the low-orbit\nsatellite Dynamics Explorer 2 was carried out. The verification showed that the\npolarization relations of AGW in the thermosphere mainly correspond to the\ngravity branch of acoustic-gravity waves freely propagating in the direction\nfrom bottom to top.

In this paper, we view the task of instance segmentation from a\ncompletely new perspective by introducing the notion of \"instance categories\",\nwhich assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the\ninstance's location. With this notion, we propose segmenting objects by\nlocations (SOLO), a simple, direct, and fast framework for instance\nsegmentation with strong performance.

Besides instance segmentation,\nour method yields state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask\nbyproduct) and panoptic segmentation.

Based on Retinex\nTheory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into\nreflectance and illumination and remove noise in the reflectance during the\ndecomposition phase. We propose a Noise and Color Bias Control module (NCBC\nModule) that contains a convolutional neural network and two loss functions\n(noise loss and color loss). This module is only used to calculate the loss\nfunctions during the training phase, so our method is very fast during the test\nphase. This module can smooth the reflectance to achieve the purpose of noise\nremoval while preserving details and edge information and controlling color\nbias. We propose a network that can be trained to learn the mapping between\nlow-light and normal-light illumination and enhance the brightness of images\ntaken in low-light illumination. We train and evaluate the performance of our\nproposed model over the real-world Low-Light (LOL) dataset), and we also test\nour model over several other frequently used datasets (LIME, DICM and MEF\ndatasets). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach\nachieves a promising effect with good rubustness and generalization and\noutperforms many other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Our method achieves high speed because we use loss functions\ninstead of introducing additional denoisers for noise removal and color\ncorrection.

In a network creation game with n selfish vertex\nagents, each vertex can build undirected edges incident to a subset of the\nother vertices. The goal of every agent is to minimize its creation cost plus\nits usage cost, where the creation cost is the unit edge cost $\\alpha$ times\nthe number of edges it builds, and the usage cost is the sum of distances to\nall other agents in the resulting network. The max-distance network creation\ngame, introduced and studied by Demaine et al., is a key variant of the\noriginal game, where the usage cost takes into account the maximum distance\ninstead.

We find a decrease\nin mobility upon optically depositing energy into the carriers, which is\ntypical of band-transport.

The impact of salts\nconcentrations, reaction time, as well as organic additives was systematically\nresearched to achieve controllable and reliable design of CaCO3 particles.

This distribution function is initially\nstable with respect to kinetic instabilities. Expansion drives the solar wind\ninto successive regimes where whistler heat flux instabilities are triggered.\nThese instabilities produce sunward whistler waves initially characterized by\npredominantly oblique propagation with respect to the interplanetary magnetic\nfield. The excited waves interact with the electrons via resonant scattering\nprocesses. As a consequence, the strahl pitch angle distribution broadens and\nits drift velocity reduces. Strahl electrons are scattered in the direction\nperpendicular to the magnetic field, and an electron halo is formed. At a later\nstage, resonant electron firehose instability is triggered and further affects\nthe electron temperature anisotropy as the solar wind expands. Wave-particle\ninteraction processes are accompanied by a substantial reduction of the solar\nwind heat flux. The simulated whistler waves are in qualitative agreement with\nobservations in terms of wave frequencies, amplitudes and propagation angles.\nOur work proposes an explanation for the observations of oblique and parallel\nwhistler waves in the solar wind.

Aside\nfrom developing methods that allow to model and account for the deterministic\nand stochastic components that contribute to the measurement errors of these\ndevices, an approach that has been put forward in recent years is to make use\nof arrays of such sensors in order to combine their measurements thereby\nreducing the impact of individual sensor noise. Nevertheless combining these\nmeasurements is not straightforward given the complex stochastic nature of\nthese errors and, although some solutions have been suggested, these are\nlimited to certain specific settings which do not allow to achieve solutions in\nmore general and common circumstances. Hence, in this work we put forward a\nnon-parametric method that makes use of the wavelet cross-covariance at\ndifferent scales to combine the measurements coming from an array of gyroscopes\nin order to deliver an optimal measurement signal without needing any\nassumption on the processes underlying the individual error signals.

Here, we focus on EPEs over the Mediterranean, a region that is\nfrequently affected by such hazards. Previous work identified strong\nconnections between localized EPEs and large-scale atmospheric flow patterns,\naffecting the weather over the entire Mediterranean. We analyze the predictive\nskill of these patterns in the ECMWF extended-range forecasts and assess if and\nwhere these patterns can be used for indirect predictions of EPEs, using the\nBrier Skill Score. The results show that the ECMWF model provides skillful\npredictions of the Mediterranean patterns up to 2 weeks in advance. Moreover,\nusing the forecasted patterns for indirect predictability of EPEs outperforms\nthe reference score up to about 10 days lead time for many locations.\nEspecially for high orography locations or coastal areas, like parts of western\nTurkey, western Balkans, Iberian Peninsula and Morocco this limit extends from\n11 to 14 days lead time. This study demonstrates that connections between\nlocalized EPEs and large-scale patterns over the Mediterranean extend the\nforecasting horizon of the model by over 3 days in many locations, in\ncomparison to forecasting based on the predicted precipitation. Thus, it is\nbeneficial to use the predicted patterns rather than the predicted\nprecipitation at longer lead times for EPEs forecasting. The model's\nperformance is also assessed from a user perspective, showing that the EPEs\nforecasting based on the patterns increases the economic benefits at medium and\nextended range lead times.

While traditional tracking approaches can deal with missing\nobservations, most of their deep counterparts are, by default, not suited for\nthis.\n  Towards this end, this paper introduces a transformer-based approach for\nhandling missing observations in variable input length trajectory data.

To enforce their widespread use, both the technical\ndevelopment and the security of users shall be guaranteed. Privacy of users\nrepresents one of the possible threats impairing EVs adoption. In particular,\nrecent works showed the feasibility of identifying EVs based on the current\nexchanged during the charging phase. In fact, while the resource negotiation\nphase runs over secure communication protocols, the signal exchanged during the\nactual charging contains features peculiar to each EV. A suitable feature\nextractor can hence associate such features to each EV, in what is commonly\nknown as profiling. In this paper, we propose EVScout2.0, an extended and\nimproved version of our previously proposed framework to profile EVs based on\ntheir charging behavior. By exploiting the current and pilot signals exchanged\nduring the charging phase, our scheme is able to extract features peculiar for\neach EV, allowing hence for their profiling.

In this paper, we build a benchmark composed of\nlarge-scale spatiotemporal crowd flow data, contextual data, and\nstate-of-the-art spatiotemporal prediction models.

Workload-balancing and parallel-reduction\nare widely-used design principles for efficient SpMV. However, prior work fails\nto resolve how to implement and adaptively use the two principles for SpMV/MM.\nTo overcome this obstacle, we first complete the implementation space with\noptimizations by filling three missing pieces in prior work, including: (1) We\nshow that workload-balancing and parallel-reduction can be combined through a\nsegment-reduction algorithm implemented with SIMD-shuffle primitives. (2) We\nshow that parallel-reduction can be implemented in SpMM through loading the\ndense-matrix rows with vector memory operations. (3) We show that vectorized\nloading of sparse rows, being a part of the benefit of parallel-reduction, can\nco-exist with sequential-reduction in SpMM through temporally caching\nsparse-matrix elements in the shared memory. In terms of adaptive use, we\nanalyze how the benefit of two principles change with two characteristics from\nthe input data space: the diverse sparsity pattern and dense-matrix width. We\nfind the benefit of the two principles fades along with the increased total\nworkload, i.e. the increased dense-matrix width. We also identify, for SpMV and\nSpMM, different sparse-matrix features that impact workload-balancing\neffectiveness. Our design consistently exceeds cuSPARSE by 1.07-1.57x on\ndifferent GPUs and dense matrix width, and the kernel selection rules involve\n5-12% performance loss compared with optimal choices.

Research\nin this topic has primarily concentrated on finding the seed configuration\nwhich infects the most individuals. Although these optimal configurations give\ninsight into how the initial state affects the outcome of an epidemic, they are\nunlikely to occur in real life. In this paper we identify two important seeding\nscenarios, both motivated by historical data, that reveal a new complex\nphenomenon. In one scenario, the seeds are concentrated on the central nodes of\na network, while in the second, they are spread uniformly in the population.\nComparing the final size of the epidemic started from these two initial\nconditions through data-driven and synthetic simulations on real and modelled\ngeometric metapopulation networks, we find evidence for a switchover\nphenomenon: When the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to its critical\nvalue, more individuals become infected in the first seeding scenario, but for\nlarger values of $R_0$, the second scenario is more dangerous. We find that the\nswitchover phenomenon is amplified by the geometric nature of the underlying\nnetwork, and confirm our results via mathematically rigorous proofs, by mapping\nthe network epidemic processes to bond percolation. Our results expand on the\nprevious finding that in case of a single seed, the first scenario is always\nmore dangerous, and further our understanding why the sizes of consecutive\nwaves can differ even if their epidemic characters are similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 13:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

First and foremost, 3D engines can well\nsimulate motion factors such as camera movement, camera view and object\nmovement, so that the simulated videos can provide association modules with\neffective motion features.

Discretization of such geometries and\nsolution of the contact problem on the internal interfaces can be\ncomputationally challenging. We employ an unfitted Finite Element (FE)\nframework for the discretization of the domains and develop a tailored,\nglobally convergent, and efficient multigrid method for solving contact\nproblems on the internal interfaces. In the unfitted FE methods, structured\nbackground meshes are used and only the underlying finite element space has to\nbe modified to incorporate the discontinuities. The non-penetration conditions\non the embedded interfaces of the domains are discretized using the method of\nLagrange multipliers. We reformulate the arising variational inequality problem\nas a quadratic minimization problem with linear inequality constraints. Our\nmultigrid method can solve such problems by employing a tailored multilevel\nhierarchy of the FE spaces and a novel approach for tackling the discretized\nnon-penetration conditions. We employ pseudo-$L^2$ projection-based transfer\noperators to construct a hierarchy of nested FE spaces from the hierarchy of\nnon-nested meshes. The essential component of our multigrid method is a\ntechnique that decouples the linear constraints using an orthogonal\ntransformation of the basis. The decoupled constraints are handled by a\nmodified variant of the projected Gauss-Seidel method, which we employ as a\nsmoother in the multigrid method.

Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust\nperception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across\nvarious lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we\npropose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.\nThe underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural\nnetwork using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation\nmasks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as\noutput. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo\nsub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection,\nunknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and\nsignificantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor.\nBy inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can\nbe used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and\nhard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments.\nIn unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D\nnetwork and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects.\nHowever, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent)\nobjects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust\nmanipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 15:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Observations have shown that this relation has a large\nscatter which can not be explained by observational errors only. That scatter\nis hence attributed to the effects of radial migration in which stars tracing\ndifferent chemical evolution histories in the disk get mixed. However, the\nrecent study of Nissen et al. 2020, using high precision observational data of\nsolar type stars, found two relatively tight age-metallicity relations. One\nsequence of older and metal-richer stars probably traces the chemical\nenrichment history of the inner disk while the other sequence of younger and\nmetal-poorer stars the chemical enrichment history of the outer disk. If\nuncertainties in age measurements increase, these sequences mix explaining the\nscatter of the one relation observed in other studies. This work follows up on\nthese results, by analysing an independent sample of red clump giants observed\nby APOGEE. Since ages for red giants are significantly more uncertain, the\n[C/N] ratios are considered as a proxy for age. This larger dataset is used to\ninvestigate these relations at different Galactic radii, finding that these\ndistinct sequences exist only in the solar neighbourhood. The APOGEE dataset is\nfurther used to explore different abundance and kinematical planes to shed\nlight on the nature of these populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 15:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Existing methods mainly focus on fully\nsupervised setting with temporal boundary labels for training, which, however,\nsuffers expensive cost of annotation. In this work, we are dedicated to weakly\nsupervised TLG, where multiple description sentences are given to an untrimmed\nvideo without temporal boundary labels. In this task, it is critical to learn a\nstrong cross-modal semantic alignment between sentence semantics and visual\ncontent. To this end, we introduce a novel weakly supervised temporal adjacent\nnetwork (WSTAN) for temporal language grounding. Specifically, WSTAN learns\ncross-modal semantic alignment by exploiting temporal adjacent network in a\nmultiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm, with a whole description paragraph\nas input. Moreover, we integrate a complementary branch into the framework,\nwhich explicitly refines the predictions with pseudo supervision from the MIL\nstage. An additional self-discriminating loss is devised on both the MIL branch\nand the complementary branch, aiming to enhance semantic discrimination by\nself-supervising.

The strength of the signal is related to the equation of state of\nneutron star matter and it increases with the stiffness of the latter. The\nrecent results obtained by NICER from the analyses of PSR J0740+6620 suggest a\nrather stiff equation of state and the expected kilonova signal is therefore\nstrong, at least if the mass of the Black Hole does not exceed $\\sim 10\n\\mathrm{\\,M}_\\odot$ and if the adimensional spin parameter is not too small and\nthe orbit is prograde. We compare the predictions obtained by considering\nequations of state of neutron star matter satisfying the most recent\nobservations and assuming that only one family of compact stars exists with the\nresults predicted in the two-families scenario. In the latter a soft hadronic\nequation of state produces very compact stellar objects while a rather stiff\nquark matter equation of state produces massive strange quark stars, satisfying\nNICER results. The expected kilonova signal in the two-families scenario is\nvery weak: in particular the Hadronic Star - Black Hole merger produces a much\nweaker signal than in the one-family scenario because the hadronic equation of\nstate is very soft. Moreover, according to the only existing simulation, the\nStrange Quark Star - Black Hole merger does not produce a kilonova signal\nbecause the amount of mass ejected is negligible.

In the interest of computational\nefficiency, the acoustic simulation of the late reverberation can be simplified\nby using a limited number of spatially distributed virtual reverb sources (VRS)\neach radiating incoherent signals. A sufficient number of VRS is needed to\napproximate spatially anisotropic late reverberation, e.g., in a room with\ninhomogeneous distribution of absorption at the boundaries. Here, a highly\nefficient and perceptually plausible method to generate and spatially render\nlate reverberation is suggested, extending the room acoustics simulator RAZR\n[Wendt et al., J.

The room dimensions and\nfrequency-dependent absorption coefficients at the wall boundaries are used to\ndetermine the parameters of a physically-based feedback delay network (FDN) to\ngenerate the incoherent VRS signals. The VRS are spatially distributed around\nthe listener with weighting factors representing the spatially subsampled\ndistribution of absorption coefficients on the wall boundaries. The minimum\nnumber of VRS required to be perceptually distinguishable from the maximum\n(reference) number of 96 VRS was assessed in a listening test conducted with a\nspherical loudspeaker array within an anechoic room.

To build predictive models that perform well\nregardless of the nuisance-label relationship, we develop Nuisance-Randomized\nDistillation (NURD).

Under this\ndistribution, we define the set of representations such that conditioning on\nany member, the nuisance and the label remain independent.

However, in\nspite of taking rigorous training on various comparative fairness notions,\nhuman auditors are known to disagree on various aspects of fairness notions in\npractice, making it difficult to collect reliable feedback. This paper offers a\nparadigm shift to the domain of algorithmic fairness via proposing a new\nfairness notion based on the principle of non-comparative justice. In contrary\nto traditional fairness notions where the outcomes of two individuals/groups\nare compared, our proposed notion compares the MLS' outcome with a desired\noutcome for each input. This desired outcome naturally describes a human\nauditor's expectation, and can be easily used to evaluate MLS on crowd-auditing\nplatforms. We show that any MLS can be deemed fair from the perspective of\ncomparative fairness (be it in terms of individual fairness, statistical\nparity, equal opportunity or calibration) if it is non-comparatively fair with\nrespect to a fair auditor. We also show that the converse holds true in the\ncontext of individual fairness. Given that such an evaluation relies on the\ntrustworthiness of the auditor, we also present an approach to identify fair\nand reliable auditors by estimating their biases with respect to a given set of\nsensitive attributes, as well as quantify the uncertainty in the estimation of\nbiases within a given MLS. Furthermore, all of the above results are also\nvalidated on COMPAS, German credit and Adult Census Income datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 20:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

The topic matrix at a\nlayer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic\nembedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of\nthe layer above.

However, existing multi-modal graph synthesis\nframeworks have several limitations. First, they mainly focus on generating\ngraphs from the same domain (intra-modality), overlooking the rich multimodal\nrepresentations of brain connectivity (inter-modality). Second, they can only\nhandle isomorphic graph generation tasks, limiting their generalizability to\nsynthesizing target graphs with a different node size and topological structure\nfrom those of the source one. More importantly, both target and source domains\nmight have different distributions, which causes a domain fracture between them\n(i.e., distribution misalignment). To address such challenges, we propose an\ninter-modality aligner of non-isomorphic graphs (IMANGraphNet) framework to\ninfer a target graph modality based on a given modality. Our three core\ncontributions lie in (i) predicting a target graph (e.g., functional) from a\nsource graph (e.g., morphological) based on a novel graph generative\nadversarial network (gGAN); (ii) using non-isomorphic graphs for both source\nand target domains with a different number of nodes, edges and structure; and\n(iii) enforcing the predicted target distribution to match that of the ground\ntruth graphs using a graph autoencoder to relax the designed loss oprimization.\nTo handle the unstable behavior of gGAN, we design a new Ground\nTruth-Preserving (GT-P) loss function to guide the generator in learning the\ntopological structure of ground truth brain graphs. Our comprehensive\nexperiments on predicting functional from morphological graphs demonstrate the\noutperformance of IMANGraphNet in comparison with its variants. This can be\nfurther leveraged for integrative and holistic brain mapping in health and\ndisease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Despite recent tremendous progress in\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) for handling Euclidean-space tasks, it still\nremains challenging to exploit SNNs in processing non-Euclidean-space data\nrepresented by graph data, mainly due to the lack of effective modeling\nframework and useful training techniques. Here we present a general spike-based\nmodeling framework that enables the direct training of SNNs for graph learning.\nThrough spatial-temporal unfolding for spiking data flows of node features, we\nincorporate graph convolution filters into spiking dynamics and formalize a\nsynergistic learning paradigm. Considering the unique features of spike\nrepresentation and spiking dynamics, we propose a spatial-temporal feature\nnormalization (STFN) technique suitable for SNN to accelerate convergence. We\ninstantiate our methods into two spiking graph models, including graph\nconvolution SNNs and graph attention SNNs, and validate their performance on\nthree node-classification benchmarks, including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.

This new notion of conditional teaching size\nuncovers new insights, such as the interposition phenomenon: certain prior\nknowledge generates simpler compatible concepts that increase the teaching size\nof the concept that we want to teach. This does not happen for conditional\nKolmogorov complexity. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm that constructs\noptimal curricula based on interposition avoidance.

In addition to fear and anxiety towards\ninterfacing with systems; cognitive disabilities, weakened memory, disorganized\nbehavior and even physical limitations are some of the problems that elderly\npeople tend to face with increasing age. The essence of providing\ntechnology-based solutions to address these needs of elderly people and to\ncreate smart and assisted living spaces for the elderly; lies in developing\nsystems that can adapt by addressing their diversity and can augment their\nperformances in the context of their day to day goals. Therefore, this work\nproposes a framework for development of a Personalized Intelligent Assistant to\nhelp elderly people perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in a smart and\nconnected Internet of Things (IoT) based environment. This Personalized\nIntelligent Assistant can analyze different tasks performed by the user and\nrecommend activities by considering their daily routine, current affective\nstate and the underlining user experience. To uphold the efficacy of this\nproposed framework, it has been tested on a couple of datasets for modelling an\naverage user and a specific user respectively. The results presented show that\nthe model achieves a performance accuracy of 73.12% when modelling a specific\nuser, which is considerably higher than its performance while modelling an\naverage user, this upholds the relevance for development and implementation of\nthis proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

The golden ratio was first introduced by the famous mathematician\nFibonacci. The ratio of two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is\nsimilar, and it is called the golden ratio, which is prevalent in nature, art,\narchitecture, and design. CDDO uses golden ratio and mimics cognitive learning\nand child's drawing development stages starting from the scribbling stage to\nthe advanced pattern-based stage. Hand pressure width, length and golden ratio\nof the child's drawing are tuned to attain better results. This helps children\nwith evolving, improving their intelligence and collectively achieving shared\ngoals. CDDO shows superior performance in finding the global optimum solution\nfor the optimization problems tested by 19 benchmark functions. Its results are\nevaluated against more than one state of art algorithms such as PSO, DE, WOA,\nGSA, and FEP. The performance of the CDDO is assessed, and the test result\nshows that CDDO is relatively competitive through scoring 2.8 ranks. This\ndisplays that the CDDO is outstandingly robust in exploring a new solution.\nAlso, it reveals the competency of the algorithm to evade local minima as it\ncovers promising regions extensively within the design space and exploits the\nbest solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}
