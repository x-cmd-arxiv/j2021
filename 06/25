Allele polymorphism is driven mainly by\npoint mutations, while haplotype polymorphism is also affected by\nrecombination. Current estimates treat recombination as mutations in an\ninfinite site model. We here show that even in the simple case of two loci in a\nhaploid individual, for a finite population, most recombination events produce\nexisting haplotypes, and as such are silent.

Additionally, it provides accurate\nground-truth for various deep-learning tasks. Virtual multi-staining can be\nobtained using different stains for consecutive sections or by re-staining the\nsame section. Both approaches require image registration to compensate tissue\ndeformations, but little attention has been devoted to comparing their\naccuracy.\n  Approach: We compare variational image registration of consecutive and\nre-stained sections and analyze the effect of the image resolution which\ninfluences accuracy and required computational resources. We present a new\nhybrid dataset of re-stained and consecutive sections (HyReCo, 81 slide pairs,\napprox. 3000 landmarks) that we made publicly available and compare its image\nregistration results to the automatic non-rigid histological image registration\n(ANHIR) challenge data (230 consecutive slide pairs).\n  Results: We obtain a median landmark error after registration of 7.1 {\\mu}m\n(HyReCo) and 16.0 {\\mu}m (ANHIR) between consecutive sections. Between\nre-stained sections, the median registration error is 2.3 {\\mu}m and 0.9 {\\mu}m\nin the two subsets of the HyReCo dataset. We observe that deformable\nregistration leads to lower landmark errors than affine registration in both\ncases, though the effect is smaller in re-stained sections. Conclusion:\nDeformable registration of consecutive and re-stained sections is a valuable\ntool for the joint analysis of different stains.\n  Significance: While the registration of re-stained sections allows\nnucleus-level alignment which allows for a direct analysis of interacting\nbiomarkers, consecutive sections only allow the transfer of region-level\nannotations. The latter can be achieved at low computational cost using coarser\nimage resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 12:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

To test the validity and\nprecision of the modelling, we perform an MCMC analysis using simulated data\ncorresponding to a $\\Lambda$CDM fiducial cosmology and Stage-IV surveys\nspecifications in two redshift bins, $z=0.5$ and $z=1$. We find the most\ncomplex EFTofLSS-based model studied to be better suited at both, describing\nthe mock data up to smaller scales, and extracting the most information. Using\nthis model, we forecast uncertainties on the dark energy equation of state,\n$w$, and on the interaction parameter, $A$, finding $\\sigma_w=0.06$ and\n$\\sigma_A=1.1$ b/GeV for the analysis at $z=0.5$ and $\\sigma_w=0.06$ and\n$\\sigma_A=2.0$ b/GeV for the analysis at $z=1$. In addition, we show that a\nfalse detection of exotic dark energy up to 3$\\sigma$ would occur should the\nnon-linear modelling be incorrect, demonstrating the importance of the\nvalidation stage for accurate interpretation of measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The aim of the ReD project is to investigate the directional\nsensitivity of argon-based TPCs via columnar recombination to nuclear recoils\nin the energy range of interest (20-200 keV$_{nr}$) for direct dark matter\nsearches. The key novel feature of the ReD TPC is a readout system based on\ncryogenic Silicon Photomultipliers, which are employed and operated\ncontinuously for the first time in an argon TPC. Over the course of six months,\nthe ReD TPC was commissioned and characterised under various operating\nconditions using $\\gamma$-ray and neutron sources, demonstrating remarkable\nstability of the optical sensors and reproducibility of the results. The\nscintillation gain and ionisation amplification of the TPC were measured to be\n$g_1 = (0.194 \\pm 0.013)$ PE/photon and $g_2 = (20.0 \\pm 0.9)$ PE/electron,\nrespectively.

More specifically, RISs are\ndeployed under the UAVs termed as UAVs-RISs that operate over the micro-wave\n($\\mu$W) channel in the sky to sustain a strong line-of-sight (LoS) connection\nwith the ground users. The macro-cell operates over the $\\mu$W channel based on\northogonal multiple access (OMA), while small base stations (SBSs) operate over\nthe millimeter-wave (mmW) channel based on non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA). We study the problem of total transmit power minimization by jointly\noptimizing the trajectory/velocity of each UAV, RISs' phase shifts, subcarrier\nallocations, and active beamformers at each BS. The underlying problem is\nhighly non-convex and the global optimal solution is intractable. To handle it,\nwe decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., a subproblem\nwhich deals with the UAVs' trajectories/velocities, RISs' phase shifts, and\nsubcarrier allocations for $\\mu$W; and a subproblem for active beamforming\ndesign and subcarrier allocation for mmW. In particular, we solve the first\nsubproblem via the dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach by developing\na distributed algorithm which leads to a better policy evaluation. Then, we\nsolve the active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for the mmW via\nthe successive convex approximation (SCA) method.

An intriguing fact that has emerged is that\nthe event horizon and the photon sphere are not necessary for a shadow to form.\nNow, when two different types of equally massive compact objects cast shadows\nof same size, then it would be very difficult to distinguish them from each\nother. However, the nature of the nulllike and timelike geodesics around the\ntwo compact objects would be different, since their spacetime geometries are\ndifferent. Therefore, the intensity distribution of light emitted by the\naccreting matter around the compact objects would also be different. In this\npaper, we emphasize this phenomenon in detail.

In this paper, we propose a morph attack detection\nalgorithm that leverages an undecimated 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for\nidentifying morphed face images. The core of our framework is that artifacts\nresulting from the morphing process that are not discernible in the image\ndomain can be more easily identified in the spatial frequency domain. A\ndiscriminative wavelet sub-band can accentuate the disparity between a real and\na morphed image. To this end, multi-level DWT is applied to all images,\nyielding 48 mid and high-frequency sub-bands each. The entropy distributions\nfor each sub-band are calculated separately for both bona fide and morph\nimages. For some of the sub-bands, there is a marked difference between the\nentropy of the sub-band in a bona fide image and the identical sub-band's\nentropy in a morphed image. Consequently, we employ Kullback-Liebler Divergence\n(KLD) to exploit these differences and isolate the sub-bands that are the most\ndiscriminative. We measure how discriminative a sub-band is by its KLD value\nand the 22 sub-bands with the highest KLD values are chosen for network\ntraining.

Specifically, glass forming fluids, as water, can have, besides\nsolid polymorphism, more than one liquid and glassy phases, and even a\nliquid-liquid critical point. In this sense, we apply a neural network (NN)\nalgorithm to analyze the phase behavior of a core-softened mixture of\ncore-softened CSW fluids that have liquid polymorphism and liquid-liquid\ncritical points, similar to water.

This makes predicting the future frames of a video,\nconditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting\ntask which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.\nExisting video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow\nbenchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with\nmore complicated dynamics or broader domain.

CMB simulations of a spatially infinite\nuniverse model within the paradigm of the standard cosmological model present\nnon-zero two-point correlations at any angular scale. This is in contradiction\nwith the extreme suppression of correlations at scales above $60^{\\circ}$ in\nthe observed CMB maps. Universe models with spatially multiply connected\ntopology contain typically a discrete spectrum of the Laplacian with a specific\nwave-length cut-off and thus lead to a suppression of the correlations at large\nangular scales, as observed in the CMB (in general there can be also an\nadditional continuous spectrum). Among the simplest examples are 3-dimensional\ntori which possess only a discrete spectrum. To date, the universe models with\nnon-trivial topology such as the toroidal space are the only models that\npossess a two-point correlation function showing a similar behaviour as the one\nderived from the observed Planck CMB maps.

The current best algorithms for\nsolving dense linear systems reduce the problem to matrix multiplication, and\nrun in time $O(n^{\\omega})$.

The power that weak lensing has to constrain\ncosmological parameters can be enhanced by considering statistics beyond\nsecond-order shear correlation functions or power spectra. One such\nhigher-order probe that has proven successful in observational data is the\ndensity split statistics (DSS), in which one analyses the mean shear profiles\naround points that are classified according to their foreground galaxy density.\nIn this paper, we generalise the most accurate DSS model to allow for a broad\nclass of angular filter functions used for the classification of the different\nlocal density regions. This approach is motivated by earlier findings showing\nthat an optimised filter can provide tighter constraints on model parameters\ncompared to the standard top-hat case. We build on large deviation theory\napproaches and approximations thereof to model the matter density PDF, and on\nperturbative calculations of higher-order moments of the density field. The\nnovel addition relies on the generalisation of these previously employed\ncalculations to allow for general filter functions and is validated on several\nsets of numerical simulations. The revised model fits well the simulation\nmeasurements, with a residual systematic offset that is small compared to the\nstatistical accuracy of current weak lensing surveys. The accuracy of the model\nis slightly lower for a compensated filter than for a non-negative filter\nfunction, and that it increases with the filter size. Using a Fisher matrix\napproach, we find constraints comparable to the commonly used two-point cosmic\nshear measures. Hence, our DSS model can be used in competitive analyses of\ncurrent cosmic shear data, while it may need refinements for forthcoming\nlensing surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:47:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 16:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is\nthrough the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each\ninput image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these\ndeformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as\ntopological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these\ndeformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by\nlifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D\nradiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through\nthis \"hyper-space\". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model\nthe evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We\nevaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between \"moments\",\ni.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining\nvisual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show\nthat our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both\ntasks.

We here investigate the interaction between a massive black\nhole binary and a self-gravitating circumbinary disc using 3D smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics simulations. We find that, when the disc self-gravity regulates\nthe angular momentum transport, the binary semi-major axis decreases regardless\nthe choice of disc masses and temperatures, within the range we explored. In\nparticular, we find that the disc initial temperature (hence the disc aspect\nratio) has little effect on the evolution of the binary since discs with the\nsame mass self-regulate towards the same temperature. Initially warmer discs\ncause the binary to shrink on a slightly shorter timescale until the disc has\nreached the self-regulated equilibrium temperature. More massive discs drive\nthe binary semi-major axis to decrease at a faster pace compared to less\nmassive discs and result in faster binary eccentricity growth even after the\ninitial-condition-dependent transient evolution. Finally we investigate the\neffect that the initial cavity size has on the binary-disc interaction and we\nfind that, in the self-gravitating regime, an initially smaller cavity leads to\na much faster binary shrinking, as expected. Our results are especially\nimportant for very massive black hole binaries such as those in the PTA band,\nfor which gas self gravity cannot be neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

The interest comes from the fact that\nBlack-Hole models seem to saturate all of them. The goal of this work is to\ngain physical intuition about the quantum mechanisms that enforce these bounds\non simple models. To this aim, we consider classical and quantum free dynamics\non curved manifolds. These systems exhibit chaos up to the lowest temperatures\nand - as we discuss - they violate the bounds in the classical limit. First of\nall, we show that the quantum dimensionless viscosity and the Lyapunov exponent\nonly depend on the de Broglie length and a geometric length-scale, thus\nestablishing the scale at which quantum effects become relevant. Then, we focus\non the bound on the Lyapunov exponent and identify three different ways in\nwhich quantum effects arise in practice. We illustrate our findings on a toy\nmodel given by the surface of constant negative curvature - a paradigmatic\nmodel of quantum chaos - glued to a cylinder. By exact solution and numerical\ninvestigations, we show how the chaotic behaviour is limited by the quantum\neffects of the curvature itself. Interestingly, we find that at the lowest\nenergies the bound to chaos is dominated by the longest length scales, and it\nis therefore a collective effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 09:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 15:51:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

In this paper, we\nexplore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to\nas Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to\nlearn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data\ndistribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the\nclassifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the\nother. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier\ndecision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame\nand seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting\nobjectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)\nto maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal\nframes will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows\nfor efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a\nminimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing\nthe data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under\ndifferent constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized\nfeature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via\nexperiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as\nanomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities.

In recent years, machine\nlearning (ML) has been gaining popularity in HIF detection because ML\ntechniques learn patterns from data and successfully detect HIFs. However, as\nthese methods are based on supervised learning, they fail to reliably detect\nany scenario, fault or non-fault, not present in the training data.\nConsequently, this paper takes advantage of unsupervised learning and proposes\na convolutional autoencoder framework for HIF detection (CAE-HIFD). Contrary to\nthe conventional autoencoders that learn from normal behavior, the\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE) in CAE-HIFD learns only from the HIF signals\neliminating the need for presence of diverse non-HIF scenarios in the CAE\ntraining. CAE distinguishes HIFs from non-HIF operating conditions by employing\ncross-correlation. To discriminate HIFs from transient disturbances such as\ncapacitor or load switching, CAE-HIFD uses kurtosis, a statistical measure of\nthe probability distribution shape. The performance evaluation studies\nconducted using the IEEE 13-node test feeder indicate that the CAE-HIFD\nreliably detects HIFs, outperforms the state-of-the-art HIF detection\ntechniques, and is robust against noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Our technique results in\nincreased optimization performance, a factor of two increase in effective\nquantum resources, and a quadratic reduction in measurement complexity. While\nthe classical simulation of many qubits with traditional quantum formalism is\nimpossible due to its exponential scaling, we mitigate this limitation with\nexact circuit representations using factorized tensor rings. In particular, the\nshallow circuits permitted by our technique, combined with efficient factorized\ntensor-based simulation, enable us to successfully optimize the MaxCut of the\nnonlocally connected $512$-vertex DIMACS library graphs on a single GPU. By\nimproving the performance of quantum optimization algorithms while requiring\nfewer quantum resources and utilizing shallower, more error-resistant circuits,\nwe offer tangible progress for variational quantum optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 20:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 19:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 21:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 07:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm codesign\nfor an efficient and adaptive lossy compressor for scientific data on FPGAs\n(called CEAZ), which is the first lossy compressor that can achieve high\ncompression ratios and throughputs simultaneously. Specifically, we propose an\nefficient Huffman coding approach that can adaptively update Huffman codewords\nonline based on codewords generated offline, from a variety of representative\nscientific datasets. Moreover, we derive a theoretical analysis to support a\nprecise control of compression ratio under an error-bounded compression mode,\nenabling accurate offline Huffman codewords generation. This also helps us\ncreate a fixed-ratio compression mode for consistent throughput. In addition,\nwe develop an efficient compression pipeline by adopting cuSZ's\ndual-quantization algorithm to our hardware use cases. Finally, we evaluate\nCEAZ on five real-world datasets with both a single FPGA board and 128 nodes\n(to accelerate parallel I/O).

The Metis\nobservations, on May 15, 2020, provide the first HI Ly-alpha images of the\nextended corona and the first instantaneous map of the speed of the coronal\nplasma outflows during the minimum of solar activity and allow us to identify\nthe layer where the slow wind flow is observed. The polarized visible light\n(580-640 nm), and the UV HI Ly-alpha (121.6 nm) coronal emissions, obtained\nwith the two Metis channels, are combined in order to measure the dimming of\nthe UV emission relative to a static corona. This effect is caused by the\noutward motion of the coronal plasma along the direction of incidence of the\nchromospheric photons on the coronal neutral hydrogen. The plasma outflow\nvelocity is then derived as a function of the measured Doppler dimming. The\nstatic corona UV emission is simulated on the basis of the plasma electron\ndensity inferred from the polarized visible light. This study leads to the\nidentification, in the velocity maps of the solar corona, of the high-density\nlayer about +/-10 deg wide, centered on the extension of a quiet equatorial\nstreamer present at the East limb where the slowest wind flows at about (160\n+/- 18) km/s from 4 Rs to 6 Rs. Beyond the boundaries of the high-density\nlayer, the wind velocity rapidly increases, marking the transition between slow\nand fast wind in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 22:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

This drag critically depends on the separation between\nthe rod and the wall and can be approximated asymptotically in specific\nregimes, namely far from, or very close to, the wall, but is typically\ndetermined numerically for general separations. In this note we determine an\nasymptotic representation of the local drag for a slender rod parallel to a\nwall which is valid for all separations. This is possible through matching the\nbehaviour of a rod close to the wall and a rod far from the wall. We show that\nthe leading order drag in both these regimes has been known since 1981 and that\nthey can used to produce a composite representation of the drag which is valid\nfor all separations. This is in contrast to a sphere above a wall, where no\nsimple uniformly valid representation exists. We estimate the error on this\ncomposite representation as the separation increases, discuss how the results\ncould be used as resistive-force theory and demonstrate their use on a\ntwo-hinged swimmer above a wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 23:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

As water and oxygen diffuse through the material, dissolved species are\nproduced, which generate osmotic pressure that deforms and debonds the\ncoating.These mechanisms are experimentally well-supported; however,\ncomprehensive macroscopic models capable of predicting the formation osmotic\nblisters, without extensive data-fitting, is scant. Here, we develop a general\nmathematical theory of blistering and apply it to the failure of anti-corrosion\ncoatings on carbon steel. The model is able to predict the irreversible,\nnonlinear blister growth dynamics, which eventually reaches a stable state,\nruptures, or undergoes runaway delamination, depending on the mechanical and\nadhesion properties of the coating. For runaway delamination, the theory\npredicts a critical delamination length, beyond which unstable corrosion-driven\ngrowth occurs. The model is able to fit multiple sets of blister growth data\nwith no fitting parameters. Corrosion experiments are also performed to observe\nundercoat rusting on carbon steel, which yielded trends comparable with model\npredictions. The theory is used to define three dimensionless numbers which can\nbe used for engineering design of elastic coatings capable of resisting visible\ndeformation, rupture, and delamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

For example, in neuroscience,\nthe activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in\nresponse to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the\nnonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple\noutputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations\nbetween the output response variables are invariant in the input space.\nStochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend\non input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output\ndependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for\nlarge datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series\nproblems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal\nstochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint\namongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational\nburden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output\ndependence.

Prior work has shown that JPEG\ncompression can combat the drop in classification accuracy on adversarial\nexamples to some extent. But, as the compression ratio increases, traditional\nJPEG compression is insufficient to defend those attacks but can cause an\nabrupt accuracy decline to the benign images. In this paper, with the aim of\nfully filtering the adversarial perturbations, we firstly make modifications to\ntraditional JPEG compression algorithm which becomes more favorable for NN.\nSpecifically, based on an analysis of the frequency coefficient, we design a\nNN-favored quantization table for compression. Considering compression as a\ndata augmentation strategy, we then combine our model-agnostic preprocess with\nnoisy training. We fine-tune the pre-trained model by training with images\nencoded at different compression levels, thus generating multiple classifiers.\nFinally, since lower (higher) compression ratio can remove both perturbations\nand original features slightly (aggressively), we use these trained multiple\nmodels for model ensemble. The majority vote of the ensemble of models is\nadopted as final predictions. Experiments results show our method can improve\ndefense efficiency while maintaining original accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 02:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

We\nconsider a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled Fermi-Hubbard model with\nfractional filling, whose low-energy physics is effectively described by a\nspinless Luttinger liquid and is trivial in the conventional characterization.\nWe show that, as being tuned by the filling factor and interaction strength,\nthe many-body ground state may exhibit nontrivial winding in its bulk spin\ntexture in the projected momentum space, manifesting an emergent topological\nphase. A topological transition occurs when the projected spin-state at a high\nsymmetry momentum becomes fully mixed one, resulting from competing processes\nof particle scattering to the lower and higher subbands, for which the spin\ntexture at such momentum point is ill-defined, but the Luttinger liquid keeps\ngapless through the transition.

We find that $t_{\\rm max}$ emerges in the early stage of the impact,\nwhile the rebound process takes place in the late stage. We find a crossover of\n$F_{\\rm max}$ from $u_0$ independent regime for low $u_0$ to a power law regime\nsatisfying $F_{\\rm max}\\propto u_0^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha\\approx 1.5$ for high\n$u_0$.

The GeV spectrum around the\ninferior conjunction was well described with two non-thermal components; a\npower law with a photon index of $\\sim 3$ and a cut-off power law with a cutoff\nenergy of $\\sim 2$ GeV. The orbital flux variability also changed gradually\naround a few GeV. These results indicate that there are two emission components\nin the GeV band, and the dominant component above $\\sim 1$ GeV does not depend\non the orbital phase. By combining these results, we update the spectral energy\ndistribution of LS 5039 with the highest available statistics. Theoretical\nmodels proposed so far cannot explain the obtained multi-wavelength spectrum,\nespecially the emission from $\\sim$ 1 MeV to $\\sim$ 400 MeV, and we discuss a\npossibility that particle acceleration in LS 5039 is different from the shock\nacceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 03:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 03:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

As graphs\nare getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs\nseparately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is\nnatural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local\nsystem holds a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the\nwhole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively\ntrain a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing\ntheir graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of\nsubgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage,\nwhich trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link\nstructures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which\ntrains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links\nacross local subgraphs.

One possible approach, the multisource\nexchangeability model (MEM), is a Bayesian method for integrating data from\nsupplementary sources into the analysis of a primary source. MEM was originally\ndeveloped to improve inference for a single study by asymmetrically borrowing\ninformation from a set of similar previous studies and was further developed to\napply a more computationally intensive symmetric borrowing in the context of\nbasket trial; however, even for asymmetric borrowing, its computational burden\ngrows exponentially with the number of supplementary sources, making it\nunsuitable for applications where hundreds or thousands of supplementary\nsources (i.e., individuals) could contribute to inference on a given\nindividual.

Toward reaching this goal we propose an object-oriented reasoning\napproach in that video is abstracted as a dynamic stream of interacting\nobjects. At each stage of the video event flow, these objects interact with\neach other, and their interactions are reasoned about with respect to the query\nand under the overall context of a video.

The standalone learning-based and statistical model-based\nclassifiers face major challenges towards the fulfillment of the classification\ntask using a small training set. Specifically, classifiers that solely rely on\nthe physics-based statistical models usually suffer from their inability to\nproperly tune the underlying unobservable parameters, which leads to a\nmismatched representation of the system's behaviors. Learning-based\nclassifiers, on the other hand, typically rely on a large number of training\ndata from the underlying physical process, which might not be feasible in most\npractical scenarios. In this paper, a hybrid classification method -- termed\nHyPhyLearn -- is proposed that exploits both the physics-based statistical\nmodels and the learning-based classifiers. The proposed solution is based on\nthe conjecture that HyPhyLearn would alleviate the challenges associated with\nthe individual approaches of learning-based and statistical model-based\nclassifiers by fusing their respective strengths. The proposed hybrid approach\nfirst estimates the unobservable model parameters using the available\n(suboptimal) statistical estimation procedures, and subsequently use the\nphysics-based statistical models to generate synthetic data. Then, the training\ndata samples are incorporated with the synthetic data in a learning-based\nclassifier that is based on domain-adversarial training of neural networks.\nSpecifically, in order to address the mismatch problem, the classifier learns a\nmapping from the training data and the synthetic data to a common feature\nspace. Simultaneously, the classifier is trained to find discriminative\nfeatures within this space in order to fulfill the classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 05:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 01:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

However,\ndirect evidence for the time-reversal symmetry-breaking of the charge order\nremains elusive. Here we utilize muon spin relaxation to probe the kagome\ncharge order and superconductivity in KV_3Sb_5. We observe a striking\nenhancement of the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble, which\ntakes place just below the charge ordering temperature and persists into the\nsuperconducting state. Remarkably, the muon spin relaxation rate below the\ncharge ordering temperature is substantially enhanced by applying an external\nmagnetic field.

This issue has been debated in the\nliterature over the past several decades, and several experimental protocols\nhave been proposed to distinguish thixotropy from viscoelasticity. In this\nwork, we assess these protocols by carrying out experiments using polymer\nsolutions, thixotropic clay dispersions, and modeling their behavior,\nrespectively, using the FENE-P constitutive equation and a viscoelastic aging\nmodel. We find that the criteria proposed in the literature, such as a step\ndown jump in the shear rate and shear startup at different waiting times\nelapsed since preshear, are inadequate to distinguish thixotropy from\nviscoelasticity. In marked contrast, we show that the application of\nstep-strain or step-stress after cessation of the preshear serves as a useful\ndiscriminant between thixotropy and viscoelasticity. In thixotropic materials,\nwe observe that the application of step strain (or step stress) after cessation\nof the preshear eventually leads to slowing down of relaxation dynamics as a\nfunction of waiting time. However, for viscoelastic materials, the relaxation\nmodulus (creep compliance) curve shifts to lower modulus (higher compliance)\nvalues as a function of waiting time until equilibrium is reached. While the\nproposed criterion offers a robust distinction between viscoelasticity and\nthixotropy for the systems studied here, further experimental investigations\nbased on other systems are needed to establish its versatility and will lead to\na greater insight into this long-standing issue in rheological categorization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 06:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

This\npaper addresses bias issues with post-hoc explanations to provide a trustable\nprediction of whether a person will receive future criminal charges given one's\nprevious criminal records by learning temporal behavior patterns over twenty\nyears. Bi-LSTM relieves the vanishing gradient problem, attentional mechanisms\nallow learning and interpretation of feature importance, and complex-valued\nnetworks inspired quantum physics to facilitate a certain level of transparency\nin modeling the decision process. Our approach shows a consistent and reliable\nprediction precision and recall on a real-life dataset. Our analysis of the\nimportance of each input feature shows the critical causal impact on\ndecision-making, suggesting that criminal histories are statistically\nsignificant factors, while identifiers, such as race and age, are not.

Compared to the previous\ndemonstration using bulk optical elements which works only with light sources\nwith a long coherence length, our experimental directionally-unbiased 3 x 3\noptical multiport does not require a long coherence length since it provides\nnegligible optical path length differences among all possible optical\ntrajectories.

The dominant VLP models adopt a CNN-Transformer\narchitecture, which embeds images with a CNN, and then aligns images and text\nwith a Transformer. Visual relationship between visual contents plays an\nimportant role in image understanding and is the basic for inter-modal\nalignment learning. However, CNNs have limitations in visual relation learning\ndue to local receptive field's weakness in modeling long-range dependencies.\nThus the two objectives of learning visual relation and inter-modal alignment\nare encapsulated in the same Transformer network.

We analyze the angular dependence of\nthe gap function and specific heat $C_V (T)$ of such nematic superconductor. We\nspecifically address three issues: (i) angular dependence of the gap in light\nof the competition between nematicity-induced $s$-$d$ mixture and orbital\ntransmutation of low-energy excitations in the nematic state, (ii) the effect\nof nematicity on the magnitude of the jump of the specific heat $C_V (T)$ at\n$T_c$ and the temperature dependence of $C_V (T)$ below $T_c$, and (iii) a\npotential transition at $T_{c1} < T_c$ from an $s+d$ state to an $s + e^{i\\eta}\nd$ state that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We consider two scenarios for a\nnematic order: scenario A, in which this order develops between $d_{xz}$ and\n$d_{yz}$ orbitals on hole and electron pockets and scenario B, in which there\nis an additional component of the nematic order for $d_{xy}$ fermions on the\ntwo electron pockets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 08:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

This model allows to transmit identifiers whose size\nscales doubly-exponentially in the blocklength, unlike common transmission (or\nchannel) codes whose size scales exponentially. It suffices to use binary\nconstant-weight codes (CWCs) to achieve the ID capacity. By relating the\nparameters of a binary CWC to the minimum distance of a code and using\nhigher-order correlation moments, two upper bounds on the binary CWC size are\nproposed. These bounds are shown to be upper bounds also on the identifier\nsizes for ID codes constructed by using binary CWCs. We propose two code\nconstructions based on optical orthogonal codes, which are used in optical\nmultiple access schemes, have constant-weight codewords, and satisfy cyclic\ncross-correlation and auto-correlation constraints.

The proposed algorithm addresses these\ndrawbacks by integrating neural-network-based learning with adaptive control.\nMore specifically, the algorithm learns a controller, represented as a neural\nnetwork, using training data that correspond to a collection of system\nparameters and tasks.

In practical situations,\nthis null training sample (NTS) can come from previous experiments, from a part\nof the data under test, from specific simulations, or from a sampling process.\nIn this work, we present theoretical results that handle such a framework, with\na focus on the false discovery rate (FDR) control and the Benjamini-Hochberg\n(BH) procedure. First, we provide upper and lower bounds for the FDR of the BH\nprocedure based on empirical $p$-values.

Active learning\n(AL) can be utilized in MDL to reduce the labeling effort by only using the\nmost informative data. The resultant paradigm is termed multi-domain active\nlearning (MDAL).

To fill this gap, we\nconstruct a pipeline of MDAL and present a comprehensive comparative study of\nthirty different algorithms, which are established by combining six\nrepresentative MDL models and five commonly used AL strategies.

The deployment of IoT applications is a critical challenge as\ncloud and fog nodes vary in terms of their resource availability and use\ndifferent cost models. Moreover, diversity in resource, quality of service\n(QoS) and security requirements of IoT applications make the problem even more\ncomplex. In this paper, we model IoT application placement as an optimization\nproblem that aims at minimizing the cost while satisfying the QoS and security\nconstraints. The problem is formulated using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).\nThe ILP model is evaluated for a small-scale scenario. The evaluation shows the\nimpact of QoS and security requirement on the cost. We also study the impact of\nrelaxing security constraint on the placement decision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 09:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 10:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

In order to verify this hypothesis, we utilized for the\nfirst time Particle-in-Cell (PIC-) code simulations to study the nonlinear\nevolution of electron-positron bunches in dependence on the relative drift\nspeeds of electrons and positrons, on the initial plasma temperature, and on\nthe initial distance between the bunches. For this sake, we utilized the\nPIC-code ACRONYM with a high-order field solver and particle weighting factor,\nappropriate to describe relativistic pair plasmas. We found that the bunch\nexpansion is mainly determined by the relative electron-positron drift speed.\nFinite drift speeds were found to cause the generation of strong electric\nfields that reach up to $E \\sim 7.5 \\times 10^{5}$ V/cm ($E / (m_\\mathrm{e} c\n\\omega_\\mathrm{p} e^{-1}) \\sim 4.4$) and strong plasma heating. As a result, up\nto 15~\\% of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into the electric field\nenergy. Assuming the same electron- and positron-distributions we found that\nthe fastest (in the bunch reference frame) particles of consecutively emitted\nbunches eventually overlap in the momentum (velocity) space.

We explore mathematical models of\npredator-prey systems, in order to assess the impact of prey dormancy on the\ncompetition between two types of prey, a perennially active (PA) and capable of\nentering dormancy (dormitive). Both the active form and the dormant form of the\ndormitive prey are individually at a disadvantage compared to the PA prey and\nwould go extinct due to their low growth rate, energy waste on the production\nof dormant prey, and inability of the latter to grow autonomously. However, the\ndormitive prey can paradoxically outcompete the PA prey with superior traits\nand even cause its extinction by alternating between the two losing strategies.\nThis outcome recapitulates the game-theoretic Parrondo's paradox, where two\nlosing strategies combine to achieve a winning outcome. We observed higher\nfitness of the dormitive prey in rich environments because a large predator\npopulation in a rich environment cannot be supported by the prey without\nadopting an evasive strategy, that is, dormancy. In such environments,\npopulations experience large-scale fluctuations, which can be survived by\ndormitive but not by PA prey. Dormancy of the prey appears to be a natural\nevolutionary response to self-destructive over-predation that stabilizes\nevolving predator-prey systems through Parrondo's paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 09:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

The\narchitecture has three major advantages over existing approaches: First, in\neach task only one DSN is active for sensing and estimating the robot state,\nand for different tasks the robot can switch the active DSN by taking resource\nsaving and system performance into account; Second, the robot only needs to\ncommunicate with one active sensor at each time to obtain its state information\nfrom the active DSN; Third, no online optimization is required. With the\ncontroller, the robot is able to accomplish a task by following a reference\ntrajectory and switch to the next task when an event-triggered condition is\nfulfilled. With the estimator, each active sensor is able to estimate the robot\nstate. Under proper conditions, we prove that the state estimation error and\nthe trajectory tracking deviation are upper bounded by two time-varying\nsequences respectively, which play an essential role in the event-triggered\ncondition. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition for accomplishing a task\nand provide an upper bound of running time for the task. Numerical simulations\nof an indoor robot's localization and navigation are provided to validate the\nproposed architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 09:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Background: Many researchers implicitly\nassume that for each tool there exists a single ideal threshold. But research\nshows the effects of alerting tools on decision errors to vary depending on\nvariables such as user ability and task difficulty. These findings motivated\nour investigation. Method: Forty-seven participants edited text passages, aided\nby a simulated spell-checker tool. We experimentally manipulated passage\ndifficulty and tool alerting threshold, measured participants' editing and\ndictation ability, and counted participants' decision errors (false positives +\nfalse negatives). We investigated whether alerting threshold, user ability,\ntask difficulty and their interactions affected error count. Results: Which\nalerting threshold better helped a user depended on an interaction between user\nability and passage difficulty. Some effects were large: for higher ability\nusers, a more sensitive threshold reduced errors by 30%, on the easier\npassages. Participants were not significantly more likely to prefer the\nalerting threshold with which they performed better. Conclusion: Adjusting\nalerting thresholds for individual users' ability and task difficulty could\nsubstantially improve effects of automated alerts on user decisions.

Attaining a\ndeeper level of understanding of its dynamical processes is a scientific\nchallenge of great urgency, especially given the ongoing climate change and the\nevolving climate crisis. In statistical physics, complex, many-particle systems\nare studied successfully using the mathematical framework of Large Deviation\nTheory (LDT). A great potential exists for applying LDT to problems relevant\nfor geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. In particular, LDT allows\nfor understanding the fundamental properties of persistent deviations of\nclimatic fields from the long-term averages and for associating them to\nlow-frequency, large scale patterns of climatic variability. Additionally, LDT\ncan be used in conjunction with so-called rare events algorithms to explore\nrarely visited regions of the phase space and thus to study special dynamical\nconfigurations of the climate. These applications are of key importance to\nimprove our understanding of high-impact weather and climate events.\nFurthermore, LDT provides powerful tools for evaluating the probability of\nnoise-induced transitions between competing metastable states of the climate\nsystem or of its components. This in turn essential for improving our\nunderstanding of the global stability properties of the climate system and of\nits predictability of the second kind in the sense of Lorenz. The goal of this\nreview is manifold. First, we want to provide an introduction to the derivation\nof large deviation laws in the context of stochastic processes. We then relate\nsuch results to the existing literature showing the current status of\napplications of LDT in climate science and geophysical fluid dynamics.

The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic\nprototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via\nHeidelberg Spectralis system.

However, multiple reasons such\nas morphological variations of nuclei or cells make it a challenging task where\nconventional object detection methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance in\nmany cases. A detection task consists of two sub-tasks, classification and\nlocalization. Under the condition of dense object detection, classification is\na key to boost the detection performance. Considering this, we propose\nsimilarity based region proposal networks (SRPN) for nuclei and cells detection\nin histology images. In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as\nembedding layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added\ninto the region proposal networks, enabling the networks to learn\ndiscriminative features based on similarity learning. Features obtained by\nsimilarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance\ncompared to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard\nconvolutional neural networks architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and\nRetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ nuclei\ndetection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental\nresults show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior\nperformance on both tasks when compared to their counterparts. In particular,\nthe proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MoNuSeg benchmark\nfor nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods, and\non the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines.

Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour\ngrowth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).\nIn this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis\nand can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to\ngrade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical\ntechniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded\nAttention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into\ndifferent severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established\nin the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully\nunsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and\ninfiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our\nsystem outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a\nconvolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the\nlatent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds\nstate-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final\naverage accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported\nclass activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the\nsame patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior\nannotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder\ncancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on\nlabelled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 11:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Indeed, the wavefield,\npropelling the droplet, encodes information about the droplet trajectory and\nthe amount of information can be controlled by a single scalar experimental\nparameter. In this work, we show numerically and experimentally that the\naccumulation of information in the wavefield induces the loss of time\ncorrelations, where the dynamics can then be described by a memory-less\nprocess. We rationalize the resulting statistical behaviour by defining an\neffective temperature for the particle dynamics where the wavefield acts as a\nthermostat of large dimensions, and by evidencing a minimization principle of\nthe generated wavefield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 11:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

Thus it is quite attractive for nearly incompressible and\nincompressible materials. Discretization with mixed finite elements will lead\nto -- possibly large -- linear saddle point systems with a particular\nstructure. Whereas efficient multigrid methods exist for solving problems in\nmixed plane elasticity, to the knowledge of the authors, no multigrid methods\nare readily available for the general dual formulation. Two are the main\nchallenges in constructing a multigrid method for the dual formulation for\nlinear elasticity. First, in the incompressible limit, the matrix block related\nto the stress is semi-positive definite. Second, the stress belongs to\n$\\textbf{H}_{\\text{div}}$ and standard smoothers, working for $\\textbf{H}^1$\nregular problems, cannot be applied. We present a novel patch-based smoother\nfor the dual formulation for linear elasticity. We discuss different types of\nlocal boundary conditions for the patch subproblems. Based on our\npatch-smoother, we build a multigrid method for the solution of the resulting\nsaddle point problem and investigate its efficiency and robustness.

Typically, the performance of such\nsystems is obtained by comparing ground truth locations with estimated\nlocations. However, these ground truth locations are usually obtained by\nclicking on a map or using other worldwide available technologies like GPS.\nThis introduces ground truth errors that are due to the marking process, map\ndistortions, or inherent GPS inaccuracy.\n  In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of\nground truth errors on the evaluation of localization systems.

To implement IRS, the pension system uses an automatic adjustment rule\nfor the indexation of individual accounts, which adapts to the notional funding\nratio of the pension system. The pension system has two parameters that\ndetermine the investment strategy and the strength of the adjustment rule,\nwhich are optimized by expected utility maximization using Bayesian\noptimization. The volatility of the retirement benefits and that of the funding\nratio are analyzed, and it is shown that the trade-off between them can be\ncontrolled by the optimal adjustment parameter to attain IRS.

During offline training,\na mapping function is built between high and low resolution representations of\na given design domain. The mapping is expressed by a FE-CNN, which targets a\ncommon objective function value (e.g., structural compliance) across design\ndomains of differing resolutions. During online optimization, an arbitrary\ndesign domain of high resolution is reduced to low resolution through the\ntrained mapping function. The original high-resolution domain is thus designed\nby computations performed on only the low-resolution version, followed by an\ninverse mapping back to the high-resolution domain. Numerical examples\ndemonstrate that this approach can accelerate optimization by up to an order of\nmagnitude in computational time.

However, it requires an initial calibration phase during which\nthe fingerprint database is built manually. This process is labour intensive\nand needs to be repeated with any change in the environment. While a number of\nsystems have been introduced to reduce the calibration effort through RF\npropagation models or crowdsourcing, these still have some limitations. Other\napproaches use the recently developed iBeacon technology as an alternative to\nWiFi for indoor localization. However, these beacon-based solutions are limited\nto a small subset of high-end phones. In this paper, we present HybridLoc: an\naccurate low-overhead indoor localization system. The basic idea HybridLoc\nbuilds on is to leverage the sensors of high-end phones to enable localization\nof lower-end phones. Specifically, the WiFi fingerprint is crowdsourced by\nopportunistically collecting WiFi-scans labeled with location data obtained\nfrom BLE-enabled high-end smart phones. These scans are used to automatically\nconstruct the WiFi-fingerprint, that is used later to localize any lower-end\ncell phone with the ubiquitous WiFi technology. HybridLoc also has provisions\nfor handling the inherent error in the estimated BLE locations used in\nconstructing the fingerprint as well as to handle practical deployment issues\nincluding the noisy wireless environment, heterogeneous devices, among others.\nEvaluation of HybridLoc using Android phones shows that it can provide accurate\nlocalization in the same range as manual fingerprinting techniques under the\nsame conditions. Moreover, the localization accuracy on low-end phones\nsupporting only WiFi is comparable to that achieved with high-end phones\nsupporting BLE. This accuracy is achieved with no training overhead, is robust\nto the different user devices, and is consistent under environment changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 14:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

While there have been several investigations\nof the ultrafast gain dynamics in vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting\nlasers (VECSELs), little is known about the associated refractive index\nchanges. Yet, such refractive index changes do not only have a profound impact\non the pulse formation process leading to self-phase modulation, which needs to\nbe compensated by dispersion, but they are also of particular relevance for\nassessing the feasibility of Kerr-lens mode-locking of VECSELs. Here, we\nmeasure both refractive index as well as gain dynamics of a VECSEL chip using\nthe ultrafast beam deflection method. We find that, in contrast to the gain\ndynamics, the refractive index dynamics is dominated by an instantaneous\n($\\sim$100~fs) and a very slow component ($\\sim$100~ps). The time-resolved\nmeasurement of nonlinear refraction allows us to predict a pulse-length\ndependent, effective nonlinear refractive index $n_{2,eff}$, which is shown to\nbe negative and in the order of $10^{-16}$ $m^2/W$ for short pulse lengths\n($\\sim$100~fs) . It becomes positive for large excitation fluences and large\npulse lengths (few ps). These results agree with some previous reports of\nself-mode-locked VECSELs for which the cavity design and pulse properties\ndetermine sign and strength of the nonlinear refractive index when assuming\nKerr-lens mode-locking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 14:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

A necessary condition for cooperative\ncollision avoidance is to couple the prediction of the agents' trajectories\nwith the planning of the robot's trajectory. However, it is unclear that\ntrajectory based cooperative collision avoidance captures the correct agent\nattributes. In this work we migrate from trajectory based coupling to a\nformalism that couples agent preference distributions. In particular, we show\nthat preference distributions (probability density functions representing\nagents' intentions) can capture higher order statistics of agent behaviors,\nsuch as willingness to cooperate. Thus, coupling in distribution space exploits\nmore information about inter-agent cooperation than coupling in trajectory\nspace. We thus introduce a general objective for coupled prediction and\nplanning in distribution space, and propose an iterative best response\noptimization method based on variational analysis with guaranteed sufficient\ndecrease. Based on this analysis, we develop a sampling-based motion planning\nframework called DistNav that runs in real time on a laptop CPU. We evaluate\nour approach on challenging scenarios from both real world datasets and\nsimulation environments, and benchmark against a wide variety of model based\nand machine learning based approaches. The safety and efficiency statistics of\nour approach outperform all other models.

For a system of $N$\nidentical bosons, a permanent state is constructed by taking a set of $N$\narbitrary (not necessarily orthonormal) single-particle orbitals, forming their\nproduct and then symmetrizing it. It is found that for the one-dimensional\nBose-Hubbard model with the periodic boundary condition and at unit filling,\nthe exact ground state can be very well approximated by a permanent state, in\nthat the permanent state has high overlap (at least 0.96 even for 12 particles\nand 12 sites) with the exact ground state and can reproduce both the ground\nstate energy and the single-particle correlators to high precision. For a\ngeneric model, we have devised a greedy algorithm to find the optimal set of\nsingle-particle orbitals to minimize the variational energy or maximize the\noverlap with a target state. It turns out that quite often the ground state of\na bosonic system can be well approximated by a permanent state by all the\ncriterions of energy, overlap, and correlation functions. And even if the error\nis apparent, it can often be remedied by including more configurations, i.e.,\nby allowing the variational wave function to be a combination of multiple\npermanent states. The algorithm is used to study the stability of a\ntwo-particle system, with great success. All these suggest that permanent\nstates are very effective as variational wave functions for bosonic systems,\nand hence deserve further studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 03:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 05:31:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 01:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

In doing so, we do not need a pre-trained teacher\nnetwork for the KD framework because the teacher and the student networks\ncoexist within the same network.

Each individual layer of the TMDs consists of three atomic layers in\nwhich the transition metal is sandwiched by two chalcogens.

Most\nridepooling models face this problem through rebalancing methods only, i.e.,\nmoving idle vehicles towards areas with high rejections rate, which is done\nindependently from routing and vehicle-to-orders assignments, so that vehicles\nserving passengers (a large portion of the total fleet) remain unaffected. This\npaper introduces two types of techniques for anticipatory routing that affect\nhow vehicles are assigned to users and how to route vehicles to serve such\nusers, so that the whole operation of the system is modified to reach more\nefficient states for future requests. Both techniques do not require any\nassumption or exogenous knowledge about the future demand, as they depend only\non current and recent requests. Firstly, we introduce rewards that reduce the\ncost of an assignment between a vehicle and a group of passengers if the\nvehicle gets routed towards a high-demand zone. Secondly, we include a small\nset of artificial requests, whose request times are in the near future and\nwhose origins are sampled from a probability distribution that mimics observed\ngeneration rates. These artificial requests are to be assigned together with\nthe real requests.\n  We test these techniques using a set of real rides from Manhattan.\nIntroducing rewards can diminish the rejection rate to about nine-tenths of its\noriginal value. On the other hand, including future requests can reduce users'\ntraveling times by about one-fifth, but increasing rejections. Both methods\nincrease the vehicles-hour-traveled by about 10%. Spatial analysis reveals that\nvehicles are indeed moved towards the most demanded areas, such that the\nreduction in rejections rate is achieved mostly there.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 15:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Moreover, the feasible\nregion is small, and simple experiments, such as uniaxial tension/compression\nand hydrostatic tests, are on its boundaries. Therefore, strain energy\nfunctions can be easily constructed by the interpolation of experimental\ncurves, which does not need initial guessing in the form of the strain energy\nfunction as most existing phenomenological models do. The proposed strain\nenergy functions are perfectly consistent with the available experimental\ncurves for interpolation.

Customers buy subscriptions, not\nindividual pieces of content, and once subscribed they may consume many pieces\nof content in addition to the one(s) that drew them to the service. In this\npaper, we propose a scalable methodology to estimate the incremental\nacquisition impact of content launches in a subscription business model when\nrandomized experimentation is not feasible. Our approach uses simple\nassumptions to transform the problem into an equivalent question: what is the\nexpected consumption rate for new subscribers who did not join due to the\ncontent launch? We estimate this counterfactual rate using the consumption rate\nof new subscribers who joined just prior to launch, while making adjustments\nfor variation related to subscriber attributes, the in-product experience, and\nseasonality. We then compare our counterfactual consumption to the actual rate\nin order to back out an acquisition estimate. Our methodology provides top-line\nimpact estimates at the content / day / region grain. Additionally, to enable\nsubscriber-level attribution, we present an algorithm that assigns specific\nindividual accounts to add up to the top-line estimate. Subscriber-level\nattribution is derived by solving an optimization problem to minimize the\nnumber of subscribers attributed to more than one piece of content, while\nmaximizing the average propensity to be incremental for subscribers attributed\nto each piece of content. Finally, in the absence of definitive ground truth,\nwe present several validation methods which can be used to assess the\nplausibility of impact estimates generated by these methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Past works in this area focused on centralized Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS), assuming the existence of a central entity to perform\ndata analysis and identify threats. However, such IDS may not always be\nfeasible, mainly due to spread of data across multiple sources and gathering at\ncentral node can be costly. Also, the earlier works primarily focused on\nimproving True Positive Rate (TPR) and ignored the False Positive Rate (FPR),\nwhich is also essential to avoid unnecessary downtime of the systems. In this\npaper, we first present an architecture for IDS based on hybrid ensemble model,\nnamed PHEC, which gives improved performance compared to state-of-the-art\narchitectures. We then adapt this model to a federated learning framework that\nperforms local training and aggregates only the model parameters. Next, we\npropose Noise-Tolerant PHEC in centralized and federated settings to address\nthe label-noise problem. The proposed idea uses classifiers using weighted\nconvex surrogate loss functions. Natural robustness of KNN classifier towards\nnoisy data is also used in the proposed architecture. Experimental results on\nfour benchmark datasets drawn from various security attacks show that our model\nachieves high TPR while keeping FPR low on noisy and clean data. Further, they\nalso demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble models achieve performance in\nfederated settings close to that of the centralized settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 06:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Simulations using the model considered in this work produce good\nqualitative and quantitative results, but many parameters must be adjusted to\nreproduce a certain material behavior. The identification of model parameters\nis considered by solving an inverse problem that uses pseudo-experimental data\nto find the values that produce the best fit to the data. We apply a\nphysics-informed neural network and combine some classical estimation methods\nto identify the material parameters that appear in the damage equation of the\nmodel. Our strategy consists of a neural network that acts as an approximating\nfunction of the damage evolution with its output regularized using the residue\nof the differential equation. Three stages of optimization seek the best\npossible values for the neural network and the material parameters. The\ntraining alternates between the fitting of only the pseudo-experimental data or\nthe total loss that includes the regularizing terms. We test the robustness of\nthe method to noisy data and its generalization capabilities using a simple\nphysical case for the damage model. This procedure deals better with noisy data\nin comparison with a PDE-constrained optimization method, and it also provides\ngood approximations of the material parameters and the evolution of damage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 13:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Deep learning\nmodels often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is\noften derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately\navailable in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has\nunraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence\nof causality. While language representation models preserve contextual\nknowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships\nduring training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an\nexisting model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene\nunderstanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better\nperformance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring\nabout. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task\nof mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,\nthere does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by\njuxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and\neasy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are\ndenser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information\noffers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a\nframework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos\nand natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a\ncausal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error\nanalysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using\na two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models\n(BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 02:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

The assumptions are still waiting for an explanation.\nThere are many proposals in the literature for the next step. The\nspin-charge-family theory of one of us (N.S.M.B.) is offering the explanation\nfor not only all by the standard model assumed properties of quarks and leptons\nand antiquarks and antileptons, with the families included, of the vectors\ngauge fields, of the Higgs's scalar and Yukawa couplings, but also for the\nsecond quantization postulates of Dirac and for cosmological observations, like\nthere are the appearance of the dark matter, of matter-antimatter asymmetry,\nmaking several predictions. This theory proposes a simple starting action in $\nd\\ge (13+1)$ space with fermions interacting with the gravity only, what\nmanifests in $d=(3+1)$ as the vector and scalar gauge fields, and uses the odd\nClifford algebra objects to describe the internal space of fermions, what\nenables that the creation and annihilation operators for fermions fulfill the\nanticommutation relations for the second quantized fields without Dirac's\npostulates: Fermions single particle states already anticommute. We present in\nthis review article a short overview of the spin-charge-family theory,\nillustrating shortly on the toy model the breaks of the starting symmetries in\n$d=(13+1)$ space, which are triggered either by scalar fields -- the vielbeins\nwith the space index belonging to $d>(3+1)$ -- or by the condensate of the two\nright handed neutrinos, with the family quantum number not belonging to the\nobserved families.
