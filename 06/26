Selection of the\n40 REBELS targets was done by combining our own and other photometric\nselections, each of which is subject to extensive vetting using three\ncompletely independent sets of photometry and template-fitting codes. Building\non the observational strategy deployed in two pilot programs, we are increasing\nthe number of massive interstellar medium (ISM) reservoirs known at z>6.5 by\n~4-5x to >30. In this manuscript, we motivate the observational strategy\ndeployed in the REBELS program and present initial results. Based on the 60.6\nhours of ALMA observations taken in the first year of the program (November\n2019 to January 2020), 18 highly significant >~7sigma [CII] lines have already\nbeen discovered, the bulk of which (13/18) also show >~3.3 sigma dust-continuum\nemission. These newly discovered lines more than triple the number of bright\nISM-cooling lines known in the z>6.5 universe, such that the number of\nALMA-derived redshifts at z>6.5 already rival Lya redshift discoveries. An\nanalysis of the completeness of our search results vs. star formation rate\n(SFR) suggests an ~79% efficiency in scanning for [CII] when the SFR(UV+IR) is\nin excess of 28 M_sol/yr.

Here, we first derive the\nmass operator in momentum space of an off-shell electron in the presence of an\narbitrary plane wave. By taking the average of the mass operator in momentum\nspace over an on-shell electron state, we obtain a new representation,\nequivalent to but more compact than the known one computed in [Sov.

We show that within the locally constant\nfield approximation it is possible to conveniently define a local expression of\nthe electron anomalous magnetic moment, which reduces to the known expression\nin a constant crossed field.

However, this approach has a poor\nperformance in terms of resolution and specially for weak couplings, leading to\nunreasonably long simulation times. To overcome this, we introduce a technique\nto obtain the couplings directly from time signals, without moving to the\nfrequency domain. This procedure works for strong and weak couplings, with much\nshorter simulation times and a reduced simulation domain over the FFT approach.\nThis technique is used to design coupled resonator filter efficiently from time\ndomain simulations. We implement this procedure using the finite-difference\ntime-domain framework using an open source solver and discuss our\nimplementation.

Qualitative methods are difficult\nto scale upwards to include large number of players and are prone to subjective\nbiases. Other approaches such as visualization and analytical tools are either\ndesigned to provide an aggregated overview of the data, losing the nuances of\nindividual player behaviors, or, in the attempt of accounting for individual\nbehavior, are not specifically designed to reduce the visual cognitive load. In\nthis work, we propose a novel visualization technique that specifically\naddresses the tasks of comparing behavior sequences in order to capture an\noverview of the strategies enacted by players and at the same time examine\nindividual player behaviors to identify differences and outliers. This approach\nallows users to form hypotheses about player strategies and verify them. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the technique through a case study: utilizing\na prototype system to investigate data collected from a commercial educational\npuzzle game. While the prototype's usability can be improved, initial testing\nresults show that core features of the system proved useful to our potential\nusers for understanding player strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 16:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

However, the\nhyper-parameter flooding level of the flooding method fails to be selected\nproperly and uniformly. We propose a novel method called Jitter to improve it.\nJitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we\nrandomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The\nflooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target\nfunction and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random\nfactor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is\nconsistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the\nlearning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the\nmodel more robust.

This neglect of \"spin inertia\" is\nunphysical and would violate energy conservation. Recently, the LLG equation\nwas modified to account for inertia effects. The consensus, however, seems to\nbe that such effects would be unimportant in slow magneto-dynamics that take\nplace over time scales much longer that the relaxation time of the angular\nmomentum, which is typically few fs to perhaps ~100 ps in ferromagnets. Here,\nwe show that there is at least one very serious and observable effect of spin\ninertia even in slow magneto-dynamics. It involves the switching error\nprobability associated with flipping the magnetization of a nanoscale\nferromagnet with an external agent, such as a magnetic field. The switching may\ntake ~ns to complete when the field strength is close to the threshold value\nfor switching, which is much longer than the angular momentum relaxation time,\nand yet the effect of spin inertia is felt in the switching error probability.\nThis is because the ultimate fate of a switching trajectory, i.e. whether it\nresults in success or failure, is influenced by what happens in the first few\nps of the switching action when nutational dynamics due to spin inertia holds\nsway. Spin inertia increases the error probability, which makes the switching\nmore error-prone.

We calculate the decay rate of a particle of\nmass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero\nmomentum.

While the three problems share the nested structure, existing\nworks often treat them separately, and thus develop problem-specific algorithms\nand their analyses. Among various exciting developments, simple SGD-type\nupdates (potentially on multiple variables) are still prevalent in solving this\nclass of nested problems, but they are believed to have slower convergence rate\ncompared to that of the non-nested problems. This paper unifies several\nSGD-type updates for stochastic nested problems into a single SGD approach that\nwe term ALternating Stochastic gradient dEscenT (ALSET) method. By leveraging\nthe hidden smoothness of the problem, this paper presents a tighter analysis of\nALSET for stochastic nested problems.

We demonstrate a multipurpose ring oscillator design -\nProgrammable Ring Oscillator (PRO) to address both fault attacks and\nside-channel attacks in a generic, application-independent manner. PRO, as an\nintegrated primitive, can provide on-chip side-channel resistance, power\nmonitoring, and fault detection capabilities to a secure design. We present a\ngrid of PROs monitoring the on-chip power network to detect anomalies. Such\npower anomalies may be caused by external factors such as electromagnetic fault\ninjection and power glitches, as well as by internal factors such as hardware\nTrojans. By monitoring the frequency of the ring oscillators, we are able to\ndetect the on-chip power anomaly in time as well as in location. Moreover, we\nshow that the PROs can also inject a random noise pattern into a design's power\nconsumption. By randomly switching the frequency of a ring oscillator, the\nresulting power-noise pattern significantly reduces the power-based\nside-channel leakage of a cipher. We discuss the design of PRO and present\nmeasurement results on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA prototype, and we show that\nside-channel and fault vulnerabilities can be addressed at a low cost by\nintroducing PRO to the design.

This result is a step towards modeling\nother rewriting formalisms, such as lambda calculus and higher order rewriting,\nusing graph rewriting in a way that preserves properties like termination and\nconfluence. We moreover expect that the encoding can serve as a guide for\nlifting TRS termination methods to PBPO+ rewriting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 18:03:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 10:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Assessing the exact magnitude of this\nnumber is a non-trivial problem, as relying only on officially reported\nCOVID-19 associated fatalities runs the risk of incurring in several kinds of\nbiases. One of the ways to approach the issue is to compare overall mortality\nduring the pandemic with expected mortality computed using the observed\nmortality figures of previous years. In this paper, we build on existing\nmethodology and propose two ways to compute expected as well as excess\nmortality, namely at the weekly and at the yearly level. Particular focus is\nput on the role of age, which plays a central part in both COVID-19-associated\nand overall mortality.

The method\nis extended to chaotic problems by using discretization error estimates that\naccount for the statistical nature of common quantities of interest and the\naccompanying finite sampling errors that pollute estimates of such quantities\nof interest.

Characterizing the evolution of protoplanetary disks is necessary to\nimprove our understanding of planet formation. Constraints on both dust and gas\nare needed to determine the dominant disk dissipation mechanisms. Aims. We aim\nto compare the disk dust masses in the Chamaeleon II (Cha II) star-forming\nregion with other regions with ages between 1 and 10Myr. Methods. We use ALMA\nband 6 observations (1.3 mm) to survey 29 protoplanetary disks in Cha II. Dust\nmass estimates are derived from the continuum data. Results. Out of our initial\nsample of 29 disks, we detect 22 sources in the continuum, 10 in 12CO, 3 in\n13CO, and none in C18O (J=2-1). Additionally, we detect two companion\ncandidates in the continuum and 12CO emission. Most disk dust masses are lower\nthan 10Mearth, assuming thermal emission from optically thin dust. We compare\nconsistent estimations of the distributions of the disk dust mass and the\ndisk-to-stellar mass ratios in Cha II with six other low mass and isolated\nstar-forming regions in the age range of 1-10Myr: Upper Sco, CrA, IC 348, Cha\nI, Lupus, and Taurus. When comparing the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, we find\nthat the masses of disks in Cha II are statistically different from those in\nUpper Sco and Taurus, and we confirm that disks in Upper Sco, the oldest region\nof the sample, are statistically less massive than in all other regions.\nPerforming a second statistical test of the dust mass distributions from\nsimilar mass bins, we find no statistical differences between these regions and\nCha II. Conclusions. We interpret these trends, most simply, as a sign of\ndecline in the disk dust masses with time or dust evolution. Different global\ninitial conditions in star-forming regions may also play a role, but their\nimpact on the properties of a disk population is difficult to isolate in\nstar-forming regions lacking nearby massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 19:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

In contrast to local mechanics,\nperidynamic boundary conditions must be defined on a finite volume region\noutside the body. Therefore, theoretical and numerical challenges arise in\norder to properly formulate Dirichlet-type nonlocal boundary conditions, while\nconnecting them to the local counterparts. While a careless imposition of local\nboundary conditions leads to a smaller effective material stiffness close to\nthe boundary and an artificial softening of the material, several strategies\nwere proposed to avoid this unphysical surface effect.\n  In this work, we study convergence of solutions to nonlocal state-based\nlinear elastic model to their local counterparts as the interaction horizon\nvanishes, under different formulations and smoothness assumptions for nonlocal\nDirichlet-type boundary conditions. Our results provide explicit rates of\nconvergence that are sensitive to the compatibility of the nonlocal boundary\ndata and the extension of the solution for the local model. In particular,\nunder appropriate assumptions, constant extensions yield $\\frac{1}{2}$ order\nconvergence rates and linear extensions yield $\\frac{3}{2}$ order convergence\nrates.

The first is\nan extension of the seminal Revolve algorithm adapted to multistage schemes.\nThe second algorithm, named CAMS, is developed based on dynamic programming,\nand it requires the least number of recomputations when compared with other\nalgorithms. The CAMS algorithm is made publicly available in a library with\nbindings to C and Python. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed\nalgorithms can deliver up to two times the speedup compared with that of\nclassical Revolve.

Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust\ndistance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or\noutliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that\ncan not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing\nmethods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning\npattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex\nand less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called\nSelf-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.\nNotably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each\niteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into\ntraining. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal\nprojection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is\npresented to show the rationality of SPCA.

HSM uses the spectral space of ultrashort laser pulses to\ncreate line codes in the form of 2D holograms. The pulse processing is\nperformed in the temporal Fourier domain by spatially dispersing the pulse\nfrequency components in a spectral processing device (SPD). The 2D holograms\nare composed of the patterns of intensity disparities that an SLM inscribes on\nthe spectrally-decomposed Fourier plane of the pulse. The holographic line\ncodes defined in this way transform the ultrashort laser pulses into\nhigh-entropy data symbols, hence, enhance the communication's spectral\nefficiency. Unlike conventional optical multiplexing schemes (e.g., TDM, WDM,\nor SDM), HSM does not physically or abstractly separate the communication\npropagation space into subchannels. Rather, HSM realizes a MIMO communication\nparadigm by allowing the photonic waves under the pulse envelope to propagate\nin the same space so they scatter and interfere by chromatic dispersion. This\nallows HSM to form beams between the pixels of SLM at the sender and receiver\nsides and optimize the beam to adapt to channel scattering situations. In this\nway, HSM delivers a rate gain that in the best case exponentially increases the\ninformation rate of communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 21:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 17:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

In this work, we\nshow that data heterogeneity can in fact be exploited to improve generalization\nperformance through implicit regularization. One way to alleviate the effects\nof heterogeneity is to encourage the alignment of gradients across different\nclients throughout training. Our analysis reveals that this goal can be\naccomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the\nimplicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as\nimprovements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in\nSGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during\ntraining, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches. To\nobtain the generalization benefits of this regularization while increasing\nparallelism, we propose a novel GradAlign algorithm that induces the same\nimplicit regularization while allowing the use of arbitrarily large batches in\neach update. We experimentally validate the benefits of our algorithm in\ndifferent distributed and federated learning settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 22:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Here, we\nshow it is possible to closely approximate the interaction between neurons and\nsynapses -- the building blocks of natural and artificial neural networks --\nconstructed by liquid time-constant networks (LTCs) efficiently in closed-form.\nTo this end, we compute a tightly-bounded approximation of the solution of an\nintegral appearing in LTCs' dynamics, that has had no known closed-form\nsolution so far. This closed-form solution substantially impacts the design of\ncontinuous-time and continuous-depth neural models; for instance, since time\nappears explicitly in closed-form, the formulation relaxes the need for complex\nnumerical solvers. Consequently, we obtain models that are between one and five\norders of magnitude faster in training and inference compared to differential\nequation-based counterparts.

Our main objective is to\nuse public data from the Gaia Mission, VVV, 2MASS and WISE in order to measure\nthe physical parameters of Minni48, a new candidate GC located in the inner\nbulge of the Galaxy at l=359.35 deg, b=2.79 deg. Even though there is a bright\nforeground star contaminating the field, the cluster appears quite bright in\nnear- and mid-IR images. We obtain deep decontaminated optical and near-IR\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for this cluster. The heliocentric cluster\ndistance is determined from the red clump (RC) and the red giant branch (RGB)\ntip magnitudes in the near-IR CMD, while the cluster metallicity is estimated\nfrom the RGB slope and the fit to theoretical isochrones. The GC size is found\nto be r = 6' +/- 1', while reddening and extinction values are E(J-Ks)=0.60 +/-\n0.05 mag, A_G=3.23 +/- 0.10 mag, A_Ks=0.45 +/- 0.05 mag. The resulting mean\nGaia proper motions are PMRA=-3.5 +/- 0.5 mas/yr, PMDEC=-6.0 +/- 0.5 mas/yr.\nThe IR magnitude of the RC yields an accurate distance modulus estimate of\n(m-M)_0=14.61 mag, equivalent to a distance D=8.4 +/- 1.0 kpc. This is\nconsistent with the optical distance estimate: (m-M)_0=14.67 mag, D=8.6 +/- 1.0\nkpc, and with the RGB tip distance: (m-M)_0=14.45 mag, D=7.8 +/- 1.0 kpc. The\nderived metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.20 +/- 0.30 dex. A good fit to the PARSEC\nstellar isochrones is obtained in all CMDs using Age = 10 +/- 2 Gyr. The total\nabsolute magnitude of this GC is estimated to be M_Ks= -9.04 +/- 0.66 mag.\nBased on its position, kinematics, metallicity and age, we conclude that\nMinni48 is a genuine GC, similar to other well known metal-rich bulge GCs. It\nis located at a projected Galactocentric angular distance of 2.9 deg,\nequivalent to 0.4 kpc, being one of the closest GCs to the Galactic centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 22:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

A commonly used approach to assist in transferring\nstyles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based\noptimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and\ntheir styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated\nwith specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style\nimage exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware\nmulti-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while\npreserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images.

While many efforts have\nbeen made to develop architectural capabilities for enforcing confidential\nsmart contracts, a few works arise to extend confidential smart contracts to\nMulti-Party Computation (MPC), i.e., multiple parties jointly evaluate a\ntransaction off-chain and commit the outputs on-chain without revealing their\nsecret inputs/outputs to each other. However, existing solutions lack public\nverifiability and require O(n) transactions to enable negotiation or resist\nadversaries, thus suffering from inefficiency and compromised security. In this\npaper, we propose Cloak, a framework for enabling Multi-Party Transaction (MPT)\non existing blockchains. An MPT refers to transitioning blockchain states by an\npublicly verifiable off-chain MPC. We identify and handle the challenges of\nsecuring MPT by harmonizing TEE and blockchain. Consequently, Cloak secures the\noff-chain nondeterministic negotiation process (a party joins an MPT without\nknowing identities or the total number of parties until the MPT proposal\nsettles), achieves public verifiability (the public can validate that the MPT\ncorrectly handles the secret inputs/outputs from multiple parties and\nreads/writes states on-chain), and resists Byzantine adversaries. According to\nour proof, Cloak achieves better security with only 2 transactions, superior to\nprevious works that achieve compromised security at O(n) transactions cost. By\nevaluating examples and real-world MPTs, the gas cost of Cloak reduces by 32.4%\non average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 02:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 03:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 11:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 13:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 20:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

However, such frequently triggered and longer\ncompletion results reduce the overall precision as they generate more invalid\nresults.

To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method named\nDual-stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning (DRDL), which is quite\nefficient in learning domain-invariant features. In DRDL, two encoders are\nfirst constructed for id-related and id-unrelated feature extractions, which\nare respectively measured by their associated classifiers.

The strong emission lines from the NLR are useful\nto diagnose physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium in AGN\nhost galaxies. However, the origin of the NLR is unclear; the gas clouds in\nNLRs may be originally in the host and photoionized by the AGN radiation, or\nthey may be transferred from the nucleus with AGN-driven outflows. For studying\nthe origin of the NLR, we systematically investigate the gas density and\nvelocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds using a large spectroscopic data set\ntaken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The [S II] emission-line flux ratio\nand [O III] velocity width of 9,571 type-2 Seyfert galaxies and 110,041\nstar-forming galaxies suggest that the gas density and velocity dispersion of\nNLR clouds in Seyfert galaxies (ne ~ 194 cm-3 and sigma([O III]) ~ 147 km s-1)\nare systematically larger than those of clouds in H II regions of star-forming\ngalaxies (ne ~ 29 cm-3 and sigma([O III]) ~ 58 km s-1). Interestingly, the\nelectron density and velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds are larger for\nSeyfert galaxies with a higher [O III]/Hbeta flux ratio, i.e., with a more\nactive AGN. We also investigate the spatially-resolved kinematics of ionized\ngas clouds using the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory\n(MaNGA) survey data for 90 Seyfert galaxies and 801 star-forming galaxies. We\nfind that the velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds in Seyfert galaxies is\nlarger than that in star-forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass, at both\ncentral and off-central regions.

We quantify the amount of depletion\nneeded to solve the Lithium problem, and show that transport processes of\nchemical elements in stars are able to account for it. Specifically, the\ncombination of atomic diffusion, rotation and penetrative convection allows us\nto reproduce the lithium surface abundances of Population II stars, starting\nfrom the primordial Lithium abundance.

This preference is driven by the\nrecently noticed discrepancy between the best-fit values for the\nbaryon-to-photon ratio (or equivalently the Deuterium abundance) inferred from\ncosmic microwave background and primordial nucleosynthesis analyses, and is\nlargely insensitive to the Helium-4 abundance.

To enable MIMO\nchannel estimation, the LTF is repeated as many times as the number of spatial\nstreams. For MU-MIMO, the CSI feedback in the 802.11ac/ax requires the access\npoint (AP) to send a null data packet (NDP) where the HT/VHT/HE LTF is repeated\nas many times as the number of transmit antennas $N_{t}$. With each LTF being\n4$\\mu$s long in case of VHT and 12$\\mu$s to 16$\\mu$s long in case of High\nEfficiency WLAN (HEW), the length of NDP grows linearly with increasing\n$N_{t}$. Furthermore, the station (STA) with $N_{r}$ receive antennas needs to\nexpend significant processing power to compute SVD per tone for the\n$N_{r}\\times N_{t}$ channel matrix for generating the feedback bits, which\nagain increases linearly with $N_{t}\\cdot N_{r}$. To reduce the training and\nfeedback overhead, this paper proposes a scheme based on Compressed Sensing\nthat allows only a subset of tones per LTF to be transmitted in NDP, which can\nbe used by STA to compute channel estimates that are then sent back without any\nfurther processing. Since AP knows the measurement matrix, the full dimension\ntime domain channel estimates can be recovered by running the L1 minimization\nalgorithms (OMP, CoSAMP). AP can further process the time domain channel\nestimates to generate the SVD precoding matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 13:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

It is,\nfurthermore, difficult to directly evaluate differing approaches on a\nlike-for-like basis without recourse to the underlying algorithms and\ncomputational workflows. To this end, the cityseer-api Python package is here\nused to develop, compute, and compare a range of centrality methods which are\nthen applied to the Ordnance Survey Open Roads dataset for Greater London. The\ncentralities are correlated to high-resolution land-use and mixed-used measures\ncomputed from the Ordnance Survey Points of Interest dataset for the same\npoints of analysis using a spatially precise methodology based on network\ndistances to premise locations. The comparisons show that mixed-uses correlate\nmore strongly against closeness than betweenness centralities; segmented\nmeasures tend to offer slightly stronger correlations than node-based\nequivalents; weighted variants offer correlations similar to unweighted\nversions, but with a greater degree of spatial specificity; simplest-path\nmethods confer an advantage in the context of local high-street mixed-uses but\nnot necessarily for district-wide mixed-uses or land-use accessibilities; and\nthe application of centrality measures to the dual network does not offer\ntangible benefits over the primal network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 15:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 07:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

However, whereas mixed-use urbanism\nis clearly beneficial, methods for measuring and assessing the presence of\nmixed-uses at a granular level of analysis remain murkier. This work\ndemonstrates techniques for gauging mixed-uses in more spatially precise terms\nconcurring more readily with an urbanist's conception of pedestrian-accessible\nmixed-uses. It does so through the use of the cityseer-api Python package,\nwhich facilitates the use of spatially granular land-use classification data\nassigned to adjacent street edges and then aggregated dynamically, with\ndistances measured from each point of analysis to each accessible land-use\nwhile taking the direction of approach into account. It is argued that Hill\nNumbers is a suitable measure of diversity because it can mirror the intent of\ntraditional indices while behaving more intuitively. Further, distance-weighted\nformulations of Hill diversity can be applied with spatial impedances, thus\nconferring a particularly spatially nuanced gauge of local access to\nmixed-uses.

If an oncoming relapse can be predicted on\ntime, for example by detecting early behavioral changes in patients, then\ninterventions could be provided to prevent the relapse. In this work, we\ninvestigated a machine learning based schizophrenia relapse prediction model\nusing mobile sensing data to characterize behavioral features. A\npatient-independent model providing sequential predictions, closely\nrepresenting the clinical deployment scenario for relapse prediction, was\nevaluated. The model uses the mobile sensing data from the recent four weeks to\npredict an oncoming relapse in the next week. We used the behavioral rhythm\nfeatures extracted from daily templates of mobile sensing data, self-reported\nsymptoms collected via EMA (Ecological Momentary Assessment), and demographics\nto compare different classifiers for the relapse prediction. Naive Bayes based\nmodel gave the best results with an F2 score of 0.083 when evaluated in a\ndataset consisting of 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to a\nyear. The obtained F2 score, though low, is better than the baseline\nperformance of random classification (F2 score of 0.02 $\\pm$ 0.024). Thus,\nmobile sensing has predictive value for detecting an oncoming relapse and needs\nfurther investigation to improve the current performance.

While\nGaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,\nthey have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and\nmultiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of\ndata-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that\nutilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference\nto address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built\nupon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical\nfactors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of\nmixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the\nlarge training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address\nthe scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear\ncombination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel\nstructure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.\nComparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large\ndatasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art\nmachine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In\naddition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the\neffect of categorical factors, such as those associated with building blocks of\narchitectures and element choices in metamaterial and materials design.

To estimate the single\nfrequency component that relates to the susceptibility induced field, it is\nrequired to maintain consistency with the measured phase after background\nsuppression, penalized by a unity rank approximation (URA) prior.

The paper\nargues that continued innovation in pharmaceutical AI will enable rapid\ndevelopment of safe and effective therapies for previously untreatable\ndiseases. A series of major points support this conclusion: The pharmaceutical\nindustry is in a significant productivity crisis today, and AI-enabled research\nmethods can be directly applied to reduce the time and cost of drug discovery\nprojects. The industry already reported results such as a 10-fold reduction in\ndrug molecule discovery times.

While\nmultiple algorithmic techniques and refinements have been proposed, the\ngreenhouse gas target spectrum used for concentration enh. estimation has\nremained largely unaltered since the introduction of quantitative MF\nretrievals. The magnitude of retrieved methane and carbon dioxide enh., and\nthereby integrated mass enh. (IME) and estimated flux of point-source emitters,\nis heavily dependent on this target spectrum. Current standard use of molecular\nabsorption coefficients to create unit enh. target spectra does not account for\nabsorption by background concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar and sensor\ngeometry, or atmospheric water vapor absorption. We introduce geometric and\natmospheric parameters into the generation of scene-specific (SS) unit enh.\nspectra to provide target spectra that are compatible with all greenhouse gas\nretrieval MF techniques. For methane plumes, IME resulting from use of\nstandard, generic enh. spectra varied from -22 to +28.7% compared to SS enh.\nspectra. Due to differences in spectral shape between the generic and SS enh.\nspectra, differences in methane plume IME were linked to surface spectral\ncharacteristics in addition to geometric and atmospheric parameters. IME\ndifferences for carbon dioxide plumes, with generic enh. spectra producing\nintegrated mass enh. -76.1 to -48.1% compared to SS enh. spectra. Fluxes\ncalculated from these integrated enh. would vary by the same %s, assuming\nequivalent wind conditions. Methane and carbon dioxide IME were most sensitive\nto changes in solar zenith angle and ground elevation. SS target spectra can\nimprove confidence in greenhouse gas retrievals and flux estimates across\ncollections of scenes with diverse geometric and atmospheric conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 17:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 18:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

Low inter-reader reliability\n(IRR) can be seen between experts when interpreting challenging cases. While\nteams-based decisions are known to outperform individual decisions,\ninter-personal biases often creep up in group interactions which limit\nnon-dominant participants from expressing true opinions. To overcome the dual\nproblems of low consensus and inter-personal bias, we explored a solution\nmodeled on biological swarms of bees. Two separate cohorts; three radiologists\nand five radiology residents collaborated on a digital swarm platform in real\ntime and in a blinded fashion, grading meniscal lesions on knee MR exams. These\nconsensus votes were benchmarked against clinical (arthroscopy) and\nradiological (senior-most radiologist) observations. The IRR of the consensus\nvotes was compared to the IRR of the majority and most confident votes of the\ntwo cohorts.The radiologist cohort saw an improvement of 23% in IRR of swarm\nvotes over majority vote. Similar improvement of 23% in IRR in 3-resident swarm\nvotes over majority vote, was observed. The 5-resident swarm had an even higher\nimprovement of 32% in IRR over majority vote. Swarm consensus votes also\nimproved specificity by up to 50%. The swarm consensus votes outperformed\nindividual and majority vote decisions in both the radiologists and resident\ncohorts. The 5-resident swarm had higher IRR than 3-resident swarm indicating\npositive effect of increased swarm size. The attending and resident swarms also\noutperformed predictions from a state-of-the-art A.I. algorithm. Utilizing a\ndigital swarm platform improved agreement and allows participants to express\njudgement free intent, resulting in superior clinical performance and robust\nA.I. training labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 06:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 23:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

However, we are often interested in the time\ndiagonal of such a Green's function or time dependent physical observables that\nare functions of one time. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using\ndynamic model decomposition (DMD), a data-driven model order reduction\ntechnique, to characterize one-time observables associated with the\nnonequilibrium dynamics using snapshots computed within a small time window.\nThe DMD method allows us to efficiently predict long time dynamics from a\nlimited number of trajectory samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMD\non a model two-band system. We show that, in the equilibrium limit, the DMD\nanalysis yields results that are consistent with those produced from a linear\nresponse analysis. In the nonequilibrium case, the extrapolated dynamics\nproduced by DMD is more accurate than a special Fourier extrapolation scheme\npresented in this paper. We point out a potential pitfall of the standard DMD\nmethod caused by insufficient spatial/momentum resolution of the discretization\nscheme. We show how this problem can be overcome by using a variant of the DMD\nmethod known as higher order DMD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 05:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}
