Determining the physical size of these structures is\nimportant for understanding the local interstellar structure and for modeling\nthe Galactic magnetic field.

We revisit a classical method of\nfinding the location of radio spurs by comparing optical polarization angles\nwith those of synchrotron emission as a function of distance. We consider three\ntracers of the magnetic field: stellar polarization, polarized synchrotron\nradio emission, and polarized thermal dust emission. We employ archival\nmeasurements of optical starlight polarization and Gaia distances, and\nconstruct a new map of polarized synchrotron emission from WMAP and Planck\ndata. We confirm that synchrotron, dust emission, and stellar polarization\nangles all show a statistically significant alignment at high Galactic\nlatitude. We obtain distance limits to three regions towards Loop I of\n112$\\pm$17 pc, 135$\\pm$20 pc, and $<105$ pc. Our results strongly suggest that\nthe polarized synchrotron emission towards the North Polar Spur at $b >\n30^\\circ$ is local. This is consistent with the conclusions of earlier work\nbased on stellar polarization and extinction, but in stark contrast with the\nGalactic center origin recently revisited on the basis of X-ray data.

We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial\ndata structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to\nfacilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive\nsubdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we\ndevise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex\ndecomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a\nshape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of\nplanes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network\nweights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.\nThe generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited\nto represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net\nis competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer\nprimitives.

In this\nwork, we study the English BERT family and use two probing techniques to\nanalyze how fine-tuning changes the space.

We confirm this hypothesis with carefully\ndesigned experiments on five different NLP tasks. Via these experiments, we\nalso discover an exception to the prevailing wisdom that \"fine-tuning always\nimproves performance\".

The targeted use case is massive\nmachine type communication (mMTC) with grant-free access in the uplink, where\nthe network is required to host a large number of low data rate devices\ntransmitting in an uncoordinated fashion. Four types of WL receivers are\ninvestigated, namely the WL zero-forcing (ZF) and the WL minimum meansquared\nerror (MMSE) receivers, along with their enhanced versions employing successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) with channel-dependent ordering, i.e., the\nWL-ZF-SIC and WL-MMSE-SIC receivers. The outage performances of these receivers\nare analytically characterized in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime\nand compared to those of conventional linear (CL) receivers using\ncomplex-valued modulation schemes. For the non-SIC receivers, we show that,\nwhen compared to the CL counterparts, the WL receivers yield a higher diversity\ngain when decoding the same number of users and have the same diversity gain\nbut a decreased coding gain when the number of users is nearly doubled. The\noutage performance analysis of WL-SIC receivers is facilitated by the marginal\ndistribution of ordered eigenvalues of a real-valued Wishart matrix. It is\nshown that the SIC operation with channel-dependent ordering brings no\nadditional diversity gain to the WL receivers but instead increases the coding\ngain. Moreover, the coding gain of WL-SIC receivers grows as the number of\nusers increases and even exceeds that of CL-SIC receivers under suitable\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 17:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

The re-calibrated ARGOS survey - which we refer to as the\nA2A survey - is combined with the APOGEE survey to investigate the abundance\nstructure of the Galactic bulge. We find X-shaped [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]\ndistributions in the bulge that are more pinched than the bulge density, a\nsignature of its disk origin. The mean abundance along the major axis of the\nbar varies such that the stars are more [Fe/H]-poor and [Mg/Fe]-rich near the\nGalactic center than in the long bar/outer bulge region. The vertical [Fe/H]\nand [Mg/Fe] gradients vary between the inner bulge and long bar with the inner\nbulge showing a flattening near the plane that is absent in the long bar. The\n[Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] distribution shows two main maxima, an ``[Fe/H]-poor [Mg/Fe]-\nrich'' maximum and an ``[Fe/H]-rich [Mg/Fe]-poor'' maximum, that vary in\nstrength with position in the bulge. In particular, the outer long bar close to\nthe Galactic plane is dominated by super-solar [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe]-normal stars.\nStars composing the [Fe/H]-rich maximum show little kinematic dependence on\n[Fe/H], but for lower [Fe/H] the rotation and dispersion of the bulge increase\nslowly. Stars with [Fe/H]<-1 dex have a very different kinematic structure than\nstars with higher [Fe/H]. Comparing with recent models for the Galactic\nboxy-peanut bulge, the abundance gradients and distribution, and the relation\nbetween [Fe/H] and kinematics suggest that the stars comprising each maximum\nhave separate disk origins with the ``[Fe/H]-poor [Mg/Fe]-rich'' stars\noriginating from a thicker disk than the ``[Fe/H]-rich [Mg/Fe]-poor'' stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 17:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Due to its dynamic\nproperties and extensive dependencies on third-party libraries without type\nannotations, the performance of traditional static analysis techniques is\nlimited. Although semantics in source code can help manifest intended usage for\nvariables (thus help infer types), they are usually ignored by existing tools.\nIn this paper, we propose PYInfer, an end-to-end learning-based type inference\ntool that automatically generates type annotations for Python variables. The\nkey insight is that contextual code semantics is critical in inferring the type\nfor a variable. For each use of a variable, we collect a few tokens within its\ncontextual scope, and design a neural network to predict its type. One\nchallenge is that it is difficult to collect a high-quality human-labeled\ntraining dataset for this purpose. To address this issue, we apply an existing\nstatic analyzer to generate the ground truth for variables in source code.\n  Our main contribution is a novel approach to statically infer variable types\neffectively and efficiently. Formulating the type inference as a classification\nproblem, we can handle user-defined types and predict type probabilities for\neach variable. Our model achieves 91.2% accuracy on classifying 11 basic types\nin Python and 81.2% accuracy on classifying 500 most common types. Our results\nsubstantially outperform the state-of-the-art type annotators. Moreover,\nPYInfer achieves 5.2X more code coverage and is 187X faster than a\nstate-of-the-art learning-based tool. With similar time consumption, our model\nannotates 5X more variables than a state-of-the-art static analysis tool. Our\nmodel also outperforms a learning-based function-level annotator on annotating\ntypes for variables and function arguments.

Some methods directly output the latent sharp\nimage in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (\\eg\nmulti-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp\nimage. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The\ncomputational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is\napplied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform\nblur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open\nproblem.

In this paper, we extend the ability of a deep neural\nnetwork based astronomical target detection algorithm to make it suitable for\nphotometry and astrometry, by adding two new branches. Because the photometry\nand astrometry neural network are data-driven regression algorithms, limited\ntraining data with limited diversity would introduce the epistemic uncertainty\nto final regression results. Therefore, we further investigate the epistemic\nuncertainty of our algorithm and have found that differences of background\nnoises and differences of point spread functions between the training data and\nthe real would introduce uncertainties to final measurements. To reduce this\neffect, we propose to use transfer learning strategy to train the neural\nnetwork with real data. The algorithm proposed in this paper could obtain\ntypes, positions and magnitudes of celestial objects with high accuracy and\ncost around 0.125 second to process an image, regardless of its size.

Recently, such controllers were introduced for the 1D heat equation,\nunder the assumption that one of the observation or control operators is\nbounded. This paper suggests a constructive method for such controllers for 1D\nparabolic PDEs with both (observation and control) operators being unbounded.\nWe consider the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) under either boundary or\nin-domain point measurement and boundary actuation. We employ a modal\ndecomposition approach via dynamic extension, using eigenfunctions of a\nSturm-Liouville operator. The controller dimension is defined by the number of\nunstable modes, whereas the observer dimension $N$ may be larger than this\nnumber. We suggest a direct Lyapunov approach to the full-order closed-loop\nsystem, which results in an LMI whose elements and dimension depend on $N$. The\nvalue of $N$ and the decay rate are obtained from the LMI. We extend our\napproach to internal stabilization with guaranteed $L^2$-gain and\ninput-to-state stabilization. We prove two crucial properties of the derived\nLMIs. First, We prove that the LMIs are always feasible provided $N$ and the\n$L^2$ or ISS gains are large enough, thereby obtaining guarantees for our\napproach. Moreover, for the case of stabilization, we show that feasibility of\nthe LMI for some $N$ implies its feasibility for $N+1$ (i.e., enlarging $N$ in\nthe LMI cannot deteriorate the resulting decay rate of the closed-loop system).\nNumerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 05:30:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 15:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

We consider here a scenario where\nthe learning agent has the ability to collect online experiences through direct\ninteractions with the environment (interventional data), but has also access to\na large collection of offline experiences, obtained by observing another agent\ninteracting with the environment (observational data). A key ingredient, that\nmakes this situation non-trivial, is that we allow the observed agent to\ninteract with the environment based on hidden information, which is not\nobserved by the learning agent. We then ask the following questions: can the\nonline and offline experiences be safely combined for learning a causal model ?\nAnd can we expect the offline experiences to improve the agent's performances ?\nTo answer these questions, we import ideas from the well-established causal\nframework of do-calculus, and we express model-based reinforcement learning as\na causal inference problem. Then, we propose a general yet simple methodology\nfor leveraging offline data during learning. In a nutshell, the method relies\non learning a latent-based causal transition model that explains both the\ninterventional and observational regimes, and then using the recovered latent\nvariable to infer the standard POMDP transition model via deconfounding.

Such potential wells allow for the\npossibility of controlled ejection of solitons with significantly high speeds.\nAt the outset, we describe the scattering setup and characterise the soliton\nejection in terms of the different parameters of the system. Then, we formulate\na theoretical model revealing the underlying physics of soliton ejection. The\nmodel is based on energy and norm exchange between the incident soliton and a\nstable trapped mode corresponding to an exact solution of the governing\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation. Remarkably, stationary solitons can lead to\nhigh-speed soliton ejection where part of the nonlinear interaction energy\ntransforms to translational kinetic energy of the ejected soliton. Our\ninvestigation shows that soliton ejection always occurs whenever the incident\nsoliton norm is greater than that of the trapped mode while their energy is\nalmost the same. Once the incident soliton is trapped, the excess in norm turns\nto an ejected soliton in addition to a small amount of radiation that share\ntranslational kinetic energy. We found that higher ejection speeds are obtained\nwith multi-node trapped modes that have larger binding energy. Simultaneous\ntwo-soliton ejection has been also induced by two solitons scattering with the\npotential from both of its sides.

As\ntransmission decreases, understanding heterogeneity in risk at fine spatial\nscales becomes increasingly important. However, there are challenges in using\nhealth system data for high-resolution risk mapping: health facilities have\nundefined and overlapping catchment areas, and report on an inconsistent basis.\nWe propose a novel inferential framework for risk mapping of malaria incidence\ndata based on formal down-scaling of confirmed case data reported through the\nhealth system in Zambia. We combine data from large community intervention\ntrials in 2011-2016 and model health facility catchments based upon\ntreatment-seeking behaviours; our model for monthly incidence is an aggregated\nlog-Gaussian Cox process, which allows us to predict incidence at fine scale.\nWe predicted monthly malaria incidence at 5km$^2$ resolution nationally:\nwhereas 4.8 million malaria cases were reported through the health system in\n2016, we estimated that the number of cases occurring at the community level\nwas closer to 10 million. As Zambia continues to scale up community-based\nreporting of malaria incidence, these outputs provide realistic estimates of\ncommunity-level malaria burden as well as high resolution risk maps for\ntargeting interventions at the sub-catchment level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 07:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

However, most existing deep learning-based\nmethods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these\nalgorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of\nexploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and\nundetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose\ninformation in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal\nresult. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced\nInformation Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently\nmodel the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of\nlayer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation\nmechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the\nDGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the\nprior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the\nopacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other\nhand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information\nAggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent\nlayer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale\nRefinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at\nthe refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details.

Since EF allocations barely exist even\nwithout budget constraints, we are interested in the relaxed notion of\nenvy-freeness up to one item (EF1).

The final morphology and\nhence the properties of the film often depend on the time needed for the\nevaporation of the solvents. This is typically the case for organic photoactive\nor electronic layers. Therefore, it is important to be able to predict the\nevaporation kinetics of such mixtures. We propose here a new phase-field model\nfor the simulation of evaporating fluid mixtures and simulate their evaporation\nkinetics. Similar to the Hertz-Knudsen theory, the local liquid-vapor\nequilibrium is assumed to be reached at the film surface and evaporation is\ndriven by diffusion away from this gas layer. In the situation where the\nevaporation is purely driven by the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the simulations\nmatch the behavior expected theoretically from the free energy: for evaporation\nof pure solvents, the evaporation rate is constant and proportional to the\nvaporpressure. For mixtures, the evaporation rate is in general strongly\ntime-dependent because of the changing composition of the film. Nevertheless,\nfor highly non-ideal mixtures, such as poorly compatible fluids or polymer\nsolutions, the evaporation rate becomes almost constant in the limit of low\nBiot numbers. The results of the simulation have been successfully compared to\nexperiments on a polystyrene-toluene mixture. The model allows to take into\naccount deformations of the liquid-vapor interface and therefore to simulate\nfilm roughness or dewetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 08:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 14:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 08:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal\ndata augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder\n(DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue.

As the number of\ninstances can be greatly increased by this algorithm, we apply a false positive\npruning using uncertainty estimates aggregated over instances.

However, in the two-stage detectors, due to the\nexcessive use of hand-crafted components, it is very difficult to reason about\nthe implicit relationship of the instance features. To tackle this problem, we\nanalyze three different levels of feature interaction relationships, namely,\nthe dependency relationship between the cropped local features and global\nfeatures, the feature autocorrelation within the instance, and the\ncross-correlation relationship between the instances. To this end, we propose a\nmore compact object detector head network (CODH), which can not only preserve\nglobal context information and condense the information density, but also\nallows instance-wise feature enhancement and relational reasoning in a larger\nmatrix space. Without bells and whistles, our method can effectively improve\nthe detection performance while significantly reducing the parameters of the\nmodel, e.g., with our method, the parameters of the head network is 0.6 times\nsmaller than the state-of-the-art Cascade R-CNN, yet the performance boost is\n1.3% on COCO test-dev.

These issues can be summarized as the inconsistency between\nforeground and background, which includes appearance inconsistency (e.g.,\nincompatible illumination), geometry inconsistency (e.g., unreasonable size),\nand semantic inconsistency (e.g., mismatched semantic context). Previous works\ndivide image composition task into multiple sub-tasks, in which each sub-task\ntargets at one or more issues. Specifically, object placement aims to find\nreasonable scale, location, and shape for the foreground. Image blending aims\nto address the unnatural boundary between foreground and background. Image\nharmonization aims to adjust the illumination statistics of foreground. Shadow\ngeneration aims to generate plausible shadow for the foreground. By putting all\nthe abovementioned efforts together, we can acquire realistic composite images.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no previous survey on image composition.\nIn this paper, we conduct comprehensive survey over the sub-tasks of image\ncomposition. For each sub-task, we summarize the traditional methods, deep\nlearning based methods, datasets and evaluation. We also point out the\nlimitations of existing methods in each sub-task and the problem of the whole\nimage composition task.

This\nmemory of reionization survives cosmological time scales because high-entropy\nmean-density gas is heated to $\\sim 3\\times10^4$ K by reionization, which is\ninhomogeneous, and subsequent shocks from denser regions. In the near future,\nthe first measurements of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest 3D power spectrum will be very\nlikely achieved by upcoming observational efforts such as the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In addition to abundant cosmological\ninformation, these observations have the potential to extract the astrophysics\nof reionization from the Ly$\\alpha$ forest. We forecast, for the first time,\nthe accuracy with which the measurements of Ly$\\alpha$ forest 3D power spectrum\ncan place constraints on the reionization parameters with DESI.

By looking at integral energy fluxes, we pose and\nanswer the question of which flow performs better at creating flow rate. We\ndefine a flow {\\em efficiency}, that quantifies the fraction of power used to\nproduce flow rate instead of being wasted as a turbulent overhead; {\\em\neffectiveness}, instead, describes the amount of flow rate produced by a given\npower. The work by Gatti \\emph{et al.} (\\emph{J. Fluid Mech.} vol.857, 2018,\npp. 345--373), where the constant power input (CPI) concept was developed to\ncompare turbulent Poiseuille flows with drag reduction, is here extended to\ncompare different flows. By decomposing the mean velocity field into a laminar\ncontribution and a deviation, analytical expressions are derived which are the\nenergy-flux equivalents of the FIK identity. These concepts are applied to\nliterature data supplemented by a new set of direct numerical simulations, to\nfind that Couette flows are less efficient but more effective than Poiseuille\nones. The reason is traced to the more effective laminar component of Couette\nflows, which compensates for their higher turbulent activity. It is also\nobserved that, when the fluctuating fields of the two flows are fed with the\nsame total power fraction, Couette flows dissipate a smaller percentage of it\nvia turbulent dissipation. A decomposition of the fluctuating field into large\nand small scales explains this feature: Couette flows develop stronger\nlarge-scale structures, which alter the mean flow while contributing less\nsignificantly to dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 09:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

These messages are then translated into actions\nperformed on or by game objects towards achieving the game's objectives. A\ngame's interaction model is the bridge between the player's interaction and its\nin-game actions by defining what the player may and may not act upon at any\ngiven moment. This makes the choice of interaction technique, its associated\nactions, and interaction model critical for designing games that are engaging,\nimmersive, and intuitive to play. This paper presents a study focused on\nOne-Touch-Gesture mobile games, with the aim of identifying the touch gestures\nused in popular games of this type, the types of in-game actions associated\nwith these gestures, and the interaction models used by these games. The study\nwas conducted by reviewing 77 of the most popular games in the last two years\nthrough playtesting by two researchers. The results of the study contribute to\nexisting knowledge by providing an insight into the interactions and actions of\npopular 1TG games and providing a guide to aid in developing games of the type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 09:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

In this study we aim at contributing to the timing problem of space\nweather impacts and propose a new method to predict the solar wind propagation\ndelay between Lagrangian point L1 and the Earth based on machine learning,\nspecifically decision tree models. The propagation delay is measured from the\nidentification of interplanetary discontinuities detected by the Advanced\nComposition Explorer (ACE) and their subsequent sudden commencements in the\nmagnetosphere recorded by ground-based magnetometers. A database of the\npropagation delay has been constructed on this principle including 380\ninterplanetary shocks. The feature set consists of six features, the three\ncomponents of each the solar wind speed and position of ACE around L1. The\nmachine learning results are compared to the flat propagation delay and the\nmethod based on the normal vector of solar wind discontinuities (vector delay).\nThe ML model achieves an RMSE of 4.5 min with respect to the measured solar\nwind propagation delay and also outperforms the physical flat and vector delay\nmodels by 50 \\% and 15 \\% respectively. To increase the confidence in the\npredictions of the trained GB model, we perform a performance validation,\nprovide feature importance and analyse the feature impact on the model output\nwith Shapley values.

Aims: We present here the eFEDS Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) catalog and the eROSITA X-ray spectral properties of the\neFEDS sources. Methods: Using a Bayesian method, we perform a systematic X-ray\nspectral analysis for all eFEDS sources. The appropriate model is chosen based\non the source classification and the spectral quality, and, in the case of AGN,\nincluding the possibility of intrinsic (rest-frame) absorption and/or soft\nexcess emission. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is used to estimate the\nspectral parameter distribution of the sample. Results: X-ray spectral\nproperties are presented for all eFEDS X-ray sources. There are 21952 candidate\nAGN, which comprise 79% of the eFEDS sample. Despite a large number of faint\nsources with low photon counts, our spectral fitting provides meaningful\nmeasurements of fluxes, luminosities, and spectral shapes for a majority of the\nsources. This AGN catalog is dominated by X-ray unobscured sources, with an\nobscured (logNH>21.5) fraction of 10% derived by HBM. The power-law slope of\nthe catalog can be described by a Gaussian distribution of 1.94+-0.22. Above a\nphoton counts threshold of 500, nine out of 50 AGN have soft excess detected.\nFor the sources with blue UV to optical color (type-I AGN), the X-ray emission\nis well correlated with the UV emission with the usual anti-correlation between\nthe X-ray to UV spectral slope {\\alpha}_{OX} and the UV luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 10:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The temporal evolution of the normalizations of the three shock\ncomponents match well the results of hydrodynamical simulations predicting a\nblue supergiant progenitor scenario. The trend at recent epochs indicate that\nthe emission caused by the forward shock after leaving the equatorial ring and\nby the reverse shock in the ejecta is becoming more dominant now. The elemental\nabundances in the hot plasma component are significantly higher than those in\nthe `cooler' one, indicating its origin from the reverse shock propagating into\nthe ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 10:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Using XMM-Newton and NICER we\nfirstly established an X-ray ephemeris for the time interval 2015 to 2020,\nwhich connects all X-ray observations in this period without cycle count alias\nand phase shifts. The mean eROSITA spectrum clearly reveals an absorption\nfeature originating from the star at 570 eV with a Gaussian sigma of about 70\neV, tentatively identified earlier in a long XMM-Newton observation\n(Arumugasamy et al. 2018). A second absorption feature, described here as an\nabsorption edge, occurs at 260-265 eV. It could be of atmospheric or of\ninstrumental origin. These absorption features are superposed on various\nemission components, phenomenologically described as the sum of hot (120 eV)\nand cold (65 eV) blackbody components, both of photospheric origin, and a\npower-law with photon index Gamma=2. The phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals\nthat the Gaussian absorption line at 570 eV is clearly present throughout ~60%\nof the spin cycle. The visibility of the line strength coincides in phase with\nthe maximum flux of the hot blackbody. We also present three families of model\natmospheres: a magnetised atmosphere, a condensed surface, and a mixed model,\nwhich were applied to the mean observed spectrum and whose continuum fit the\nobserved data well. The atmosphere model, however, predicts too short\ndistances. For the mixed model, the Gaussian absorption may be interpreted as\nproton cyclotron absorption in a field as high as 10^14 G, which is\nsignificantly higher than that derived from the moderate observed spin-down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 10:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

This is usually determined from an optical spectrum giving the\nsource redshift. However, not only will this be impractical for the large\nnumber of sources expected to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array, but\nbright optical sources are the most ultra-violet luminous at high redshift and\nso bias against the detection of cool, neutral gas. Adding another 44, mostly\nnewly detected absorbers, to the previous sample of 92, we test four different\nmachine learning algorithms, again using the line properties (width, depth and\nnumber of Gaussian fits) as features. Of these algorithms, three gave a some\nimprovement over the previous sample, with a logistic regression model giving\nthe best results. This suggests that the inclusion of further training data, as\nnew absorbers are detected, will further increase the prediction accuracy above\nthe current 80%. We use the logistic regression model to classify the z = 0.42\nabsorption towards PKS 1657-298 and find this to be associated, which is\nconsistent with a previous study which determined a similar redshift from the\nK-band magnitude-redshift relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 10:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, key technical challenges, such as safe navigation in\ncomplex urban environments, need to be addressed before deploying these\nvehicles on the market. Teleoperation can help smooth the transition from human\noperated to fully autonomous vehicles since it still has human in the loop\nproviding the scope of fallback on driver. This paper presents an Active Safety\nSystem (ASS) approach for teleoperated driving. The proposed approach helps the\noperator ensure the safety of the vehicle in complex environments, that is,\navoid collisions with static or dynamic obstacles. Our ASS relies on a model\npredictive control (MPC) formulation to control both the lateral and\nlongitudinal dynamics of the vehicle. By exploiting the ability of the MPC\nframework to deal with constraints, our ASS restricts the controller's\nauthority to intervene for lateral correction of the human operator's commands,\navoiding counter-intuitive driving experience for the human operator. Further,\nwe design a visual feedback to enhance the operator's trust over the ASS. In\naddition, we propose an MPC's prediction horizon data based novel predictive\ndisplay to mitigate the effects of large latency in the teleoperation system.\nWe tested the performance of the proposed approach on a high-fidelity vehicle\nsimulator in the presence of dynamic obstacles and latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 10:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

A recent MC study clarified that a prior\ncrossover leads to a transition to nematic phase. The crossover was interpreted\nas due to the onset of a perturbing relevant scaling field originating from the\nextra spin degree of freedom. As a counter example and in support of this\nhypothesis, we now consider V-shaped bent-core molecules with rigid rod-like\nsegments connected at an assigned angle. The two segments of the molecule\ninteract with the segments of all the nearest neighbours on a square lattice,\nprescribed by a biquadratic interaction. We compute equilibrium averages of\ndifferent observables with Monte Carlo techniques as a function of temperature\nand sample size. For the chosen molecular bend angle and symmetric\ninter-segment interaction between neighbouirng molecules, the 2D system shows\ntwo transitions as a function of T: the higher one at T1 leads to a topological\nordering of defects associated with the major molecular axis without a\ncrossover, imparting uniaxial symmetry to the medium described by the first\nfundamental group of the order parameter space $\\pi_{1}$= $Z_{2}$ (inversion\nsymmetry). The second at T2 leads to a medium displaying biaxial symmetry with\n$\\pi_{1}$ = Q (quaternion group).

In this work, for the first time, we propose a\ntrainable image acquisition method that removes the sensitive identity\nrevealing information in the optical domain before it reaches the image sensor.\nThe method benefits from a trainable optical convolution kernel which transmits\nthe desired information while filters out the sensitive content. As the\nsensitive content is suppressed before it reaches the image sensor, it does not\nenter the digital domain therefore is unretrievable by any sort of privacy\nattack. This is in contrast with the current digital privacy-preserving methods\nthat are all vulnerable to direct access attack. Also, in contrast with the\nprevious optical privacy-preserving methods that cannot be trained, our method\nis data-driven and optimized for the specific application at hand. Moreover,\nthere is no additional computation, memory, or power burden on the acquisition\nsystem since this processing happens passively in the optical domain and can\neven be used together and on top of the fully digital privacy-preserving\nsystems. The proposed approach is adaptable to different digital neural\nnetworks and content. We demonstrate it for several scenarios such as smile\ndetection as the desired attribute while the gender is filtered out as the\nsensitive content. We trained the optical kernel in conjunction with two\nadversarial neural networks where the analysis network tries to detect the\ndesired attribute and the adversarial network tries to detect the sensitive\ncontent. We show that this method can reduce 65.1% of sensitive content when it\nis selected to be the gender and it only loses 7.3% of the desired content.\nMoreover, we reconstruct the original faces using the deep reconstruction\nmethod that confirms the ineffectiveness of reconstruction attacks to obtain\nthe sensitive content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 11:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

As concrete examples, we study the conjectured metastable state of\npolarised anti-D3 branes at the tip of the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) throat in\ntype IIB supergravity and the analogous state of polarised anti-M2 branes at\nthe tip of the Cvetic-Gibbons-Lu-Pope (CGLP) throat in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity.\n  For anti-D3 branes in KS throat, we provide novel evidence for the existence\nof the metastable state exactly where no-go theorems are lifted. In the\nextremal limit, we recover directly in supergravity the metastable states\noriginally discovered by Kachru, Pearson, and Verlinde (KPV). Away from\nextremality, we uncover a metastable wrapped black NS5 state. We observe that\nsuch metastability is lost when the wrapped NS5 is heated sufficiently that its\nhorizon geometry resembles that of a black anti-D3. We study the classical\nstability of the KPV state under generic long-wavelength deformations. We\nobserve that, with regards to considered perturbations and regime of\nparameters, the state is classically stable. A study of anti-M2 branes in CGLP\nthroat reveals many similarities to that of the anti-D3 branes. We recover\ndirectly in supergravity the Klebanov-Pufu (KP) state at extremality, and our\nfinite temperature results fit suggestively well with known, complementary\nno-go theorems.

Though existing efforts\ndemonstrate the possibility of a unified model for all missing situations, most\nof them perform poorly when more than one modality is missing. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) to solve this issue,\nin which a series of independent yet related models are trained dedicated to\neach missing situation with significantly better results. Specifically, ACN\nadopts a novel co-training network, which enables a coupled learning process\nfor both full modality and missing modality to supplement each other's domain\nand feature representations, and more importantly, to recover the `missing'\ninformation of absent modalities.

Here we show that an accurate description of a Floquet system requires\na set of Hamiltonian exhausting all values of the micro-motion parameter, and\nthis micro-motion parameter can be viewed as an extra synthetic dimension of\nthe system. Therefore, we show that a $d$-dimensional Floquet system can be\ndescribed by a $d+1$-dimensional static Hamiltonian, and the advantage of this\nrepresentation is that the periodic boundary condition is automatically imposed\nalong the extra-dimension, which enables a straightforward definition of\ntopological invariants.

Regret quantifies the difference between a learner's performance against\na baseline in hindsight. It is well-known that regret-minimizing algorithms\nconverge to certain classes of equilibria in games; however, traditional forms\nof regret used in game theory predominantly consider baselines that permit\ndeviations to deterministic actions or strategies. In this paper, we revisit\nour understanding of regret from the perspective of deviations over partitions\nof the full \\emph{mixed} strategy space (i.e., probability distributions over\npure strategies), under the lens of the previously-established $\\Phi$-regret\nframework, which provides a continuum of stronger regret measures.

Implementation of DFRC schemes in\nvehicular systems gives rise to strict constraints in terms of cost, power\nefficiency, and hardware complexity. In this paper, we extend IM-based DFRC\nsystems to utilize sparse arrays and frequency modulated continuous waveforms\n(FMCWs), which are popular in automotive radar for their simplicity and low\nhardware complexity. The proposed FMCW-based radar-communications system (FRaC)\noperates at reduced cost and complexity by transmitting with a reduced number\nof radio frequency modules, combined with narrowband FMCW signalling.

However, the algebra of\ncommutators of the quantized eBMS charges has been a thorny issue in the\nliterature. On the one hand, recent developments in celestial holography point\ntowards a symmetry algebra which is a closed Lie algebra with no central\nextension or anomaly, and on the other hand, work of Distler, Flauger and Horn\nhas shown that when these charges are quantized at null infinity, the\ncommutator of a supertranslation and a superrotation charge does not close into\na supertranslation but gets deformed by a 2 cocycle term, which is consistent\nwith the original proposal of Barnich and Troessaert.\n  In this paper, we revisit this issue in light of recent developments in the\nclassical understanding of superrotation charges. We show that, for extended\nBMS symmetries, a phase space at null infinity is an extension of hitherto\nconsidered phase spaces which also includes a mode associated to the spin\nmemory and its conjugate partner. We also show that for holomorphic vector\nfields on the celestial plane, quantization of the eBMS charges in the new\nphase space leads to an algebra which closes without a 2 cocycle. The\ndegenerate vacua are labelled by the soft news and a Schwarzian mode which\ncorresponds to deformations of the celestial metric by superrotations. The\nclosed eBMS quantum algebra may also lead to a convergence between two\nmanifestations of asymptotic symmetries, one via asymptotic quantization at\nnull infinity and the other through celestial holography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Only the\nsemantic skeleton representation is transmitted over the network and raw images\nremain on the sensor board. 3D poses are recovered from 2D joints on a central\nbackend, based on triangulation and a body model which incorporates prior\nknowledge of the human skeleton. A feedback channel from backend to individual\nsensors is implemented on a semantic level. The allocentric 3D pose is\nbackprojected into the sensor views where it is fused with 2D joint detections.\nThe local semantic model on each sensor can thus be improved by incorporating\nglobal context information.

Smart walkers are a commonly used solution that should embed\nautomatic and objective tools for data-driven human-in-the-loop control and\nmonitoring. However, present solutions focus on extracting few specific metrics\nfrom dedicated sensors with no unified full-body approach. We investigate a\ngeneral, real-time, full-body pose estimation framework based on two RGB+D\ncamera streams with non-overlapping views mounted on a smart walker equipment\nused in rehabilitation. Human keypoint estimation is performed using a\ntwo-stage neural network framework. The 2D-Stage implements a detection module\nthat locates body keypoints in the 2D image frames. The 3D-Stage implements a\nregression module that lifts and relates the detected keypoints in both cameras\nto the 3D space relative to the walker. Model predictions are low-pass filtered\nto improve temporal consistency. A custom acquisition method was used to obtain\na dataset, with 14 healthy subjects, used for training and evaluating the\nproposed framework offline, which was then deployed on the real walker\nequipment. An overall keypoint detection error of 3.73 pixels for the 2D-Stage\nand 44.05mm for the 3D-Stage were reported, with an inference time of 26.6ms\nwhen deployed on the constrained hardware of the walker.

Through collaboration learning, OS-AD can capture the common\ncharacteristics between objects having the same underlying affordance and learn\na good adaptation capability for perceiving unseen affordances. Besides, we\nbuild a Purpose-driven Affordance Dataset (PAD) by collecting and labeling 4k\nimages from 31 affordance and 72 object categories. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our model over previous representative ones in\nterms of both objective metrics and visual quality. The benchmark suite is at\nProjectPage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 14:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

In this work, we first\nprove that for contrastive learning, inaccurate label assignment heavily\nimpairs its generalization for semantic instance discrimination, while accurate\nlabels benefit its generalization. Inspired by this theory, we propose a novel\nself-labeling refinement approach for contrastive learning.

However, training / running large-scale DNNs as\npart of a smart contract is infeasible on today's blockchain platforms, due to\ntwo fundamental design issues of these platforms. First, blockchains nowadays\ntypically require that each node maintain the complete world state at any time,\nmeaning that the node must execute all transactions in every block. This is\nprohibitively expensive for computationally intensive smart contracts involving\nDNNs. Second, existing blockchain platforms expect smart contract transactions\nto have deterministic, reproducible results and effects. In contrast, DNNs are\nusually trained / run lock-free on massively parallel computing devices such as\nGPUs, TPUs and / or computing clusters, which often do not yield deterministic\nresults.\n  This paper proposes novel platform designs, collectively called A New Hope\n(ANH), that address the above issues. The main ideas are (i)\ncomputing-intensive smart contract transactions are only executed by nodes who\nneed their results, or by specialized serviced providers, and (ii) a\nnon-deterministic smart contract transaction leads to uncertain results, which\ncan still be validated, though at a relatively high cost; specifically for\nDNNs, the validation cost can often be reduced by verifying properties of the\nresults instead of their exact values.

To\nimprove the classification accuracy, state-of-the-art CNNs usually involve\nlarge and complex convolutional layers. However, for certain applications, e.g.\nInternet of Things (IoT), where such CNNs are to be implemented on\nresource-constrained platforms, the CNN architectures have to be small and\nefficient. To deal with this problem, reducing the resource consumption in\nconvolutional layers has become one of the most significant solutions. In this\nwork, a multi-objective optimisation approach is proposed to trade-off between\nthe amount of computation and network accuracy by using Multi-Objective\nEvolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The number of convolution kernels and the size\nof these kernels are proportional to computational resource consumption of\nCNNs. Therefore, this paper considers optimising the computational resource\nconsumption by reducing the size and number of kernels in convolutional layers.\nAdditionally, the use of unconventional kernel shapes has been investigated and\nresults show these clearly outperform the commonly used square convolution\nkernels. The main contributions of this paper are therefore a methodology to\nsignificantly reduce computational cost of CNNs, based on unconventional kernel\nshapes, and provide different trade-offs for specific use cases. The\nexperimental results further demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nlarge improvements in resource consumption with no significant reduction in\nnetwork performance.

We investigate the origin and eruption of a stealth event\nthat occurred on 2015 January 3 that was responsible for a strong geomagnetic\nstorm upon its arrival at Earth. To simulate the coronal magnetic field and\nplasma parameters of the eruption we use a coupled approach. This approach\ncombines an evolutionary nonlinear force-free field model of the global corona\nwith a MHD simulation. The combined simulation approach accurately reproduces\nthe stealth event and suggests that sympathetic eruptions occur. In the\ncombined simulation we found that three flux ropes form and then erupt. The\nfirst two flux ropes, which are connected to a large AR complex behind the east\nlimb, erupt first producing two near-simultaneous CMEs. These CMEs are closely\nfollowed by a third, weaker flux rope eruption in the simulation that\noriginated between the periphery of AR 12252 and the southern polar coronal\nhole. The third eruption coincides with a faint coronal dimming, which appears\nin the SDO/AIA 211 A observations, that is attributed as the source responsible\nfor the stealth event and later the geomagnetic disturbance at 1 AU. The\nincorrect interpretation of the stealth event being linked to the occurrence of\na single partial halo CME observed by LASCO/C2 is mainly due to the lack of\nSTEREO observations being available at the time of the CMEs. The simulation\nalso shows that the LASCO CME is not a single event but rather two\nnear-simultaneous CMEs.

Such reasoning leads to the proposal for\noptoelectronic neuromorphic platforms that leverage the complementary\nproperties of optics and electronics. Starting from the conjecture that future\nlarge-scale neuromorphic systems will utilize integrated photonics and fiber\noptics for communication in conjunction with analog electronics for\ncomputation, we consider two possible paths towards achieving this vision. The\nfirst is a semiconductor platform based on analog CMOS circuits and\nwaveguide-integrated photodiodes. The second is a superconducting approach that\nutilizes Josephson junctions and waveguide-integrated superconducting\nsingle-photon detectors. We discuss available devices, assess scaling\npotential, and provide a list of key metrics and demonstrations for each\nplatform. Both platforms hold potential, but their development will diverge in\nimportant respects. Semiconductor systems benefit from a robust fabrication\necosystem and can build on extensive progress made in purely electronic\nneuromorphic computing but will require III-V light source integration with\nelectronics at an unprecedented scale, further advances in ultra-low\ncapacitance photodiodes, and success from emerging memory technologies.\nSuperconducting systems place near theoretically minimum burdens on light\nsources (a tremendous boon to one of the most speculative aspects of either\nplatform) and provide new opportunities for integrated, high-endurance synaptic\nmemory. However, superconducting optoelectronic systems will also contend with\ninterfacing low-voltage electronic circuits to semiconductor light sources, the\nserial biasing of superconducting devices on an unprecedented scale, a less\nmature fabrication ecosystem, and cryogenic infrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Traditional models usually conduct feature\nmining from a single perspective, with the features mined being limited and the\ninternal relationships between them being ignored. Consequently, useful\nfeatures are lost and classification results are unsatisfactory. To fully mine\nand utilize image features, a new multi-scale feature-mining learning algorithm\n(MGRNet) is proposed. The model uses principal component analysis to reduce the\ndimensionality of the original hyperspectral image (HSI) to retain 99.99% of\nits semantic information and extract dimensionality reduction features. Using a\nmulti-scale convolution algorithm, the input dimensionality reduction features\nwere mined to obtain shallow features, which then served as inputs into a\nmulti-scale graph convolution algorithm to construct the internal relationships\nbetween eigenvalues at different scales. We then carried out cross fusion of\nmulti-scale information obtained by graph convolution, before inputting the new\ninformation obtained into the residual network algorithm for deep feature\nmining. Finally, a flexible maximum transfer function classifier was used to\npredict the final features and complete the classification. Experiments on\nthree common hyperspectral datasets showed the MGRNet algorithm proposed in\nthis paper to be superior to traditional methods in recognition accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

This might be due to the original description by\nHsu and McConnell in some places only sketching the details of the\nimplementation. In this paper, we describe two alternative implementations of\nPC-trees.

When those particles are anisotropic, the\naddition of a particle orientation vector to the kinetic description yields a\n$2d-1$ dimensional theory which becomes intractable to simulate, especially in\nthree dimensions or near states where the particles are highly aligned.\nCoarse-grained theories that track only moments of the particle distribution\nfunctions provide a more efficient simulation framework, but require closure\nassumptions. For the particular case where the particles are apolar, the\nBingham closure has been found to agree well with the underlying kinetic\ntheory; yet the closure is non-trivial to compute, requiring the solution of an\noften nearly-singular nonlinear equation at every spatial discretization point\nat every timestep. In this paper, we present a robust, accurate, and efficient\nnumerical scheme for evaluating the Bingham closure, with a controllable\nerror/efficiency tradeoff. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we carry\nout high-resolution simulations of a coarse-grained continuum model for a\nsuspension of active particles in parameter regimes inaccessible to kinetic\ntheories. Analysis of these simulations reveals that inaccurately computing the\nclosure can act to effectively limit spatial resolution in the coarse-grained\nfields. Pushing these simulations to the high spatial resolutions enabled by\nour method reveals a coupling between vorticity and topological defects in the\nsuspension director field, as well as signatures of energy transfer between\nscales in this active fluid model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Also, modifications of the\ndefault Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex\ninteraction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based\nHill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)\nleaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the\ncomplex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific\nstructure in advance.

These corrections should be quick and non-iterative.\nTo solve this problem without modification of a legacy AI system, we propose\nspecial `external' devices, correctors. Elementary correctors consist of two\nparts, a classifier that separates the situations with high risk of error from\nthe situations in which the legacy AI system works well and a new decision for\nsituations with potential errors. Input signals for the correctors can be the\ninputs of the legacy AI system, its internal signals, and outputs. If the\nintrinsic dimensionality of data is high enough then the classifiers for\ncorrection of small number of errors can be very simple. According to the\nblessing of dimensionality effects, even simple and robust Fisher's\ndiscriminants can be used for one-shot learning of AI correctors. Stochastic\nseparation theorems provide the mathematical basis for this one-short learning.\nHowever, as the number of correctors needed grows, the cluster structure of\ndata becomes important and a new family of stochastic separation theorems is\nrequired. We refuse the classical hypothesis of the regularity of the data\ndistribution and assume that the data can have a fine-grained structure with\nmany clusters and peaks in the probability density.

By mobilizing the public to actively\nreport possible sightings of the Asian giant hornet, the governmentcould timely\nsend inspectors to confirm and possibly destroy the nests. However, such\nconfirmation requires lab expertise, where manually checking the reports one by\none is extremely consuming of human resources.

For\nnon-unitary joint diagonalization (NUJD) based on the least-squares (LS)\ncriterion, outliers, also referred to as anomaly or discordant observations,\nhave a negative influence on the performance, since squaring the residuals\nmagnifies the effects of them. To solve this problem, we propose a novel cost\nfunction that incorporates the soft decision-directed scheme into the\nleast-squares algorithm and develops an efficient algorithm. The influence of\nthe outliers is mitigated by applying decision-directed weights which are\nassociated with the residual error at each iterative step. Specifically, the\nmixing matrix is estimated by a modified stationary point method, in which the\nupdating direction is determined based on the linear approximation to the\ngradient function. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms conventional non-unitary diagonalization algorithms in terms of\nboth convergence performance and robustness to outliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 07:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

First,\nNormal data and abnormal data generated after injection fault are normalized\nand mapped to gray image as input data of the convolutional neural network.\nThen, based on the classical convolution neural network, three new\nconvolutional neural network models are designed by designing the parameters of\nthe convolutional layer and the fully connected layer. This model solves the\nproblem that the performance of traditional detection algorithm is easily\naffected by relevant threshold through self-learning data characteristics of\nconvolution layer.

Much efforts have been made to\nimprove the metallic microheater performance in the past decades. However,\nbecause of the metallic nature of light absorption, placing the metallic\nmicroheater very close to the waveguide for fast response is impractical and\nhas not been done experimentally. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a\nmetallic microheater placed very close to the waveguide based on parity-time\n(PT) symmetry breaking. The intrinsic high loss of metallic heater ensures the\nsystem will operate in the PT-symmetry-broken region, which guarantee the low\nloss of light in the silicon waveguide. Moreover, heating at a close range\nsignificantly reduces the response time. A fast response time of ~1 us is\nachieved without introducing extra loss. The insertion loss is only 0.1 dB for\nthe long heater. The modulation bandwidth is 280 kHz, which is an order of\nmagnitude improvement when compared with that of the mainstream thermo-optic\nphase shifters. To verify the capability of large-scale integration, a 1*8\nphased array for beam steering is also demonstrated experimentally with the\nPT-symmetry-broken metallic heaters. Our work provides a novel design concept\nfor low-loss fast-response optical switches with dissipative materials and\noffers a new approach to enhance the performance of thermo-optic phase\nshifters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 02:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Macromodels of each unit cell are produced by applying the\nequivalence principle on fictitious surfaces encapsulating them. Unit cells\noften consist of multiple dielectric layers and conductor traces, featuring\nmultiscale structures. Challenges arise when a current-carrying conductor trace\ntraverses the fictitious surface. Hence, a new method based on half\nRao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions is proposed to accurately ensure the\ncontinuity of the surface currents and avoid singularities at the\nintersections. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated by comparing\nthe results with commercial solvers for different EM surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}
