However, recent\nexperimental and computational studies have shown that under certain conditions\nalkali cations can migrate in electric fields as if they carried a net negative\neffective charge. In particular, alkali cations were observed to have negative\ntransference numbers at small mole fractions of alkali metal salt that revert\nto the expected net positive transference numbers at large mole fractions.\nSimulations have provided some insights into these observations, where the\nformation of asymmetric ionic clusters, as well as a percolating ion network\ncould largely explain the anomalous transport of alkali cations. However, a\nthermodynamic theory that captures such phenomena has not been developed, as\nionic associations were typically treated via the formation of ion pairs. The\ntheory presented herein, based on the classical polymer theories, describes\nthermoreversible associations between alkali cations and anions, where the\nformation of large, asymmetric ionic clusters and a percolating ionic network\nare a natural result of the theory. Furthermore, we present several general\nmethods to calculate the effective charge of alkali cations in ionic liquids.\nWe note that the negative effective charge is a robust prediction with respect\nto the parameters of the theory, and that the formation of a percolating ionic\nnetwork leads to the restoration of net positive charges of the cations at\nlarge mole fractions of alkali metal salt. Overall, we find excellent\nqualitative agreement between our theory and molecular simulations in terms of\nionic cluster statistics and the effective charges of the alkali cations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 20:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

We derive these samplers from a new\nclass of mirrored Stein operators and adaptive kernels developed in this work.\nWe demonstrate that these new samplers yield accurate approximations to\ndistributions on the simplex, deliver valid confidence intervals in\npost-selection inference, and converge more rapidly than prior methods in\nlarge-scale unconstrained posterior inference. Finally, we establish the\nconvergence of our new procedures under verifiable conditions on the target\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 03:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 16:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

We achieve this by utilizing recent definitions for\nentropic areas, volumes, and higher-dimensional volumes for multipartite\nquantum systems. This enables us to differentiate systems with high quantum\ncorrelation from systems with low quantum correlation and differentiate between\ndifferent types of multi-partite entanglement. It also enables us to describe\nsome of the strange properties of quantum entanglement using simple geometrical\ninequalities.

We explain why conventional\ntreatments by traditional quantum optics and atomic physics based on quantum\nmechanics may become inadequate when faced with issues related to locality,\nsimultaneity, signaling, causality, etc. Quantum field theory is needed. Adding\nthe effects of gravitation, we are led to Quantum Field Theory in Curved\nSpacetime (QFTCST). This well-established theory should serve as the canonical\nreference theory to a large class of proposed space experiments testing the\nfoundations of gravitation and quantum theory, and the basic notions of quantum\ninformation theory in relativistic settings.\n  This is the first in a series of papers treating near-term quantum optics and\nmatter waves experiments in space from the perspective of QFTCST. We analyze\nthe quantum motion of photons and of scalar massive particles using QFTCST with\napplication to interferometer experiments. Our main result is that, for\nphotons, the weak gravitational field is to leading order completely equivalent\nto an inhomogeneous dielectric, thus allowing for a description of quantum\noptics experiments in curved space using familiar notions from the theory of\noptical media. We also discuss interference experiments that probe first-order\nquantum coherence, the importance of a covariant particle detection theory, and\nthe relevance of time of arrival measurements. For massive particles with\ninternal structure, we identify a novel gravity-induced phase shift that\noriginates from the different gravitational masses attributed to the excited\ninternal states.

Using Pauli and Bell measurements on\ncopies of the output states, we can generate a hypothesis circuit that is\nequivalent to the unknown target circuit on computational basis states as\ninput. If the number of $T$ gates of the target is of the order $O({{\\log\nn}})$, our algorithm requires $O(n^2)$ queries to it and produces its\nequivalent circuit representation on the computational basis in time $O(n^3)$.\nUsing further additional $O(4^{3n})$ classical computations, we can derive an\nexact description of the target for arbitrary input states. Our results greatly\nextend the previously known facts that stabilizer states can be efficiently\nidentified based on the stabilizer formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 14:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 12:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Cancer labels\nachieved by image registration can be used to improve radiologists'\ninterpretation of MRI by training deep learning models for early detection of\nprostate cancer. A major limitation of current automated registration\napproaches is that they require manual prostate segmentations, which is a\ntime-consuming task, prone to errors. This paper presents a weakly supervised\napproach for affine and deformable registration of MRI and histopathology\nimages without requiring prostate segmentations. We used manual prostate\nsegmentations and mono-modal synthetic image pairs to train our registration\nnetworks to align prostate boundaries and local prostate features. Although\nprostate segmentations were used during the training of the network, such\nsegmentations were not needed when registering unseen images at inference time.\nWe trained and validated our registration network with 135 and 10 patients from\nan internal cohort, respectively. We tested the performance of our method using\n16 patients from the internal cohort and 22 patients from an external cohort.\nThe results show that our weakly supervised method has achieved significantly\nhigher registration accuracy than a state-of-the-art method run without\nprostate segmentations.

Importantly, in this\nframing, the burden of learning is placed solely on the decision-maker, while\nthe agents' best responses are implicitly treated as instantaneous. In this\nwork, we argue that the order of play in strategic classification is\nfundamentally determined by the relative frequencies at which the\ndecision-maker and the agents adapt to each other's actions. In particular, by\ngeneralizing the standard model to allow both players to learn over time, we\nshow that a decision-maker that makes updates faster than the agents can\nreverse the order of play, meaning that the agents lead and the decision-maker\nfollows. We observe in standard learning settings that such a role reversal can\nbe desirable for both the decision-maker and the strategic agents.

The analysis takes into account the electromagnetic\ninterference, generated by external sources, and the constraint on the physical\nradiated power. The electromagnetic MIMO model is particularized for a pair of\nparallel line segments in line-of-sight conditions. Inspired by\northogonal-frequency division-multiplexing, we assume that the\nspatially-continuous transmit currents and received fields are represented\nusing the Fourier basis functions. In doing so, a wavenumber-division\nmultiplexing (WDM) scheme is obtained, which is not optimal but can be\nefficiently implemented. The interplay among the different system parameters\n(e.g., transmission range, wavelength, and sizes of source and receiver) in\nterms of number of communication modes and level of interference among them is\nstudied with conventional tools of linear systems theory. Due to the non-finite\nsupport (in the spatial domain) of the electromagnetic channel, WDM cannot\nprovide non-interfering communication modes. The interference decreases as the\nreceiver size grows, and goes to zero only asymptotically. Different digital\nprocessing architectures, operating in the wavenumber domain, are thus used to\ndeal with the interference. The simplest implementation provides the same\nspectral efficiency of a singular-value decomposition architecture with\nwater-filling when the receiver size is comparable to the transmission range.\nThe developed framework is also used to represent a classical MIMO system and\nto make comparisons. It turns out that the latter achieves better performance\nonly when a higher number of radio-frequency chains is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 10:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 06:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

To better assess this impact, here we\nconsider the work output of an infinitely narrow thermodynamic cycle with two\nstreamlines connecting the top of the boundary layer in the vicinity of maximum\nwind (without assuming gradient-wind balance) to an arbitrary level in the\ninviscid free troposphere. The reduction of a storm's maximum wind speed due to\nwater lifting is found to decline with increasing efficiency of the cycle and\nis about 5% for maximum observed Carnot efficiencies. In the steady-state\ncycle, there is an extra heat input associated with the warming of\nprecipitating water. The corresponding positive extra work is of an opposite\nsign and several times smaller than that due to water lifting. We also estimate\nthe gain of kinetic energy in the outflow region. Contrary to previous\nassessments, this term is found to be large when the outflow radius is small\n(comparable to the radius of maximum wind). Using our framework, we show that\nEmanuel's maximum potential intensity (E-PI) corresponds to a cycle where total\nwork equals work performed at the top of the boundary layer (net work in the\nfree troposphere is zero). This constrains a dependence between the outflow\ntemperature and heat input at the point of maximum wind, but does not constrain\nthe radial pressure gradient. We outline the implications of the established\npatterns for assessing real storms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 17:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 20:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In this class of\nscenarios, however, the elastic scattering cross section of the twin tau with\nnuclei exceeds the bounds from XENON1T and other recent direct detection\nexperiments. In this paper, we propose a modification to the Fraternal Twin\nHiggs scenario that we call $\\mathbb{Z}_2$FTH, incorporating visible and twin\nhypercharged scalars (with $Y = 2$) which break twin electromagnetism. This\nleads to new mass terms for the twin tau that are unrelated to its Yukawa\ncoupling, as well as additional annihilation channels via the massive twin\nphoton. We show that these features make it possible for the right-handed twin\ntau to freeze out with an acceptable thermal relic abundance while scattering\nwith nuclei at a rate that is well below existing constraints. Nonetheless,\nlarge portions of the currently viable parameter space in this model are within\nthe reach of planned direct detection experiments. The prospects for indirect\ndetection using gamma rays and cosmic-ray antiprotons are also promising in\nthis model. Furthermore, if the twin neutrino is light, the predicted deviation\nof $\\Delta N_\\mathrm{eff} \\approx 0.1$ would be within reach of Stage 4 CMB\nexperiments.

We consider the Lorentzian analog to reformulate the\n'complexity=volume' conjecture using Lorentzian flows -- timelike vector fields\nwhose minimum flux through a boundary subregion is equal to the volume of the\nhomologous maximal bulk Cauchy slice. By the nesting of Lorentzian flows,\nholographic complexity is shown to obey a number of properties. Particularly,\nthe rate of complexity is bounded below by conditional complexity, describing a\nmulti-step optimization with intermediate and final target states. We provide\nmultiple explicit geometric realizations of Lorentzian flows in AdS\nbackgrounds, including their time-dependence and behavior near the singularity\nin a black hole interior. Conceptually, discretized flows are interpreted as\nLorentzian threads or 'gatelines'. Upon selecting a reference state, complexity\nthence counts the minimum number of gatelines needed to prepare a target state\ndescribed by a tensor network discretizing the maximal volume slice, matching\nits quantum information theoretic definition. We point out that suboptimal\ntensor networks are important to fully characterize the state, leading us to\npropose a refined notion of complexity as an ensemble average. The bulk\nsymplectic potential provides a specific 'canonical' thread configuration\ncharacterizing perturbations around arbitrary CFT states. Consistency of this\nsolution requires the bulk satisfy the linearized Einstein's equations, which\nare shown to be equivalent to the holographic first law of complexity, thereby\nadvocating for a principle of 'spacetime complexity'.

The principle of\nmediocrity entails that we live at asymptotic late times, when the occupational\nprobabilities of vacua has settled to a near-equilibrium distribution. In this\npaper we further develop the idea that we instead exist during the approach to\nequilibrium, much earlier than the exponentially-long mixing time. In this case\nwe are most likely to reside in vacua that are easily accessed dynamically.\nUsing first-passage statistics, we prove that vacua that maximize their\nspace-time volume at early times have: 1. maximal ever-hitting probability; 2.\nminimal mean first-passage time; and 3. minimal decay rate. These requirements\nare succinctly captured by an early-time measure. The idea that we live at\nearly times is a predictive guiding principle, with many phenomenological\nimplications. First, our vacuum should lie deep in a funneled region, akin to\nfolding energy landscapes of proteins. Second, optimal landscape regions are\ncharacterized by relatively short-lived vacua, with lifetime of order the de\nSitter Page time. For our vacuum, this lifetime is $\\sim 10^{130}$~years, which\nis consistent with the Standard Model estimate due to Higgs metastability.\nThird, the measure favors vacua with small, positive vacuum energy. This can\naddress the cosmological constant problem, provided there are sufficiently many\nvacua in the entire ensemble of funnels. As a concrete example, we study the\nBousso-Polchinski lattice of flux vacua, and find that the early-time measure\nfavors lattices with the fewest number of flux dimensions. This favors\ncompactifications with a large hierarchy between the lightest modulus and all\nother K\\\"ahler and complex structure moduli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

We\nanalyze how this coupling affects the dynamics of rotors and the self-energy of\nfermions.A common belief is that near a $q=0$ ferromagnetic transition,\nfermions induce an $\\Omega/q$ Landau damping of rotors (i.e., the dynamical\ncritical exponent is $z=3$) and Landau overdamped rotors give rise to non-Fermi\nliquid fermionic self-energy $\\Sigma\\propto \\omega^{2/3}$. This behavior has\nbeen confirmed in previous quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) studies.Here we show that\nfor the XY case the behavior is different.We report the results of large scale\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations,which show that at small frequencies $z=2$ and\n$\\Sigma\\propto \\omega^{1/2}$. We argue that the new behavior is associated with\nthe fact that a fermionic spin is by itself not a conserved quantity due to\nspin-spin coupling to rotors, and a combination of self-energy and vertex\ncorrections replaces $1/q$ in the Landau damping by a constant. We discuss the\nimplication of these results to experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 01:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

One suggested explanation for at least the small glitches are\nstarquakes, that is, failures of the solid neutron star crust, in which the\nprogressive reduction in the centrifugal force deforms the star, stressing the\nsolid until it breaks. This produces a spin-up, dissipating energy inside the\nstar. We analyze the deformations produced by the decreasing centrifugal force,\nmodeling the star with a fluid core and a solid crust, each with uniform\ndensity and with the core possibly denser than the crust, as a simple\napproximation to the strong density gradient present in real neutron stars. The\ndeformation is qualitatively different from the previously studied case of\nequal densities. The former more closely resembles the behavior of a fluid\nstar, in which the core-crust interface is a surface of constant gravitational\nplus centrifugal potential. Regardless of the uncertain breaking strain, the\nglitch activity in this model is several orders of magnitude smaller than\nobserved, even if only small glitches are considered. For a large breaking\nstrain, suggested by simulations, glitches due to starquakes could be roughly\nof the correct size but much less frequent than observed glitches. The energy\nreleased in each glitch is much larger than in the model of angular momentum\ntransfer from a faster rotating superfluid in the inner crust. On the other\nhand, we cannot rule out that the heating produced by small starquakes could\ntrigger glitches by allowing neutron superfluid vortices to move. We also\nconfirm that stresses in the neutron star crust can in principle support an\nellipticity much larger than some observational upper limits from pulsar timing\nand continuous gravitational wave searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:05:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 18:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

That year, Al production required 848 TWh of\nelectricity1, 3% of the worldwide total, and caused 1% of human greenhouse gas\nemissions. Much of the electricity and emissions originate from energy loss in\nthe poorly conducting electrolyte where aluminum oxide is dissolved. Thinning\nthe electrolyte layer could decrease loss but has been limited by the Metal Pad\nInstability (MPI), which causes Al cells to slosh out of control if the\nelectrolyte is not sufficiently thick. Here we show that adding an oscillating\ncomponent to the current disrupts the MPI in realistic simulations, allowing\nstable operation with electrolyte layers at least 12% thinner. This occurs when\noscillation excites standing waves, which decouple the resonance that drives a\ngrowing traveling wave, characteristic of the MPI. Maintaining oscillation can\nprevent MPI; initiating oscillation can halt an MPI in progress. Our findings\ncould significantly increase the efficiency of virtually all aluminium refining\ncells without the need for expensive reconstruction, thereby decreasing energy\nuse by 34 TWh/year (2.1 MJ/kg Al) or more and greenhouse gas emissions by 13\nMton/year or more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

In spite of the impressive success\nmade by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy\ncomputation and intensive memory costs. To address this limitation, this paper\npresents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$).\nWe start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on\nuncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to\ndynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework\nis then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at\ndifferent stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage\nof computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video\ntasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4x speed-up for state-of-the-art\nmodels like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy.\nMore importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is\ninherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision\ntransformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being\nlighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our\nframework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual\ntransformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation\nmethods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.

Our first main result shows that, for sets described by one\nbipartite bilinear constraint together with bounds, it is always possible to\nsequentially lift a seed inequality that is valid for a restriction obtained by\nfixing variables to their bounds, when the lifting is accomplished using affine\nfunctions of the fixed variables. In this setting, sequential lifting involves\nsolving a non-convex nonlinear optimization problem each time a variable is\nlifted, just as in Mixed Integer Linear Programming. To reduce the\ncomputational burden associated with this procedure, we develop a framework\nbased on subadditive approximations of lifting functions that permits\nsequence-independent lifting of seed inequalities for separable bipartite\nbilinear sets. In particular, this framework permits the derivation of\nclosed-form valid inequalities. We then study a separable bipartite bilinear\nset where the coefficients form a minimal cover with respect to the\nright-hand-side. For this set, we introduce a bilinear cover inequality, which\nis second-order cone representable. We argue that this bilinear cover\ninequality is strong by showing that it yields a constant-factor approximation\nof the convex hull of the original set. We study its lifting function and\nconstruct a two-slope subadditive upper bound. Using this subadditive\napproximation, we lift fixed variable pairs in closed-form, thus deriving a\nlifted bilinear cover inequality that is valid for general separable bipartite\nbilinear sets with box constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

There is then\nan equivalence among the energy excited within the medium, the Wigner time\ndelay, and the density of states. But these equivalences fall away in the\npresence of material loss or gain. In this paper, we use microwave\nmeasurements, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis to discover the\nchanging relationships among the internal field, transmission, transmission\ntime, dwell time, total excited energy, and the density of states in with loss\nand gain, and their dependence upon dimensionality and spectral overlap. The\ntotal energy excited is equal to the dwell time. In 1D, the average\ntransmission time is independent of loss, gain, and scattering strength. In\nhigher dimensions, however, the average transmission time falls with loss,\nscattering strength and channel number, and increases with gain. It is the sum\nover Lorentzian functions associated with the zeros as well as the poles of the\ntransmission matrix. This endows transmission zeros with robust topological\ncharacteristics: in unitary media, zeros occur either singly on the real axis\nor as conjugate pairs in the complex frequency plane. In weakly absorbing\nmedia, the spectrum of the transmission time of the lowest transmission\neigenchannel is the sum of Lorentzians due to transmission zeros plus a\nbackground due to far-off-resonance poles. The average density of transmission\nzeros in the complex plane is found from the fall of the average transmission\ntime with absorption as zeros are swept into the lower half of the complex\nfrequency plane. We show that the disposition of poles and zeros in the complex\nfrequency plane provides a framework for understanding and controlling wave\npropagation in non-Hermitian systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 19:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

Because of large catalog spaces and real-time\nlatency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall\nbut also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches\n(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but\nfail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,\nembedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior\ndata, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to\nlatency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme\nMulti-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input\ninstances and products are output labels.

Then, the power spectrum of the correlation\nsequence is estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT\ncoefficients corresponding to the angles within the noise-plus-interference\nregion are used to reconstruct the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix\n(NPICM), while the desired signal covariance matrix (DSCM) is estimated by\nidentifying and removing the noise-plus-interference component from the SCM.

Mutable value semantics is a third approach that\nbans sharing instead of mutation, thereby supporting part-wise in-place\nmutation and local reasoning, while maintaining a simple type system. In the\npurest form of mutable value semantics, references are second-class: they are\nonly created implicitly, at function boundaries, and cannot be stored in\nvariables or object fields. Hence, variables can never share mutable state.\n  Because references are often regarded as an indispensable tool to write\nefficient programs, it is legitimate to wonder whether such a discipline can\ncompete other approaches.

In this\npaper, we introduce a concept of the spin-orbital correlation diagram, where\nspin angular momentum is plotted against orbital angular momentum, much like\nthe position-velocity phase diagram in classical mechanics. We use four sets of\nhighly accurate time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (TR-XMCD) data\nto construct four correlation diagrams for iron and cobalt. To our surprise, a\npattern emerges. The trace on the correlation diagram for iron is an arc, and\nat the end of demagnetization, it has a pronounced cusp. The correlation\ndiagram for cobalt is different and appears more linear, but with kinks.

As\naverage temperatures continue to rise, the ability of the transmission network\nto meet demand is diminished. Higher temperatures lead to congestion by\nreducing thermal limits of lines while simultaneously reducing generation\npotential. Due to prohibitive costs and limited real estate for building new\nlines, it is necessary to consider capacity expansion as well to improve the\nfunctioning and efficiency of the grid. Optimal control, however, requires many\ndiscrete choices, rendering fully accurate models intractable. Furthermore,\ntemperature changes will impact different regions and climate differently. As\nsuch, it is necessary to model both temperature changes and transmission flows\nwith high spatial resolution. This work proposes a case study of the\ntransmission grid centered in Arizona, using a DC optimal power flow\nmathematical formulation to plan for future transmission expansion and capacity\nexpansion to efficiently meet demand. The effects of rising temperatures on\ntransmission and generation are modeled at the regional level. Several classes\nof valid inequalities are employed to speed up the solution process. Multiple\nexperiments considering different temperature and demand trends are considered\nwhich include each of the above technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 23:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

This\nproblem is motivated by the goal of better understanding the adaptivity of a\nlearning algorithm. Another motivation comes from fairness: it is known that\nbest-case lower bounds are instrumental in obtaining algorithms for\ndecision-theoretic online learning (DTOL) that satisfy a notion of group\nfairness. Our contributions are a general method to provide best-case lower\nbounds in Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithms with time-varying\nregularizers, which we use to show that best-case lower bounds are of the same\norder as existing upper regret bounds: this includes situations with a fixed\nlearning rate, decreasing learning rates, timeless methods, and adaptive\ngradient methods.

This has\nelevated the need for improved designs by embodying countermeasures, with\nmasking being the most prominent example. To formally verify the security of a\nmasking scheme, numerous attack models have been developed to capture the\nphysical properties of the information leakage as well as the capabilities of\nthe adversary. With regard to these models, extensive research has been\nperformed to realize masking schemes. These research efforts have led to\nsignificant progress in the development of security assessment methodologies\nand further initiated standardization activities. However, since the majority\nof this work is theoretical, it is challenging for the more practice-oriented\nhardware security community to fully grasp and contribute to. To bridge the\ngap, these advancements are reviewed and discussed in this survey, mainly from\nthe perspective of hardware security. In doing so, a clear taxonomy is provided\nthat is helpful for a systematic treatment of the masking-related topics.

Existing mainstream methods\nfollow the instance segmentation pipeline to obtain the text regions. However,\narbitraryshaped texts are difficult to be depicted through one single\nsegmentation network because of the varying scales. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage segmentation-based detector, termed as NASK (Need A Second looK), for\narbitrary-shaped text detection. Compared to the traditional single-stage\nsegmentation network, our NASK conducts the detection in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the first stage segmentation spotting the rectangle text proposals\nand the second one retrieving compact representations. Specifically, NASK is\ncomposed of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network (1st stage), a\nGeometry-aware Text RoI Alignment (GeoAlign) module, and a Fiducial pOint\neXpression (FOX) module (2nd stage). Firstly, TIS extracts the augmented\nfeatures with a novel Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module and\nconducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle proposals. Then, GeoAlign\nconverts these rectangles into the fixed size and encodes RoI-wise feature\nrepresentation. Finally, FOX disintegrates the text instance into serval\npivotal geometrical attributes to refine the detection results. Extensive\nexperimental results on three public benchmarks including Total-Text,\nSCUTCTW1500, and ICDAR 2015 verify that our NASK outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 01:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

For a length-$n$ text, however, they use\n$\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bits of space, which is often too costly. To address this,\nGrossi and Vitter [STOC 2000] and, independently, Ferragina and Manzini [FOCS\n2000] introduced space-efficient versions of the suffix array, known as the\ncompressed suffix array (CSA) and the FM-index. Sadakane [SODA 2002] then\nshowed how to augment them to obtain the compressed suffix tree (CST). For a\nlength-$n$ text over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$, these structures use only\n$O(n\\log\\sigma)$ bits. The biggest remaining open question is how efficiently\nthey can be constructed. After two decades, the fastest algorithms still run in\n$O(n)$ time [Hon et al., FOCS 2003], which is $\\Theta(\\log_{\\sigma} n)$ factor\naway from the lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$.\n  In this paper, we make the first in 20 years improvement in $n$ for this\nproblem by proposing a new compressed suffix array and a new compressed suffix\ntree which admit $o(n)$-time construction algorithms while matching the space\nbounds and the query times of the original CSA/CST and the FM-index. More\nprecisely, our structures take $O(n\\log\\sigma)$ bits, support SA queries and\nfull suffix tree functionality in $O(\\log^{\\epsilon}n)$ time per operation, and\ncan be constructed in $O(n \\min(1,\\log\\sigma/\\sqrt{\\log n}))$ time using\n$O(n\\log\\sigma)$ bits of working space. We derive this result as a corollary\nfrom a much more general reduction: We prove that all parameters of a\ncompressed suffix array/tree (query time, space, construction time, and\nconstruction working space) can essentially be reduced to those of a data\nstructure answering new query types that we call prefix rank and prefix\nselection. Using the novel techniques, we also develop a new index for pattern\nmatching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 02:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 20:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Weaker $B_{\\rm c}$ leads to cooler and\nless dense coronae because most of the input waves dissipate in the lower\natmosphere on account of the larger nonlinearity. Accordingly EUV and X-ray\nluminosities also correlate with $B_{\\rm c}$, while they are emitted in a wide\nrange of the field strength. Finally we extend our results to evaluating the\ncontribution from low-mass Population III coronae to the cosmic reionization.\nWithin the limited range of our parameters on magnetic fields and loop lengths,\nthe EUV and X-ray radiations give a weak impact on the ionization and heating\nof the gas at high redshifts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created\nSemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations\nfrom abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing\n28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using\nSemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a\nPubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our\nknowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug\ninteractions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic\nplausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%\nmore DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT\nmodel obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,\nimproving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.\nSuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings\nidentified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed\nDS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.\nDISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG\nthat was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the\nnature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using\nSemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend\nSemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find\npotential DS-Drug interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 02:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

While institutions are often accredited by qualified authorities\non a regional level, there is no global authority fulfilling this task.\nSecondly, many different data schemas are used to encode education credentials,\nwhich represents a considerable challenge to automated processing.\nConsequently, significant manual effort is required to verify credentials.\n  In this paper, we tackle these challenges by introducing a decentralized and\nopen system to automatically verify the legitimacy of issuers and interpret\ncredentials in unknown schemas. We do so by enabling participants to publish\ntransformation information, which enables verifiers to transform credentials\ninto their preferred schema. Due to the lack of a global root of trust, we\nutilize a distributed ledger to build a decentralized web of trust, which\nverifiers can query to gather information on the trustworthiness of issuing\ninstitutions and to establish trust in transformation information.

Therefore, in this\npaper, we first propose a new metric, degree of delay (DoD), to quantify the\nissue of information delay, and characterize DoD for three typical transmission\nschemes, i.e., TDMA, beamforming based TDMA (BD-TDMA), and retrospective\ninterference alignment (RIA). By analyzing DoD in these schemes, its value\nmainly depends on three factors, i.e., delay sensitive factor, size of data\nset, and queueing delay slot. The first two reflect the relationship between\nquality of service (QoS) and information delay sensitivity, and normalize time\ncost for each symbol, respectively. These two factors are independent of the\ntransmission schemes, and thus we aim to reduce the queueing delay slot to\nimprove DoD. Herein, three novel joint IA schemes are proposed for MIMO\ndownlink networks with different number of users. That is, hybrid antenna array\nbased partial interference elimination and retrospective interference\nregeneration scheme (HAA-PIE-RIR), HAA based improved PIE and RIR scheme\n(HAA-IPIE-RIR), and HAA based cyclic interference elimination and RIR scheme\n(HAA-CIE-RIR).

The presence of scars, grey zones and\nnon-remodeled regions of the myocardium is accounted for by the introduction of\na spatially heterogeneous coefficient in the 3D electromechanics model. This 3D\nelectromechanics model is firstly coupled with a 2-element Windkessel afterload\nmodel to fit the pressure-volume (PV) loop of a patient-specific left ventricle\n(LV) with ICM in SR. Then, we employ the coupling with a 0D closed-loop\ncirculation model to analyze a VT circuit over multiple heartbeats on the same\nLV.

Nevertheless, modern VQAs suffer from cumbersome\ncomputational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary\nquantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the\nsuperiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime\nefficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called\nQUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central\nserver partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate\nthem to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor\nand a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes\nproceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes\noptimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a\nsublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration\nunder the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent\noptimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO\ncan surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the\nnumber of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced\nVQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and\napplications with quantum advantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 08:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

We consider discs that\nare fully exposed to the fluid and discs for which only half of the surface\ninterfaces the fluid. The disc motion is thwarted by the fluid torque in the\nhousing cavity and by the torque of the ball bearing that supports the disc.\nFor the full discs, no drag reduction occurs because of the small angular\nvelocities. The most energetic disc response occurs for disc diameters that are\ncomparable with the spanwise spacing of the low-speed streaks. A perturbation\nanalysis for small disc-tip velocities reveals that the two-way nonlinear\ncoupling has an intense attenuating effect on the disc response.

And detection of such forgery videos is much more urgent and\nchallenging. Most existing detection methods treat the problem as a vanilla\nbinary classification problem. In this paper, the problem is treated as a\nspecial fine-grained classification problem since the differences between fake\nand real faces are very subtle. It is observed that most existing face forgery\nmethods left some common artifacts in the spatial domain and time domain,\nincluding generative defects in the spatial domain and inter-frame\ninconsistencies in the time domain. And a spatial-temporal model is proposed\nwhich has two components for capturing spatial and temporal forgery traces in\nglobal perspective respectively. The two components are designed using a novel\nlong distance attention mechanism. The one component of the spatial domain is\nused to capture artifacts in a single frame, and the other component of the\ntime domain is used to capture artifacts in consecutive frames. They generate\nattention maps in the form of patches. The attention method has a broader\nvision which contributes to better assembling global information and extracting\nlocal statistic information. Finally, the attention maps are used to guide the\nnetwork to focus on pivotal parts of the face, just like other fine-grained\nclassification methods. The experimental results on different public datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance,\nand the proposed long distance attention method can effectively capture pivotal\nparts for face forgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 08:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

Besides the balancing of\nthe work, the communication cost to exchange data between units determines the\nquality of a chosen partition. This cost can be approximated by the\nsurface-to-volume ratio of partitions: the volume represents the amount of\nlocal work, while the surface represents the amount of data to be transmitted.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that space-filling curves yield advantageous\nsurface-to-volume ratios. Formal proofs are available only for regular grids.\nWe investigate the surface-to-volume ratio of space-filling curve partitions\nfor adaptive grids and derive the maximum surface-to-volume ratio as a function\nof the number of cells in the partition. In order to prove our main theorem, we\nconstruct a new framework for the study of adaptive grids, notably introducing\nthe concepts of a shape and of classified partitions. The new methodological\nframework yields insight about the SFC-induced partition character even if the\ngrids refine rather aggressively in localised areas: it quantifies the obtained\nsurface-to-volume ratio.

The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied\ndue to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To\naddress the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching\nframework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and\nunsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an\nablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is\nmore suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is\nintroduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the\nsecond stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level\ncan be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an\nunsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from\nfeatures to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented\nby a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch,\nlearning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution\nsimultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning\nframework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image\nstitching is presented and released.

The (001) surface is the most stable\nsurface among all the low index (001), (010), and (100) surfaces. There are V\nand Bi sites exposed on (001) surface which can serves as activity sites. That\nis quite different from BiVO4 where only Bi sties can be taken as surface\nreaction sites. The OER intermediates OH* and OOH* prefer to form a bridge\nstructure on both V and Bi sites. This makes the first proton removal step is\nvery easy, but the O-O bond is difficult to form which leads the overpotential\nof OER is very high.

The existence of hidden visits hinders our ability to extract reliable\ninformation about human mobility and travel behavior from CDR data. In this\nstudy, we propose a data fusion approach to obtain labeled data for statistical\ninference of hidden visits. In the absence of complementary data, this can be\naccomplished by extracting labeled observations from more granular cellular\ndata access records, and extracting features from voice call and text messaging\nrecords.

The test\nresults show significant improvement over the naive no-hidden-visit rule, which\nis an implicit assumption adopted by most existing studies.

These techniques are also useful for causal policy\nlearning problems, since estimation of individualized treatment rules can be\ncast as a weighted (cost-sensitive) classification problem. Consistency of the\nsurrogate loss approaches studied in Zhang (2004) and Bartlett et al. (2006)\ncrucially relies on the assumption of correct specification, meaning that the\nspecified set of classifiers is rich enough to contain a first-best classifier.\nThis assumption is, however, less credible when the set of classifiers is\nconstrained by interpretability or fairness, leaving the applicability of\nsurrogate loss based algorithms unknown in such second-best scenarios. This\npaper studies consistency of surrogate loss procedures under a constrained set\nof classifiers without assuming correct specification. We show that in the\nsetting where the constraint restricts the classifier's prediction set only,\nhinge losses (i.e., $\\ell_1$-support vector machines) are the only surrogate\nlosses that preserve consistency in second-best scenarios. If the constraint\nadditionally restricts the functional form of the classifier, consistency of a\nsurrogate loss approach is not guaranteed even with hinge loss.

After applying a straight-line approximation for the particle path\ninside the phantom, the most probable value (MPV) of the RSP distribution could\nbe measured with an accuracy of 0.59%. The RSP resolution inside the phantom\nwas only 9.3% due to a limited amount of projections and measured events per\nprojection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 10:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Specifically, our work casts optimization\nas iteratively playing a two-player zero-sum game. Many existing optimization\nalgorithms including Frank-Wolfe and Nesterov's acceleration methods can be\nrecovered from the game by pitting two online learners with appropriate\nstrategies against each other. Furthermore, the sum of the weighted average\nregrets of the players in the game implies the convergence rate. As a result,\nour approach provides simple alternative proofs to these algorithms. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that our approach of optimization as iteratively playing a game\nleads to three new fast Frank-Wolfe-like algorithms for some constraint sets,\nwhich further shows that our framework is indeed generic, modular, and\neasy-to-use.\n  In the second part, we develop a modular analysis of provable acceleration\nvia Polyak's momentum for certain problems, which include solving the classical\nstrongly quadratic convex problems, training a wide ReLU network under the\nneural tangent kernel regime, and training a deep linear network with an\northogonal initialization. We develop a meta theorem and show that when\napplying Polyak's momentum for these problems, the induced dynamics exhibit a\nform where we can directly apply our meta theorem.\n  In the last part of the dissertation, we show another advantage of the use of\nPolyak's momentum -- it facilitates fast saddle point escape in smooth\nnon-convex optimization. This result, together with those of the second part,\nsheds new light on Polyak's momentum in modern non-convex optimization and deep\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 17:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

Recently, machine learning based\nsolutions have shown their capacity to give more accurate stock prediction and\nbecome indispensable components in modern quantitative investment systems.\nHowever, the i.i.d. assumption behind existing methods is inconsistent with the\nexistence of diverse trading patterns in the stock market, which inevitably\nlimits their ability to achieve better stock prediction performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to\nempower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple\nstock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists\nof a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a\nrouter to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of\nexplicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective\nTRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning\nalgorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to\npredictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment\nthrough an auxiliary loss term.

Although these methods show strong results\non outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised\nmethods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are\ncommon for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:\nabundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for\nimages under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more\ngeneralised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel\nFilled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction\nerror loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in\nuntextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured\nareas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show\nthat depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without\nany loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.\nSecondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations,\nin both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over\nthe entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is\nsuccessfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets\nwith no camera rotation.

An original\ncomputational strategy is developed to address the resulting static limit\nanalysis problem, involving the introduction of a mesh on the dome mid-surface,\nthe interpolation of the physical components of the shell stress tensors on the\nelement boundaries, and the imposition of equilibrium and admissibility\nconditions respectively for the elements and at the nodes of the mesh. The\ndescending discrete convex optimization problem is solved by standard and\neffective optimization tools, automatically providing collapse multiplier of\nhorizontal forces, incipient collapse mechanism and expected crack pattern.\nConvergence analysis, validation with experimental results available in the\nliterature, and parametric analyses with respect to geometric parameters and\nfriction coefficient, are presented for spherical and ellipsoidal masonry\ndomes, proving the reliability of the proposed approach for estimating the\npseudo-static seismic resistance of masonry domes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 12:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

First, as users\nmay grant or revoke permissions at any time while they are using an app,\ndevelopers need to ensure that the app properly checks and requests required\npermissions before invoking any permission-protected APIs. Second, Android's\npermission mechanism keeps evolving and getting customized by device\nmanufacturers.

This paper\npresents a human-in-the-loop approach to explain machine learning models using\nverbatim neighborhood manifestation. Contrary to most of the current\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems, which provide hit-or-miss\napproximate explanations, our approach generates the local decision boundary of\nthe given instance and enables human intelligence to conclude the model\nbehavior. Our method can be divided into three stages: 1) a neighborhood\ngeneration stage, which generates instances based on the given sample; 2) a\nclassification stage, which yields classifications on the generated instances\nto carve out the local decision boundary and delineate the model behavior; and\n3) a human-in-the-loop stage, which involves human to refine and explore the\nneighborhood of interest. In the generation stage, a generative model is used\nto generate the plausible synthetic neighbors around the given instance. After\nthe classification stage, the classified neighbor instances provide a\nmultifaceted understanding of the model behavior. Three intervention points are\nprovided in the human-in-the-loop stage, enabling humans to leverage their own\nintelligence to interpret the model behavior.

By learning\nfrom the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been\nbuilt to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto\ndiagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population\nthat satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is\nscarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This\nstudy presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic\npre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,\nfollowed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The\nsemantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,\nand the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware\nfine-tuning stage.

The convergence of\nthe two approaches is founded on two key features. The first is a penalty term\nwith a single, automatically tuned, parameter for controlling the step size of\nthe gas network iterates. The second is a sequence of supporting hyperplanes\ntogether with an increasing number of carefully constructed halfspaces for\ncontrolling the convergence of the electricity network iterates. Moreover, the\ntwo proposed algorithms use as a warm start the solution from a novel\npolyhedral relaxation of the MOEGF problem, for a noticeable improvement in\ncomputation time as compared to a cold start. Unlike the first method, which\ninvokes a branch-and-bound algorithm to find an integral solution, the second\nmethod implements an elaborate steering procedure that guides the continuous\nvariables to take integral values at the solution.

We observe that,\ndue to their intended security guarantees, SC schemes are inherently oblivious\n-- their memory access patterns are independent of the input data. Using this\nproperty, MAGE calculates the memory access pattern ahead of time and uses it\nto produce a memory management plan. This formulation of memory management,\nwhich we call memory programming, is a generalization of paging that allows\nMAGE to provide a highly efficient virtual memory abstraction for SC.

Different from\nother common e-commerce platforms, the behavior of users on the local consumer\nservice platform is closely related to their real-time local context\ninformation. Therefore, building a context-aware user behavior prediction\nsystem is able to provide both merchants and users better service in local\nconsumer service platforms. However, most of the previous work just treats the\ncontextual information as an ordinary feature into the prediction model to\nobtain the prediction list under a specific context, which ignores the fact\nthat the interest of a user in different contexts is often significantly\ndifferent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a context-aware heterogeneous graph\nattention network (CHGAT) to dynamically generate the representation of the\nuser and to estimate the probability for future behavior. Specifically, we\nfirst construct the meta-path based heterogeneous graphs with the historical\nbehaviors from multiple sources and comprehend heterogeneous vertices in the\ngraph with a novel unified knowledge representing approach. Next, a multi-level\nattention mechanism is introduced for context-aware aggregation with graph\nvertices, which contains the vertex-level attention network and the path-level\nattention network. Both of them aim to capture the semantic correlation between\ninformation contained in the graph and the outside real-time contextual\ninformation in the search system. Then the model proposed in this paper\naggregates specific graphs with their corresponding context features and\nobtains the representation of user interest under a specific context and input\nit into the prediction network to finally obtain the predicted probability of\nuser behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 03:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Depending on the quality and accuracy,\nthese multi-source data are divided into different fidelity levels.\nHigh-fidelity (HF) responses describe the system of interest accurately but are\ncomputed costly. In contrast, low-fidelity (LF) responses have a low\ncomputational cost but could not meet the required accuracy. Multi-fidelity\ndata fusion (MDF) methods aims to use massive LF samples and small amounts of\nHF samples to develop an accurate and efficient model for describing the system\nwith a reasonable computation burden. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngenerative adversarial network for MDF in digital twins (GAN-MDF). The\ngenerator of GAN-MDF is composed of two sub-networks: one extracts the LF\nfeatures from an input; and the other integrates the input and the extracted LF\nfeatures to form the input of the subsequent discriminator. The discriminator\nof GAN-MDF identifies whether the generator output is a real sample generated\nfrom HF model. To enhance the stability of GAN-MDF's training, we also\nintroduce the supervised-loss trick to refine the generator weights during each\niteration of the adversarial training. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nmethods, the proposed GAN-MDF has the following advantages: 1) it performs well\nin the case of either nested or unnested sample structure; 2) there is no\nspecific assumption on the data distribution; and 3) it has high robustness\neven when very few HF samples are provided. The experimental results also\nsupport the validity of GAN-MDF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 06:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

This work aims at developing a system that imitates humans when\nidentifying words in running speech and, in this way, provide a framework to\nbetter understand human speech processing. We build a speech recognizer for\nItalian based on the principles of Stevens' model of Lexical Access in which\nwords are stored as hierarchical arrangements of distinctive features (Stevens,\nK. N. (2002). \"Toward a model for lexical access based on acoustic landmarks\nand distinctive features,\" J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 111(4):1872-1891). Over the\npast few decades, the Speech Communication Group at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology (MIT) developed a speech recognition system for English based on\nthis approach. Italian will be the first language beyond English to be\nexplored; the extension to another language provides the opportunity to test\nthe hypothesis that words are represented in memory as a set of\nhierarchically-arranged distinctive features, and reveal which of the\nunderlying mechanisms may have a language-independent nature. This paper also\nintroduces a new Lexical Access corpus, the LaMIT database, created and labeled\nspecifically for this work, that will be provided freely to the speech research\ncommunity. Future developments will test the hypothesis that specific acoustic\ndiscontinuities - called landmarks - that serve as cues to features, are\nlanguage independent, while other cues may be language-dependent, with powerful\nimplications for understanding how the human brain recognizes speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 10:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

With the utilisation of\nconformal mapping, the porous structures here can be generated by two\ncontrolling field variables, the (logarithm of) the local scaling factor and\nthe rotational angle of the matrix cell, and they are interrelated through the\nCauchy-Riemann equations. Thus the design variables are simply reduced to the\nlogarithm values of the local scaling factor on selected boundary points. Other\nattractive features shown by the present method are summarised as follows.\nFirstly, with the condition of total differential automatically met by the two\ncontrolling field variables, the integrability problem which necessitates\npost-processing treatments in many other similar methods can be resolved\nnaturally. Secondly, according to the maximum principle for harmonic functions,\nthe minimum feature size can be explicitly monitored during optimisation.\nThirdly, the rotational symmetry possessed by the matrix cell can be fully\nexploited in the context of conformal mapping, and the computational cost for\nsolving the cell problems for the homogenised elasticity tensor is maximally\nabased. In particular, when the design domain takes a rectangle shape,\nanalytical expressions for the controlling fields are available. The\nhomogenised results are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to converge\nto the corresponding fine-scale results, and the effectiveness of the proposed\nwork is further demonstrated with more numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 04:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Moreover, we have incorporated Berenger's\nperfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition (ABC) into the\ndispersive formulation to truncate open-domain structures. In general, the LH\nmedium as a kind of dispersive media can be described by frequency-dependent\nconstitutive parameters. The most appropriate numerical techniques for analysis\nof LH media are dispersive formulations of conventional numerical methods. In\ncomparison to the conventional grid-based numerical methods, it is proved that\nmeshless methods not only are strong tools for accurate approximation of\nderivatives in Maxwell's equations but also can provide more flexibility in\nmodeling the spatial domain of problems. However, we have not seen any reports\non using dispersive forms of meshless methods for simulation of wave\npropagation in metamaterials and applying any PML ABCs to dispersive\nformulation of meshless method. The proposed formulation in this paper enables\nus to take advantage of meshless methods in analysis of LH media. For modeling\nthe frequency behavior of the medium in the proposed dispersive formulation, we\nhave used auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method based on the relations\nbetween electromagnetic fields intensities and current densities. Effectiveness\nof the proposed formulation is verified by a numerical example; also, some\nbasic factors which affect the accuracy and computational cost of the\nsimulations are studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 06:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

In several\ninstances, the constant term of the potential has no physical meaning. However,\nthere are special cases where it receives important applications. In low\ndimensions ($d=1$), in a quantum mechanical model, this term is associated with\nthe ground-state energy of the anharmonic oscillator. In higher dimensions\n($d=4$), it is identical to the $\\Lambda$ term of the Einstein equations and it\nplays a role in cosmic inflation. Thus, in statistical field theory, in flat\nspace, the constant term could be associated with the free energy, while in\ncurved space, it could be naturally associated with the cosmological constant.\nIt is known that one has to use a subtraction method for the quantum anharmonic\noscillator in $d=1$ to remove the $k^2$ term that appears in the RG flow in its\nhigh-energy (UV) limit in order to recover the correct results for the\nground-state energy. The subtraction is needed because the Gaussian fixed point\nis missing in the RG flow once the constant term is included. However, if the\nGaussian fixed point is there, no further subtraction is required. Here, we\npropose a subtraction method for $k^4$ and $k^2$ terms of the UV scaling of the\nRG equations for $d=4$ dimensions if the Gaussian fixed point is missing in the\nRG flow with the constant term.
