The\nclassical response is anonymization, i.e., sanitizing the information that can\ndirectly or indirectly allow users' re-identification. The most popular\nsolution in the literature is the k-anonymity. However, it is hard to achieve\nk-anonymity on a continuous stream of data, as well as when the number of\ndimensions becomes high.In this paper, we propose a novel anonymization\nproperty called z-anonymity. Differently from k-anonymity, it can be achieved\nwith zero-delay on data streams and it is well suited for high dimensional\ndata. The idea at the base of z-anonymity is to release an attribute (an atomic\ninformation) about a user only if at least z - 1 other users have presented the\nsame attribute in a past time window. z-anonymity is weaker than k-anonymity\nsince it does not work on the combinations of attributes, but treats them\nindividually. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework to map the\nz-anonymity into the k-anonymity property. Our results show that a proper\nchoice of the z-anonymity parameters allows the data curator to likely obtain a\nk-anonymized dataset, with a precisely measurable probability. We also evaluate\na real use case, in which we consider the website visits of a population of\nusers and show that z-anonymity can work in practice for obtaining the\nk-anonymity too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

To ensure uninterrupted\ncommunication, existing lightpath provisioning schemes are mainly done with the\nassumption of worst-case resource under-provisioning and fixed channel spacing,\nwhich preserves an excessive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) margin. However, under\na resource over-provisioning scenario, the excessive SNR margin restricts the\ntransmission bit-rate or transmission reach, leading to physical layer resource\nwaste and stranded transmission capacity. To tackle this challenging problem,\nwe leverage an iterative feedback tuning algorithm to provide a just-enough SNR\nmargin, so as to maximize the network throughput. Specifically, the proposed\nalgorithm is implemented in three steps. First, starting from the high SNR\nmargin setup, we establish an integer linear programming model as well as a\nheuristic algorithm to maximize the network throughput by solving the problem\nof routing, modulation format, forward error correction, baud-rate selection,\nand spectrum assignment. Second, we optimize the channel spacing of the\nlightpaths obtained from the previous step, thereby increasing the available\nphysical layer resources. Finally, we iteratively reduce the SNR margin of each\nlightpath until the network throughput cannot be increased. Through numerical\nsimulations, we confirm the throughput improvement in different networks and\nwith different baud-rates. In particular, we find that our algorithm enables\nover 20\\% relative gain when network resource is over-provisioned, compared to\nthe traditional method preserving an excessive SNR margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:02:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 00:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Consequently we consistently estimate dynamic networks of Box Jenkins\nmodel structure, while keeping the computational burden low.

Research efforts have begun to focus on the engineering\nchallenges associated with developing large-scale ion-trap arrays and networks.\nHowever, increasing the size of the array and integrating on-chip electronics\ncan drastically increase the power dissipation within the ion-trap chips. This\nleads to an increase in the operating temperature of the ion-trap and limits\nthe device performance. Therefore, effective thermal management is an essential\nconsideration for any large-scale architecture. Presented here is the\ndevelopment of a modular cooling system designed for use with multiple\nion-trapping experiments simultaneously. The system includes an extensible\ncryostat that permits scaling of the cooling power to meet the demands of a\nlarge network. Following experimental testing on two independent ion-trap\nexperiments, the cooling system is expected to deliver a net cooling power of\n111 W at ~70 K to up to four experiments.

Electric utilities in these\neconomies face unique constraints regarding raising capital required to upgrade\ntheir congested networks.

This article presents a flexible valuation framework\nfor battery storage use in distribution networks and its application in the\ncontext of EMDE distribution network planning.

However, in presence of\nhigh traffic load, not all offered traffic can be satisfied at all time. As\ncarried traffic load brings revenues to operators, traffic blocking due to\nlimited spectrum resource leads to revenue losses. In this study, given a set\nof traffic requests to be provisioned, we consider the problem of maximizing\noperator's revenue, subject to limited spectrum resource and physical layer\nimpairments (PLIs), namely amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE),\nself-channel interference (SCI), cross-channel interference (XCI), and node\ncrosstalk. In FONs, adaptive modulation, multiple FEC, and the tuning of power\nspectrum density (PSD) can be effectively employed to mitigate the impact of\nPLIs. Hence, in our study, we propose a universal bandwidth-related impairment\nevaluation model based on channel bandwidth, which allows a performance\nanalysis for different PSD, FEC and modulations. Leveraging this PLI model and\na piecewise linear fitting function, we succeed to formulate the revenue\nmaximization problem as a mixed integer linear program. Then, to solve the\nproblem on larger network instances, a fast two-phase heuristic algorithm is\nalso proposed, which is shown to be near-optimal for revenue maximization.\nThrough simulations, we demonstrate that using adaptive modulation enables to\nsignificantly increase revenues in the scenario of high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), where the revenue can even be doubled for high traffic load, while using\nmultiple FECs is more profitable for scenarios with low SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

The last allows to present the one to one\ncorrespondence between monotone Riemannian metrics and operator monotone\nfunctions (which is a statement of the Petz theorem in the quantum information\ntheory) in terms of the linear response theory. We show that monotone\nRiemannian metrics can be determined from the analysis of the infinite chain of\nequations of motion of the retarded Green's functions. Inequalities between the\ndifferent metrics have been obtained as well. It is a demonstration that the\nanalysis of information-theoretic problems has benefited from concepts of\nstatistical mechanics and might cross-fertilize or extend both directions, and\nvice versa. We illustrate the presented approach on the calculation of the\nentire class of monotone (contractive) Riemannian metrics on the examples of\nsome simple but instructive systems employed in various physical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

However, this can only occur with\ndrastic cost reductions compared to current battery technology, with predicted\ntargets for the cost per unit energy (CPE) below $20/kWh. Notably, for full\ndecarbonization, long duration storage up to 100 hrs will be needed at such low\ncosts, and prior analyses have shown that in such high renewable penetration\nscenarios, CPE is more critical than other parameters such as round trip\nefficiency or cost per unit power when comparing the costs of different\ntechnologies. Here, we introduce an electricity storage concept that stores\nelectricity as sensible heat in graphite storage blocks and uses multi-junction\nthermophotovoltaics (TPV) as a heat engine to convert it back to electricity on\ndemand. This design is an outgrowth of the system proposed by Amy et al. in\n2019, which has been modified here to use a solid graphite medium and molten\ntin as a heat transfer fluid rather than silicon as both. The reason for this\nis two-fold: (1) the CPE of graphite is almost 10X lower than that of silicon,\nwhich derives from the lower cost per unit mass (i.e., $0.5/kg vs. $1.5/kg) and\nthe higher heat capacity per unit mass (2000 J/kg-K vs. 950 J/kg-K); and (2)\nthe melting point tin and solubility of tin in graphite are much lower than\nthat of silicon, which lessens the number of issues that have to overcome along\nthe research and development pathway. The usage of graphite also eliminates the\nneed for a second tank, but the main disadvantage of using a solid medium is\nthat one cannot easily provide a steady discharge rate, as the power output\nfrom the storage will change with time, as the graphite cools during discharge.\nThus, the objective of this work is to examine how these changes in the system\ndesign effect the overall technoeconomics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

SSB manifests itself through a pitchfork\nbifurcation, but that bifurcation is fragile, and perturbed by any asymmetry or\nimperfections.

The two-roundtrip evolution induces a self-symmetrization of the\nsystem through averaging of the parameters, hence enabling the realization of\nSSB with unprecedented robustness. This mechanism is universal: all\nsymmetry-broken solutions of driven Kerr resonators have a period-doubled\ncounterpart.

The physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is\nstill a matter of open debate and the samples are too small and of\nserendipitous nature to provide robust answers. In order to tackle this\nproblem, we need to design methods that are able to detect AGN right in the act\nof changing-state. Here we present an anomaly detection (AD) technique designed\nto identify AGN light curves with anomalous behaviors in massive datasets. The\nmain aim of this technique is to identify CSAGN at different stages of the\ntransition, but it can also be used for more general purposes, such as cleaning\nmassive datasets for AGN variability analyses. We used light curves from the\nZwicky Transient Facility data release 5 (ZTF DR5), containing a sample of\n230,451 AGNs of different classes. The ZTF DR5 light curves were modeled with a\nVariational Recurrent Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture, that allowed us to\nobtain a set of attributes from the VRAE latent space that describes the\ngeneral behaviour of our sample. These attributes were then used as features\nfor an Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm, that is an anomaly detector for a \"one\nclass\" kind of problem. We used the VRAE reconstruction errors and the IF\nanomaly score to select a sample of 8,809 anomalies. These anomalies are\ndominated by bogus candidates, but we were able to identify 75 promising CSAGN\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 16:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

In particular, type-II\nmultiferroics exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which\ndirectly induces a ferroelectric polarization through various mechanisms, such\nas the spin-current or the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya effect. This intrinsic\ncoupling between the magnetic and dipolar order parameters results in\nrecord-strength magnetoelectric effects. Two dimensional materials possessing\nsuch intrinsic multiferroic properties have been long sought for harnessing\nmagnetoelectric coupling in nanoelectronic devices. Here, we report the\ndiscovery of type-II multiferroic order in a single atomic layer of the\ntransition metal-based van der Waals material NiI2. The multiferroic state of\nNiI2 is characterized by a proper-screw spin helix with given handedness, which\ncouples to the charge degrees of freedom to produce a chirality-controlled\nelectrical polarization. We use circular dichroic Raman measurements to\ndirectly probe the magneto-chiral ground state and its electromagnon modes\noriginating from dynamic magnetoelectric coupling. Using birefringence and\nsecond-harmonic generation measurements, we detect a highly anisotropic\nelectronic state simultaneously breaking three-fold rotational and inversion\nsymmetry, and supporting polar order. The evolution of the optical signatures\nas a function of temperature and layer number surprisingly reveals an ordered\nmagnetic, polar state that persists down to the ultrathin limit of monolayer\nNiI2. These observations establish NiI2 and transition metal dihalides as a new\nplatform for studying emergent multiferroic phenomena, chiral magnetic textures\nand ferroelectricity in the two-dimensional limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 06:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 08:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Along with the CMB dipole\nsignal, this motion also causes an inevitable signature of statistical\nanisotropy in the higher multipoles due to the modulation and aberration of the\nCMB temperature and polarization fields. This leads to a correlation between\nadjacent CMB multipoles causing a non-zero value of the off-diagonal terms in\nthe covariance matrix which can be captured in terms of the dipolar spectra of\nthe bipolar spherical harmonics (BipoSH).

Hence, their realistic\ntreatment in N-body studies is critical to accurately model the formation of\nterrestrial planets and to develop interpretations of telescopic and spacecraft\nobservations. In this work, we compare the effects of two collision\nprescriptions on the core-mantle differentiation of terrestrial planets: a\nmodel in which collisions are always completely accretionary (``perfect\nmerging'') and a more realistic model based on neural networks that has been\ntrained on hydrodynamical simulations of giant impacts. The latter model is\nable to predict the loss of mass due to imperfect accretion and the evolution\nof non-accreted projectiles in hit-and-run collisions. We find that the results\nof the neural-network model feature a wider range of final core mass fractions\nand metal-silicate equilibration pressures, temperatures, and oxygen fugacities\nthan the assumption of perfect merging. When used to model collisions in N-body\nstudies of terrestrial planet formation, the two models provide similar answers\nfor planets more massive than 0.1 Earth's masses. For less massive final\nbodies, however, the inefficient-accretion model predicts a higher degree of\ncompositional diversity. This phenomenon is not reflected in planet formation\nmodels of the solar system that use perfect merging to determine collisional\noutcomes. Our findings confirm the role of giant impacts as important drivers\nof planetary diversity and encourage a realistic implementation of inefficient\naccretion in future accretion studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 18:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

We apply the adversarial paradigm to\nthis question, and introduce a new adversarial method of dataset creation for\nparaphrase identification: the Adversarial Paraphrasing Task (APT), which asks\nparticipants to generate semantically equivalent (in the sense of mutually\nimplicative) but lexically and syntactically disparate paraphrases.

Among these mechanisms, settling-driven gravitational\ninstabilities result from the formation of a gravitationally-unstable particle\nboundary layer (PBL) that grows between volcanic ash clouds and the underlying\natmosphere. The PBL destabilises once it reaches a critical thickness,\ntriggering the formation of rapid, downward-moving ash fingers that remain\npoorly characterised. We simulate this process by coupling a Lattice Boltzmann\nmodel, which solves the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid phase, with a\nWeighted Essentially Non Oscillatory (WENO) finite difference scheme which\nsolves the advection-diffusion-settling equation describing particle transport.\nSince the physical problem is advection dominated, the use of the WENO scheme\nreduces numerical diffusivity and ensures accurate tracking of the temporal\nevolution of the interface between the layers. We have validated the new model\nby showing that the simulated early-time growth rate of the instability is in\nvery good agreement with that predicted by linear stability analysis, whilst\nthe modelled late-stage behaviour also successfully reproduces quantitative\nresults from published laboratory experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 18:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The\nstandard-of-care for interpretation of coronary angiograms depends upon ad-hoc\nvisual assessment by the physician operator. However, ad-hoc visual\ninterpretation of angiograms is poorly reproducible, highly variable and bias\nprone. Here we show for the first time that fully-automated angiogram\ninterpretation to estimate coronary artery stenosis is possible using a\nsequence of deep neural network algorithms. The algorithmic pipeline we\ndeveloped--called CathAI--achieves state-of-the art performance across the\nsequence of tasks required to accomplish automated interpretation of\nunselected, real-world angiograms. CathAI (Algorithms 1-2) demonstrated\npositive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the\nprojection angle overall and >=93% for left or right coronary artery angiogram\ndetection, the primary anatomic structures of interest. To predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis (>=70% stenosis), CathAI (Algorithm 4) exhibited an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI:\n0.843-0.880). When externally validated in a healthcare system in another\ncountry, CathAI AUC was 0.869 (95% CI: 0.830-0.907) to predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis. Our results demonstrate that multiple purpose-built\nneural networks can function in sequence to accomplish the complex series of\ntasks required for automated analysis of real-world angiograms. Deployment of\nCathAI may serve to increase standardization and reproducibility in coronary\nstenosis assessment, while providing a robust foundation to accomplish future\ntasks for algorithmic angiographic interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 18:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

This paper derives the first non-null central limit\ntheorem for the sample distance covariance, and the more general sample\n(Hilbert-Schmidt) kernel distance covariance in high dimensions, primarily in\nthe Gaussian case. The new non-null central limit theorem yields an\nasymptotically exact first-order power formula for the widely used generalized\nkernel distance correlation test of independence between $X$ and $Y$.

For this reason, we find that these agents can achieve either high\nutility or cooperation, but not both. To address this, we introduce a targeted\ndata acquisition framework where we guide the exploration of a reinforcement\nlearning agent using annotations from an expert oracle.

One such planet is known (K2-18b) and other candidates are being\nfollowed up. Sub Neptunes are common and easier to study observationally than\nrocky exoplanets because of their larger sizes, lower densities, and extended\natmospheres or envelopes. Yet, sub Neptunes lack any solid surface as we know\nit, so it is worthwhile considering whether their atmospheres can support an\naerial biosphere. We review, synthesize, and build upon existing research.\nPassive microbial-like life particles must persist aloft in a region with\nliquid water clouds for long enough to metabolize, reproduce, and spread before\ndownward transport to lower altitudes that may be too hot for life of any kind\nto survive.

In order to better take advantage of\navailable quantum resources and obtain the maximum possible sensitivity, it is\nnecessary to determine fundamental sensitivity limits for different possible\nconfigurations for a given sensing system. Here, due to their wide\napplicability, we focus on optical resonance sensors, which detect a change in\na parameter of interest through a resonance shift. We compare their fundamental\nsensitivity limits set by the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) based on the\nestimation of changes in transmission or phase of a probing bright two-mode\nsqueezed state (bTMSS) of light. We show that the fundamental sensitivity\nresults from an interplay between the QCRB and the transfer function of the\nsystem. As a result, for a resonance sensor with a Lorentzian lineshape a\nphase-based scheme outperforms a transmission-based one for most of the\nparameter space; however, this is not the case for lineshapes with steeper\nslopes, such as higher order Butterworth lineshapes. Furthermore, such an\ninterplay results in conditions under which the phase-based scheme provides a\nhigher sensitivity than the transmission-based one but a smaller degree of\nquantum enhancement. We also study the effect of losses external to the sensor\non the degree of quantum enhancement and show that for certain conditions\nprobing with a classical state can provide a higher sensitivity than probing\nwith a bTMSS. Finally, we discuss detection schemes, namely optimized\nintensity-difference and optimized homodyne detection, that can achieve the\nfundamental sensitivity limits even in the presence of external losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

However, to extend the range of compositions and applications,\nprofound knowledge about composition-property relationships is necessary. To\nthis end, we collected a large quantity of composition-property data on\nchalcogenide glasses from SciGlass database regarding glass transition\ntemperature ($T_g$), Young's modulus ($E$), coefficient of thermal expansion\n(CTE), and refractive index ($n_D$). With these data, we induced predictive\nmodels using three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, K-nearest\nNeighbors, and Classification and Regression Trees. Finally, the induced models\nwere interpreted by computing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values\nof the chemical features, which revealed the key elements that significantly\nimpacted the tested properties and quantified their impact. For instance, Ge\nand Ga increase $T_g$ and $E$ and decrease CTE (three properties that depend on\nbond strength), whereas Se has the opposite effect. Te, As, Tl, and Sb increase\n$n_D$ (which strongly depends on polarizability), whereas S, Ge, and P diminish\nit. Knowledge about the effect of each element on the glass properties is\nprecious for semi-empirical compositional development trials or\nsimulation-driven formulations. The induced models can be used to design novel\nchalcogenide glasses with required combinations of properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The main advantage is that OCA ensure a certain amount of diffusion in\nthe generated sequences, a property which is usually missing from traditional\nCA-based pseudorandom number generators. We study the problem of finding OCA\npairs with maximal period by first performing an exhaustive search up to local\nrules of diameter $d=5$, and then focusing on the subclass of linear\nbipermutive rules.

In this problem, instead of i.i.d. training and testing\ndatapoints, we assume that the source (training) data and the target (testing)\ndata have different distributions. With that setting, the empirical risk\nminimization training procedure often does not perform well, since it does not\naccount for the change in the distribution. A common approach in the domain\nadaptation literature is to learn a representation of the input that has the\nsame (marginal) distribution over the source and the target domain. However,\nthese approaches often require additional networks and/or optimizing an\nadversarial (minimax) objective, which can be very expensive or unstable in\npractice. To improve upon these marginal alignment techniques, in this paper,\nwe first derive a generalization bound for the target loss based on the\ntraining loss and the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the\nsource and the target representation distributions. Based on this bound, we\nderive an algorithm that minimizes the KL term to obtain a better\ngeneralization to the target domain. We show that with a probabilistic\nrepresentation network, the KL term can be estimated efficiently via minibatch\nsamples without any additional network or a minimax objective. This leads to a\ntheoretically sound alignment method which is also very efficient and stable in\npractice. Experimental results also suggest that our method outperforms other\nrepresentation-alignment approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 22:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 16:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Nevertheless, the\nsystematic understanding of the Landau levels of quasicrystals in the presence\nof the magnetic field has not been established yet. One of the main obstacles\nis the complication of the quasiperiodic tilings without periodic length\nscales, thus it has been thought that the system cannot possess any universal\nfeatures of the Landau levels. In this paper, contrary to these assertions, we\ndevelop a generic theory of the Landau levels for quasicrystals. Focusing on\nthe two dimensional quasicrystals with rotational symmetries, we highlight that\nquasiperiodic tilings induce anomalous Landau levels where electrons are\nlocalized near the rotational symmetry centers. Interestingly, the localization\nlength of these Landau levels has a universal dependence on n for quasicrystals\nwith n-fold rotational symmetry. Furthermore, macroscopically degenerate zero\nenergy Landau levels are present due to the chiral symmetry of the rhombic\ntilings. In this case, each Landau level forms an independent island where\nelectrons are trapped at given fields, but with field control, the interference\nbetween the islands gives rise to an abrupt change in the local density of\nstates.

To address this shortfall, we develop a framework\nbased in Bayesian inference to provide a more rigorous methodology for\nestimating pre-instrumental earthquakes. By directly modeling accounts of\nresultant tsunamis via probability distributions, the framework allows\npractitioners to make principled estimates of key characteristics (e.g.,\nmagnitude and location) of historical earthquakes. To illustrate this idea, we\napply the methodology to the estimation of an earthquake in Eastern Indonesia\nin the mid 19th century, the source of which is currently the subject of\nconsiderable debate in the geological community.

ML models have shown promising results in research settings, but\ntheir lack of interoperability has been a major barrier for clinical\nintegration and evaluation. The DICOM a standard specifies Information Object\nDefinitions and Services for the representation and communication of digital\nimages and related information, including image-derived annotations and\nanalysis results. However, the complexity of the standard represents an\nobstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates a need for software\nlibraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format. Here\nwe present the highdicom library, which provides a high-level application\nprogramming interface for the Python programming language that abstracts\nlow-level details of the standard and enables encoding and decoding of\nimage-derived information in DICOM format in a few lines of Python code. The\nhighdicom library ties into the extensive Python ecosystem for image processing\nand machine learning. Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of\nDICOM-compliant files, highdicom achieves interoperability with the medical\nimaging systems that hold the data used to train and run ML models, and\nultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging,\nthat, by bridging these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train\nand evaluate state-of-the-art ML models in pathology and radiology while\nremaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable with clinical\nsystems at all stages.

We tackle the problem of cross-domain few-shot learning where there is\na large shift between the base and target domain. The problem of cross-domain\nfew-shot recognition with unlabeled target data is largely unaddressed in the\nliterature. STARTUP was the first method that tackles this problem using\nself-training. However, it uses a fixed teacher pretrained on a labeled base\ndataset to create soft labels for the unlabeled target samples. As the base\ndataset and unlabeled dataset are from different domains, projecting the target\nimages in the class-domain of the base dataset with a fixed pretrained model\nmight be sub-optimal. We propose a simple dynamic distillation-based approach\nto facilitate unlabeled images from the novel/base dataset. We impose\nconsistency regularization by calculating predictions from the weakly-augmented\nversions of the unlabeled images from a teacher network and matching it with\nthe strongly augmented versions of the same images from a student network. The\nparameters of the teacher network are updated as exponential moving average of\nthe parameters of the student network.

We model this region with the\nExplicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate model using its active\nmicrophysics scheme to study the phenomenology of water and ammonia clouds\nwithin the jet region. On perturbing the atmosphere, we find that an upper\ntropospheric wave develops that directly influences the cloud structure within\nthe jet.

This work gives the first\nconvergence analysis of the DP deep learning, through the lens of training\ndynamics and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Our convergence theory\nsuccessfully characterizes the effects of two key components in the DP\ntraining: the per-sample clipping and the noise addition. Our analysis not only\ninitiates a general principled framework to understand the DP deep learning\nwith any network architecture and loss function, but also motivates a new\nclipping method -- the global clipping, that significantly improves the\nconvergence, as well as preserves the same DP guarantee and computational\nefficiency as the existing method, which we term as local clipping.\n  Theoretically speaking, we precisely characterize the effect of per-sample\nclipping on the NTK matrix and show that the noise level of DP optimizers does\nnot affect the convergence in the gradient flow regime. In particular, the\nlocal clipping almost certainly breaks the positive semi-definiteness of NTK,\nwhich can be preserved by our global clipping. Consequently, DP gradient\ndescent (GD) with global clipping converge monotonically to zero loss, which is\noften violated by the existing DP-GD. Notably, our analysis framework easily\nextends to other optimizers, e.g., DP-Adam. We demonstrate through numerous\nexperiments that DP optimizers equipped with global clipping perform strongly\non classification and regression tasks. In addition, our global clipping is\nsurprisingly effective at learning calibrated classifiers, in contrast to the\nexisting DP classifiers which are oftentimes over-confident and unreliable.\nImplementation-wise, the new clipping can be realized by inserting one line of\ncode into the Pytorch Opacus library.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 01:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 04:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 04:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 05:25:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 22:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

It costs only\n$O(\\lambda n^3)$ bits and $O(1)$ rounds, and ensures that with at least 1/3\nprobability, all honest parties can output a common bit that is as if randomly\nflipped. This directly renders more efficient private-setup free asynchronous\nbinary agreement (ABA) with expected $O(\\lambda n^3)$ bits and $O(1)$ rounds. -\nThen, we lift our common coin to attain perfect agreement by using a single\nABA.

(2018), is a smoothed rotation-independent Fourier\namplitude spectrum of the two horizontal components of an acceleration time\nhistory. The main motivation for developing a non-ergodic $EAS$ GMM, rather\nthan a spectral acceleration GMM, is that the scaling of $EAS$ does not depend\non spectral shape, and therefore, the more frequent small magnitude events can\nbe used in the estimation of the non-ergodic terms.\n  The model is developed using the California subset of the NGAWest2 dataset\nAncheta et al. (2013). The Bayless and Abrahamson (2019b) (BA18) ergodic $EAS$\nGMM was used as backbone to constrain the average source, path, and site\nscaling. The non-ergodic GMM is formulated as a Bayesian hierarchical model:\nthe non-ergodic source and site terms are modeled as spatially varying\ncoefficients following the approach of Landwehr et al. (2016), and the\nnon-ergodic path effects are captured by the cell-specific anelastic\nattenuation attenuation following the approach of Dawood and Rodriguez-Marek\n(2013). Close to stations and past events, the mean values of the non-ergodic\nterms deviate from zero to capture the systematic effects and their epistemic\nuncertainty is small. In areas with sparse data, the epistemic uncertainty of\nthe non-ergodic terms is large, as the systematic effects cannot be determined.\n  The non-ergodic total aleatory standard deviation is approximately $30$ to\n$40\\%$ smaller than the total aleatory standard deviation of BA18. This\nreduction in the aleatory variability has a significant impact on hazard\ncalculations at large return periods. The epistemic uncertainty of the ground\nmotion predictions is small in areas close to stations and past events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 01:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 02:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

Unfortunately, traditional\ntechniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been\nmodified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which\nproprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a\npractical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black\nbox models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs.\nUsing faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most\nimportant inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple\ncombinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC\noutputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box\nnature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC\ncode and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust\ninstead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code\nand neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated\nour approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that\nit could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and\nthus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs\nto.

To solve this problem, the brain\nhas been hypothesised to sit near a critical boundary. Yet, precisely how\ncriticality and these opposing information processing modes are implemented in\nthe brain remains elusive. A potential solution to this problem involves\nmodulating intrinsically nonlinear neurons within the cerebral cortex with\nneuromodulatory neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, a highly-conserved\nchemical released from the pontine locus coeruleus. Here we confirm that\nneuronal spiking in mice is poised close to the critical point of a branching\nprocess and that time-varying signatures of criticality fluctuate with\nneuromodulatory tone, as assessed by dynamic alterations in pupil diameter. We\nexplore these results theoretically by creating a dual-compartment model of\nnon-linear pyramidal neurons - capable of both regular spike and bursting modes\n- that replicates our main empirical findings of slightly subcritical dynamics.\nWe then probe our model at a resolution impossible in vivo to demonstrate that\nnoradrenaline differentially alters spiking- and bursting-criticality to\nfacilitate sensitive and stable dynamics following an inverted-U profile that\npeaks at intermediate noradrenergic tone.

We employ a new\nfinite-temperature composition-dependent equation of state (EOS) with a first\norder phase transition between hadrons and deconfined quarks to perform\nnumerical relativity simulations of BNS mergers. The softening of the EOS due\nto the phase transition causes the merger remnants to be more compact and to\ncollapse to a black hole (BH) at earlier times. The phase transition is\nimprinted on the postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal duration, amplitude,\nand peak frequency. However, this imprint is only detectable for binaries with\nsufficiently long-lived remnants. Moreover, the phase transition does not\nresult in significant deviations from quasi-universal relations for the\npostmerger GW peak frequency.

In the thick channel regime this ratio is\nsmall and the channel effectively behaves as thick, even when the diffuse\nlayers strongly overlap. The latter is possible for highly charged channels\nonly. In the thin channel regime the disjoining pressure is comparable to the\nexcess osmotic pressure at the wall, which implies relatively weakly charged\nwalls.

However, due to the long durations of typical conversation based\ntherapy sessions, and due to limited annotated modeling resources,\ncomputational methods largely rely on frequency-based lexical features or\ndialogue acts to assess the overall session level characteristics. In this\nwork, we propose a hierarchical framework to automatically evaluate the quality\nof transcribed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interactions. Given the\nrichly dynamic nature of the spoken dialog within a talk therapy session, to\nevaluate the overall session level quality, we propose to consider modeling it\nas a function of local variations across the interaction. To implement that\nempirically, we divide each psychotherapy session into conversation segments\nand initialize the segment-level qualities with the session-level scores.\nFirst, we produce segment embeddings by fine-tuning a BERT-based model, and\npredict segment-level (local) quality scores. These embeddings are used as the\nlower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network to predict the\nsession-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, we model the global\nquality as a linear function of the local quality scores, which allows us to\nupdate the segment-level quality estimates based on the session-level quality\nprediction. These newly estimated segment-level scores benefit the BERT\nfine-tuning process, which in turn results in better segment embeddings. We\nevaluate the proposed framework on automatically derived transcriptions from\nreal-world CBT clinical recordings to predict session-level behavior codes. The\nresults indicate that our approach leads to improved evaluation accuracy for\nmost codes when used for both regression and classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 01:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

In a bilayer consisting of a nonmagnet and a ferromagnet, spin\ninjection from the interface results in spin accumulation and torque in the\nferromagnet, which rapidly oscillate and decay by spin dephasing. In contrast,\nwe find that even when an external electric field is applied only on the\nnonmagnet, we find substantially long-ranged orbital magnetoelectric response\nin the FM, which can go far beyond the spin dephasing length. This unusual\nfeature is attributed to nearly degenerate orbital characters imposed by the\ncrystal symmetry, which form hotspots for the intrinsic orbital response.\nBecause only the states near the hotspots contribute dominantly, the induced\norbital angular momentum does not exhibit destructive interference among states\nwith different momentum as in the case of the spin dephasing.

Recently, 1T phase CrTe2 (1T-CrTe2)\nnanosheets with five and thicker layers have been successfully synthesized,\nwhich all exhibit the properties of ferromagnetic (FM) metals with Curie\ntemperatures around 305 K. However, whether the ferromagnetism therein can be\nmaintained when continuously reducing the nanosheet's thickness to monolayer\nlimit remains unknown. Here, through first-principles calculations, we explore\nthe evolution of magnetic properties of 1 to 6 layers CrTe2 nanosheets and\nseveral interesting points are found: First, unexpectedly, monolayer CrTe2\nprefers a zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) state with its energy much lower than\nthat of FM state. Second, in 2 to 4 layers CrTe2, both the intralayer and\ninterlayer magnetic coupling are AFM. Last, when the number of layers is equal\nto or greater than five, the intralayer and interlayer magnetic coupling become\nFM. Theoretical analysis reveals that the in-plane lattice contraction of few\nlayer CrTe2 compared to bulk is the main factor producing intralayer AFM-FM\nmagnetic transition. At the same time, as long as the intralayer coupling gets\nFM, the interlayer coupling will concomitantly switch from AFM to FM.

Primarily, conventional TWDP parameterization is not in accordance with\nthe model's underlying physical mechanisms. In addition, available TWDP\nexpressions for PDF, CDF, and MGF are given either in integral or approximate\nforms, or as mathematically untractable closed-form expressions. Consequently,\nthe existing TWDP statistical characterization does not allow accurate\nevaluation of system performance (such as error and outage probability) in all\nfading conditions for most modulation and diversity techniques. In this paper,\nthe existing statistical characterization of the TWDP fading model is improved\nby overcoming some of the noticed issues.

However, because it is common that the terminals\nappear spatially clustered, some degree of spatial correlation between their\nchannels to the base station (BS) is expected to occur. The paper considers a\nmassive antenna array at the BS for WET that only has access to i) the first\nand second order statistics of the Rician channel component of the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel and also to ii) the line-of-sight\nMIMO component. The optimal precoding scheme that maximizes the total energy\navailable to the single-antenna devices is derived considering a continuous\nalphabet for the precoders, permitting any modulated or deterministic waveform.\nThis may lead to some devices in the clusters being assigned a low fraction of\nthe total available power in the cluster, creating a rather uneven situation\namong them. Consequently, a fairness criterion is introduced, imposing a\nminimum amount of power allocated to the terminals. A piece-wise linear\nharvesting circuit is considered at the terminals, with both saturation and a\nminimum sensitivity, and a constrained version of the precoder is also proposed\nby solving a non-linear programming problem. A paramount benefit of the\nconstrained precoder is the encompassment of fairness in the power allocation\nto the different clusters. Moreover, given the polynomial complexity increase\nof the proposed unconstrained precoder, and the observed linear gain of the\nsystem's available sum-power with an increasing number of antennas at the ULA,\nthe use of massive antenna arrays is desirable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 09:08:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 18:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

So far, lots of liveness detection schemes have\nbeen developed to prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, the attacker can still\nbypass these schemes by constructing wide-ranging sophisticated attacks. We\nstudy the security of existing face authentication services (e.g., Microsoft,\nAmazon, and Face++) and typical liveness detection approaches.

The latter one exploits the non-linear magnetization response of\na large ensemble of magnetic nanoparticles to magnetic fields which allows\ndetermining the spatial distribution of the MNP concentration from measured\nvoltage signals. Currently, modeling the voltage signals of large ensembles of\nMNPs in an MPI environment is not yet accurately possible, especially for\nliquid tracers in multi-dimensional magnetic excitation fields. Thus, the\nvoltage-to-image mapping is still obtained in a time consuming calibration\nprocedure.

By aligning the particles during immobilization, one can encode the\nangle of the easy axis into the magnetization response providing a\nsophisticated benchmark system for model-based approaches.

This paper presents analyses for the statistical benefit of\nmultitask representation learning in linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) under\na generative model. In this paper, we consider an agent to learn a\nrepresentation function $\\phi$ out of a function class $\\Phi$ from $T$ source\ntasks with $N$ data per task, and then use the learned $\\hat{\\phi}$ to reduce\nthe required number of sample for a new task. We first discover a\n\\emph{Least-Activated-Feature-Abundance} (LAFA) criterion, denoted as $\\kappa$,\nwith which we prove that a straightforward least-square algorithm learns a\npolicy which is $\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2 \\kappa\nd}{NT}+\\frac{\\kappa d}{n}})$ sub-optimal. Here $H$ is the planning horizon,\n$\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$ is $\\Phi$'s complexity measure, $d$ is the dimension of the\nrepresentation (usually $d\\ll \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$) and $n$ is the number of\nsamples for the new task. Thus the required $n$ is $O(\\kappa d H^4)$ for the\nsub-optimality to be close to zero, which is much smaller than\n$O(\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2\\kappa d H^4)$ in the setting without multitask\nrepresentation learning, whose sub-optimality gap is\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2d}{n}})$. This\ntheoretically explains the power of multitask representation learning in\nreducing sample complexity. Further, we note that to ensure high sample\nefficiency, the LAFA criterion $\\kappa$ should be small. In fact, $\\kappa$\nvaries widely in magnitude depending on the different sampling distribution for\nnew task. This indicates adaptive sampling technique is important to make\n$\\kappa$ solely depend on $d$. Finally, we provide empirical results of a noisy\ngrid-world environment to corroborate our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 11:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

In this paper we study the stochastic dynamics of protein\ninteraction networks (PIN) that are made up of monomers and dimers. The network\nis defined by the dimers, which are formed by hybridizing two monomers. The\nsize of a PIN was defined as the number of monomers that interacts with at\nleast one other monomer (including itself). We generated 4200 random PIN of\nsizes between 2 and 8 (600 per size) and simulated via the Gillespie algorithm\nthe stochastic evolution of copy numbers of all monomers and dimers until they\nreached a steady state. The simulations revealed that the Fano factors of both\nmonomers and dimers in all networks and for all time points were close to one,\neither from below or above.

This stark difference in the importance of curriculum raises\na fundamental theoretical question: when and why does curriculum learning help?\n  In this work, we analyse a prototypical neural network model of curriculum\nlearning in the high-dimensional limit, employing statistical physics methods.\nCurricula could in principle change both the learning speed and asymptotic\nperformance of a model. To study the former, we provide an exact description of\nthe online learning setting, confirming the long-standing experimental\nobservation that curricula can modestly speed up learning. To study the latter,\nwe derive performance in a batch learning setting, in which a network trains to\nconvergence in successive phases of learning on dataset slices of varying\ndifficulty. With standard training losses, curriculum does not provide\ngeneralisation benefit, in line with empirical observations. However, we show\nthat by connecting different learning phases through simple Gaussian priors,\ncurriculum can yield a large improvement in test performance. Taken together,\nour reduced analytical descriptions help reconcile apparently conflicting\nempirical results and trace regimes where curriculum learning yields the\nlargest gains.

In recent, many researchers use deep learning\nmethods to classify plants directly using plant images. While deep learning\nmodels have achieved a great success, the lack of interpretability limit their\nwidespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,\nmeasurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image\nprocessing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in\nfeature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf\nimage by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our\nalgorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,\nii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove\nstalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image\nprocessing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52\ncomputationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features\nare mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)\ncolor-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.\nLength, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to\nname few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the\nclasses of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning\nsettings.

This shortcoming has recently been addressed\nusing methods that encourage parameters to stay close to those used for\nprevious tasks. This can be done by (i) using specific parameter regularizers\nthat map out suitable destinations in parameter space, or (ii) guiding the\noptimization journey by projecting gradients into subspaces that do not\ninterfere with previous tasks.

Our method outperforms both standard weight regularization\ntechniques and projection based approaches when applied to continual learning\nproblems in feedforward and recurrent networks.

Existing fusion\nmethods use scalar weights to characterize the relative information confidence\namong the local MODs, and in this way the portion of contribution of each local\nMOD to the fused global MOD can be tuned via adjusting these weights. Our\nanalysis shows that the fusion mechanism of using a scalar coefficient can be\noversimplified for practical scenarios, as the information confidence of an MOD\nis complex and usually space-varying due to the imperfection of sensor ability\nand the various impacts from surveillance environment. Consequently, severe\nfusion performance degradation can be observed when these scalar weights fail\nto reflect the actual situation. We make two contributions towards addressing\nthis problem. Firstly, we propose a novel heterogeneous fusion method to\nperform the information averaging among local RFS MODs. By factorizing each\nlocal MODs into a number of smaller size sub-MODs, it can transform the\noriginal complicated fusion problem into a much easier parallelizable\nmulti-cluster fusion problem.

The Gaussian mixture implementations of the\nproposed fusion algorithms are also presented.

Although the throughput of existing leader-based BFT protocols has\nreached a high level of $10^5$ requests per second for a small scale of\nreplicas, it drops significantly when the number of replicas increases, which\nleads to a lack of practicality. This paper focuses on the scalability of BFT\nprotocols and identifies a major bottleneck to leader-based BFT protocols due\nto the excessive workload of the leader at large scales. A new metric of\nscaling factor is defined to capture whether a BFT protocol will get stuck when\nit scales out, which can be used to measure the performance of efficiency and\nscalability of BFT protocols. We propose \"Leopard\", the first leader-based BFT\nprotocol that scales to multiple hundreds of replicas, and more importantly,\npreserves a high efficiency. We remove the bottleneck by introducing a\ntechnique of achieving a constant scaling factor, which takes full advantage of\nthe idle resource and adaptively balances the workload of the leader among all\nreplicas. We implement Leopard and evaluate its performance compared to\nHotStuff, the state-of-the-art BFT protocol. We run extensive experiments on\nthe two systems with up to 600 replicas. The results show that Leopard achieves\nsignificant performance improvements both on throughput and scalability. In\nparticular, the throughput of Leopard remains at a high level of $10^5$ when\nthe system scales out to 600 replicas. It achieves a $5\\times$ throughput over\nHotStuff when the scale is 300 (which is already the largest scale we can see\nthe progress of the latter in our experiments), and the gap becomes wider as\nthe number of replicas further increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 03:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 14:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

However, the word-by-word generation\nmanner determined by the autoregressive mechanism leads to high translation\nlatency of the NMT and restricts its low-latency applications.\nNon-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) removes the autoregressive\nmechanism and achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target\nwords independently and simultaneously. Nevertheless, NAT still takes the\nword-level cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which is not optimal\nbecause the output of NAT cannot be properly evaluated due to the multimodality\nproblem. In this article, we propose using sequence-level training objectives\nto train NAT models, which evaluate the NAT outputs as a whole and correlates\nwell with the real translation quality. Firstly, we propose training NAT models\nto optimize sequence-level evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) based on several\nnovel reinforcement algorithms customized for NAT, which outperforms the\nconventional method by reducing the variance of gradient estimation. Secondly,\nwe introduce a novel training objective for NAT models, which aims to minimize\nthe Bag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference\nsentence. The BoN training objective is differentiable and can be calculated\nefficiently without doing any approximations. Finally, we apply a three-stage\ntraining strategy to combine these two methods to train the NAT model.

The hydrodynamic properties of the\nroughness are investigated and compared to those obtained from full-size DNS\nfor 12 roughness topographies with systematically varied PDF and PS at four\nroughness height. The comparison confirms the viability of the minimal channel\napproach for characterization of rough surfaces providing excellent agreement\nin roughness function and zero-plane displacement across various types of\nroughness and different regimes. Results also indicates that different\nrealizations of roughness, with a fixed PS and PDF, translate to similar values\nof roughness function with a small scatter.

The anisotropy translates into a very small streamwise integral length\nscale, which weakly depends on the considered roughness topography, while the\nlarger spanwise integral length scale shows a stronger dependence on roughness\ncharacteristics.

This presents a significant barrier towards large-scale EV adoption.\nTo address this concern, this paper considers a novel business model, on-demand\nvalet charging, that unlocks the potential of under-utilized public charging\ninfrastructure to promise higher EV penetration. In the proposed model, a\nplatform recruits a fleet of couriers that shuttle between customers and public\ncharging stations to provide on-demand valet charging services to EV owners at\nan affordable price. Couriers are dispatched to pick up low-battery EVs from\ncustomers, deliver the EVs to charging stations, plug them in, and then return\nthe fully-charged EVs to customers. To depict the proposed business model, we\ndevelop a queuing network to represent the stochastic matching dynamics, and\nfurther formulate an economic equilibrium model to capture the incentives of\ncouriers, customers as well as the platform. These models are used to examine\nhow charging infrastructure planning and regulatory intervention will affect\nthe market outcome. First, we find that the optimal charging station densities\nfor distinct stakeholders are different: couriers prefer a lower density; the\nplatform prefers a higher density; while the density in-between leads to the\nhighest EV penetration as it balances the time traveling to and queuing at\ncharging stations. Second, we evaluate a regulatory policy that imposes a tax\non the platform and invests the tax revenue in public charging infrastructure.\nNumerical results suggest that this regulation can suppress the platform's\nmarket power associated with monopoly pricing, increase social welfare, and\nfacilitate the market expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 14:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 15:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Fetal MRI is\nincreasingly used for fetal brain assessment. Three key biometric linear\nmeasurements important for fetal brain evaluation are Cerebral Biparietal\nDiameter (CBD), Bone Biparietal Diameter (BBD), and Trans-Cerebellum Diameter\n(TCD), obtained manually by expert radiologists on reference slices, which is\ntime consuming and prone to human error. The aim of this study was to develop a\nfully automatic method computing the CBD, BBD and TCD measurements from fetal\nbrain MRI. The input is fetal brain MRI volumes which may include the fetal\nbody and the mother's abdomen. The outputs are the measurement values and\nreference slices on which the measurements were computed. The method, which\nfollows the manual measurements principle, consists of five stages: 1)\ncomputation of a Region Of Interest that includes the fetal brain with an\nanisotropic 3D U-Net classifier; 2) reference slice selection with a\nConvolutional Neural Network; 3) slice-wise fetal brain structures segmentation\nwith a multiclass U-Net classifier; 4) computation of the fetal brain\nmidsagittal line and fetal brain orientation, and; 5) computation of the\nmeasurements. Experimental results on 214 volumes for CBD, BBD and TCD\nmeasurements yielded a mean $L_1$ difference of 1.55mm, 1.45mm and 1.23mm\nrespectively, and a Bland-Altman 95% confidence interval ($CI_{95}$) of 3.92mm,\n3.98mm and 2.25mm respectively. These results are similar to the manual\ninter-observer variability. The proposed automatic method for computing\nbiometric linear measurements of the fetal brain from MR imaging achieves human\nlevel performance. It has the potential of being a useful method for the\nassessment of fetal brain biometry in normal and pathological cases, and of\nimproving routine clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 14:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

However, the success of deep learning\nmodels requires a lot of training data in order to have decent performance,\nwhile on the other hand, there are very limited amount of publicly available\nspace datasets for the training of deep learning models. Currently, there is no\npublic datasets for space-based object detection or instance segmentation,\npartly because manually annotating object segmentation masks is very time\nconsuming as they require pixel-level labelling, not to mention the challenge\nof obtaining images from space. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by\nreleasing a dataset for spacecraft detection, instance segmentation and part\nrecognition. The main contribution of this work is the development of the\ndataset using images of space stations and satellites, with rich annotations\nincluding bounding boxes of spacecrafts and masks to the level of object parts,\nwhich are obtained with a mixture of automatic processes and manual efforts. We\nalso provide evaluations with state-of-the-art methods in object detection and\ninstance segmentation as a benchmark for the dataset.

While a simple quadratic algorithm has been\nknown for the problem for more than 40 years, no faster algorithm has been\nfound despite an extensive effort. The lack of progress on the problem has\nrecently been explained by Abboud, Backurs, and Vassilevska Williams [FOCS'15]\nand Bringmann and K\\\"unnemann [FOCS'15] who proved that there is no\nsubquadratic algorithm unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.\nThis has led the community to look for subquadratic approximation algorithms\nfor the problem.\n  Yet, unlike the edit distance problem for which a constant-factor\napproximation in almost-linear time is known, very little progress has been\nmade on LCS, making it a notoriously difficult problem also in the realm of\napproximation.

We\nshow, that light can dehybridize the local Kondo screening and induce magnetic\norder out of a previously paramagnetic state. We demonstrate that, depending on\nthe laser pulse field parameters, it is possible to deconfine the Kondo singlet\nand thereby induce second order phase transition to a dynamically ordered\nstate, as well as a dynamic Lifshitz transition that changes the Fermi surface\ntopology from hole- to electron-like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The interior of the black hole\nis represented by the type II Weyl semimetal, where the Fermi surface is\nformed. The process of the filling of the Fermi surface by electrons results in\nthe relaxation inside the horizon. This leads to the Hawking radiation and to\nthe reconstruction of the interior vacuum state. After the Fermi surface is\nfully occupied, the interior region reaches the equilibrium state, for which\nthe Hawking radiation is absent. If this scenario is applicable to the real\nblack hole, then the final state of the black hole will be the dark energy star\nwith the event horizon. Inside the event horizon one would have de Sitter space\ntime, which is separated from the event horizon by the shell of the Planck\nlength width. Both the de Sitter part and the shell are made of the vacuum\nfields without matter. This is distinct from the gravastar, in which the matter\nshell is outside the \"horizon\", and which we call the type I gravastar. But\nthis is similar to the other type of the vacuum black hole, where the shell is\ninside the event horizon, and which we call the type II gravastar. We suggest\nto study the vacuum structure of the type II gravastar using the $q$-theory,\nwhere the vacuum variable is the 4-form field introduced for the\nphenomenological description of the quantum vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 10:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 08:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

In electron microscopy, such concepts have not been extensively\nexplored yet in all their implications; in particular, inelastic scattering can\nbe reanalyzed in terms of correlation between the electron beam and the sample.\nWhile classical inelastic scattering simply implies loss of coherence in the\nelectron beam, performing a joint measurement on the electron beam and the\nsample excitation could restore the coherence and the lost information. Here,\nwe propose to exploit joint measurement in electron microscopy for a surprising\nand counter-intuitive application of the concept of ghost imaging. Ghost\nimaging, first proposed in quantum photonics, can be applied partially in\nelectron microscopy by performing joint measurement between the portion of the\ntransmitted electron beam and a photon emitted from the sample reaching a\nbucket detector. This would permit us to form a one-dimensional virtual image\nof an object that even has not interacted with the electron beam directly. This\ntechnique is extremely promising for low-dose imaging that requires the\nminimization of radiation exposure for electron-sensitive materials, because\nthe object interacts with other form of waves, e.g., photons/surface plasmon\npolaritons, and not the electron beam. We demonstrate this concept\ntheoretically for any inelastic electron-sample interaction in which the\nelectron excites a single quantum of a collective mode, such as a photon,\nplasmon, phonon, magnon, or any optical polariton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 23:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

A\ncommon feature of such apps is a swipe enabling a user to decide whether to\nlike or dislike another user. As is the case in real life, a user may be more\nor less popular, which implies the distribution of likes among different users\nis not trivial. In this paper we show how likes are distributed across users,\nbased on different decision-making strategies and on different app settings. We\napply theoretical methods originally developed in stochastic and coagulation\nprocesses to the investigation into the dynamics of dating app networks. More\nspecifically, we show that whenever a dating app differentially displays\ndifferent users with respect to their popularity in different models, users are\nsplit into two categories: a first category including users who have received\nmost likes and a second category, referred to as a condensate, which in the\nlong-term will be reduced to a small fraction of likes or to no likes at all.\nFinally, we explore different models based on a rating system of the users,\nknown as Elo. These models will turn out to exhibit behaviour typical of\ngelating systems and non-trivial distribution of Elo rating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 21:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The free field\ndescribing a free particle (with no interaction term) can suddenly become\nnonrenormalizable the instant a suitable interaction term appears. For example,\nusing canonical quantization, $\\varphi^4_4$, has been deemed a ``free\" theory\nwith no difference from a truly free field [1], [2], [3]. Using the same model,\naffine quantization has led to a truly interacting theory [4]. This fact alone\nasserts that canonical and affine tools of quantization deserve to be open to\ntheir procedures together as a significant enlargement of QFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 01:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}
