In\ngeneral, RNNs assume observations at discrete times, which may not suit the\nirregular sampling of lightcurves. A traditional technique to address irregular\nsequences consists of adding the sampling time to the network's input, but this\nis not guaranteed to capture sampling irregularities during training.\nAlternatively, the Phased LSTM unit has been created to address this problem by\nupdating its state using the sampling times explicitly. In this work, we study\nthe effectiveness of the LSTM and Phased LSTM based architectures for the\nclassification of astronomical lightcurves.

A common phenomenon in many spatial\nregression models is spatial confounding. This phenomenon takes place when\nspatially indexed covariates modeling the mean of the response are correlated\nwith the spatial random effect. As a result, estimates for regression\ncoefficients of the covariates can be severely biased and interpretation of\nthese is no longer valid. Recent literature has shown that typical solutions\nfor reducing spatial confounding can lead to misleading and counterintuitive\nresults. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient spatial model in\na Bayesian framework integrating novel prior structure that reduces spatial\nconfounding. Starting from the univariate case, we extend our prior structure\nto case of multiple spatially confounded covariates. In a simulation study, we\nshow that our novel model flexibly detects and reduces spatial confounding in\nspatial datasets, and it performs better than typically used methods such as\nrestricted spatial regression. These results are promising for any applied\nresearcher who wishes to interpret covariate effects in spatial regression\nmodels.

It\nis a natural consequence of additional discrete degree of freedom associated\nwith a valley or the occurence of electronic flat-bands. Combination of both\ntypes of lattices, observed in CoSn-like compounds, leads not only to the\ntopological electronic behavior, but also to the emergence of chiral phonon\nmodes. Here, we study CoSn-like compounds in the context of realization of\nchiral phonons. Previous theoretical studies demonstrated that the chiral\nphonons can be found in ideal two-dimensional hexagonal or kagome lattices.\nHowever, it turns out that in the case of CoSn-like systems with the $P6/mmm$\nsymmetry, the kagome lattice formed by $d$-block element is decorated by the\nadditional $p$-block atom. This results in a two dimensional triangular lattice\nof atoms with non-equal masses and the absence of chiral phonons in the kagome\nplane. Contrary to this, the interlayer hexagonal lattice of $p$-block atoms is\npreserved and allows for the realization of chiral phonons. We discuss\nproperties of these chiral phonons in seven CoSn-like compounds and demonstrate\nthat they do not depend on atomic mass ratio or the presence of intrinsic\nmagnetic order. The chiral phonons of $d$-block atoms can be restored by\nremoving the inversion symmetry. The latter is possible in the crystal\nstructure of CoGe and RhPb with the reduced symmetry ($P\\bar{6}2m$) and\ndistorted-kagome-like lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Extracting these signals from the\ninstruments' background noise is a complex problem and the computational cost\nof most current searches depends on the complexity of the source model. Deep\nlearning may be capable of finding signals where current algorithms hit\ncomputational limits. Here we restrict our analysis to signals from\nnon-spinning binary black holes and systematically test different strategies by\nwhich training data is presented to the networks. To assess the impact of the\ntraining strategies, we re-analyze the first published networks and directly\ncompare them to an equivalent matched-filter search. We find that the deep\nlearning algorithms can generalize low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals to\nhigh SNR ones but not vice versa. As such, it is not beneficial to provide high\nSNR signals during training, and fastest convergence is achieved when low SNR\nsamples are provided early on. During testing we found that the networks are\nsometimes unable to recover any signals when a false alarm probability\n$<10^{-3}$ is required. We resolve this restriction by applying a modification\nwe call unbounded Softmax replacement (USR) after training.

How does one\nchoose the `best' imputation method in a given application? The standard\napproach is to select some observations, set their status to missing, and\ncompare prediction accuracy of the methods under consideration of these\nobservations. Besides having to somewhat artificially mask observations, a\nshortcoming of this approach is that imputations based on the conditional mean\nwill rank highest if predictive accuracy is measured with quadratic loss. In\ncontrast, we want to rank highest an imputation that can sample from the true\nconditional distributions. In this paper, we develop a framework called\n\"Imputation Scores\" (I-Scores) for assessing missing value imputations. We\nprovide a specific I-Score based on density ratios and projections, that is\napplicable to discrete and continuous data. It does not require to mask\nadditional observations for evaluations and is also applicable if there are no\ncomplete observations. The population version is shown to be proper in the\nsense that the highest rank is assigned to an imputation method that samples\nfrom the correct conditional distribution. The propriety is shown under the\nmissing completely at random (MCAR) assumption but is also shown to be valid\nunder missing at random (MAR) with slightly more restrictive assumptions. We\nshow empirically on a range of data sets and imputation methods that our score\nconsistently ranks true data high(est) and is able to avoid pitfalls usually\nassociated with performance measures such as RMSE. Finally, we provide the\nR-package Iscores available on CRAN with an implementation of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:20:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 13:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 17:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Differently from CNNs, VTs can\ncapture global relations between image elements and they potentially have a\nlarger representation capacity. However, the lack of the typical convolutional\ninductive bias makes these models more data-hungry than common CNNs. In fact,\nsome local properties of the visual domain which are embedded in the CNN\narchitectural design, in VTs should be learned from samples. In this paper, we\nempirically analyse different VTs, comparing their robustness in a small\ntraining-set regime, and we show that, despite having a comparable accuracy\nwhen trained on ImageNet, their performance on smaller datasets can be largely\ndifferent. Moreover, we propose a self-supervised task which can extract\nadditional information from images with only a negligible computational\noverhead. This task encourages the VTs to learn spatial relations within an\nimage and makes the VT training much more robust when training data are scarce.\nOur task is used jointly with the standard (supervised) training and it does\nnot depend on specific architectural choices, thus it can be easily plugged in\nthe existing VTs.

In the present work, we analyze function\nclasses defined via quantum kernels. Quantum computers offer the possibility to\nefficiently compute inner products of exponentially large density operators\nthat are classically hard to compute. However, having an exponentially large\nfeature space renders the problem of generalization hard. Furthermore, being\nable to evaluate inner products in high dimensional spaces efficiently by\nitself does not guarantee a quantum advantage, as already classically tractable\nkernels can correspond to high- or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel\nHilbert spaces (RKHS).\n  We analyze the spectral properties of quantum kernels and find that we can\nexpect an advantage if their RKHS is low dimensional and contains functions\nthat are hard to compute classically. If the target function is known to lie in\nthis class, this implies a quantum advantage, as the quantum computer can\nencode this inductive bias, whereas there is no classically efficient way to\nconstrain the function class in the same way. However, we show that finding\nsuitable quantum kernels is not easy because the kernel evaluation might\nrequire exponentially many measurements.\n  In conclusion, our message is a somewhat sobering one: we conjecture that\nquantum machine learning models can offer speed-ups only if we manage to encode\nknowledge about the problem at hand into quantum circuits, while encoding the\nsame bias into a classical model would be hard. These situations may plausibly\noccur when learning on data generated by a quantum process, however, they\nappear to be harder to come by for classical datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 09:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

In this work, we\npropose a two-stage graph-based framework for superpixel segmentation. In the\nfirst stage, we introduce an efficient Deep Affinity Learning (DAL) network\nthat learns pairwise pixel affinities by aggregating multi-scale information.\nIn the second stage, we propose a highly efficient superpixel method called\nHierarchical Entropy Rate Segmentation (HERS). Using the learned affinities\nfrom the first stage, HERS builds a hierarchical tree structure that can\nproduce any number of highly adaptive superpixels instantaneously. We\ndemonstrate, through visual and numerical experiments, the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our method compared to various state-of-the-art superpixel\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 18:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

The instability leads to\nion ejection from jets formed on the droplet's surface. Despite the many\nexperiments that have been performed to capture the jet formation the precise\nfission mechanism has not yet been observed because of its brief transient\nnature. Here, we present the first atomistic simulations that reveal the\nmechanism of Rayleigh fission. We demonstrate that ion ejection takes place\nthrough a drop's deformation from a spherical into a distinct shape that\ncontains a conical protrusion. We assert that the latter state is a free energy\nminimum along an order parameter that measures the degree of droplet\nasphericity. The charged droplet's long-time evolution proceeds by alternating\nbetween the two minima above and below the critical value that are reached\nthrough solvent evaporation and ion ejection, respectively. For the first time,\nthis mechanism allows one to explain the nature of the progeny droplets and the\npercentage of charge lost during fission. We determine that the cone half-angle\nis close to the value predicted from the solution of the electrostatic equation\nfor the dielectric liquid. It is found that the conical deformation is\nindependent of the effect of electrohydrodynamic forces reported in\nexperiments. Contrary to the experimental observations of two diametrically\nopposite jets for droplets suspended in the electric field, we found that a\nsingle jet is formed at the Rayleigh limit. This indicates that super-charged\ndroplet states may have been detected in the experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In this paper we discuss the appearance of complex energy\nvalues in CC calculations from a mathematical perspective. We analyze the\nbehaviour of the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices that are perturbed (in a\nnon-Hermitian manner) by a real parameter. Based on these results we show that\nfor CC calculations with real-valued Hamiltonian matrices the ground-state\nenergy generally takes a real value. Furthermore, we show that in the case of\nreal-valued Hamiltonian matrices complex excitation energies only occur in the\ncontext of conical intersections. In such a case, unphysical consequences are\nencountered such as a wrong dimension of the intersection seam, large numerical\ndeviations from full configuration-interaction (FCI) results, and the\nsquare-root-like behaviour of the potential surfaces near the conical\nintersection. In the case of CC calculations with complex-valued Hamiltonian\nmatrix elements, it turns out that complex energy values are to be expected for\nground and excited states when no symmetry is present. We confirm the\noccurrence of complex energies by sample calculations using a six-state model\nand by CC calculations for the H2O molecule in a strong magnetic field. We\nfurthermore show that symmetry can prevent the occurrence of complex energy\nvalues. Lastly, we demonstrate that in most cases the real part of the complex\nenergy values provides a very good approximation to the FCI energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

We perform a theoretical analysis of the core\ncomponent responsible for signal propagation between elements, i.e. the\nself-attention matrix. In practice, this matrix typically exhibits two\nproperties: (1) it is sparse, meaning that each token only attends to a small\nsubset of other tokens; and (2) it changes dynamically depending on the input\nto the module. With these considerations in mind, we ask the following\nquestion: Can a fixed self-attention module approximate arbitrary sparse\npatterns depending on the input? How small is the hidden size $d$ required for\nsuch approximation? We make progress in answering this question and show that\nthe self-attention matrix can provably approximate sparse matrices, where\nsparsity is in terms of a bounded number of nonzero elements in each row and\ncolumn. While the parameters of self-attention are fixed, various sparse\nmatrices can be approximated by only modifying the inputs. Our proof is based\non the random projection technique and uses the seminal Johnson-Lindenstrauss\nlemma. Our proof is constructive, enabling us to propose an algorithm for\nfinding adaptive inputs and fixed self-attention parameters in order to\napproximate a given matrix. In particular, we show that, in order to\napproximate any sparse matrix up to a given precision defined in terms of\npreserving matrix element ratios, $d$ grows only logarithmically with the\nsequence length $L$ (i.e. $d = O(\\log L)$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 10:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

A promising candidate is a\nclass of hybrid circuits, where entangling unitary dynamics compete with\ndisentangling measurements. Novel phase transitions between different\nentanglement regimes have been identified in their dynamical states, with\nuniversal properties hinting at unexplored critical phenomena. Trapped ion\nhardware is a leading contender for the experimental realization of such\nphysics, which requires not only traditional two-qubit entangling gates, but a\nconstant rate of local measurements accurately addressed throughout the\ncircuit. Recent progress in engineering high-precision optical addressing of\nindividual ions makes preparing a constant rate of measurements throughout a\nunitary circuit feasible. Using tensor network simulations, we show that the\nresulting class of hybrid circuits, prepared with native gates, exhibits a\nvolume-law to area-law transition in the entanglement entropy. This displays\nuniversal hallmarks of a measurement-induced phase transition. Our simulations\nare able to characterize the critical exponents using circuit sizes with tens\nof qubits and thousands of gates. We argue that this transition should be\nrobust against additional sources of experimental noise expected in modern\ntrapped ion hardware, and will rather be limited by statistical requirements on\npost selection.

Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on first estimating poses\nin each frame and only then implementing data association and refinement.\nDespite the promising results achieved, such a strategy is inevitably prone to\nmissed detections especially in heavily-cluttered scenes, since this\ntracking-by-detection paradigm is, by nature, largely dependent on visual\nevidences that are absent in the case of occlusion. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel online approach to learning the pose dynamics, which are independent of\npose detections in current fame, and hence may serve as a robust estimation\neven in challenging scenarios including occlusion. Specifically, we derive this\nprediction of dynamics through a graph neural network~(GNN) that explicitly\naccounts for both spatial-temporal and visual information. It takes as input\nthe historical pose tracklets and directly predicts the corresponding poses in\nthe following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be\naggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce\nthe final pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the\nestimator. Experiments on PoseTrack 2017 and PoseTrack 2018 datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves results superior to the state of\nthe art on both human pose estimation and tracking tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Recent empirical studies have illustrated that even simple\npruning strategies can be surprisingly effective, and several theoretical\nstudies have shown that compressible networks (in specific senses) should\nachieve a low generalization error. Yet, a theoretical characterization of the\nunderlying cause that makes the networks amenable to such simple compression\nschemes is still missing. In this study, we address this fundamental question\nand reveal that the dynamics of the training algorithm has a key role in\nobtaining such compressible networks. Focusing our attention on stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD), our main contribution is to link compressibility to two\nrecently established properties of SGD: (i) as the network size goes to\ninfinity, the system can converge to a mean-field limit, where the network\nweights behave independently, (ii) for a large step-size/batch-size ratio, the\nSGD iterates can converge to a heavy-tailed stationary distribution. In the\ncase where these two phenomena occur simultaneously, we prove that the networks\nare guaranteed to be '$\\ell_p$-compressible', and the compression errors of\ndifferent pruning techniques (magnitude, singular value, or node pruning)\nbecome arbitrarily small as the network size increases. We further prove\ngeneralization bounds adapted to our theoretical framework, which indeed\nconfirm that the generalization error will be lower for more compressible\nnetworks. Our theory and numerical study on various neural networks show that\nlarge step-size/batch-size ratios introduce heavy-tails, which, in combination\nwith overparametrization, result in compressibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In this work, the above question is\naddressed directly (for the first time) by performing calculations with and\nwithout assumption of locality of the corresponding diagrams. For this purpose\nwe use sc(GW+G3W2) approach where the higher order part (G3W2) is evaluated\nwith fully momentum dependent Green's function G and screened interaction W and\nwith \"local\" variant, where the single site approximation is assumed for both G\nand W. For all three materials studied in this work (NiO, $\\alpha$-Ce, LiFeAs),\nwe have found the spatial non-locality effects to be strong. For NiO and LiFeAs\nthey, in fact, are decisive for the proper evaluation of vertex corrections.\nThe results of this study have direct impact on our understanding of\napproximations made in practical implementations of GW+DMFT method, where all\ndiagrams beyond GW (DMFT part) are assumed to be local. Taking into account the\nfact that the first diagrams beyond GW represent the most important\ncontribution also in GW+DMFT calculations, we conclude that the basic\nassumption of GW+DMFT, namely the locality of diagrams evaluated in the DMFT\npart, is not as good as it is believed to be.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 15:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 14:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Also, compared to existing methods where the\nlearner and the sampler are trained in a multi-stage manner, we propose to\ntrain them in a task-aware jointly manner which enables transforming the latent\nspace into two separate tasks: one that classifies the labelled examples; the\nother that distinguishes the labelling direction.

Key advantages of DDPMs include ease of training, in contrast\nto generative adversarial networks, and speed of generation, in contrast to\nautoregressive models. However, DDPMs typically require hundreds-to-thousands\nof steps to generate a high fidelity sample, making them prohibitively\nexpensive for high dimensional problems. Fortunately, DDPMs allow trading\ngeneration speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement\nsteps as a post process. Prior work has been successful in improving generation\nspeed through handcrafting the time schedule by trial and error. We instead\nview the selection of the inference time schedules as an optimization problem,\nand introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal\ndiscrete time schedules for any pre-trained DDPM.

Furthermore, we find 14 classical $r$-matrices coming\nfrom Drinfel'd doubles, obtaining new results for the de Sitter ${so}(4,1)$ and\nanti-de Sitter ${so}(3,2)$ and for some of their contractions. These geometric\nresults are exhaustively applied onto the (3+1)D kinematical algebras, not only\nconsidering the usual (3+1)D spacetime but also the 6D space of lines. We\nestablish different assignations between the geometrical CK generators and the\nkinematical ones which convey physical identifications for the CK contraction\nparameters in terms of the cosmological constant/curvature $\\Lambda$ and speed\nof light $c$. We finally obtain four classes of kinematical $r$-matrices\ntogether with their noncommutative spacetimes and spaces of lines, comprising\nall $\\kappa$-deformations as particular cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 14:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

We assume\nthat this context is not accessible to a learner agent who can only observe the\nexpert data. Then, our goal is to use the context-aware expert data to learn an\noptimal context-unaware policy for the learner using only a few new data\nsamples. Such problems are typically solved using imitation learning that\nassumes that both the expert and learner agents have access to the same\ninformation. However, if the learner does not know the expert context, using\nthe expert data alone will result in a biased learner policy and will require\nmany new data samples to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, we\nformulate the learning problem as a causal bound-constrained Multi-Armed-Bandit\n(MAB) problem. The arms of this MAB correspond to a set of basis policy\nfunctions that can be initialized in an unsupervised way using the expert data\nand represent the different expert behaviors affected by the unobserved\ncontext. On the other hand, the MAB constraints correspond to causal bounds on\nthe accumulated rewards of these basis policy functions that we also compute\nfrom the expert data. The solution to this MAB allows the learner agent to\nselect the best basis policy and improve it online. And the use of causal\nbounds reduces the exploration variance and, therefore, improves the learning\nrate. We provide numerical experiments on an autonomous driving example that\nshow that our proposed transfer RL method improves the learner's policy faster\ncompared to existing imitation learning methods and enjoys much lower variance\nduring training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

KV separation has a significant drawback that\nmakes it less attractive: Delete and especially update operations that are\nimportant in modern workloads result in frequent and expensive garbage\ncollection (GC) in the value log. In this paper, we design and implement\nParallax, which proposes hybrid KV placement that reduces GC overhead\nsignificantly and maximizes the benefits of using a log.

Accreting dust and pebbles\ncontribute to the envelope opacity and, thus, influence the outcome of planet\nformation. Our aim is to model the size evolution and opacity contribution of\nsolids inside planetary envelopes. We then use the resultant opacity relations\nto study emergent trends in planet formation. We design a model for the opacity\nof solids in planetary envelopes that accounts for the growth, fragmentation\nand erosion of pebbles during their sedimentation. We formulate analytical\nexpressions for the opacity of pebbles and dust and map out their trends as a\nfunction of depth, planet mass, distance and accretion rate. We find that the\naccretion of pebbles rather than planetesimals can produce fully convective\nenvelopes, but only in lower-mass planets that reside in the outer disk or in\nthose that are accreting pebbles at a high rate. In these conditions, pebble\nsizes are limited by fragmentation and erosion, allowing them to pile up in the\nenvelope. At higher planetary masses or reduced accretion rates, a different\nregime applies where the sizes of sedimenting pebbles are only limited by their\nrate of growth. The opacity in this growth-limited regime is much lower,\nsteeply declines with depth and planet mass but is invariant with the pebble\nmass flux. Our results imply that the opacity of a forming planetary envelope\ncan not be approximated by a value that is constant with either depth or planet\nmass. When applied to the Solar System, we argue that Uranus and Neptune could\nnot have maintained a sufficiently high opacity to avoid runaway gas accretion\nunless they both experienced sufficiently rapid accretion of solids and formed\nlate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

For the strongest neutron-star fields, however, stresses\nbuild to the point of crustal failure, at which point the standard evolution\nequations are no longer valid. Here, we study the evolution of the magnetic\nfield of the crust up to and beyond crustal failure, whence the crust begins to\nflow plastically. We perform global axisymmetric evolutions, exploring\ndifferent types of failure affecting a limited region of the crust.

In\nthis way, the geometry of the $G_{2}$ orbifold is translated to bundle data in\nthe heterotic background. While the instanton configuration looks surprising\nfrom the perspective of the $E_{8}\\times E_{8}$ heterotic string, it may be\nunderstood as T-dual $\\text{Spin}(32)/\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ instantons along with\nwinding shifts originating in a dual Type I compactification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 18:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 02:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Most existing\nepidemic forecasting models disregard uncertainty quantification, resulting in\nmis-calibrated predictions. Recent works in deep neural models for\nuncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g.\nit is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods\nlike deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper,\nwe fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic\ngenerative process and propose a functional neural process model called EPIFNP,\nwhich directly models the probability density of the forecast value. EPIFNP\nleverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations\nbetween sequences in a non-parametric way, and designs different stochastic\nlatent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives.\nOur extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that\nEPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both\naccuracy and calibration metrics, up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in\ncalibration. Additionally, due to properties of its generative process,EPIFNP\nlearns the relations between the current season and similar patterns of\nhistorical seasons,enabling interpretable forecasts. Beyond epidemic\nforecasting, the EPIFNP can be of independent interest for advancing principled\nuncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 18:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

It turns out that for all such\nspacetimes nothing can reach the Schwarzschild event horizon in a finite amount\nof proper time for conformally coupled ``massive'' particles, or finite values\nof the affine parameter for massless particles. Therefore, for such vacuum\nsolutions the event horizon is an asymptotic region of the Universe.

Unfortunately, OOD\ndetection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this\nwork, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale\nfine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have\ndifficulties.

In the induced state of the\nlac-pathway, the genes comprising the lac-operon are transcribed, leading to\nthe production of proteins which import and metabolize lactose. In the\nuninduced state, a stable repressor-DNA loop frequently blocks the\ntranscription of the lac-genes. Transitions from one phenotypic state to the\nother are driven by fluctuations, which arise from the random timing of the\nbinding of ligands and proteins. This stochasticity affects transcription and\ntranslation, and ultimately molecular copy numbers. Our aim is to understand\nthe transition from the induced to the uninduced state of the lac-operon. We\nuse a detailed computational model to show that repressor-operator\nbinding/unbinding, fluctuations in the total number of repressors, and\ninducer-repressor binding/unbinding all play a role in this transition. Based\non the timescales on which these processes operate, we construct a minimal\nmodel of the transition to the uninduced state and compare the results with\nsimulations and experimental observations. The induced state turns out to be\nvery stable, with a transition rate to the uninduced state lower than $2 \\times\n10^{-9}$ per minute. In contrast to the transition to the induced state, the\ntransition to the uninduced state is well described in terms of a 2D diffusive\nsystem crossing a barrier, with the diffusion rates emerging from a model of\nrepressor unbinding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 19:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 20:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 19:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

For decades, spatial diffusion has been\nargued to take place along the urban hierarchy such that the innovation first\nspreads from large to medium cities then later from medium to small cities.\nYet, the role of geographical distance, the other major factor of spatial\ndiffusion, was difficult to identify in hierarchical diffusion due to missing\ndata on spreading events. In this paper, we exploit spatial patterns of\nindividual invitations on a social media platform sent from registered users to\nnew users over the entire life cycle of the platform. This enables us to\ndisentangle the role of urban hierarchy and the role of distance by observing\nthe source and target locations of flows over an unprecedented timescale. We\ndemonstrate that hierarchical diffusion greatly overlaps with diffusion to\nclose distances and these factors co-evolve over the life cycle; thus, their\njoint analysis is necessary. Then, a regression framework is applied to\nestimate the number of invitations sent between pairs of towns by years in the\nlife cycle with the population sizes of the source and target towns, their\ncombinations, and the distance between them.

Recent work with tethered flying insects\nindicates that their sensory representation of orientation, apparent flow,\ndirection of movement, and control is represented by a 2-dimensional angular\nencoding in the central brain. This representation simplifies sensory\nintegration by projecting the direction (but not scale) of measurements with\ndifferent units onto a universal polar coordinate frame. To align these angular\nmeasurements with one another and the motor system does, however, require a\ncalibration of angular gain and offset for each sensor. This calibration could\nchange with time due to changes in the environment or physical structure. The\ncircumstances under which small robots and animals with angular sensors and\nchanging calibrations could self-calibrate and estimate the direction of\nambient fluid flow while moving remains an open question. Here, a methodical\nnonlinear observability analysis is presented to address this. The analysis\nshows that it is mathematically feasible to continuously estimate flow\ndirection and perform regular self-calibrations by adopting frequent changes in\ncourse (or active prevention thereof) and orientation, and requires fusion and\ntemporal differentiation of three sensory measurements: apparent flow,\norientation (or its derivative), and direction of motion (or its derivative).\nThese conclusions are consistent with the zigzagging trajectories exhibited by\nmany plume tracking organisms, suggesting that perhaps flow estimation is a\nsecondary driver of their trajectory structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 21:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The fundamental idea is to define\nnew laser-noise-free observables by combining appropriately time-shifted\nmeasurements. First- and second-generation TDI combinations cancel laser noise\nunder the assumption that the LISA armlengths are constant or evolve linearly\nwith time, respectively. We recently extended TDI by solving for the\nlaser-noise-free combinations implicitly, writing the likelihood of the data\ndirectly in terms of the basic measurements, and using a discretized\nrepresentation of the delays that can accommodate any time dependence of the\narmlengths. We named the resulting formalism \"TDI-infinity'' [PRD 103, 082001\n(2021)].\n  According to Tinto, Dhurandhar, and Joshi [arXiv/2105.02054], our\nmatrix-based approach is invalidated by the simplified start-up conditions\nassumed for the design matrix that connects the time series of laser-noise\nfluctuations to the time series of interferometric measurements along the LISA\narms. Here we respond that, if those boundary conditions are indeed\nunrealistic, they do not invalidate the algorithm, since one can simply\ntruncate the design matrix to exclude \"incomplete'' measurements, or set them\nto zero. Our formalism then proceeds unmodified, except that the length of the\nlaser-noise canceling time series is reduced by the number of excluded\nmeasurements. Tinto and colleagues further claim that the matrix formulation is\nmerely a finite representation of the polynomial ring of delay operators\nintroduced by Dhurandar, Nayak, and Vinet to formalize TDI. We show that this\nis only true if all interferometric delays are exact multiples of the sampling\ninterval, which will not be possible in practical contexts such as LISA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 21:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Most popular methods assume the mean streamwise\nvelocity to satisfy either a logarithmic law in the inner layer or a composite\nvelocity profile with many tuned constants for the entire TBL, both of which\nrequire reliable data from the inner layer. The presence of roughness and\npressure gradient brings additional complications where most existing methods\neither fail or require significant modification. A novel method is proposed to\ndetermine the wall shear stress in zero pressure gradient TBL from measured\nmean profiles, without requiring near-wall data. The method is based on the\nstress model of Kumar and Mahesh [Phys. Rev. Fluids 6, 024603 (2021)], who\ndeveloped accurate models for mean stress and wall-normal velocity in zero\npressure gradient TBL. The proposed method requires a single point measurement\nof mean streamwise velocity and mean shear stress in the outer layer,\npreferably between $20$ to $50 \\%$ of the TBL, and an estimate of boundary\nlayer thickness and shape factor. The method can handle wall roughness without\nmodification and is shown to predict friction velocities to within $3 \\%$ over\na range of Reynolds number for both smooth and rough wall zero pressure\ngradient TBL.

We present derivations of the Granger causality measure in the\ntime and frequency domains and give numerical examples using a non-parametric\nestimation method in the frequency domain. Parametric methods are addressed in\nthe Appendix. We discuss the limitations and applications of this method and\nother alternatives to measure causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 22:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

In this problem, each agent\nhas a local cost, and the goal for the agents is to collectively find a minimum\nof their aggregate cost. A standard algorithm to solve this problem is the\niterative distributed gradient-descent (DGD) method being implemented\ncollaboratively by the server and the agents. In the synchronous setting, the\nalgorithm proceeds from one iteration to the next only after all the agents\ncomplete their expected communication with the server. However, such synchrony\ncan be expensive and even infeasible in real-world applications. We show that\nwaiting for all the agents is unnecessary in many applications of distributed\noptimization, including distributed machine learning, due to redundancy in the\ncost functions (or {\\em data}).

At a nanoscale, the Arp2/3 complex alters the topology of\nactomyosin by nucleating a daughter filament at an angle to a mother filament.\nAt a subcellular scale, they orchestrate the formation of branched actomyosin\nnetwork. Using a coarse-grained approach, we sought to understand how an\nactomyosin network temporally and spatially reorganizes itself by varying the\nconcentration of the Arp2/3 complexes. Driven by the motor dynamics, the\nnetwork stalls at a high concentration of Arp2/3 and contracts at a low Arp2/3\nconcentration. At an intermediate Arp2/3 concentration, however, the actomyosin\nnetwork is formed by loosely connected clusters that may collapse suddenly when\ndriven by motors. This physical phenomenon is called an \"avalanche\" largely due\nto the marginal instability inherent from the morphology of a branched\nactomyosin network when the Arp2/3 complex is present. While embracing the data\nscience approaches, we unveiled the higher-order patterns in the branched\nactomyosin networks and discovered a sudden change in the \"social\" network\ntopology of the actomyosin. This is a new type of avalanches in addition to the\ntwo types of avalanches associated with a sudden change in the size or the\nshape of the whole actomyosin network as shown in the previous investigation.\nOur new finding promotes the importance of using network theory and machine\nlearning models to forecast avalanches in actomyosin networks.

It introduces pupils to\nreal-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical\nconsiderations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of\nTinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To\nfacilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the\ncourses, we launched a standalone website, a forum, a chat, and an optional\ncourse-project competition. We also released the course materials publicly,\nhoping they will inspire the next generation of ML practitioners and educators\nand further broaden access to cutting-edge ML technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 23:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 16:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

In practice, the\nmost common way to learn invariance is through data augmentation. There has\nbeen recent interest in the development of methods that learn distributions on\naugmentation transformations from the training data itself. While such\napproaches are beneficial since they are responsive to the data, they ignore\nthe fact that in many situations the range of transformations to which a model\nneeds to be invariant changes depending on the particular class input belongs\nto. For example, if a model needs to be able to predict whether an image\ncontains a starfish or a dog, we may want to apply random rotations to starfish\nimages during training (since these do not have a preferred orientation), but\nwe would not want to do this to images of dogs. In this work we introduce a\nmethod by which we can learn class conditional distributions on augmentation\ntransformations. We give a number of examples where our methods learn different\nnon-meaningful transformations depending on class and further show how our\nmethod can be used as a tool to probe the symmetries intrinsic to a potentially\ncomplex dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 23:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Then, we compare the\nusefulness of the features extracted by each architecture. We do so with a\nquick training keeping most of the architecture frozen. This gives fast\nestimates of the relative performance. We validate FEAR on Natsbench topology\nsearch space on three different datasets against competing baselines and show\nstrong ranking correlation especially compared to recently proposed zero-cost\nmethods. FEAR particularly excels at ranking high-performance architectures in\nthe search space. When used in the inner loop of discrete search algorithms\nlike random search, FEAR can cut down the search time by approximately 2.4X\nwithout losing accuracy.

Given\nthat modern networks are deep, this raises the question of how well modern\narchitectures, like ResNets, are captured by the infinite-width limit. To\nprovide a better approximation, we study ReLU ResNets in the\ninfinite-depth-and-width limit, where both depth and width tend to infinity as\ntheir ratio, $d/n$, remains constant. In contrast to the Gaussian\ninfinite-width limit, we show theoretically that the network exhibits\nlog-Gaussian behaviour at initialization in the infinite-depth-and-width limit,\nwith parameters depending on the ratio $d/n$.

In the context of Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, the use of Slater\ndeterminants with some imposed constraints to preserve symmetries of the exact\nproblem may lead to physically unreasonable potential energy surfaces. On the\nother hand, lifting these constraints leads to the so-called broken symmetry\nsolutions that usually provide better energetics, at the cost of losing\ninformation about good quantum numbers that describe the state of the system.\nThis behavior has been previously extensively studied in the context of bond\ndissociation. This paper studies the behavior of different classes of\nHartree-Fock spin polarized solutions (restricted, unrestricted, generalized)\nin the context of ionization by strong static electric fields. We find that,\nfor simple two-electron systems, UHF is able to provide a qualitatively good\ndescription of states involved during the ionization process (neutral,\nsingly-ionized and doubly ionized states), whereas RHF fails to describe the\nsingly ionized state. For more complex systems, even though UHF is able to\ncapture some of the expected characteristics of the ionized states, it is\nconstrained to a single $M_s$ (diabatic) manifold in the energy surface as a\nfunction of field intensity. In this case a better qualitative picture can be\npainted by GHF as it is able to explore different spin manifolds and follow the\nlowest solution due to lack of collinearity constraints on the spin\nquantization axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 01:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

In addition, an elastodynamic \"tight binding\" model was proposed to\ninvestigate the formation and evolution of the band structure. The elastic\nwaves were found to propagate largely under \"easy\" modes in the pre-stretched\nsoft lattice, and finite stretch tuned the symmetry of the band structure, but\nalso \"purify\" the propagation modes.

To avoid collusion, we also introduce an extra platform revenue\nconstraint. We analyze the optimal functional form of the bidding formula\ntheoretically and design a policy network accordingly to generate auction-level\nbids. Then we design an efficient multi-agent evolutionary strategy for model\noptimization. Offline experiments and online A/B tests conducted on the Taobao\nplatform indicate both single advertiser's objective and global profit have\nbeen significantly improved compared to state-of-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 03:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

We propose a measure of\nrecognizability of a face image that leverages a key empirical observation: an\nembedding of face images, implemented by a deep neural network trained using\nmostly recognizable identities, induces a partition of the hypersphere whereby\nunrecognizable identities cluster together. This occurs regardless of the\nphenomenon that causes a face to be unrecognizable, it be optical or motion\nblur, partial occlusion, spatial quantization, poor illumination. Therefore, we\nuse the distance from such an \"unrecognizable identity\" as a measure of\nrecognizability, and incorporate it in the design of the over-all system.

Since most medical images have the\ncharacteristics of blurred boundaries and uneven intensity distribution,\nthrough existing segmentation methods, the discontinuity within the target area\nand the discontinuity of the target boundary are likely to lead to rough or\neven erroneous boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative\nrefined interactive segmentation method for medical images based on agent\nreinforcement learning, which focuses on the problem of target segmentation\nboundaries. We model the dynamic process of drawing the target contour in a\ncertain order as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on a deep reinforcement\nlearning method. In the dynamic process of continuous interaction between the\nagent and the image, the agent tracks the boundary point by point in order\nwithin a limited length range until the contour of the target is completely\ndrawn. In this process, the agent can quickly improve the segmentation\nperformance by exploring an interactive policy in the image. The method we\nproposed is simple and effective.

Consequently, there is\na need for methods that generalize well despite restricted access to target\ndomain data during training. In this work, we propose an adversarial semantic\nhallucination approach (ASH), which combines a class-conditioned hallucination\nmodule and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation performance\nvaries across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned style\nhallucination module to generate affine transformation parameters from semantic\ninformation in the segmentation probability maps of the source domain image.\nUnlike previous adaptation approaches, which treat all classes equally, ASH\nconsiders the class-wise differences.

The model is in agreement with a systematic experimental\ncharacterization of the FERMI EEHG FEL in the photon energy range $130-210$ eV.\nWe find that amplification of electron beam energy distortions primarily in the\nEEHG dispersive sections explains an observed reduction of the FEL spectral\nbrightness that is proportional to the EEHG harmonic number. Local maxima of\nthe FEL spectral brightness and of the spectral stability are found for a\nsuitable balance of the dispersive sections' strength and the first seed laser\npulse energy. Such characterization provides a benchmark for user experiments\nand future EEHG implementations designed to reach shorter wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 07:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Among other things, this means having better resonators which\nwould provide improved spin sensitivity, as well as enable larger microwave\nmagnetic field power conversion factors. Surface micro resonators, made of\nsmall metallic patches on a dielectric substrate, provide very good absolute\nspin sensitivity and high conversion factors due to their very small mode\nvolume. However, such resonators suffer from having a relatively low quality\nfactor, which offsets some of their significant potential advantages. The use\nof superconducting patches to replace the metallic layer seems like a\nreasonable and straightforward solution to the quality factor issue, at least\nfor measurements carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless,\nsuperconducting materials are not easily incorporated into setups requiring\nhigh magnetic fields, due to electric current vortices generated in the\nlatter's surface.

Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equation (NODE), a deep learning model integrated with\ndifferential equations, is popular in learning dynamics recently due to its\nrobustness to irregular samples and its flexibility to high-dimensional input.\nHowever, the training of NODE is sensitive to the precision of the numerical\nsolver, which makes the convergence of NODE unstable, especially for\nill-conditioned dynamical systems. In this paper, to reduce the reliance on the\nnumerical solver, we propose to enhance the supervised signal in the training\nof NODE. Specifically, we pre-train a neural differential operator (NDO) to\noutput an estimation of the derivatives to serve as an additional supervised\nsignal. The NDO is pre-trained on a class of basis functions and learns the\nmapping between the trajectory samples of these functions to their derivatives.\nTo leverage both the trajectory signal and the estimated derivatives from NDO,\nwe propose an algorithm called NDO-NODE, in which the loss function contains\ntwo terms: the fitness on the true trajectory samples and the fitness on the\nestimated derivatives that are outputted by the pre-trained NDO. Experiments on\nvarious kinds of dynamics show that our proposed NDO-NODE can consistently\nimprove the forecasting accuracy with one pre-trained NDO.

Explicit\nanalytic results are derived for the work and heat statistics, energy, and\nentropy changes for harmonic and non-harmonic trapping potential with arbitrary\ntime-dependent potential parameters and temperature protocols.

However, if a thin nickel film is\nsubjected to ultrashort laser pulses, it can lose its magnetic order almost\ncompletely within merely femtosecond times. This phenomenon, in the meantime\nalso observed in many other materials, has connected magnetism with femtosecond\noptics in an efficient, ultrafast and complex way, offering opportunities for\nrapid information processing or ultrafast spintronics at frequencies\napproaching those of light. Consequently, the physics of ultrafast\ndemagnetization is central to modern material research, but a crucial question\nhas remained elusive: If a material loses its magnetization within only\nfemtoseconds, where is the missing angular momentum in such short time? Here we\nuse ultrafast electron diffraction to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous,\nlong-lasting, non-equilibrium population of anisotropic high-frequency phonons\nthat appear as quickly as the magnetic order is lost. The anisotropy plane is\nperpendicular to the direction of the initial magnetization and the atomic\noscillation amplitude is 2 pm. We explain these observations by means of\ncircularly polarized phonons that quickly absorb the missing angular momentum\nof the spin system before the slower onset of a macroscopic sample rotation.\nThe time that is needed for demagnetization is related to the time it takes to\naccelerate the atoms. These results provide an atomistic picture of ultrafast\ndemagnetization under adherence to all conservation laws but also demonstrate\nthe general importance of polarized phonons for non-equilibrium dynamics and\nprovide innovative ways for controlling materials on atomic dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 09:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Our self-supervised pre-trained model also provides an\nexcellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning, suggesting an alternate\ntraining paradigm in contrast to current supervised learning methods that\nhighly rely on pre-training on synthetic data. At the time of writing, our\nfine-tuned models ranked 1st among all monocular methods on the KITTI 2015\nbenchmark, and outperform all published methods on the Sintel Final benchmark.\nMore importantly, we demonstrate the generalization capability of DistillFlow\nin three aspects: framework generalization, correspondence generalization and\ncross-dataset generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 09:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

An ideal MHD parallel shock (where the velocity and\nmagnetic fields are aligned) is unconditionally unstable to the corrugation\ninstability, whereas the ideal hydrodynamic (HD) counterpart is unconditionally\nstable. For a partially ionised medium (for example the solar chromosphere),\nboth hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic species coexist and the stability of\nthe system has not been studied. In this paper, we perform numerical\nsimulations of the corrugation instability in two-fluid partially-ionised shock\nfronts to investigate the stability conditions, and compare the results to HD\nand MHD simulations. Our simulations consist of an initially steady 2D parallel\nshock encountering a localised upstream density perturbation. In MHD, this\nperturbation results in an unstable shock front and the corrugation grows with\ntime. We find that for the two-fluid simulation, the neutral species can act to\nstabilise the shock front. A parameter study is performed to analyse the\nconditions under which the shock front is stable and unstable.

These dynamics,\nwhen viewed in isolation, have no time-local description: they are\nnon-Markovian and memory effects induce complex features that are difficult to\ninterpret. To address this problem, we here show how to use system\ncorrelations, calculated by any method, to infer any correlation function of a\nGaussian environment, so long as the coupling between system and environment is\nlinear. This not only allows reconstruction of the full dynamics of both system\nand environment, but also opens avenues into studying the effect of a system on\nits environment. In order to obtain accurate bath dynamics, we exploit a\nnumerically exact approach to simulating the system dynamics, which is based on\nthe construction and contraction of a tensor network that represents the\nprocess tensor of this open quantum system.

Nevertheless, it has been shown that passengers\nare afraid of taking a ride in self-driving cars. One way to alleviate this\nproblem is by allowing the passenger to give natural language commands to the\ncar. However, the car can misunderstand the issued command or the visual\nsurroundings which could lead to uncertain situations. It is desirable that the\nself-driving car detects these situations and interacts with the passenger to\nsolve them. This paper proposes a model that detects uncertain situations when\na command is given and finds the visual objects causing it. Optionally, a\nquestion generated by the system describing the uncertain objects is included.\nWe argue that if the car could explain the objects in a human-like way,\npassengers could gain more confidence in the car's abilities.

For\neach coverage, we study the competition between the desorption and oxidation of\nCO on the corresponding optimized structure by analyzing their reaction\nenergies and minimum energy reaction paths. The desorption process is\nendothermic at all coverages, although the desorption energy decreases as the\nCO coverage increases. The process itself (and also the reverted adsorption)\nbecomes more involved at the intermediate and high coverages because of the\nappearance of a physisorption well and concomitant energy barrier separating it\nfrom the chemisorbed state. Remarkably, the oxidation of CO, which is\nendothermic at low coverages, turns exothermic at the intermediate and high\ncoverages. In all cases, the minimum reaction path for oxidation, which\ninvolves the chemisorbed and physisorbed CO2, is ruled by one of the large\nenergy barriers that protect these molecular states. Altogether, the larger\nactivation energies for oxidation as compared to those for desorption and the\nextreme complexity of the oxidation against the desorption paths explain that\nCO desorption dominates over the oxidation in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 10:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared\nacross channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the\nconnection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance.\nWe point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its\ndynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight\nsharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights)\nacross spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on\ndepth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation\ncomplexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin\nTransformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet\nclassification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation. These\nobservations suggest that Local Vision Transformer takes advantage of two\nregularization forms and dynamic weight to increase the network capacity.

To handle the scale variance among\ndifferent body parts, we build a hierarchical point representation of body\nparts and jointly regress them.

A radiant structure means a torsion-free affine\nconnection and a radiant vector field, meaning its covariant derivative is the\nidentity endomorphism. A radiant structure is conelike if for every point and\nevery two-dimensional subspace containing the radiant vector field there is a\ntotally geodesics surface passing through the point and tangent to the\nsubspace. Such structures exist on the total space of any principal bundle with\none-dimensional fiber and on any Lie group with a quadratic structure on its\nLie algebra.\n  The affine connection of a conelike radiant structure can be normalized in a\ncanonical way to have antisymmetric Ricci tensor. Applied to a conelike radiant\nstructure on the total space of a principal bundle with one-dimensional fiber\nthis yields a generalization of the classical Thomas connection of a projective\nstructure.

By training only on generated data the results\nincreased to 72.1%, and by mixing generated and real data we achieve 75.7%\naverage precision.

To this end, we propose a novel discrete\nvariational autoencoder with adversarial loss, dVAE-Adv, which learns a new\ndiscrete latent representation we call Memcodes. Memcodes are straightforward\nto implement, require no additional loss terms, are stable to train compared\nwith other approaches, and show evidence of interpretability. To predict on the\nMemcode space, we use an autoregressive encoder-decoder model conditioned on\naudio. Additionally, our model can control latent attributes in the generated\nvideo that are not annotated in the data. We train NWT on clips from HBO's Last\nWeek Tonight with John Oliver.

Choosing the\nbest memory layout for each hardware architecture is increasingly important as\nmore and more programs become memory bound. For portable codes that run across\nheterogeneous hardware architectures, the choice of the memory layout for data\nstructures is ideally decoupled from the rest of a program. This can be\naccomplished via a zero-runtime-overhead abstraction layer, underneath which\nmemory layouts can be freely exchanged.\n  We present the Low-Level Abstraction of Memory Access (LLAMA), a C++ library\nthat provides such a data structure abstraction layer with example\nimplementations for multidimensional arrays of nested, structured data. LLAMA\nprovides fully C++ compliant methods for defining and switching custom memory\nlayouts for user-defined data types. The library is extensible with third-party\nallocators.\n  Providing two close-to-life examples, we show that the LLAMA-generated AoS\n(Array of Structs) and SoA (Struct of Arrays) layouts produce identical code\nwith the same performance characteristics as manually written data structures.\nIntegrations into the SPEC CPU\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered} lbm benchmark\nand the particle-in-cell simulation PIConGPU demonstrate LLAMA's abilities in\nreal-world applications.

The hybrid classical-quantum approach consists in the\nsolution on a quantum computer of the coupled linear system of equations that\nresult from the discretization step.

Unlike the\nclassical Gauss-Seidel method, the errors of the quantum solutions level off\nafter a few iterations of our algorithm. This is partly a result of the span of\nthe real number line available from the mapping of the chosen size of the set\nof qubit states.

As wireless systems evolve towards\n6G, the ambition to immerse the digital into the physical reality will\nincrease. Besides making the real-time requirements more stringent, this\nimmersion will bring the notions of time, simultaneity, presence, and causality\nto a new level of complexity. A growing body of research points out that\nlatency is insufficient to parameterize all real-time requirements. Notably,\none such requirement that received a significant attention is information\nfreshness, defined through the Age of Information (AoI) and its derivatives.\nThe objective of this article is to investigate the general notion of timing in\nwireless communication systems and networks and its relation to effective\ninformation generation, processing, transmission, and reconstruction at the\nsenders and receivers. We establish a general statistical framework of timing\nrequirements in wireless communication systems, which subsumes both latency and\nAoI. The framework is made by associating a timing component with the two basic\nstatistical operations, decision and estimation. We first use the framework to\npresent a representative sample of the existing works that deal with timing in\nwireless communication. Next, it is shown how the framework can be used with\ndifferent communication models of increasing complexity, starting from the\nbasic Shannon one-way communication model and arriving to communication models\nfor consensus, distributed learning, and inference. Overall, this paper fills\nan important gap in the literature by providing a systematic treatment of\nvarious timing measures in wireless communication and sets the basis for design\nand optimization for the next-generation real-time systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 13:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 07:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Unfortunately, to date, most of the models\nhave little to no empirical validation. One major problem in testing these\nmodels against real-world data relates to the difficulties in measuring\nopinions in ways that map directly to representations in models. Indeed, this\nkind of measurement is complex in nature and presents more types of measurement\nerror than just classical random noise. Thus, it is crucial to know how these\ndifferent error types may affect the model's predictions. In this work, we\nanalyze this relationship in the Deffuant model. Starting from the\npsychometrics literature, we first discuss how opinion measurements are\naffected by three types of errors: random noise, binning, and distortions (i.e.\nuneven intervals between scale points). While the first two are known to most\nof the scientific community, the third one is mostly unknown outside\npsychometrics. Because of that, we highlight the nature and peculiarities of\neach of these measurement errors. By simulating these types of error, we show\nthat the Deffuant model is robust to binning but not to noise and distortions.\nIndeed, if a scale has 4 or more points (like most self-report scales), binning\nhas almost no effect on the final predictions. However, prediction error\nincreases almost linearly with random noise, up to a maximum error of 40%.\nAfter reaching this value, increasing the amount of noise does not worsen the\nprediction. Distortions are most problematic, reaching a maximum prediction\nerror of 80%. Up to now most of the research focused on the properties of the\nmodels without analyzing the types of data they may be used with. Here we show\nthat when studying a model, we should also analyze its robustness to these\ntypes of measurement error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 16:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

However, it has\nbeen widely observed in practice that the best-performing AF in terms of regret\ncan vary significantly under different types of black-box functions. It has\nremained a challenge to design one AF that can attain the best performance over\na wide variety of black-box functions. This paper aims to attack this challenge\nthrough the perspective of reinforced few-shot AF learning (FSAF).\nSpecifically, we first connect the notion of AFs with Q-functions and view a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) as a surrogate differentiable AF. While it serves as a\nnatural idea to combine DQN and an existing few-shot learning method, we\nidentify that such a direct combination does not perform well due to severe\noverfitting, which is particularly critical in BO due to the need of a\nversatile sampling policy. To address this, we present a Bayesian variant of\nDQN with the following three features: (i) It learns a distribution of\nQ-networks as AFs based on the Kullback-Leibler regularization framework. This\ninherently provides the uncertainty required in sampling for BO and mitigates\noverfitting. (ii) For the prior of the Bayesian DQN, we propose to use a demo\npolicy induced by an off-the-shelf AF for better training stability. (iii) On\nthe meta-level, we leverage the meta-loss of Bayesian model-agnostic\nmeta-learning, which serves as a natural companion to the proposed FSAF.\nMoreover, with the proper design of the Q-networks, FSAF is general-purpose in\nthat it is agnostic to the dimension and the cardinality of the input domain.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the FSAF achieves comparable\nor better regrets than the state-of-the-art benchmarks on a wide variety of\nsynthetic and real-world test functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 13:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Studies of\ncollective behaviours on the controlled-structure complexes can reveal the\nsubtle interplay of geometry and dynamics. Here, we investigate the phase\nsynchronisation dynamics under the competing interactions embedded on 1-simplex\n(edges) and 2-simplex (triangles) faces of a homogeneous 4-dimensional\nsimplicial complex. Its underlying network is a 1-hyperbolic graph with the\nassortative correlations among the node's degrees and the spectral dimension\nthat exceeds $d_s=4$. We determine the time-averaged system's order parameter\nto characterise the synchronisation level. In the absence of higher\ninteractions, the complete synchrony is continuously reached with the\nincreasing positive pairwise interactions ($K_1>0$), and a partial\nsynchronisation for the negative couplings ($K_1<0$) with no apparent\nhysteresis. Similar behaviour occurs in the degree-preserved randomised\nnetwork. In contrast, the synchronisation is absent for the negative pairwise\ncoupling in the entirely random graph and simple scale-free networks.\nIncreasing the strength $K_2\\neq 0$ of the triangle-based interactions\ngradually hinders the synchronisation promoted by pairwise couplings, and the\nnon-symmetric hysteresis loop opens with an abrupt desynchronisation transition\ntowards the $K_1<0$ branch. However, for substantial triangle-based\ninteractions, the frustration effects prevail, preventing the complete\nsynchronisation, and the abrupt transition disappears. These findings shed new\nlight on the mechanisms by which the high-dimensional simplicial complexes in\nnatural systems, such as human connectomes, can modulate their native\nsynchronisation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 14:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this paper, to promote trustworthy data\nacquisition for ML tasks, we propose FL-Market, a locally private model\nmarketplace that protects privacy not only against model buyers but also\nagainst the untrusted broker. FL-Market decouples ML from the need to centrally\ngather training data on the broker's side using federated learning, an emerging\nprivacy-preserving ML paradigm in which data owners collaboratively train an ML\nmodel by uploading local gradients (to be aggregated into a global gradient for\nmodel updating). Then, FL-Market enables data owners to locally perturb their\ngradients by local differential privacy and thus further prevents privacy\nrisks. To drive FL-Market, we propose a deep learning-empowered auction\nmechanism for intelligently deciding the local gradients' perturbation levels\nand an optimal aggregation mechanism for aggregating the perturbed gradients.\nOur auction and aggregation mechanisms can jointly maximize the global\ngradient's accuracy, which optimizes model buyers' utility.

On\nDecember 24 and 26, 2019, close to perihelion, we detected several OH lines of\nthe 309 nm (0-0) band and derived a water production rate of $2.2\\pm0.2 \\times\n10^{26}$ molecules/s. The three [OI] forbidden oxygen lines were detected at\ndifferent epochs and we derive a green-to-red doublet intensity ratio (G/R) of\n$0.31\\pm0.05$ close to perihelion. NH$_2$ ortho and para lines from various\nbands were measured and allowed us to derive an ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of\n$3.21\\pm0.15$, corresponding to an OPR and spin temperature of ammonia of\n$1.11\\pm0.08$ and $31^{+10}_{-5}$ K, respectively. These values are consistent\nwith the values usually measured for solar system comets. Emission lines of the\nradicals NH (336 nm), CN (388 nm), CH (431 nm), and C$_2$ (517 nm) were also\ndetected. Several FeI and NiI lines were identified and their intensities were\nmeasured to provide a ratio of log (NiI/FeI) = $0.21\\pm0.18$ in agreement with\nthe value recently found in solar system comets. Our high spectral resolution\nobservations of 2I/Borisov and the associated measurements of the NH$_2$ OPR\nand the Ni/Fe abundance ratio are remarkably similar to solar system comets.\nOnly the G/R ratio is unusually high but consistent with the high abundance\nratio of CO/H$_2$O found by other investigators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 15:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

We employ an optical quantum memory with spin-wave storage and\nan embedded processing capability to implement a time-inversion interferometer\nfor input light, projecting the optical field in the symmetric-antisymmetric\nmode basis. Our tailored measurement achieves a resolution of 15 kHz and\nrequires 20 times less photons than a corresponding Rayleigh-limited\nconventional method. We demonstrate the advantage of our technique over both\nconventional spectroscopy and heterodyne measurements, showing potential for\napplication in distinguishing ultra-narrowband emitters, optical communication\nchannels, or signals transduced from lower-frequency domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 15:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 10:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The price to pay is a high computational burden and the\nneed for diversity to lift any phase ambiguity. If those limitations can be\novercome, FPWFS is a great solution for NCPA measurement, a key limitation for\nhigh-contrast imaging, and could be used as adaptive optics wavefront sensor.\nHere, we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to measure\nNCPA based on focal plane images. Two CNN architectures are considered:\nResNet-50 and U-Net which are used respectively to estimate Zernike\ncoefficients or directly the phase. The models are trained on labelled datasets\nand evaluated at various flux levels and for two spatial frequency contents (20\nand 100 Zernike modes). In these idealized simulations we demonstrate that the\nCNN-based models reach the photon noise limit in a large range of conditions.\nWe show, for example, that the root mean squared (rms) wavefront error (WFE)\ncan be reduced to < $\\lambda$/1500 for $2 \\times 10^6$ photons in one iteration\nwhen estimating 20 Zernike modes. We also show that CNN-based models are\nsufficiently robust to varying signal-to-noise ratio, under the presence of\nhigher-order aberrations, and under different amplitudes of aberrations.\nAdditionally, they display similar to superior performance compared to\niterative phase retrieval algorithms. CNNs therefore represent a compelling way\nto implement FPWFS, which can leverage the high sensitivity of FPWFS over a\nbroad range of conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 15:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Deep learning has shown promising results in\nbiomedical engineering thanks to its capacity of modelling complicated data\nwith its non-linear architecture. However, due to their complex structure, deep\nlearning models are generally not interpretable by humans, making it difficult\nfor clinicians to rely on the findings. In this paper, we propose a channel\nattention module for deep learning models to predict cerebral palsy from\ninfants' body movements, which highlights the key features (i.e. body joints)\nthe model identifies as important, thereby indicating why certain diagnostic\nresults are found. To highlight the capacity of the deep network in modelling\ninput features, we utilize raw joint positions instead of hand-crafted\nfeatures. We validate our system with a real-world infant movement dataset. Our\nproposed channel attention module enables the visualization of the vital joints\nto this disease that the network considers.

At the first stage, we employ the physics-informed\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (PI-GAN) to learn a functional prior either\nfrom a prescribed function distribution, e.g., Gaussian process, or from\nhistorical data and physics. At the second stage, we employ the Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo (HMC) method to estimate the posterior in the latent space of\nPI-GANs. In addition, we use two different approaches to encode the physics:\n(1) automatic differentiation, used in the physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) for scenarios with explicitly known partial differential equations\n(PDEs), and (2) operator regression using the deep operator network (DeepONet)\nfor PDE-agnostic scenarios. We then test the proposed method for (1)\nmeta-learning for one-dimensional regression, and forward/inverse PDE problems\n(combined with PINNs); (2) PDE-agnostic physical problems (combined with\nDeepONet), e.g., fractional diffusion as well as saturated stochastic\n(100-dimensional) flows in heterogeneous porous media; and (3) spatial-temporal\nregression problems, i.e., inference of a marine riser displacement field. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide accurate predictions\nas well as uncertainty quantification given very limited scattered and noisy\ndata, since historical data could be available to provide informative priors.\nIn summary, the proposed method is capable of learning flexible functional\npriors, and can be extended to big data problems using stochastic HMC or\nnormalizing flows since the latent space is generally characterized as low\ndimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 03:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

By\ndefining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic\ndecompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with\na probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e.\nachieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability,\ngiven that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the\nindependent training and testing of the subsystems; if they each learn a policy\nsatisfying the appropriate subtask specification, then their composition is\nguaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the\nsubtask specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we\npresent a method, formulated as the problem of finding an optimal set of\nparameters in the pMDP, to automatically update the subtask specifications to\naccount for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for\ndefining subtask specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them.\nAs an additional benefit, this procedure allows for particularly challenging or\nimportant components of an overall task to be determined automatically, and\nfocused on, during training.

Here we study nonlinear\nnon-Hermitian skin effect and explore nonlocal and substantial effects of edges\non stationary nonlinear solutions. We show that fractal and continuum bands\narise in a long lattice governed by a nonreciprocal discrete nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation.

It is nowadays commonly used in geosciences to perform parametric\ncalibration. In a context of climate change, old calibrations can not\nnecessarily be used for new scenarios. This raises the question of DA\ncomputational cost, as costly physics-based numerical models need to be\nreanalyzed. Reduction and metamodelling represent therefore interesting\nperspectives, for example proposed in recent contributions as hybridization\nbetween ensemble and variational methods, to combine their advantages\n(efficiency, non-linear framework). They are however often based on Monte Carlo\n(MC) type sampling, which often requires considerable increase of the ensemble\nsize for better efficiency, therefore representing a computational burden in\nensemble-based methods as well. To address these issues, two methods to replace\nthe complex model by a surrogate are proposed and confronted : (i) PODEn3DVAR\ndirectly inspired from PODEn4DVAR, relies on an ensemble-based joint\nparameter-state Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which provides a linear\nmetamodel ; (ii) POD-PCE-3DVAR, where the model states are POD reduced then\nlearned using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), resulting in a non-linear\nmetamodel. Both metamodels allow to write an approximate cost function whose\nminimum can be analytically computed, or deduced by a gradient descent at\nnegligible cost. Furthermore, adapted metamodelling error covariance matrix is\ngiven for POD-PCE-3DVAR, allowing to substantially improve the metamodel-based\nDA analysis. Proposed methods are confronted on a twin experiment, and compared\nto classical 3DVAR on a measurement-based problem. Results are promising, in\nparticular superior with POD-PCE-3DVAR, showing good convergence to classical\n3DVAR and robustness to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 07:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Thanks to the high spectral efficiency and\nlow latency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential access\ntechnique for future communication networks. In this paper, we propose to use\nthe UAV as a moving base station (BS) to serve multiple users using NOMA and\njointly solve for the 3D-UAV placement and resource allocation problem. Since\nthe corresponding optimization problem is non-convex, we rely on the recent\nadvances in artificial intelligence (AI) and propose AdaptSky, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework, to efficiently solve it. To the\nbest of our knowledge, AdaptSky is the first framework that optimizes NOMA\npower allocation jointly with 3D-UAV placement using both sub-6GHz and\nmillimeter wave mmWave spectrum. Furthermore, for the first time in NOMA-UAV\nnetworks, AdaptSky integrates the dueling network (DN) architecture to the DRL\ntechnique to improve its learning capabilities. Our findings show that AdaptSky\ndoes not only exhibit a fast-adapting learning and outperform the\nstate-of-the-art baseline approach in data rate and fairness, but also it\ngeneralizes very well.
