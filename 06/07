Principle\namong these limitations are the convergence of associated Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these\nlimitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are\nremoved from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman\ngenerators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for\ncertain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of\nthe operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a\nviable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of\neigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to\nbe achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is\nembedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a\nmore typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank\nrepresentation that converges in norm.

Specifically, we first divide the input\nimage into patches as commonly done, and each patch is viewed as a token. Then,\nthe proposed H-MHSA learns token relationships within local patches, serving as\nlocal relationship modeling. Then, the small patches are merged into larger\nones, and H-MHSA models the global dependencies for the small number of the\nmerged tokens. At last, the local and global attentive features are aggregated\nto obtain features with powerful representation capacity. Since we only\ncalculate attention for a limited number of tokens at each step, the\ncomputational load is reduced dramatically. Hence, H-MHSA can efficiently model\nglobal relationships among tokens without sacrificing fine-grained information.\nWith the H-MHSA module incorporated, we build a family of\nHierarchical-Attention-based Transformer Networks, namely HAT-Net. To\ndemonstrate the superiority of HAT-Net in scene understanding, we conduct\nextensive experiments on fundamental vision tasks, including image\nclassification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance\nsegmentation. Therefore, HAT-Net provides a new perspective for the vision\ntransformer.

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) has recently gained its popularity by establishing the state-of-the-art\nscores in several NLP benchmarks. A Lite BERT (ALBERT) is literally\ncharacterized as a lightweight version of BERT, in which the number of BERT\nparameters is reduced by repeatedly applying the same neural network called\nTransformer's encoder layer. By pre-training the parameters with a massive\namount of natural language data, ALBERT can convert input sentences into\nversatile high-dimensional vectors potentially capable of solving multiple NLP\ntasks. In that sense, ALBERT can be regarded as a well-designed\nhigh-dimensional dynamical system whose operator is the Transformer's encoder,\nand essential structures of human language are thus expected to be encapsulated\nin its dynamics. In this study, we investigated the embedded properties of\nALBERT to reveal how NLP tasks are effectively solved by exploiting its\ndynamics.

Indeed, contrarily to two- or\nthree-dimensional models, the BHJ morphology is not explicitly described in\none-dimensional models and must be implicitly expressed through effective\nparameters. In order to inform experimental decisions, a helpful parameter\nestimation method must establish that one can correctly interpret the provided\nparameters. However, only a few works have been undertaken to reach that\nobjective in the context of BHJ organic solar cells. In this work, a realistic\ntwo-dimensional model of BHJ solar cells is used to investigate the behavior of\nstate-of-the-art parameter estimation procedures in situations that emulate\nexperimental conditions. We demonstrate that fitting solely current-voltage\ncharacteristics by an effective medium one-dimensional model can yield\nnonsensical results, which may lead to counter-productive decisions about\nfuture design choices. In agreement with previously published literature, we\nexplicitly demonstrate that fitting several characterization results together\ncan drastically improve the robustness of the parameter estimation. Based on a\ndetailed analysis of parameter estimation results, a set of recommendations is\nformulated to avoid the most problematic pitfalls and increase awareness about\nthe limitations that cannot be circumvented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 18:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Oceans typically have a non-uniform density stratification profile;\nmoreover, submarine topography leads to a spatially varying ocean depth ($h$).\nUnder these conditions and assuming mild-slope bathymetry, we employ\nmultiple-scale analysis to derive the wave amplitude equations for triadic- and\nself-interactions. The waves are assumed to have a slowly (rapidly) varying\namplitude (phase) in space and time. For uniform stratifications, the\nhorizontal wavenumber ($k$) condition for waves ($1$,$2$,$3$), given by\n${k}_{(1,a)}+{k}_{(2,b)}+{k}_{(3,c)}=0$, is unaffected as $h$ is varied, where\n$(a,b,c)$ denote the modenumber. Moreover, the nonlinear coupling coefficients\n(NLC) are proportional to $1/h^2$, implying that triadic waves grow faster\nwhile travelling up a seamount. For non-uniform stratifications, triads that do\nnot satisfy the condition $a=b=c$ may not satisfy the horizontal wavenumber\ncondition as $h$ is varied, and unlike uniform stratification, the NLC may not\ndecrease (increase) monotonically with increasing (decreasing) $h$. NLC, and\nhence wave growth rates for both triads and self-interactions, can also vary\nrapidly with $h$. The most unstable daughter wave combination of a triad with a\nmode-1 parent wave can also change for relatively small changes in $h$. We also\ninvestigate higher-order self-interactions in the presence of a monochromatic,\nsmall amplitude bathymetry; here the bathymetry behaves as a zero frequency\nwave. We derive the amplitude evolution equations and show that higher-order\nself-interactions might be a viable mechanism of energy cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 18:12:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 14:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 21:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Decreasing the grain size further decreases the\nthermal conductivity. We also observe that this effect is smaller in OM\nnanostructures than in membranes due to the competition of surface scattering\nin decreasing thermal conductivity.

To find analytical solutions, we analyze the propagation of waves in\nvacuum spacetime. The background field equations in absence of matter are\nsolved by assuming the expansion scalar to be proportional to the shear scalar.\nUsing the method of separation of variables, the axial perturbation parameter $\nh_0(t, r) $ is obtained from its wave equation. The other perturbation $ h_1(t,\nr) $ is then determined from $ h_0(t, r) $. The anisotropy of the background\nspacetime is responsible for the damping of the axial waves. The polar\nperturbation equations are much more involved compared to their FLRW\ncounterparts, as well as to the axial perturbations in Kantowski-Sachs\nbackground.

In this work, the decision-maker is\ngiven a deadline of $T$ rounds, where, on each round, it can adaptively choose\nwhich arms to pull and how many times to pull them; this distinguishes the\nnumber of decisions made (i.e., time or number of rounds) from the number of\nsamples acquired (cost).

However,\nfinding winning tickets requires burdensome computations in the\ntrain-prune-retrain process, especially on large-scale datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet), restricting their practical benefits. This paper explores a new\nperspective on finding lottery tickets more efficiently, by doing so only with\na specially selected subset of data, called Pruning-Aware Critical set (PrAC\nset), rather than using the full training set. The concept of PrAC set was\ninspired by the recent observation, that deep networks have samples that are\neither hard to memorize during training, or easy to forget during pruning. A\nPrAC set is thus hypothesized to capture those most challenging and informative\nexamples for the dense model. We observe that a high-quality winning ticket can\nbe found with training and pruning the dense network on the very compact PrAC\nset, which can substantially save training iterations for the ticket finding\nprocess. Extensive experiments validate our proposal across diverse datasets\nand network architectures. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny\nImageNet, we locate effective PrAC sets at 35.32%~78.19% of their training set\nsizes.

As predicting missing distances is a difficult\nproblem, we take a two-stage approach. Structural parameters for families of\nsynthetic networks are first estimated from a small set of measurements of a\nreal-world network and these synthetic networks are then used to pre-train the\npredictive neural networks. Since our model first searches for the most\nsuitable synthetic graph parameters which can be used as an \"oracle\" to create\narbitrarily large training data sets, we call our approach \"Oracle Search\nPre-training\" (OSP). For example, many real-world networks exhibit a Power law\nstructure in their node degree distribution, so a Power law model can provide a\nfoundation for the desired oracle to generate synthetic pre-training networks,\nif the appropriate Power law graph parameters can be estimated. Accordingly, we\nconduct experiments on real-world Facebook, Email, and Train Bombing networks\nand show that OSP outperforms models without pre-training, models pre-trained\nwith inaccurate parameters, and other distance prediction schemes such as\nLow-rank Matrix Completion. In particular, we achieve a prediction error of\nless than one hop with only 1% of sampled distances from the social network.\nOSP can be easily extended to other domains such as random networks by choosing\nan appropriate model to generate synthetic training data, and therefore\npromises to impact many different network learning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 20:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Given the initial content and a sequence\nof forwarding users, DyDiff-VAE aims to estimate the propagation likelihood for\nother potential users and predict the corresponding user rankings. Inferring\nuser interests from diffusion data lies the foundation of diffusion prediction,\nbecause users often forward the information in which they are interested or the\ninformation from those who share similar interests. Their interests also evolve\nover time as the result of the dynamic social influence from neighbors and the\ntime-sensitive information gained inside/outside the social media. Existing\nworks fail to model users' intrinsic interests from the diffusion data and\nassume user interests remain static along the time. DyDiff-VAE advances the\nstate of the art in two directions: (i) We propose a dynamic encoder to infer\nthe evolution of user interests from observed diffusion data.

In particular the muon beam normalised\ntransverse emittance is a relevant figure of merit to meet luminosity requests.\nA typical issue impacting the achieved transverse emittance in muon collider\nschemes so far considered is the phase space dilution caused by coulomb\ninteraction of primary particles propagating into the target where muons are\ngenerated. In this study we present a new scheme for muon beam generation\noccurring in vacuum by interactions of electron and photon beams. Setting the\ncenter of mass energy at about twice the threshold (i.e. around $350$ MeV) the\nnormalised emittance of the muon beam generated via muon pair production\nreaction ($e^-+\\gamma \\rightarrow e^-+\\mu^+/\\mu^-$) is largely independent on\nthe emittance of the colliding electron beam and is set basically by the excess\nof transverse momentum in the muon pair creation. In absence of any other\nmechanism for emittance dilution, the resulting muon beam, with energy in the\nrange of few tens of GeV, is characterised by an ultra-low normalised\ntransverse rms emittance of a few nm rad, corresponding to a geometrical\nemittance below $10$ pm rad. This opens the way to a new muon collider paradigm\nbased on muon sources conceived with primary colliding beams delivered by $100$\nGeV-class energy recovery linacs interacting with hard-X ray free electron\nlasers. The challenge is to achieve the requested luminosity of the muon\ncollider adopting a strategy of low muon fluxes/currents combined to ultra-low\nemittances, so to largely reduce also the levels of muon beam-induced\nbackground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 21:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

In this paper, we consider the filtering\nproblem associate with these advanced technologies, i.e., how to estimate\nlatent dynamic states of an intracellular multiscale stochastic reaction\nnetwork from time-course measurements of fluorescent reporters. A good solution\nto this problem can further improve scientists' ability to extract information\nabout intracellular systems from time-course experiments.\n  A straightforward approach to this filtering problem is to use a particle\nfilter where particles are generated by simulation of the full model and\nweighted according to observations. However, the exact simulation of the full\ndynamic model usually takes an impractical amount of computational time and\nprevents this type of particle filters from being used for real-time\napplications, such as transcription regulation networks. Inspired by the recent\ndevelopment of hybrid approximations to multiscale chemical reaction networks,\nwe approach the filtering problem in an alternative way. We first prove that\naccurate solutions to the filtering problem can be constructed by solving the\nfiltering problem for a reduced model that represents the dynamics as a hybrid\nprocess. The model reduction is based on exploiting the time-scale separations\nin the original network and, therefore, can greatly reduce the computational\neffort required to simulate the dynamics. As a result, we are able to develop\nefficient particle filters to solve the filtering problem for the original\nmodel by applying particle filters to the reduced model.

Standard approaches for computing equilibria in these games\nreformulate the followers' best response as constraints in the leader's\noptimization problem. These reformulation approaches can sometimes be\neffective, but often get trapped in low-quality solutions when followers'\nobjectives are non-linear or non-quadratic. Moreover, these approaches assume a\nunique equilibrium or a specific equilibrium concept, e.g., optimistic or\npessimistic, which is a limiting assumption in many situations. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose a stochastic gradient descent--based approach,\nwhere the leader's strategy is updated by differentiating through the\nfollowers' best responses. We frame the leader's optimization as a learning\nproblem against followers' equilibrium, which allows us to decouple the\nfollowers' equilibrium constraints from the leader's problem. This approach\nalso addresses cases with multiple equilibria and arbitrary equilibrium\nselection procedures by back-propagating through a sampled Nash equilibrium. To\nthis end, this paper introduces a novel concept called equilibrium flow to\nformally characterize the set of equilibrium selection processes where the\ngradient with respect to a sampled equilibrium is an unbiased estimate of the\ntrue gradient. We evaluate our approach experimentally against existing\nbaselines in three Stackelberg problems with multiple followers and find that\nin each case, our approach is able to achieve higher utility for the leader.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 23:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 23:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Recent work on decision-focused learning shows that\nembedding the optimization problem in the training pipeline can improve\ndecision quality and help generalize better to unseen tasks compared to relying\non an intermediate loss function for evaluating prediction quality. We study\nthe predict-then-optimize framework in the context of sequential decision\nproblems (formulated as MDPs) that are solved via reinforcement learning. In\nparticular, we are given environment features and a set of trajectories from\ntraining MDPs, which we use to train a predictive model that generalizes to\nunseen test MDPs without trajectories. Two significant computational challenges\narise in applying decision-focused learning to MDPs: (i) large state and action\nspaces make it infeasible for existing techniques to differentiate through MDP\nproblems, and (ii) the high-dimensional policy space, as parameterized by a\nneural network, makes differentiating through a policy expensive.

In order that the velocity\nvector remain parallel to the surface of the spherical earth, a centripetal\nforce is required to rotate the velocity without altering its magnitude. This\nforce must be radially inward and thus parallel to the local vertical. The\nassertion that ``lift balances gravity\" is only an approximation. To follow the\ncurve of the earth, the vertical component of aerodynamic lift must be\n\\emph{slightly weaker} than gravity so that the plane can be in ``orbitfall\".\n  That is, to follow the curvature of the earth, maintaining a constant\ndistance $R$ from the center of the earth while flying at a constant speed $V$\nand generating a vertical lift per unit mass $L$, the plane and all inside it\nmust fall towards the center of the earth with an acceleration, the ``orbitfall\nacceleration\", $g_{orbitfall} \\equiv g-L=V^{2} / R$ where $g$ is the usual\ngravitational acceleration constant.

Iterative closest\npoint (ICP) is a commonly used pose estimation algorithm which provides a point\nestimate of the transformation between two point clouds. There are many sources\nof uncertainty in this process that may arise due to sensor noise, ambiguous\nenvironment, and occlusion. However, for safety critical problems such as\nautonomous driving, a point estimate of the pose transformation is not\nsufficient as it does not provide information about the multiple solutions.\nCurrent probabilistic ICP methods usually do not capture all sources of\nuncertainty and may provide unreliable transformation estimates which can have\na detrimental effect in state estimation or decision making tasks that use this\ninformation. In this work we propose a new algorithm to align two point clouds\nthat can precisely estimate the uncertainty of ICP's transformation parameters.\nWe develop a Stein variational inference framework with gradient based\noptimization of ICP's cost function.

For this\nreason, SMEs may seek to protect their competitive advantage by avoiding any\nstandardization encouraged by the use of packaged software (PS). Packaged\nsoftware implementation at SMEs therefore presents challenges relating to how\nbest to respond to misfits between the functionality offered by the packaged\nsoftware and each SME's business needs. An important question relates to which\nprocesses small software enterprises - or Small to Medium-Sized Software\nDevelopment Companies (SMSSDCs) - apply in order to identify and then deal with\nthese misfits. To explore the processes of packaged software (PS)\nimplementation, an ethnographic study was conducted to gain in-depth insights\ninto the roles played by analysts in two SMSSDCs. The purpose of the study was\nto understand PS implementation in terms of requirements engineering (or\n'PSIRE'). Data collected during the ethnographic study were analyzed using an\ninductive approach. Based on our analysis of the cases we constructed a\ntheoretical model explaining the requirements engineering process for PS\nimplementation, and named it the PSIRE Parallel Star Model. The Parallel Star\nModel shows that during PSIRE, more than one RE process can be carried out at\nthe same time. The Parallel Star Model has few constraints, because not only\ncan processes be carried out in parallel, but they do not always have to be\nfollowed in a particular order. This paper therefore offers a novel\ninvestigation and explanation of RE practices for packaged software\nimplementation, approaching the phenomenon from the viewpoint of the analysts,\nand offers the first extensive study of packaged software implementation RE\n(PSIRE) in SMSSDCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 02:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In\ntradition, KD usually relies on access to the training samples and the\nparameters of the white-box teacher to acquire the transferred knowledge.\nHowever, these prerequisites are not always realistic due to storage costs or\nprivacy issues in real-world applications. Here we propose the concept of\ndecision-based black-box (DB3) knowledge distillation, with which the student\nis trained by distilling the knowledge from a black-box teacher (parameters are\nnot accessible) that only returns classes rather than softmax outputs. We start\nwith the scenario when the training set is accessible. We represent a sample's\nrobustness against other classes by computing its distances to the teacher's\ndecision boundaries and use it to construct the soft label for each training\nsample. After that, the student can be trained via standard KD. We then extend\nthis approach to a more challenging scenario in which even accessing the\ntraining data is not feasible. We propose to generate pseudo samples\ndistinguished by the teacher's decision boundaries to the largest extent and\nconstruct soft labels for them, which are used as the transfer set.

The system of fully implicit mass balance\nequations is highly nonlinear and often difficult to solve for the nonlinear\nsolver, generally Newton(-Raphson). Strong nonlinearities can cause Newton\niterations to converge very slowly. This frequently results in time step cuts,\nleading to computationally expensive simulations. Much literature has looked\ninto how to improve the nonlinear solver through enhancements or safeguarding\nupdates. In this work, we take a different approach; we aim to improve\nconvergence with a smoother finite volume discretization scheme which is more\nsuitable for the Newton solver.\n  Building on recent work, we propose a novel total velocity hybrid upwinding\nscheme with weighted average flow mobilities (WA-HU TV) that is unconditionally\nmonotone and extends to compositional multiphase simulations. Analyzing the\nsolution space of a one-cell problem, we demonstrate the improved properties of\nthe scheme and explain how it leverages the advantages of both phase potential\nupwinding and arithmetic averaging. This results in a flow subproblem that is\nsmooth with respect to changes in the sign of phase fluxes, and is well-behaved\nwhen phase velocities are large or when co-current viscous forces dominate.\nAdditionally, we propose a WA-HU scheme with a total mass (WA-HU TM)\nformulation that includes phase densities in the weighted averaging.\n  The proposed WA-HU TV consistently outperforms existing schemes, yielding\nbenefits from 5\\% to over 50\\% reduction in nonlinear iterations. The WA-HU TM\nscheme also shows promising results; in some cases leading to even more\nefficiency. However, WA-HU TM can occasionally also lead to convergence issues.\nOverall, based on the current results, we recommend the adoption of the WA-HU\nTV scheme as it is highly efficient and robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 03:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The original TASS method\nemploys the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) which is an iterative\npost-processing to reweight and stitch high dimensional probability\ndistributions in sliced windows that are obtained in the presence of\nrestraining biases. The WHAM necessitates that TASS windows lie close to each\nother for proper overlap of distributions and span the collective variable\nspace of interest. On the other hand, increase in number of TASS windows\nimplies more number of simulations, and thus it affects the efficiency of the\nmethod. To overcome this problem, we propose herein a new mean-force (MF) based\nreweighting scheme called TASS-MF, which enables accurate computation with a\nfewer number of windows devoid of the WHAM post-processing. Application of the\ntechnique is demonstrated for alanine di- and tripeptides in vacuo to compute\ntheir two- and four-dimensional free energy landscapes, the latter of which is\nformidable in conventional umbrella sampling and metadynamics.

In the\nsecond pass, i.e., contextual segmentation, we introduce multiple contextual\nsegmentation schemes. For human instance, we develop skeleton-guided\nsegmentation in a frame along with object flow to correct and refine the result\nacross frames. For non-human instance, if the instance has a wide variation in\nappearance and belongs to known categories (which can be inferred from the\ninitial mask), we adopt instance segmentation. If the non-human instance is\nnearly rigid, we train FCNs on synthesized images from the first frame of a\nvideo sequence.

By using the rate discrepancy, we follow Gozalo (1993) and show\nthat the (properly scaled) maximal difference of the two kernel estimators on a\nrandom grid of points is asymptotically chi-square-1-distributed. As a data\nexample, for a sample of 130,000 German women observed over a period of nine\nyears, we model the mortality after dementia onset, potentially dependent on\nthe disease duration. As usual, the models under both hypotheses need to be\nenlarged to allow for independent right-censoring. We find a significant effect\nof dementia duration, nearly independent of the bandwidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 06:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

To address the ambiguity, we propose a novel\ndifferentiable rendering-based approach named \\textbf{ContourRender}. During\ntraining, it first predicts a contour generated by an invertible shape\nsignature, and then optimizes the contour with the more stable silhouette by\nconverting it to a contour mesh and rendering the mesh to a 2D map.\n  This method significantly improves the quality of contour without iterations\nor cascaded refinements. Moreover, as optimization is not needed during\ninference, the inference speed will not be influenced.\n  Experiments show the proposed ContourRender outperforms all the contour-based\ninstance segmentation approaches on COCO, while stays competitive with the\niteration-based state-of-the-art on Cityscapes.

Although the effect of the\nnoise crucially determines whether a VQA works or not, the heuristic nature of\nVQAs makes it difficult to establish analytic theories. Analytic estimations of\nthe impact of the noise are urgent for searching for quantum advantages, as\nnumerical simulations of noisy quantum computers on classical computers are\nheavy and quite limited to small scale problems. In this paper, we establish\nanalytic estimations of the error in the cost function of VQAs due to the\nnoise. The estimations are applicable to any typical VQAs under the Gaussian\nnoise, which is equivalent to a class of stochastic noise models. Notably, the\ndepolarizing noise is included in this model. As a result, we obtain\nestimations of the noise level to guarantee a required precision.

The order of visiting the targets\nis often achieved by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or its\nvariants. TSP requires to define costs between the individual targets, which -\nin a map with obstacles - requires to compute mutual paths between the targets.\nThese paths, found by path planning, are used both to define the costs (e.g.,\nbased on their length or time-to-traverse) and also they define paths that are\nlater used in the final solution. To enable TSP finding a good-quality\nsolution, it is necessary to find these target-to-target paths as short as\npossible. We propose a sampling-based planner called Space-Filling Forest\n(SFF*) that solves the part of finding collision-free paths. SFF* uses multiple\ntrees (forest) constructed gradually and simultaneously from the targets and\nattempts to find connections with other trees to form the paths. Unlike\nRapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which uses the nearest-neighbor rule for\nselecting nodes for expansion, SFF* maintains an explicit list of nodes for\nexpansion. Individual trees are grown in a RRT* manner, i.e., with rewiring the\nnodes to minimize their cost. Computational results show that SFF* provides\nshorter target-to-target paths than existing approaches, and consequently, the\nfinal TSP solutions also have a lower cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 08:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

The difficulty lies in the proximity of either a bound or\nvirtual state pole to the threshold which creates an almost identical structure\nin the scattering region.

Instead,\nalthough disclinations dissociate as soon as the liquid phase appears, extended\nclusters of defects largely dominate below the solid-hexatic critical line. The\nlatter percolate in the liquid phase very close to the hexatic-liquid\ntransition, both for continuous and discontinuous transitions, in the\nhomogeneous liquid regime.

In many applications, the multirotor UAV is\nrequired to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios\nlike the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes.\nIn this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on\nidentification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks\nwith the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a\nlinear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback\nlinearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of\ndifferent controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the\nnon-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between\nperformance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for\nthe design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We\ndemonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of\nexperiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite\nsignificant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application\nof wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to\nobtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is\nbeneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based\nplanning and fault detection tasks. We obtained RMSE of $3.59 \\; cm$ when\ntracking aggressive trajectories in the presence of strong wind, which is on\npar with state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 09:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 11:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

In microgrid control systems, faults may occur in both electrical\nand communication layers. This may have severe effects on the operation of\nmicrogrids.

To address the faults and\ndisturbances simultaneously, a model predictive control (MPC) method based on\nset-membership estimation (SME) that transmits information via a communication\nnetwork is proposed.

Not all graphs are interval\ncolorable; in fact, quite few families have been proved to admit interval\ncolorings. In this paper we introduce and investigate a new notion, the\ninterval coloring thickness of a graph $G$, denoted\n${\\theta_{\\mathrm{int}}}(G)$, which is the minimum number of interval colorable\nedge-disjoint subgraphs of $G$ whose union is $G$.\n  Our investigation is motivated by scheduling problems with compactness\nrequirements, in particular, problems whose solution may consist of several\nschedules, but where each schedule must not contain any waiting periods or idle\ntimes for all involved parties. We first prove that every connected properly\n$3$-edge colorable graph with maximum degree $3$ is interval colorable, and\nusing this result, we deduce an upper bound on ${\\theta_{\\mathrm{int}}}(G)$ for\ngeneral graphs $G$. We demonstrate that this upper bound can be improved in the\ncase when $G$ is bipartite, planar or complete multipartite and consider some\napplications in timetabling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 11:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Finding clothes that fit online is very challenging and\naccounts for one of the main drivers of increased return rates in fashion\ne-commerce.

For such small datasets, test set bounds adversely affect generalisation\nperformance by withholding data from the training procedure. In this setting,\nPAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive, due to their ability to use all the\ndata to simultaneously learn a posterior and bound its generalisation risk. We\nfocus on the case of i.i.d. data with a bounded loss and consider the generic\nPAC-Bayes theorem of Germain et al. While their theorem is known to recover\nmany existing PAC-Bayes bounds, it is unclear what the tightest bound derivable\nfrom their framework is. For a fixed learning algorithm and dataset, we show\nthat the tightest possible bound coincides with a bound considered by Catoni;\nand, in the more natural case of distributions over datasets, we establish a\nlower bound on the best bound achievable in expectation. Interestingly, this\nlower bound recovers the Chernoff test set bound if the posterior is equal to\nthe prior. Moreover, to illustrate how tight these bounds can be, we study\nsynthetic one-dimensional classification tasks in which it is feasible to\nmeta-learn both the prior and the form of the bound to numerically optimise for\nthe tightest bounds possible. We find that in this simple, controlled scenario,\nPAC-Bayes bounds are competitive with comparable, commonly used Chernoff test\nset bounds.

In this paper, it is shown that all\nfree-choice nets having a home cluster are lucent. These nets have a so-called\nhome marking such that it is always possible to reach this marking again.

For $k\\geq 1$, the MWIS in $k+1$-claw free\ngraphs generalizes the weighted $k$-Set Packing Problem.

For\nthe last twenty years, Berman's algorithm SquareImp, which yields a\n$\\frac{d}{2}+\\epsilon$-approximation for the MWIS in $d$-claw free graphs, has\nremained unchallenged for both problems.

Under this scheme, only a bijective mapping is\nbuilt between nodes in two different views, which means that the\nself-supervision signals from other nodes are being neglected. Due to the\nwidely observed homophily in recommender systems, we argue that the supervisory\nsignals from other nodes are also highly likely to benefit the representation\nlearning for recommendation. To capture these signals, a general socially-aware\nSSL framework that integrates tri-training is proposed in this paper.\nTechnically, our framework first augments the user data views with the user\nsocial information. And then under the regime of tri-training for multi-view\nencoding, the framework builds three graph encoders (one for recommendation)\nupon the augmented views and iteratively improves each encoder with\nself-supervision signals from other users, generated by the other two encoders.\nSince the tri-training operates on the augmented views of the same data sources\nfor self-supervision signals, we name it self-supervised tri-training.\nExtensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets consistently validate the\neffectiveness of the self-supervised tri-training framework for improving\nrecommendation.

The implies that the\namplifier intrinsic noise sources induce random perturbations on the phase of\nthe incoming optical signal which translates into spectral broadening. To\nachieve the minimum (quantum noise limited) induced phase fluctuation, and the\ncorresponding minimum spectral broadening, an optimum phase measurement method\nis needed. We demonstrate that a measurement method based on the heterodyne\ndetection and the extended Kalman filtering approaches an optimum phase\nmeasurement in the presence of amplifier noise. A penalty of 5 dB (numerical)\nand 15 dB (experimental) compared to the quantum limited spectral broadening is\nachieved.

Our continuized framework benefits from the best of both\ncontinuous and discrete worlds: the algorithms it applies to are based on\nevent-driven updates.

This gives us context for how the different communication\ntasks can be implemented in different theories, in doing so establishing\nquantum theory intuitively as an operational theory among other theories. The\nmain property of measurements we focus on in this work is the simulation of\nmeasurements, which consists of manipulating the inputs and outputs of the\nmeasurement devices.

We argue that the restricted set of physical\nmeasurements must be closed with respect to the simulation process since the\nsimulation of physical devices must lead to other physically feasible devices.\nWe demonstrate different types of restrictions by classifying them. As a second\napplication we see how the simulation of measurements relates to compatibility\nof measurements and how it can be viewed as a generalisation of it. This allows\nus to present an operational principle previously known to quantum theory, the\nno-free-information principle, according to which any measurement that is\ncompatible with all other measurement must not provide any useful, and\ntherefore free, information about the system.

While this assumption leads to efficient algorithms, it limits\napplications to very specific classes of systems. We introduce a novel\nnonparametric adaptive algorithm that estimates an infinite-dimensional density\nover parameters online to learn an unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel\nHilbert space. Surprisingly, the resulting control input admits an analytical\nexpression that enables its implementation despite its underlying\ninfinite-dimensional structure. While this adaptive input is rich and\nexpressive - subsuming, for example, traditional linear parameterizations - its\ncomputational complexity grows linearly with time, making it comparatively more\nexpensive than its parametric counterparts. Leveraging the theory of random\nFourier features, we provide an efficient randomized implementation that\nrecovers the complexity of classical parametric methods while provably\nretaining the expressivity of the nonparametric input. In particular, our\nexplicit bounds only depend polynomially on the underlying parameters of the\nsystem, allowing our proposed algorithms to efficiently scale to\nhigh-dimensional systems.

Traditional auction mechanisms, such as GSP and VCG auctions, can be\nsuboptimal due to their fixed allocation rules to optimize a single performance\nmetric (e.g., revenue or social welfare). Recently, data-driven auctions,\nlearned directly from auction outcomes to optimize multiple performance\nmetrics, have attracted increasing research interests. However, the procedure\nof auction mechanisms involves various discrete calculation operations, making\nit challenging to be compatible with continuous optimization pipelines in\nmachine learning. In this paper, we design \\underline{D}eep \\underline{N}eural\n\\underline{A}uctions (DNAs) to enable end-to-end auction learning by proposing\na differentiable model to relax the discrete sorting operation, a key component\nin auctions. We optimize the performance metrics by developing deep models to\nefficiently extract contexts from auctions, providing rich features for auction\ndesign. We further integrate the game theoretical conditions within the model\ndesign, to guarantee the stability of the auctions.

Methods.\nWe performed a GC search specifically tailored to find new GC members within\nthe main body of this dwarf galaxy using the combined data of the VISTA\nVariables in the Via Lactea Extended Survey (VVVX) near-infrared survey and the\nGaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) optical database. Results. We applied proper\nmotion (PM) cuts to discard foreground bulge and disk stars, and we found a\nnumber of GC candidates in the main body of the Sgr dwarf galaxy.

Dynamic game\ntheory provides an expressive theoretical framework for modeling scenarios\ninvolving multiple agents with differing objectives interacting over time. A\ncore challenge when formulating a dynamic game is designing objectives for each\nagent that capture desired behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for\ninferring parametric objective models of multiple agents based on observed\ninteractions.

Thus, it is suitable for downstream trajectory forecasting\ntasks. We demonstrate our method in several simulated traffic scenarios.\nResults show that it reliably estimates player objectives from a short sequence\nof noise-corrupted partial state observations.

In\nthis paper, we propose two attacks against deep ranking systems, i.e.,\nCandidate Attack and Query Attack, that can raise or lower the rank of chosen\ncandidates by adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the expected ranking\norder is first represented as a set of inequalities, and then a triplet-like\nobjective function is designed to obtain the optimal perturbation. Conversely,\nan anti-collapse triplet defense is proposed to improve the ranking model\nrobustness against all proposed attacks, where the model learns to prevent the\npositive and negative samples being pulled close to each other by adversarial\nattack. To comprehensively measure the empirical adversarial robustness of a\nranking model with our defense, we propose an empirical robustness score, which\ninvolves a set of representative attacks against ranking models. Our\nadversarial ranking attacks and defenses are evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,\nCUB200-2011, CARS196 and Stanford Online Products datasets.

It has been a new trend to merge multi-modal information into\nknowledge graph(KG), resulting in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKG). However,\nMMKGs usually suffer from low coverage and incompleteness. To mitigate this\nproblem, a viable approach is to integrate complementary knowledge from other\nMMKGs. To this end, although existing entity alignment approaches could be\nadopted, they operate in the Euclidean space, and the resulting Euclidean\nentity representations can lead to large distortion of KG's hierarchical\nstructure. Besides, the visual information has yet not been well exploited. In\nresponse to these issues, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal entity\nalignment approach, Hyperbolic multi-modal entity alignment(HMEA), which\nextends the Euclidean representation to hyperboloid manifold. We first adopt\nthe Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCNs) to learn structural\nrepresentations of entities. Regarding the visual information, we generate\nimage embeddings using the densenet model, which are also projected into the\nhyperbolic space using HGCNs. Finally, we combine the structure and visual\nrepresentations in the hyperbolic space and use the aggregated embeddings to\npredict potential alignment results.

Profits earned due to the\nprevention of milk fever [INR 16000 (USD 218.7)] overweighs the losses from\nmilk fever [INR 4000 (USD 54.7)]; thus, prevention using AMM is better than\ncure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 14:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

With the availability\nof low-cost 2D LiDARs, there are increasing applications of such 2D LiDARs in\nindustrial environments. However, environment mapping in an unknown and\nfeature-less environment with such low-cost 2D LiDARs remains a challenge. The\nchallenge mainly originates from the short-range of LiDARs and complexities in\nperforming scan matching in these environments. In order to resolve these\nshortcomings, we propose to fuse the ultra-wideband (UWB) with 2D LiDARs to\nimprove the mapping quality of a mobile robot. The optimization-based approach\nis utilized for the fusion of UWB ranging information and odometry to first\noptimize the trajectory. Then the LiDAR-based loop closures are incorporated to\nimprove the accuracy of the trajectory estimation. Finally, the optimized\ntrajectory is combined with the LiDAR scans to produce the occupancy map of the\nenvironment. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in an indoor\nfeature-less environment with a size of 20m*20m. Obtained results show that the\nmapping error of the proposed scheme is 85.5% less than that of the\nconventional GMapping algorithm with short-range LiDAR (for example Hokuyo\nURG-04LX in our experiment with a maximum range of 5.6m).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 14:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In particular, we introduce a\ndynamic topological map that can be initialized from the rough 2-D map along\nwith a high-level planning approach for proposing reachable 2-D map patches of\nthe intermediate landmarks between the start and goal locations. To use\nproposed 2-D patches, we train a deep generative model to generate intermediate\nlandmarks in observation space which are used as subgoals by low-level\ngoal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Importantly, because the low-level\ncontroller is only trained with local behaviors (e.g. go across the\nintersection, turn left at a corner) on existing environments, this framework\nallows us to generalize to novel environments given only a rough 2-D map,\nwithout requiring further learning. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework in both seen and novel environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 14:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

There is a surge of\ninterest, both from biology and engineering, in considering natural selection\nof intellectual agents that can learn individually. Learning by individual\nagents of better behaviors for survival may accelerate the evolutionary\nprocesses by natural selection. We have accumulating pieces of evidence that\norganisms can transmit its information to the next generation via epigenetic\nstates or memes. Also, such idea is important for engineering applications. To\naccelerate the evolutionary process, an agent should change their strategy so\nthat the population fitness increases the most. Equivalently, an agent should\nupdate the strategy towards a gradient of the population fitness. However, it\nhas not yet been clarified whether and how an agent can estimate the gradient\nand accelerate the evolutionary process. We also lack methodology to quantify\nthe acceleration to understand and predict the impact of learning. In this\npaper, we address these problems. We show that an learning agent can accelerate\nthe evolutionary process by proposing ancestral learning, which uses the\ninformation transmitted from the ancestor (ancestral information). We next show\nthat the ancestral information is sufficient to estimate the gradient. In\nparticular, learning can accelerate the evolutionary process without\ncommunications between agents. Finally, to quantify the acceleration, we extend\nthe Fisher's fundamental theorem (FF-thm) for natural selection to ancestral\nlearning. Our extended FF-thm relates the acceleration of the evolutionary\nprocess to the variety of individual fitness of the agent. By the theorem, we\ncan quantitatively understand when and why learning is beneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 14:45:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 03:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

To apply this method, we consider a system of spin-1 BEC\nunder three-dimensional isotropic and effective one-dimensional harmonic\nconfinement in the absence (negligible presence) of the magnetic field which\nhas ground state candidates of comparable energy. It should be noted that in\nsuch circumstances kinetic energy contribution to the ground state cannot be\nneglected which puts the applicability of Thomas-Fermi approximation to\nquestion. For anti-ferromagnetic condensates, the T-F approximated energy\ndifference between the competing stationary states (ground state and the first\nexcited state) is approximately 0.3\\%. As T-F approximation is only good for\ncondensates with a large number of particles, T-F approximated predictions can\ncompletely go wrong especially for small condensates. This is where comes the\nrole of a detailed analysis using our variational method, which incorporates\nthe kinetic energy contribution and accurately estimates the number- and\nenergy-density profile even for condensates having a small number of particles.\nResults of our analytical method are supported by numerical simulation. This\nvariational method is general and can be extended to other\nsimilar/higher-dimensional problems to get results beyond the accuracy of the\nThomas-Fermi approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 15:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 14:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 04:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

They are important for the studies of CE evolution, binary evolution,\nand binary population synthesis. However, the relation between WD mass and\norbital period of sdB + He WD binaries has not been specifically studied. In\nthis paper, we first use a semi-analytic method to follow their formation and\nfind a WD mass and orbital period relation.

These\nquantities are not measured directly but are estimated by the original\nequipment manufacturers' (OEM) proprietary algorithms and have inherent\nlimitations since particle scattering depends on their composition, size,\nshape, and complex index of refraction (CRI). Hence, there is a need to\ncharacterize and calibrate their performance under a controlled environment. We\npresent calibration algorithms for Plantower PMS A003 sensor as a function of\nparticle size and concentration. A standardized experimental protocol was used\nto control the PM level, environmental conditions and to evaluate\nsensor-to-sensor reproducibility. The calibration was based on tests when PMS\nA003 were exposed to different polydisperse standardized testing aerosols. The\nresults suggested particle size distribution from PMS A003 was shifted compared\nto reference instrument measures. For calibration of number concentration,\nlinear model without adjusting aerosol properties corrects the raw PMS A003\nmeasurement for specific size bins with normalized mean absolute error within\n4.0% of the reference instrument. Although the Bayesian Information Criterion\nsuggests that models adjusting for particle optical properties and relative\nhumidity are technically superior, they should be used with caution as the\nparticle properties used in fitting were within a narrow range for challenge\naerosols. The calibration models adjusted for particle CRI and density account\nfor non-linearity in the OEM's mass concentrations estimates and demonstrated\nlower error. These results have significant implications for using PMS A003 in\nhigh concentration environments, including indoor air quality and\noccupational/industrial exposure assessments, wildfire smoke, or near-source\nmonitoring scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 18:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

However,\nexisting methods can generate responses with only one controllable attribute or\nlack a flexible way to generate them with multiple controllable attributes. In\nthis paper, we propose a Progressively trained Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder\n(PHED) to tackle this task. More specifically, PHED deploys Conditional\nVariational AutoEncoder (CVAE) on Transformer to include one aspect of\nattributes at one stage. A vital characteristic of the CVAE is to separate the\nlatent variables at each stage into two types: a global variable capturing the\ncommon semantic features and a specific variable absorbing the attribute\ninformation at that stage. PHED then couples the CVAE latent variables with the\nTransformer encoder and is trained by minimizing a newly derived ELBO and\ncontrolled losses to produce the next stage's input and produce responses as\nrequired. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations to show that PHED\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art neural generation models and\nproduces more diverse responses as expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 08:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}
