Our analysis uses momentum operators to describe the spatial\nevolution of quantised modes along a TWPA.

However, wide-field surveys have the potential\nto also identify rapidly fading transients independently of such external\ntriggers. The volumetric survey speed of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)\nmakes it sensitive to faint and fast-fading objects as kilonovae, the optical\ncounterparts to binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole mergers, out\nto almost 200Mpc. We introduce an open-source software infrastructure, the ZTF\nREaltime Search and Triggering, ZTFReST, designed to identify kilonovae and\nfast optical transients in ZTF data. Using the ZTF alert stream combined with\nforced photometry, we have implemented automated candidate ranking based on\ntheir photometric evolution and fitting to kilonova models. Automated\ntriggering of follow-up systems, such as Las Cumbres Observatory, has also been\nimplemented. In 13 months of science validation, we found several extragalactic\nfast transients independent of any external trigger (though some counterparts\nwere identified later), including at least one supernova with post-shock\ncooling emission, two known afterglows with an associated gamma-ray burst, two\nknown afterglows without any known gamma-ray counterpart, and three new\nfast-declining sources (ZTF20abtxwfx, ZTF20acozryr, and ZTF21aagwbjr) that are\nlikely associated with GRB200817A, GRB201103B, and GRB210204A.

In particular, we will demonstrate that pseudo-gauge fields can\nprovide a unified understanding of a variety of physical phenomena, including\nchiral zero modes inside a magnetic vortex core of magnetic Weyl semimetals, a\ngiant current response at magnetic resonance in magnetic topological\ninsulators, and piezo-electromagnetic response in time-reversal invariant\nsystems.

This study therefore addresses the stability of a liquid-gas interface\nwith surface tension, subject to a diverging flow in the gas phase, where the\nliquid and the gas phase are both represented as potential fluids. We perform a\nKelvin-Helmholtz-type linear modal stability analysis of the surface to obtain\nan amplitude equation that is subsequently analysed in detail and applied to\ntwo cases of interest for impact problems, namely, the parallel impact of a\nwave onto a vertical wall, and the impact of a horizontal plate onto a liquid\nsurface.

Such programs\nconsist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter\nvalues. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program\nshould be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful\nmanipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design\nhigher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of\ncommands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring\nsuch macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely\nrestricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm\nfor automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of\n3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an\nimperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that\nmake programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free\nparameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on\nmultiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D\nshape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of\nmacros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that\ngeneralize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros\nfound by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape\ngenerative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we\nconduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD's discovered macros make\ninteractive shape editing more efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 17:54:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 20:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 21:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

The granule is modelled as a spherical free boundary domain\nwith radial symmetry. The equation which governs the free boundary is derived\nfrom global mass balance considerations and takes into account the growth of\nsessile biomass and the exchange fluxes with the bulk liquid. Starting from a\nvanishing initial value, the expansion of the free boundary is initiated by the\nattachment process, which depends on the microbial species concentrations\nwithin the bulk liquid and their specific attachment velocity. Nonlinear\nhyperbolic PDEs model the growth of the sessile microbial species, while\nquasi-linear parabolic PDEs govern the dynamics of substrates and invading\nspecies within the granular biofilm. Nonlinear ODEs govern the evolution of\nsoluble substrates and planktonic biomass within the bulk liquid. The model is\napplied to an anaerobic granular-based system and solved numerically to test\nits qualitative behaviour and explore the main aspects of de novo anaerobic\ngranulation: ecology, biomass distribution, relative abundance, dimensional\nevolution of the granules and soluble substrates and planktonic biomass\ndynamics within the reactor. The numerical results confirm that the model\naccurately describes the ecology and the concentrically-layered structure of\nanaerobic granules observed experimentally, and is able to predict the effects\nof some significant factors, such as influent wastewater composition,\ngranulation properties of planktonic biomass, biomass density and hydrodynamic\nand shear stress conditions, on the process performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 18:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

There is a\nconsensus that matter flowing through the disk is channelled onto the stellar\nsurface by the stellar magnetic field. This is thought to be strong enough to\ntruncate the disk close to the so-called corotation radius where the disk\nrotates at the same rate as the star. Spectro-interferometric studies in young\nstellar objects show that Hydrogen is mostly emitted in a region of a few\nmilliarcseconds across, usually located within the dust sublimation radius. Its\norigin is still a matter of debate and it can be interpreted as coming from the\nstellar magnetosphere, a rotating wind or a disk. In the case of\nintermediate-mass Herbig AeBe stars, the fact that the Br gamma emission is\nspatially resolved rules out that most of the emission comes from the\nmagnetosphere. This is due to the weak magnetic fields (some tenths of G)\ndetected in these sources, resulting in very compact magnetospheres. In the\ncase of T Tauri sources, their larger magnetospheres should make them easier to\nresolve. However, the small angular size of the magnetosphere (a few tenths of\nmilliarcseconds), along with the presence of winds emitting in Hydrogen make\nthe observations interpretation challenging. Here, we present direct evidence\nof magnetospheric accretion by spatially resolving the inner disk of the 60 pc\nT Tauri star TW Hydrae through optical long baseline interferometry. We find\nthat the hydrogen near-infrared emission comes from a region approximately 3.5\nstellar radii (R*) across. This region is within the continuum dusty disk\nemitting region (Rcont = 7 R*) and smaller than the corotation radius which is\ntwice as big. This indicates that the hydrogen emission originates at the\naccretion columns, as expected in magnetospheric accretion models, rather than\nin a wind emitted at much larger distance (>1au).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 18:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In contrast, abiotic oxygen\naccumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less likely,\nprovided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The\ncomparative robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has\nmotivated plans for next-generation telescopes capable of oxygen detection on\nplanets around sun-like stars. However, the general tendency of terrestrial\nplanets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial\nconditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a\ncoupled thermal-geochemical-climate model of terrestrial planet evolution to\nillustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic oxygen can accumulate\naround sun-like stars, even when significant non-condensable gas inventories\nare present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to\nmodern levels if (1) the CO$_2$:H$_2$O ratio of the initial volatile inventory\nis high, (2) the initial water inventory exceeds ~50 Earth oceans, or (3) the\ninitial water inventory is very low. Fortunately, these three abiotic oxygen\nscenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of\nother atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This\nhighlights the need for broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are\nequipped to constrain surface water inventories via time-resolved photometry\nand search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium biosignatures to assess\nwhether oxygen is biogenic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 19:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Moreover, academic research on\ninterdependency between cyber and physical layers of the grid indicate that\npower failure during a cascade may lead to outages in communication networks,\nwhich progressively reduce the observable areas. These challenge the current\nliterature on line outage detection, which assumes that the grid remains as a\nsingle connected component. We propose a new approach to eliminate that\nassumption. Following an islanding event, first the buses forming that\nconnected components are identified and then further line outages within the\nindividual islands are detected. In addition to the power system measurements,\nobservable breaker statuses are integrated as constraints in our topology\nidentification algorithm. The impact of error propagation on the estimation\nprocess as reliance on previous estimates keeps growing during cascade is also\nstudied.

This effect is analysed in a steadily\npropagating rupture model that includes frictional weakening, slip-dependent\nfault dilation and fluid flow. Dilatancy is shown to increase the stress\nintensity factor required to propagate the rupture tip. With increasing rupture\nspeed, an undrained (strengthened) region develops near the tip and extends\nbeyond the frictionally weakened zone. Away from the undrained region, pore\nfluid diffusion gradually recharges the fault and strength returns to the\ndrained, weakened value. For sufficiently large rupture dimensions, the\ndilation-induced strength increase near the tip is equivalent to an increase in\ntoughness that is proportional to the square root of the rupture speed. In\ngeneral, dilation has the effect of increasing the stress required for rupture\ngrowth by decreasing the stress drop along the crack. Thermal pressurisation\nhas the potential to compensate for the dilatant strengthening effect, at the\nexpense of an increased heating rate, which might lead to premature frictional\nmelting.

While the problem\nof single-target domain adaptation (STDA) for object detection has recently\nreceived much attention, multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) remains largely\nunexplored, despite its practical relevance in several real-world applications,\nsuch as multi-camera video surveillance. Compared to the STDA problem that may\ninvolve large domain shifts between complex source and target distributions,\nMTDA faces additional challenges, most notably the computational requirements\nand catastrophic forgetting of previously-learned targets, which can depend on\nthe order of target adaptations. STDA for detection can be applied to MTDA by\nadapting one model per target, or one common model with a mixture of data from\ntarget domains. However, these approaches are either costly or inaccurate. The\nonly state-of-art MTDA method specialized for detection learns targets\nincrementally, one target at a time, and mitigates the loss of knowledge by\nusing a duplicated detection model for knowledge distillation, which is\ncomputationally expensive and does not scale well to many domains.

Despite\nrecent advances, occlusions continue to corrupt the features extracted by\nstate-of-art CNN backbones, and thereby deteriorate the accuracy of ReID\nsystems. To address this issue, methods in the literature use an additional\ncostly process such as pose estimation, where pose maps provide supervision to\nexclude occluded regions. In contrast, we introduce a novel Holistic Guidance\n(HG) method that relies only on person identity labels, and on the distribution\nof pairwise matching distances of datasets to alleviate the problem of\nocclusion, without requiring additional supervision. Hence, our proposed\nstudent-teacher framework is trained to address the occlusion problem by\nmatching the distributions of between- and within-class distances (DCDs) of\noccluded samples with that of holistic (non-occluded) samples, thereby using\nthe latter as a soft labeled reference to learn well separated DCDs. This\napproach is supported by our empirical study where the distribution of between-\nand within-class distances between images have more overlap in occluded than\nholistic datasets. In particular, features extracted from both datasets are\njointly learned using the student model to produce an attention map that allows\nseparating visible regions from occluded ones. In addition to this, a joint\ngenerative-discriminative backbone is trained with a denoising autoencoder,\nallowing the system to self-recover from occlusions. Extensive experiments on\nseveral challenging public datasets indicate that the proposed approach can\noutperform state-of-the-art methods on both occluded and holistic datasets\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 21:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

The theory was developed for a general, non-uniform intra-cluster\ninteractions, but in the present paper the results presented correspond to\nuniform, anti-ferromagnetic (AF) intra-clusters interactions $J_{0}/J$. The\nclusters are represented by nodes on a finite connectivity random graph, and\nthe inter-cluster interactions are random Gaussian distributed. The graph\nrealizations are treated in replica theory using the formalism of order\nparameter functions, which allows to calculate the distribution of local fields\nand, as a consequence, the relevant observable.

To\nmotivate and validate these changes, we use a recent database of convective\nflicker measurements in Kepler stars, which allows us to more fully detail the\nremaining model--prediction error. Our model improvements reduce the typical\nmisprediction of flicker amplitude from a factor of 2.5 to 2. We rule out\nrotation period and strong magnetic activity as possible explanations for the\nremaining model error, and we show that binary companions may affect convective\nflicker. We also introduce an \"envelope\" model which predicts a range of\nflicker amplitudes for any one star to account for some of the spread in\nnumerical simulations, and we find that this range covers 78% of observed\nstars. We note that the solar granular flicker amplitude is lower than most\nSun-like stars. This improved model of convective flicker amplitude can better\ncharacterize this source of noise in exoplanet studies as well as better inform\nmodels and simulations of stellar granulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 22:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The presence of long-range interactions can be safely assumed for the\npristine and irradiated cases of MST examined in this work. Further analysis on\nthe effective spatial dimensionality reveal that MST remains at d = 3 under\nproton irradiation transitioning from an n = 1 spin dimensionality to n = 2 and\nn=3 for 1 x 10^15 and 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2, indicating an XY interaction and a\nHeisenberg interaction, respectively. The pair (spin-spin) correlation function\nreveals an increase in magnetic correlations at the proton irradiance of 5 x\n10^15 H+/cm^2. In conjunction, the maximum change in magnetic entropy obtained\nfrom isothermal magnetization at 3 T is the largest for 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2 with\na value of 2.45 J/kgK at T = 73.66 K, in comparison to 1.60 J/kgK for pristine\nMST at T = 73 K.

After a given number $n$ of transmissions, the student outputs an estimate\nof the unknown bit, and we are interested in the exponential decay rate of the\nerror probability as $n$ increases. We propose a novel block-structured\nteaching strategy in which the teacher encodes the number of 1s received in\neach block, and show that the resulting error exponent is the binary relative\nentropy $D\\big(\\frac{1}{2}\\|\\max(p,q)\\big)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the noise\nparameters.

However, recent\nstudies show that LDP is generally vulnerable to malicious data providers in\nnature. Because a data collector has to estimate background data distribution\nonly from already randomized data, malicious data providers can manipulate\ntheir output before sending, i.e., randomization would provide them plausible\ndeniability. Attackers can skew the estimations effectively since they are\ncalculated by normalizing with randomization probability defined in the LDP\nprotocol, and can even control the estimations. In this paper, we show how we\nprevent malicious attackers from compromising LDP protocol. Our approach is to\nutilize a verifiable randomization mechanism. The data collector can verify the\ncompleteness of executing an agreed randomization mechanism for every data\nprovider. Our proposed method completely protects the LDP protocol from\noutput-manipulations, and significantly mitigates the expected damage from\nattacks.

The VFZO\nframework offers an advantage over other five degree-of-freedom based property\ninterpolation methods because it is constructed as a point set in a manifold.\nThis means that directly computed Euclidean distances approximate the original\noctonion distance with significantly reduced computation runtime (~7 CPU\nminutes vs. 153 CPU days for a 50000x50000 pairwise-distance matrix). This\nincreased efficiency facilitates lower interpolation error through the use of\nsignificantly more input data. We demonstrate grain boundary energy\ninterpolation results for a non-smooth validation function and simulated\nbi-crystal datasets for Fe and Ni using four interpolation methods: barycentric\ninterpolation, Gaussian process regression (GPR), inverse-distance weighting,\nand nearest-neighbor interpolation. These are evaluated for 50000 random input\nGBs and 10 000 random prediction GBs. The best performance was achieved with\nGPR, which resulted in a reduction of the root mean square error (RMSE) by\n83.0% relative to RMSE of a constant, average model.

Now, linear regression models are commonly used to analyze\nobservational data and estimate causal effects. How do linear regression\nadjustments in observational studies emulate key features of randomized\nexperiments, such as covariate balance, self-weighted sampling, and study\nrepresentativeness? In this paper, we provide answers to this and related\nquestions by analyzing the implied (individual-level data) weights of linear\nregression methods. We derive new closed-form expressions of the weights and\nexamine their properties in both finite and asymptotic regimes. We show that\nthe implied weights of general regression problems can be equivalently obtained\nby solving a convex optimization problem. Among others, we study doubly and\nmultiply robust properties of regression estimators from the perspective of\ntheir implied weights. This equivalence allows us to bridge ideas from the\nregression modeling and causal inference literatures. As a result, we propose\nnovel regression diagnostics for causal inference that are part of the design\nstage of an observational study. As special cases, we analyze the implied\nweights in common settings such as multi-valued treatments and regression\nadjustment after matching. We implement the weights and diagnostics in the new\nlmw package for R.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 01:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 15:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 13:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

A face presentation attack detection model with good\ngeneralization can be obtained when it is trained with face images from\ndifferent input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality,\ntraining data (both real face images and spoof images) are not directly shared\nbetween data owners due to legal and privacy issues. In this paper, with the\nmotivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose a Federated Face\nPresentation Attack Detection (FedPAD) framework that simultaneously takes\nadvantage of rich fPAD information available at different data owners while\npreserving data privacy. In the proposed framework, each data center locally\ntrains its own fPAD model. A server learns a global fPAD model by iteratively\naggregating model updates from all data centers without accessing private data\nin each of them. To equip the aggregated fPAD model in the server with better\ngeneralization ability to unseen attacks from users, following the basic idea\nof FedPAD, we further propose a Federated Generalized Face Presentation Attack\nDetection (FedGPAD) framework. A federated domain disentanglement strategy is\nintroduced in FedGPAD, which treats each data center as one domain and\ndecomposes the fPAD model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts in\neach data center. Two parts disentangle the domain-invariant and\ndomain-specific features from images in each local data center, respectively. A\nserver learns a global fPAD model by only aggregating domain-invariant parts of\nthe fPAD models from data centers and thus a more generalized fPAD model can be\naggregated in server.

With this\npublication we release the new X-CLASS catalogue of 1646 well-selected\nX-ray-detected clusters over a wide sky area, along with their selection\nfunction. The sample spans a wide redshift range, from the local Universe up to\nz~1.5, with 982 spectroscopically confirmed clusters, and over 70 clusters\nabove z=0.8. Because of its homogeneous selection and thorough verification,\nthe cluster sample can be used for cosmological analyses, but also as a\ntest-bed for the upcoming eROSITA observations and other current and future\nlarge-area cluster surveys. It is the first time that such a catalogue is made\navailable to the community via an interactive database which gives access to a\nwealth of supplementary information, images, and data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 04:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 16:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Modeling forces in robot feet is particularly challenging due to\nstatic indeterminacy, thereby requiring direct sensing. Unfortunately,\nresolving forces in the feet of some smaller-sized humanoids is limited both by\nthe quality of sensors and the current algorithms used to interpret the data.\nThis paper presents light-weight, low-cost and open-source force-sensing shoes\nto improve force measurement for popular smaller-sized humanoid robots, and a\nmethod for calibrating the shoes. The shoes measure center of pressure (CoP)\nand normal ground reaction force (GRF). The calibration method enables each\nindividual shoe to reach high measurement precision by applying known forces at\ndifferent locations of the shoe and using a regularized least squares\noptimization to interpret sensor outputs. A NAO robot is used as our\nexperimental platform. Experiments are conducted to compare the measurement\nperformance between the shoes and the robot's factory-installed force-sensing\nresistors (FSRs), and to evaluate the calibration method over these two sensing\nmodules. Experimental results show that the shoes significantly improve CoP and\nGRF measurement precision compared to the robot's built-in FSRs. Moreover, the\ndeveloped calibration method improves the measurement performance for both our\nshoes and the built-in FSRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 04:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

To achieve optimum computation performance in a dynamic MEC\nenvironment, mobile devices often need to make online decisions on whether to\noffload the computation tasks to nearby edge terminals under the uncertainty of\nfuture system information (e.g., random wireless channel gain and task\narrivals). The design of an efficient online offloading algorithm is\nchallenging. On one hand, the fast-varying edge environment requires frequently\nsolving a hard combinatorial optimization problem where the integer offloading\ndecision and continuous resource allocation variables are strongly coupled. On\nthe other hand, the uncertainty of future system states makes it hard for the\nonline decisions to satisfy long-term system constraints.

By\nutilizing scalar auxiliary variables, the original PDE problems are\nreformulated into equivalent PDE problems. The advantages of the SAV approach,\nsuch as linearity, unconditionally energy stability, and easy-to-implement, are\nprevalent. However, there is still an open issue unresolved, i.e., the\nnumerical schemes resulted from the SAV method preserve a \"modified\" energy law\naccording to the auxiliary variables instead of the original variables.\nTruncation errors are introduced during numerical calculations so that the\nnumerical solutions of the auxiliary variables are no longer equivalent to\ntheir original continuous definitions. In other words, even though the SAV\nscheme satisfies a modified energy law, it does not necessarily satisfy the\nenergy law of the original PDE models. This paper presents one essential\nrelaxation technique to overcome this issue, which we named the relaxed-SAV\n(RSAV) method. Our RSAV method penalizes the numerical errors of the auxiliary\nvariables by a relaxation technique. In general, the RSAV method keeps all the\nadvantages of the baseline SAV method and improves its accuracy and consistency\nnoticeably. Several examples have been presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the RSAV approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 04:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Our study perspective is born from\nthe method of Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) that has been developed in the\nlast years to analyze time series avoiding the tedium and the high\ncomputational cost that other methods offer. Here we build a complex network\nbased on directed HVG technique applied to magnetic field fluctuations time\nseries obtained from Particle In Cell (PIC) simulations of a magnetized\ncollisionless plasma to distinguish the degree distributions and calculate the\nKullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) as a measure of relative entropy of data sets\nproduced by processes that are not in equilibrium. First, we analyze the\nconnectivity probability distribution for the undirected version of HVG finding\nhow the Kappa distribution for low values of $\\kappa$ tends to be an\nuncorrelated time series, while the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution shows a\ncorrelated stochastic processes behavior. Then, we investigate the degree of\ntemporary irreversibility of magnetic fluctuations self-generated by the\nplasma, comparing the case of a thermal plasma (described by a Maxwell-Botzmann\nvelocity distribution function) with non-thermal Kappa distributions. We have\nshown that the KLD associated to the HVG is able to distinguish the level of\nreversibility associated to the thermal equilibrium in the plasma because the\ndissipative degree of the system increases as the value of $\\kappa$ parameter\ndecreases and the distribution function departs from the Maxwell-Boltzmann\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 05:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

An alternative scenario is that the bulk of the slow wind\n(excluding that in the immediate vicinity of the heliospheric current sheet)\noriginates from rapidly diverging flux tubes rooted inside small coronal holes\nor just within the boundaries of large holes. This viewpoint is based largely\non photospheric field extrapolations, which are subject to considerable\nuncertainties and do not include dynamical effects, making it difficult to be\ncertain whether a source is located just inside or outside a hole boundary, or\nwhether a high-latitude hole will be connected to Earth. To minimize the\ndependence on field-line extrapolations, we have searched for cases where\nequatorial coronal holes at central meridian are followed by low-speed streams\nat Earth. We describe 14 examples from the period 2014--2017, involving Fe XIV\n21.1 nm coronal holes located near active regions and having equatorial widths\nof $\\sim$3$^\\circ$--10$^\\circ$.

However, there exist doubts about whether these intuitive\nvisualizations are related to the network decisions. Recent studies have\nconfirmed this suspicion by verifying that almost all these modified\nback-propagation visualizations are not faithful to the model's decision-making\nprocess. Besides, these visualizations produce vague \"relative importance\nscores\", among which low values can't guarantee to be independent of the final\nprediction. Hence, it's highly desirable to develop a novel back-propagation\nframework that guarantees theoretical faithfulness and produces a quantitative\nattribution score with a clear understanding. To achieve the goal, we resort to\nmutual information theory to generate the interpretations, studying how much\ninformation of output is encoded in each input neuron. The basic idea is to\nlearn a source signal by back-propagation such that the mutual information\nbetween input and output should be as much as possible preserved in the mutual\ninformation between input and the source signal. In addition, we propose a\nMutual Information Preserving Inverse Network, termed MIP-IN, in which the\nparameters of each layer are recursively trained to learn how to invert. During\nthe inversion, forward Relu operation is adopted to adapt the general\ninterpretations to the specific input. We then empirically demonstrate that the\ninverted source signal satisfies completeness and minimality property, which\nare crucial for a faithful interpretation. Furthermore, the empirical study\nvalidates the effectiveness of interpretations generated by MIP-IN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 05:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Towards\nthis end, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) for\nimproving video inpainting with exceptional efficiency. Our proposed DSTT\ndisentangles the task of learning spatial-temporal attention into 2 sub-tasks:\none is for attending temporal object movements on different frames at same\nspatial locations, which is achieved by temporally-decoupled Transformer block,\nand the other is for attending similar background textures on same frame of all\nspatial positions, which is achieved by spatially-decoupled Transformer block.\nThe interweaving stack of such two blocks makes our proposed model attend\nbackground textures and moving objects more precisely, and thus the attended\nplausible and temporally-coherent appearance can be propagated to fill the\nholes. In addition, a hierarchical encoder is adopted before the stack of\nTransformer blocks, for learning robust and hierarchical features that maintain\nmulti-level local spatial structure, resulting in the more representative token\nvectors.

For that, we use\non-line five data resources: (1) past flu patients, (2) SNS (Twitter), (3)\nsearch engines (Yahoo! Japan), (4) shopping services (Yahoo! Shopping), and (5)\nQ&A services (Yahoo!

Suppliers can integrate these externalities in their pricing\nstrategies to increase their revenue. Besides optimizing the prize, suppliers\nalso have to consider their production and maintenance costs. Predictive\nmaintenance has the potential to reduce the maintenance costs and improve the\nsystem availability. To address the joint optimization of pricing with network\nexternalities and predictive maintenance scheduling based on the condition of\nthe system, we propose a bi-level optimization solution based on game theory.\nIn the first level, the manufacturing company decides about the predictive\nmaintenance scheduling of the units and the price of the goods. In the second\nlevel, the customers decide about their consumption using an optimization\napproach in which the objective function depends on their consumption, the\nconsumption levels of other customers who are connected through the graph, and\nthe price of the network which is determined by the supplier. To solve the\nproblem, we propose the leader-multiple-followers game where the supplier as a\nleader predicts the strategies of the followers. Then, customers as the\nfollowers obtain their strategies based on the leader's and other followers'\nstrategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a\nsimulated case study. The results demonstrate that knowledge of the social\nnetwork graph results in an increased revenue compared to the case when the\nunderlying social network graph is not known. Moreover, the results demonstrate\nthat obtaining the predictive maintenance scheduling based on the proposed\noptimization approach leads to an increased profit compared to the baseline\ndecision-making (perform maintenance at the degradation limit).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Despite the simplicity,\nwe show that modeling structures and their dynamics in the discrete semantic\nstructure space with a stochastic recurrent estimator leads to surprisingly\nsuccessful long-term prediction. We evaluate our method on three challenging\ndatasets involving car driving and human dancing, and demonstrate that it can\ngenerate complicated scene structures and motions over a very long time horizon\n(i.e., thousands frames), setting a new standard of video prediction with\norders of magnitude longer prediction time than existing approaches.

This task becomes even more complicated when the\noptimal parameter values change significantly during the run of the algorithm\nsince then a dynamic parameter choice (parameter control) is necessary.\n  In this work, we propose a lazy but effective solution, namely choosing all\nparameter values (where this makes sense) in each iteration randomly from a\nsuitably scaled power-law distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis approach, we perform runtime analyses of the $(1+(\\lambda,\\lambda))$\ngenetic algorithm with all three parameters chosen in this manner. We show that\nthis algorithm on the one hand can imitate simple hill-climbers like the\n$(1+1)$ EA, giving the same asymptotic runtime on problems like OneMax,\nLeadingOnes, or Minimum Spanning Tree. On the other hand, this algorithm is\nalso very efficient on jump functions, where the best static parameters are\nvery different from those necessary to optimize simple problems. We prove a\nperformance guarantee that is comparable to the best performance known for\nstatic parameters.

For x = 0.20, the size of the\nsegregated CuO phase is optimum for facilitating the catalytic reaction.

Existing deep learning based methods\nhave made remarkable progress in NIR-VIS face recognition, while it encounters\ncertain newly-emerged difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19, since\npeople are supposed to wear facial masks to cut off the spread of the virus. We\ndefine this task as NIR-VIS masked face recognition, and find it problematic\nwith the masked face in the NIR probe image. First, the lack of masked face\ndata is a challenging issue for the network training. Second, most of the\nfacial parts (cheeks, mouth, nose etc.) are fully occluded by the mask, which\nleads to a large amount of loss of information. Third, the domain gap still\nexists in the remaining facial parts. In such scenario, the existing methods\nsuffer from significant performance degradation caused by the above issues.

In the numerical example of a large-scale event, the\n2009 Hsiaolin event, the results computed by two distinct NVIDIA GPU cards\n(RTX-2080-Ti and Tesla-V100) are found to be identical but only tiny deviation\nis figured out in comparison with the results computed by the conventional\nsingle-core CPU-code. It is speculated to be caused by the different structures\nin the source codes and some float/double operations. In addition to the\nillustration in the GIS system, the computed results by MoSES\\_2PDF can also be\nshown with animated 3D graphics in the ANSI-Platform, where the user can\ninteract with 3D scenes. The feasibility, features, and facilities of\nMoSES\\_2PDF are demonstrated with respect to the two numerical examples\nconcerning two real events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 11:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Typically, the multi-dimensional\nstructure of the received signal in co-array domain is ignored in the problem\nconsidered. Moreover, the cross term generated by the correlated signal and\nnoise components degrades the 2-D DOA estimation performance seriously. To\ntackle these issues, an iterative 2-D DOA estimation approach based on tensor\nmodeling is proposed. To develop such approach, a higher-order tensor is\nconstructed, whose factor matrices contain the sources azimuth and elevation\ninformation. By exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a\ncomputationally efficient tensor decomposition method is then developed to\nestimate the sources DOA information in each dimension independently. The\npair-matching of the azimuth and elevation angles is conducted via the\ncross-correlation matrix (CCM) of the received signals. An iterative method is\nfurther designed to improve the DOA estimation performance.

The purpose of this paper\nis to investigate the spectral formation in the neutron star atmosphere at low\n$\\dot{M}$ and to conduct a parameter study of physical properties of the\nemitting region. We obtain the structure of the static atmosphere, assuming\nthat Coulomb collisions are the dominant deceleration process. The upper part\nof the atmosphere is strongly heated by the braking plasma, reaching\ntemperatures of 30-40 keV, while its denser isothermal interior is much cooler\n(~2 keV). We numerically solve the polarized radiative transfer in the\natmosphere with magnetic Compton scattering, free-free processes, and\nnon-thermal cyclotron emission due to possible collisional excitations of\nelectrons. The strongly polarized emitted spectrum has a double-hump shape that\nis observed in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars. A low-energy \"thermal\" component\nis dominated by extraordinary photons that can leave the atmosphere from deeper\nlayers due to their long mean free path at soft energies.

The geometric cross-section of these aggregates\nis a crucial parameter characterizing aerodynamical friction, collision rates,\nand opacities. However, numerical measurements of the cross-section are often\ntime-consuming as aggregates exhibit complex shapes. In this study, we derive a\nnovel analytic expression for geometric cross-sections of fractal aggregates.\nIf an aggregate consists of $N$ monomers of radius $R_0$, its geometric\ncross-section $G$ is expressed as \\begin{equation} \\frac{G}{N\\pi\nR_0^2}=\\frac{A}{1+(N-1)\\tilde{\\sigma}}, \\nonumber\n  \\end{equation} where $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is an overlapping efficiency, and $A$\nis a numerical factor connecting the analytic expression to the small\nnon-fractal cluster limit. The overlapping efficiency depends on the fractal\ndimension, fractal prefactor, and $N$ of the aggregate, and its analytic\nexpression is derived as well. The analytic expressions successfully reproduce\nnumerically measured cross-sections of aggregates. We also find that our\nexpressions are compatible with the mean-field light scattering theory of\naggregates in the geometrical optics limit. The analytic expressions greatly\nsimplify an otherwise tedious calculation and will be useful in model\ncalculations of fractal grain growth in protoplanetary discs and planetary\natmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 12:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Both models predict\nmultiple time steps into the future, but handle the time-dependent uncertainty\nestimation differently. We present a sampling technique in order to aggregate\nquantile estimates for link level travel time to yield the multi-link travel\ntime distribution needed for a vehicle to travel from its current position to a\nspecific downstream stop point or transfer site.\n  To motivate the relevance of uncertainty-aware models in the domain, we focus\non the connection assurance application as a case study: An expert system to\ndetermine whether a bus driver should hold and wait for a connecting service,\nor break the connection and reduce its own delay. Our results show that the\nDQR-model performs overall best for the 80%, 90% and 95% prediction intervals,\nboth for a 15 minute time horizon into the future (t + 1), but also for the 30\nand 45 minutes time horizon (t + 2 and t + 3), with a constant, but very small\nunderestimation of the uncertainty interval (1-4 pp.).

In\nthe Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson is closely linked to\nthe mechanism that gives mass to the W and Z gauge bosons that mediate the weak\ninteractions and to the charged fermions. Following discovery of the Higgs\nboson, present measurements at the Large Hadron Collider are focused on testing\nthe Higgs boson's couplings to other elementary particles, precision\nmeasurements of the Higgs boson's properties and initial investigation of the\nHiggs boson's self-interaction and shape of the Higgs potential. With the Higgs\nboson mass of 125 GeV the vacuum sits very close to the border of stable and\nmetastable, which may be a hint to deeper physics beyond the Standard Model.\nThe Higgs potential also plays an important role in ideas about the\ncosmological constant or dark energy that drives the accelerating expansion of\nthe Universe, the mysterious dark matter that comprises about 80% of the matter\ncomponent in the Universe, as well as a possible phase transition in the early\nUniverse that might be responsible for baryogenesis. Detailed study of the\nHiggs boson is at the centre of the recent European Strategy for Particle\nPhysics update.

In this scheme, model updates are encrypted via an aggregated\npublic key before sharing with a server for aggregation. For decryption,\ncollaboration between all participating devices is required. This scheme\nprevents privacy leakage from publicly shared information in federated\nlearning, and is robust to collusion between $k<N-1$ participating devices and\nthe server.

However, state-of-the-art accuracy often comes\nat a high computational price, requiring hardware acceleration to achieve\nreal-time performance, while use cases, such as smart cities, require images\nfrom fixed cameras to be analyzed in real-time. Due to the amount of network\nbandwidth these streams would generate, we cannot rely on offloading compute to\na centralized cloud. Thus, a distributed edge cloud is expected to process\nimages locally. However, the edge is, by nature, resource-constrained, which\nputs a limit on the computational complexity that can execute. Yet, there is a\nneed for a meeting point between the edge and accurate real-time video\nanalytics. Specializing lightweight models on a per-camera basis may help but\nit quickly becomes unfeasible as the number of cameras grows unless the process\nis automated. In this paper, we present and evaluate COVA (Contextually\nOptimized Video Analytics), a framework to assist in the automatic\nspecialization of models for video analytics in edge cameras. COVA\nautomatically improves the accuracy of lightweight models through their\nspecialization. Moreover, we discuss and review each step involved in the\nprocess to understand the different trade-offs that each one entails.\nAdditionally, we show how the sole assumption of static cameras allows us to\nmake a series of considerations that greatly simplify the scope of the problem.\nFinally, experiments show that state-of-the-art models, i.e., able to\ngeneralize to unseen environments, can be effectively used as teachers to\ntailor smaller networks to a specific context, boosting accuracy at a constant\ncomputational cost.

We propose a scenario linking this dependence with that of\ngiant exoplanet occurrence rates. We show that there are enough exoplanets to\naccount for the observed disk structures if transitional disks are created by\nexoplanets more massive than Jupiter, and ring disks by exoplanets more massive\nthan Neptune, under the assumption that most of those planets eventually\nmigrate inwards. On the other hand, the known anti-correlation between\ntransiting super-Earths and stellar mass implies those planets must form in the\ndisks without observed structure, consistent with formation through pebble\naccretion in drift-dominated disks. These findings support an evolutionary\nscenario where the early formation of giant planets determines the disk's dust\nevolution and its observational appearance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 03:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 15:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Large quantities of planetesimals form as a\nby-product of planet formation. Therefore, it seems likely that ISOs are former\nplanetesimals that became unbound from their parent star. The discoveries raise\nthe question of the dominant ISO formation process. Here, we concentrate on\nplanetesimals released during another star's close flybys. We quantify the\namount of planetesimals released during close stellar flybys, their ejection\nvelocity and likely composition. We study the dependence of the effect of\nparabolic flybys on the mass ratio between the perturber and parent star, the\nperiastron distance, inclination, and angle of periastron. Whenever ISOs are\nproduced, they leave their parent system typically with velocities of 0.5-2\nkm/s. This ejection velocity is distinctly different to that of ISOs produced\nby planet scattering (4-8 km/s) and those shed during the stellar\npost-main-sequence phase 0.1-0.2 km/s). Using the typical disc truncation\nradius in various cluster environments, we find that clusters like the Orion\nnebula cluster are likely to produce the equivalent of 0.85 Earth-masses of\nISOs per star. In contrast, clusters like NGC 3603 could produce up to 50\nEarth-masses of ISOs per star. Our solar system probably produced the\nequivalent of 2-3 Earth masses of ISOs, which left our solar system at a mean\nejection velocity of 0.7 km/s. Most ISOs produced by flybys should be\ncomet-like, similar to Borisov. ISOs originating from compact long-lived\nclusters would often show a deficiency in CO. As soon as a statistically\nsignificant sample of ISOs is discovered, the combined information of their\nobserved velocities and composition might help in constraining the dominant\nproduction process (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

We find that the densities and relative\nproportions of these mantle reservoirs, in particular of the late forming\nilmenite bearing cumulates (IBC), strongly depend on the FeO content of the\nbulk silicate Moon.

In combination with seismic and selenodetic\nconstraints on mantle stratigraphy, core radius, extent of the low velocity\nzone at the core mantle boundary, considerations about the present day\nselenotherm and the effects of reservoir mixing by convection our model\nindicates that the bulk silicate Moon is only moderately enriched in FeO\ncompared to the Earths mantle and contains about 9.4 - 10.9 weight percent FeO\n(with a lowermost limit of 8.3 weight percent and an uppermost limit of 11.9\nweight percent).

The combined results from\nBrookhaven and Fermilab show a difference with the SM prediction $\\delta a_\\mu\n= (251 \\pm 59) \\times 10^{-11}$ at a significance of $4.2\\sigma$, strongly\nindicating the presence of new physics. Motivated by this new result we\nreexamine the contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment from both:\n(i)~the ubiquitous $U(1)$ gauge bosons of D-brane string theory constructions\nand (ii)~the Regge excitations of the string. We show that, for a string scale\n${\\cal O} ({\\rm PeV})$, the contribution from anomalous $U(1)$ gauge bosons\nwhich couple to hadrons could help to reduce (though not fully eliminate) the\ndiscrepancy reported by the Muon $g-2$ Collaboration. Consistency with null\nresults from LHC searches of new heavy vector bosons imparts the dominant\nconstraint. We demonstrate that the contribution from Regge excitations is\nstrongly suppressed as it was previously conjectured. We also comment on\ncontributions from Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes, which could help resolve the\n$\\delta a_\\mu$ discrepancy. In particular, we argue that for 4-stack\nintersecting D-brane models, the KK excitations of the $U(1)$ boson living on\nthe lepton brane would not couple to hadrons and therefore can evade the LHC\nbounds while fully bridging the $\\delta a_\\mu$ gap observed at Brookhaven and\nFermilab.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 17:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 21:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

We propose an additional intervention that allows rapid control of\nemerging infectious diseases, and can also be used to eradicate diseases that\nrely almost exclusively on human-to-human transmission. The intervention is\nbased on (1) testing every individual for the disease, (2) repeatedly, and (3)\nisolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of\ntesting, the reproduction number is reduced below 1.0 and the epidemic will\nrapidly collapse. The approach does not rely on strong or unrealistic\nassumptions about test accuracy, isolation compliance, population structure or\nepidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored in real time by\nfollowing the test positivity rate. In addition to the compliance rate and\nfalse negatives, the required rate of testing depends on the design of the\ntesting regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling. Provided\nthat results are obtained rapidly, the test frequency required to suppress an\nepidemic is monotonic and near-linear with respect to R0, the infectious\nperiod, and the fraction of susceptible individuals. The testing regime is\neffective against both early phase and established epidemics, and additive to\nother interventions (e.g. contact tracing and social distancing). It is also\nrobust to failure: any rate of testing reduces the number of infections,\nimproving both public health and economic conditions. These conclusions are\nbased on rigorous analysis and simulations of appropriate epidemiological\nmodels. A mass-produced, disposable test that could be used at home would be\nideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests that return immediate\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In this theory, the\nrenormalization group flow connects a non-interacting ultraviolet fixed point,\nwhere the theory is controlled by linear elasticity, to an interacting infrared\nfixed point. By studying the structure of correlation functions and of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, we show that, in the infrared, the theory is only\nscale-invariant: the dilatation symmetry is not enhanced to full conformal\ninvariance. The model is shown to present a non-vanishing virial current which,\ndespite being non-conserved, maintains a scaling dimension exactly equal to $D\n- 1$, even in presence of interactions. We attribute the absence of anomalous\ndimensions to the symmetries of the model under translations and rotations in\nthe embedding space, which are realized as shifts of phonon fields, and which\nprotect the renormalization of several non-invariant operators. We also note\nthat closure of a symmetry algebra with both shift symmetries and conformal\ninvariance would require, in the hypothesis that phonons transform as primary\nfields, the presence of new shift symmetries which are not expected to hold on\nphysical grounds. We then consider an alternative model, involving only scalar\nfields, which describes effective phonon-mediated interactions between local\nGaussian curvatures.

To efficiently browse high-dimensional media over\nbandwidth-constrained networks, a navigational streaming model is considered: a\nclient navigates the large media space by dictating a navigation path to a\nserver, who in response transmits the corresponding pre-encoded media data\nunits (MDU) to the client one-by-one in sequence. Intra-coding an MDU (I-MDU)\nwould result in a large bitrate but I-MDU can be randomly accessed, while\ninter-coding an MDU (P-MDU) using another MDU as a predictor incurs a small\ncoding cost but imposes an order where the predictor must be first transmitted\nand decoded. From a compression perspective, the technical challenge is: how to\nachieve coding gain via inter-coding of MDUs, while enabling adequate random\naccess for satisfactory user navigation. To address this problem, we propose\nlandmarks, a selection of key MDUs from the high-dimensional media. Using\nlandmarks as predictors, nearby MDUs in local neighborhoods are intercoded,\nresulting in a predictive MDU structure with controlled coding cost. It means\nthat any requested MDU can be decoded by at most transmitting a landmark and an\ninter-coded MDU, enabling navigational random access. To build a landmarked MDU\nstructure, we employ tree-structured vector quantizer (TSVQ) to first optimize\nlandmark locations, then iteratively add/remove inter-coded MDUs as refinements\nusing a fast branch-and-bound technique. Taking interactive LF images and\nviewport adaptive 360 images as illustrative applications, and I-, P- and\npreviously proposed merge frames to intra- and inter-code MDUs, we show\nexperimentally that landmarked MDU structures can noticeably reduce the\nexpected transmission cost compared with MDU structures without landmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 13:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 03:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In this study, we aim to understand the impact\nof X-rays on the composition of low-mass protostellar envelopes, focusing\nspecifically on water and related oxygen bearing species. We compute the\nchemical composition of two low-mass protostellar envelopes using a 1D\ngas-grain chemical reaction network, under various X-ray field strengths.\nAccording to our calculations, outside the water snowline, the water gas\nabundance increases with $L_{\\mathrm{X}}$. Inside the water snowline, water\nmaintains a high abundance of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ for small $L_{\\mathrm{X}}$, with\nwater and CO being the dominant oxygen carriers. For large $L_{\\mathrm{X}}$,\nthe water gas abundances significantly decrease just inside the water snowline\n(down to $\\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$) and in the innermost regions ($\\sim10^{-6}$).\nFor these cases, the O$_{2}$ and O gas abundances reach $\\sim 10^{-4}$ within\nthe water snowline, and they become the dominant oxygen carriers. The HCO$^{+}$\nand CH$_{3}$OH abundances, which have been used as tracers of the water\nsnowline, significantly increase/decrease within the water snowline,\nrespectively, as the X-ray fluxes become larger. The abundances of some other\ndominant molecules, such as CO$_{2}$, OH, CH$_{4}$, HCN, and NH$_{3}$, are also\naffected by strong X-ray fields, especially within their own snowlines.

Many spinel compounds are\nmagnetic insulators or semiconductors; however, a number of spinel-type metals\nexists including superconductors and some rare examples of d-derived\nheavy-fermion compounds. In the early days, they gained importance as\nferrimagnetic or even ferromagnetic insulators with relatively high saturation\nmagnetization and high ordering temperatures, with magnetite being the first\nmagnetic mineral known to mankind. However, spinels played an outstanding role\nin the development of concepts of magnetism, in testing and verifying the\nfundamentals of magnetic exchange, in understanding orbital-ordering and\ncharge-ordering phenomena. In addition, the A- site as well as the B-site\ncations in the spinel structure form lattices prone to strong frustration\neffects resulting in exotic ground-state properties. In case the A-site cation\nis Jahn-Teller active, additional entanglements of spin and orbital degrees of\nfreedom appear, which can give rise to a spin-orbital liquid or an orbital\nglass state. The B-site cations form a pyrochlore lattice, one of the strongest\ncontenders of frustration in three dimensions. In addition, in spinels with\nboth cation lattices carrying magnetic moments, competing magnetic exchange\ninteractions become important, yielding ground states like the time-honoured\ntriangular Yafet-Kittel structure. Finally, yet importantly, there exists a\nlong-standing dispute about the possibility of a polar ground state in spinels,\ndespite their reported overall cubic symmetry.

However, one of the\nobstacles to making these methods work in real-time is the autoregressive (AR)\nstructure. To overcome this obstacle, we develop a method to obtain a model\nthat is free from an AR structure and behaves similarly to the original S2S\nmodels, based on a teacher-student learning framework. In our method, called\n\"FastS2S-VC\", the student model consists of encoder, decoder, and attention\npredictor.

China's low-carbon generation\nin the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of\n36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when\nthe fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the\ncarbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of\n519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power\ndemand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of\nChina's power demand could be provided by low carbon sources. Our results thus\nreveal that China made progress towards its carbon neutrality target during the\npandemic, and suggest the potential for substantial further decarbonization in\nthe next few years if the latest trends persist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In the foreseeable future, shared spaces will be populated\nwith a mixture of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs)\nlike pedestrians and cyclists. However, a driver-less AV lacks a way to\ncommunicate with the VRUs when they have to reach an agreement of a\nnegotiation, which brings new challenges to the safety and smoothness of the\ntraffic. To find a feasible solution to integrating AVs seamlessly into\nshared-space traffic, we first identified the possible issues that the\nshared-space designs have not considered for the role of AVs. Then an online\nquestionnaire was used to ask participants about how they would like a driver\nof the manually driving vehicle to communicate with VRUs in a shared space. We\nfound that when the driver wanted to give some suggestions to the VRUs in a\nnegotiation, participants thought that the communications via the driver's body\nbehaviors were necessary. Besides, when the driver conveyed information about\nher/his intentions and cautions to the VRUs, participants selected different\ncommunication methods with respect to their transport modes (as a driver,\npedestrian, or cyclist). These results suggest that novel eHMIs might be useful\nfor AV-VRU communication when the original drivers are not present. Hence, a\npotential eHMI design concept was proposed for different VRUs to meet their\nvarious expectations. In the end, we further discussed the effects of the eHMIs\non improving the sociality in shared spaces and the autonomous driving systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 19:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

The goal is to reconstruct the linear\nattenuation coefficient of the object's interior. For each position of the\nX-ray source, characterized by its angle with respect to a fixed coordinate\nsystem, one measures a set of data referred to as a view. A common assumption\nis that these view angles are known, but in some applications they are known\nwith imprecision. We propose a framework to solve a Bayesian inverse problem\nthat jointly estimates the view angles and an image of the object's attenuation\ncoefficient. We also include a few hyperparameters that characterize the\nlikelihood and the priors. Our approach is based on a Gibbs sampler where the\nassociated conditional densities are simulated using different sampling schemes\n- hence the term hybrid. In particular, the conditional distribution associated\nwith the reconstruction is nonlinear in the image pixels, non-Gaussian and\nhigh-dimensional. We approach this distribution by constructing a Laplace\napproximation that represents the target conditional locally at each Gibbs\niteration. This enables sampling of the attenuation coefficients in an\nefficient manner using iterative reconstruction algorithms. The numerical\nresults show that our algorithm is able to jointly identify the image and the\nview angles, while also providing uncertainty estimates of both.

State-of-the-Art methods, such as NeRF, are designed to learn a\nsingle scene with a neural network and require dense multi-view inputs. Testing\non a new scene requires re-training from scratch, which takes 2-3 days. In this\nwork, we introduce Stereo Radiance Fields (SRF), a neural view synthesis\napproach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requires\nonly sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspired\nby classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points by\nfinding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color and\ndensity for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in the\ninput images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise\nsimilarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns\nstructure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the\nDTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10\nsparse and spread-out views as input. We show that 10-15 minutes of fine-tuning\nfurther improve the results, achieving significantly sharper, more detailed\nresults than scene-specific models. The code, model, and videos are available\nat https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/srf/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

To this end, we carefully profile BERT\ntraining and identify key algorithmic behaviors which are worthy of attention\nin accelerator design.\n  We observe that while computations which manifest as matrix multiplication\ndominate BERT's overall runtime, as in many convolutional neural networks,\nmemory-intensive computations also feature prominently. We characterize these\ncomputations, which have received little attention so far. Further, we also\nidentify heterogeneity in compute-intensive BERT computations and discuss\nsoftware and possible hardware mechanisms to further optimize these\ncomputations.
