The four MMS\nspacecraft were separated by several hundred km, comparable to suprathermal ion\ngyro-radius scales or several ion inertial lengths. At least half of the shock\nreformation cycle was observed, with a new shock ramp rising up out of the\n\"foot\" region of the original shock ramp. Using the multipoint observations, we\nconvert the observed time-series data into distance along the shock normal in\nthe shock's rest frame. That conversion allows for a unique study of the\nrelative spatial scales of the shock's various features, including the shock's\ngrowth rate, and how they evolve during the reformation cycle. Analysis\nindicates that: the growth rate increases during reformation, electron-scale\nphysics play an important role in the shock reformation, and energy conversion\nprocesses also undergo the same cyclical periodicity as reformation. Strong,\nthin electron-kinetic-scale current sheets and large-amplitude electrostatic\nand electromagnetic waves are reported. Results highlight the critical\ncross-scale coupling between electron-kinetic- and ion-kinetic-scale processes\nand details of the nature of nonstationarity, shock-front reformation at\ncollisionless, fast magnetosonic shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

At this early stage of an epidemic, where no vaccine or medical\ntreatment is in sight, algorithmic prediction can become a powerful tool to\ninform local policymaking. However, when we replicated one prominent\nepidemiological model to inform health authorities in a region in the south of\nBrazil, we found that this model relied too heavily on manually predetermined\ncovariates and was too reactive to changes in data trends.\n  Methods: Our four proposed variations of the original method allow accessing\ndata of daily reported infections and take into account the under-reporting of\ncases more explicitly.

To achieve these benefits, Tempo timestamps each application command\nand executes it only after the timestamp becomes stable, i.e., all commands\nwith a lower timestamp are known. Both the timestamping and stability detection\nmechanisms are fully decentralized, thus obviating the need for a leader\nreplica. Our protocol furthermore generalizes to partial replication settings,\nenabling scalability in highly parallel workloads. We evaluate the protocol in\nboth real and simulated geo-distributed environments and demonstrate that it\noutperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 16:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 08:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

We explore different\nmechanisms to learn such a policy based on Reinforcement Learning. The key\ncontribution of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to learn a\ntactile insertion policy that generalizes across different object geometries,\nand an ablation study of the key design choices for the learning agent: 1) the\ntype of learning scheme: supervised vs. reinforcement learning; 2) the type of\nlearning schedule: unguided vs. curriculum learning; 3) the type of sensing\nmodality: force/torque (F/T) vs. tactile; and 4) the type of tactile\nrepresentation: tactile RGB vs. tactile flow. We show that the optimal\nconfiguration of the learning agent (RL + curriculum + tactile flow) exposed to\n4 training objects yields an insertion policy that inserts 4 novel objects with\nover 85.0% success rate and within 3~4 attempts. Comparisons between F/T and\ntactile sensing, shows that while an F/T-based policy learns more efficiently,\na tactile-based policy provides better generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 17:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Secondly, the immense energy\ninjection into the blastwave should lead to extremely bright radio transients\nwhich previous studies found to be inconsistent with deep radio observations of\nshort gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, we show that upcoming all-sky radio\nsurveys will constrain the extracted energy distribution, independently of a\nGRB jet formation. Our results can be self-consistently understood, provided\nthat most BNS merger remnants collapse shortly after formation (even if their\nmasses are low enough to allow for SMNS formation). This naturally occurs if\nthe remnant retains half or less of its initial energy by the time it enters\nsolid body rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We find\nthat, the inferred density and metallicity of low-density ($10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$)\ngas is uncertain by factors of 6.3 and 3.2, whereas high density ($10^{-3}$\ncm$^{-3}$) gas by factors of 4 and 1.6, respectively. The variation in the\nshape of the UV background models is entirely responsible for such a variation\nin the metallicity while variation in the density arises from both\nnormalization and shape of the UV background.

In this paper, we introduce a principled\nstrategy for the construction of a gold standard in deformable registration.\nOur framework: (i) iteratively suggests the most informative location to\nannotate next, taking into account its redundancy with previous annotations;\n(ii) extends traditional pointwise annotations by accounting for the spatial\nuncertainty of each annotation, which can either be directly specified by the\nuser, or aggregated from pointwise annotations from multiple experts; and (iii)\nnaturally provides a new strategy for the evaluation of deformable registration\nalgorithms. Our approach is validated on four different registration tasks. The\nexperimental results show the efficacy of suggesting annotations according to\ntheir informativeness, and an improved capacity to assess the quality of the\noutputs of registration algorithms. In addition, our approach yields, from\nsparse annotations only, a dense visualization of the errors made by a\nregistration method.

These virus-laden particles are more\nhighly concentrated in the expiratory jet of an infectious person than in a\nwell-mixed room, but this near-field enhancement in virion exposure has not\nbeen well quantified. Transmission of airborne viruses depends on factors that\nare inherently variable and, in many cases, poorly constrained, and quantifying\nthis uncertainty requires large ensembles of model simulations that span the\nvariability in input parameters. However, models that are well-suited to\nsimulate the near-field evolution of respiratory particles are also\ncomputationally expensive, which limits the exploration of parametric\nuncertainty. In order to perform many simulations that span the wide\nvariability in factors governing transmission, we developed the\nQuadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD). QuaRAD is\nan efficient framework for simulating the evolution of virus-laden particles\nafter they are expelled from an infectious person, their deposition to the\nnasal cavity of a susceptible person, and the subsequent risk of initial\ninfection. We simulated 10,000 scenarios to quantify the risk of initial\ninfection by a particular virus, SARS-CoV-2. The predicted risk of infection\nwas highly variable among scenarios and, in each scenario, was strongly\nenhanced near the infectious individual. In more than 50% of scenarios, the\nphysical distancing needed to avoid near-field enhancements in airborne\ntransmission was beyond the recommended safe distance of two meters (six feet)\nif the infectious person is not wearing a mask, though this distance defining\nthe near-field extent was also highly variable among scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 19:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

We compile a sample of 892 M dwarfs with Halpha equivalent width\n(HaEW) measurements from the literature that are either co-moving with a white\ndwarf of known age (21 stars) or in a known young association (871 stars). In\nthis sample we identify 7 M dwarfs that are new candidate members of known\nassociations. By dividing the stars into active and inactive categories\naccording to their HaEW and spectral type (SpT), we find that the fraction of\nactive dwarfs decreases with increasing age, and the form of the decline\ndepends on SpT. Using the compiled sample of age-calibrators we find that HaEW\nand fractional Halpha luminosity (LHaLbol) decrease with increasing age. HaEW\nfor SpT<M7 decreases gradually up until ~1Gyr. For older ages, we found only\ntwo early M dwarfs which are both inactive and seem to continue the gradual\ndecrease. We also found 14 mid-type out of which 11 are inactive and present a\nsignificant decrease of HaEW, suggesting that the magnetic activity decreases\nrapidly after ~1Gyr. We fit LHaLbol versus age with a broken power-law and find\nan index of -0.11+0.02-0.01 for ages <~776Myr. The index becomes much steeper\nat older ages however a lack of field age-calibrators leaves this part of the\nrelation far less constrained. Finally, from repeated independent measurements\nfor the same stars we find that 94% of these has a level of HaEW variability\n<=5A at young ages (<1Gyr).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 20:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The\ndynamical model accounts for all the relevant harmonics of the gravity field at\nthe altitude of geostationary orbits, as well as solar radiation pressure and\nthird-body perturbations caused by the Moon and the Sun.

In this article,\nwe examine three trends that biologists have observed in the evolution of\nsymbiotes. (1) Management: If one partner is able to control the symbiotic\nrelation, this control can reduce conflict; thus, evolutionary selection\nfavours symbiotes that have a manager. (2) Mutualism: Although partners in a\nsymbiote often have conflicting needs, evolutionary selection favours symbiotes\nin which partners are better off together inside the symbiote than they would\nbe as individuals outside of the symbiote. (3) Interaction: Repeated\ninteraction among partners in symbiosis tends to promote increasing fitness due\nto evolutionary selection. We have added new components to Model-S that allow\nus to observe these three trends in runs of Model-S. The new components are\nanalogous to the practice of staining cells in biology research, to reveal\npatterns that are not usually visible. When we measure the fitness of a\nsymbiote by making it compete with other symbiotes, we find that fitter\nsymbiotes have significantly more management, mutualism, and interaction than\nless fit symbiotes. These results confirm the trends observed in nature by\nbiologists. Model-S allows biologists to study these evolutionary trends and\nother characteristics of symbiosis in ways that are not tractable with living\norganisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 21:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 19:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 20:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

High-quality building footprint generation\nfrom satellite images can accelerate this predictive process and empower\nmunicipal decision-making at scale.

The standard training approach,\nteacher forcing, guides a model with the reference output history. At inference\nstage, the generated output history must be used. This mismatch can impact\nperformance. However, it is highly challenging to train the model using the\ngenerated output. Several approaches have been proposed to address this\nproblem, normally by selectively using the generated output history. To make\ntraining stable, these approaches often require a heuristic schedule or an\nauxiliary classifier. This paper introduces attention forcing for NMT. This\napproach guides the model with the generated output history and reference\nattention, and can reduce the training-inference mismatch without a schedule or\na classifier. Attention forcing has been successful in TTS, but its application\nto NMT is more challenging, due to the discrete and multi-modal nature of the\noutput space. To tackle this problem, this paper adds a selection scheme to\nvanilla attention forcing, which automatically selects a suitable training\napproach for each pair of training data.

The study of the\nstatistical distribution of waiting-times between flares (the time intervals\nbetween consecutive activity peaks) can give information on the distribution of\nflaring times, and constrain the physical mechanism responsible for gamma-ray\nemission. We adopt here a Scan-Statistic driven clustering method (iSRS) to\nrecognize flaring states within the FERMI-LAT data, and identify the time of\nactivity-peaks. Results: Flares waiting times can be described with a\npoissonian process, consisting of a set of overlapping bursts of flares, with\nan average burst duration of about 0.6 year, and average rate of 1.3/y . For\nwaiting times below 1d host-frame we found a statistically-relevant second\npopulation, the fast-component, mainly from CTA 102 data. The period of\nconspicuous detection of the fast component for CTA 102 coincides with the\ncrossing-time of the superluminal K1 feature with the C1 stationary feature in\nradio reported in Jorstad et al.

(2017); Casadio et al.\n(2019) with the bursting-activity, we have to assume that plasma streams with a\ntypical length of about 2pc (in the stream reference-frame) reach the\nrecollimation-shock. Otherwise, the distribution of waiting-times can be\ninterpreted as originating from relativistic-plasma moving along the jet for a\ndeprojected length of about 30-50pc (assuming a Lorentz-factor=10), that\nsporadically produces gamma-ray flares. In magnetic-reconnection scenario,\nreconnection events or plasma injection to the reconnection-sites should be\nintermittent. Individual plasmoids can be resolved in a few favourable cases\nonly (Christie et al., 2019); they could be responsible for the fast component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 22:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 10:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

This paper\nclarifies some of these confusions: e.g., the U-MUSCL scheme can be third-order\naccurate in the point-valued solution with kappa=1/3 on regular grids for\nlinear equations in all dimensions, it can be third-order accurate with\nkappa=1/2 as the QUICK scheme in one dimension. It is shown that the U-MUSCL\nscheme cannot be third-order accurate for nonlinear equations, except a very\nspecial case of kappa=1/2 on regular simplex-element grids, but it can be an\naccurate low-dissipation second-order scheme. It is also shown that U-MUSCL\nextrapolates a quadratic function exactly with kappa=1/2 on arbitrary grids\nprovided the gradient is computed by a quadratic least-squares method. Two\ntechniques are discussed, which transform the U-MUSCL scheme into being\ngenuinely third-order accurate on a regular grid: an efficient\nflux-reconstruction method and a special source term quadrature formula for\nkappa=1/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 02:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

Despite\ntheir widespread use, however, many such techniques rely on unverifiable\nassumptions and only few provide mechanisms to control the approximation error\nquantitatively. Addressing this gap, Dowdy and Barton [The Journal of Chemical\nPhysics, 149(7), 074103 (2018)] proposed a method for the computation of\nguaranteed bounds on the moment trajectories associated with stochastic\nchemical systems described by the Chemical Master Equation, thereby providing a\ngeneral framework for error quantification. Here, we present an extension of\nthis method. The key contribution is a new hierarchy of convex necessary moment\nconditions crucially reflecting the temporal causality and other regularity\nconditions that are inherent to the moment trajectories associated with\nstochastic processes described by the Chemical Master Equation. Analogous to\nthe original method, these conditions generate a hierarchy of semidefinite\nprograms that furnishes monotonically improving bounds on the trajectories of\nthe moments and related statistics. Compared to its predecessor, the presented\nhierarchy produces bounds that are at least as tight and it often enables the\ncomputation of dramatically tighter bounds as it enjoys superior scaling\nproperties and the generated semidefinite programs are highly structured. We\nanalyze the properties of the presented hierarchy, discuss some aspects of its\npractical implementation and demonstrate its merits with several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 04:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 09:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Polarization-resolved SHG spectroscopy in the visible to\ninfrared regime is regularly used to investigate electronic and magnetic orders\nthrough their angular anisotropies within the crystal structure. However, the\nincreasing complexity of novel materials and emerging phenomena hamper the\ninterpretation of experiments solely based on the investigation of hybridized\nvalence states.

In non-centrosymmetric LiNbO$_3$, elemental\ncontributions by lithium and niobium are clearly distinguished by energy\ndependent XUV-SHG measurements. This element-resolved and symmetry-sensitive\nexperiment suggests that the displacement of Li ions in LiNbO$_3$, which is\nknown to lead to ferroelectricity, is accompanied by distortions to the Nb ion\nenvironment that breaks the inversion symmetry of the NbO$_{6}$ octahedron as\nwell.

To contribute to understanding of these\nspikes, we analyze the narrowband spikes observed in the 800-2000 MHz range\nduring the impulsive phase of the November 7, 2013 flare. In the radio\nspectrum, the spikes started with typical broadband clouds of spikes, and then\ntheir distribution in frequencies changed into unique, very narrow bands having\nnon-integer frequency ratios. We successfully fitted frequencies of these\nnarrow spike bands by those, calculating dispersion branches and growth rates\nof the Bernstein modes. For comparison, we also analyzed the model, where the\nnarrow bands of spikes are generated at the upper-hybrid frequencies. Using\nboth models, we estimated the plasma density and magnetic field in spike\nsources. Then the models are discussed, and arguments in favor of the model\nwith the Bernstein modes are presented. Analyzing frequency profiles of this\nspike event by the Fourier method, we found the power-law spectra with the\npower-law indices varying in the -0.8 -- -2.75 interval. Because at some times\nthis power-law index was close to the Kolmogorov spectral index (-5/3), we\npropose that the spikes are generated through the Bernstein modes in turbulent\nplasma reconnection outflows or directly in the turbulent magnetic reconnection\nof solar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 08:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

A caustic is a curve $C$\nwhose tangent lines are reflected by the billiard to lines tangent to $C$. The\nfamous Birkhoff Conjecture states that the only strictly convex billiards with\na foliation by closed caustics near the boundary are ellipses. By Lazutkin's\ntheorem, there always exists a Cantor family of closed caustics approaching the\nboundary. In the present paper we deal with an open billiard, whose boundary is\na strictly convex embedded (non-closed) curve $\\gamma$. We prove that there\nexists a domain $U$ adjacent to $\\gamma$ from the convex side and a\n$C^\\infty$-smooth foliation of $U\\cup\\gamma$ whose leaves are $\\gamma$ and\n(non-closed) caustics of the billiard. This generalizes a previous result by\nR.Melrose, which yields existence of a germ of foliation as above at a boundary\npoint. We show that there exists a continuum of above foliations by caustics\nwhose germs at each point in $\\gamma$ are pairwise different. We prove a more\ngeneral version of this statement in the cases, when $\\gamma$ is just an arc,\nand also when both $\\gamma$ and the caustics are immersed curves. It also\napplies to a billiard bounded by a closed strictly convex curve $\\gamma$ and\nyields infinitely many \"immersed\" foliations by immersed caustics. For the\nproof of the above results, we state and prove their analogue for a special\nclass of area-preserving maps generalizing billiard reflections: the so-called\n$C^{\\infty}$-lifted strongly billiard-like maps.

We also show that in the presence of nonlinearity the system\nsustains nonlinear topological edge states bifurcating from the linear\ntopological edge states and the modes without linear limit. Each nonlinear mode\nrepresents a doublet of odd-PT -conjugate states. In the broken PT phase, the\nnonlinear edge states may be effectively stabilized when an additional\nabsorption is introduced into the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 11:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

In the absence of continuous symmetry,\nthe lack of a conserved quantity makes the study of flows intrinsically\nchallenging. In a toroidal domain, the requirement of double-periodicity for\nphysical quantities adds to the complications. In particular, the\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of plasma steady-state with the flow in a\nnon-symmetric toroidal domain allows the development of singularities when the\nrotational transform of the magnetic field is rational, much like the\nequilibrium MHD model. In this work, we show that steady flows can still be\nmaintained provided the rotational transform is close to rational and the\nmagnetic shear is weak. We extend the techniques developed in carrying out\nperturbation methods to all orders for static MHD equilibrium by Weitzner\n(Physics of Plasmas 21, 022515 (2014)) to MHD equilibrium with flows. We\nconstruct perturbative MHD equilibrium in a doubly-periodic domain with nearly\nparallel flows by systematically eliminating magnetic resonances order by\norder. We then utilize an additional symmetry of the flow problem, first\ndiscussed by E. Hameiri in (J. Math. Phys. \\textbf{22}, 2080 (1981) Sec. III),\nto obtain a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for a class of non-symmetric\nthree-dimensional MHD equilibrium with flows both parallel and perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field. For this class of flows, we are able to obtain\nnon-symmetric generalizations of integrals of motion, such as Bernoulli's\nfunction and angular momentum. Finally, we obtain the generalized Hamada\nconditions, which are consistency conditions necessary to suppress singular\ncurrents in such a system when the magnetic field lines are closed.

We tested a biologically\nplausible model of adaptive rewiring in directed networks, based on two\nalgorithms widely used in distributed computing: advection and consensus. When\nboth are used in combination as rewiring criteria, adaptive rewiring shortens\npath length and enhances connectivity. When keeping a balance between advection\nand consensus, adaptive rewiring produces convergent-divergent units consisting\nof convergent hub nodes, which collect inputs from pools of sparsely connected,\nor local, nodes and project them via densely interconnected processing nodes\nonto divergent hubs that broadcast output back to the local pools.\nConvergent-divergent units operate within and between sensory, motor, and\ncognitive brain regions as their connective core, mediating context-sensitivity\nto local network units. By showing how these structures emerge spontaneously in\ndirected networks models, adaptive rewiring offers self-organization as a\nprinciple for efficient information propagation and integration in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 14:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Based on the introduced basic signal model\nof `STAR', three practical operating protocols for STAR-RISs are proposed,\nnamely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS).\nMoreover, a STAR-RIS aided downlink communication system is considered for both\nunicast and multicast transmission, where a multi-antenna base station (BS)\nsends information to two users, i.e., one on each side of the STAR-RIS. A power\nconsumption minimization problem for the joint optimization of the active\nbeamforming at the BS and the passive transmission and reflection beamforming\nat the STAR-RIS is formulated for each of the proposed operating protocols,\nsubject to communication rate constraints of the users.

The challenges mainly drive from (1) image content reasoning from\ndistant contexts, and (2) fine-grained texture synthesis for a large missing\nregion. To overcome these two challenges, we propose an enhanced GAN-based\nmodel, named Aggregated COntextual-Transformation GAN (AOT-GAN), for\nhigh-resolution image inpainting. Specifically, to enhance context reasoning,\nwe construct the generator of AOT-GAN by stacking multiple layers of a proposed\nAOT block. The AOT blocks aggregate contextual transformations from various\nreceptive fields, allowing to capture both informative distant image contexts\nand rich patterns of interest for context reasoning. For improving texture\nsynthesis, we enhance the discriminator of AOT-GAN by training it with a\ntailored mask-prediction task. Such a training objective forces the\ndiscriminator to distinguish the detailed appearances of real and synthesized\npatches, and in turn, facilitates the generator to synthesize clear textures.\nExtensive comparisons on Places2, the most challenging benchmark with 1.8\nmillion high-resolution images of 365 complex scenes, show that our model\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin in terms of FID with\n38.60% relative improvement.

The discovery led to a\nmajor controversy with criticism of the analysis and results and responses to\nit. The issue remains unresolved, leading to a fresh interest in the study of\nVenus including ground-based observations as well as space-probes that can\nanswer these questions conclusively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 17:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Thus, unsupervised methods face major challenges as\nthey need to tune complex cost functions with several terms designed to handle\neach of these sources of ambiguity. In contrast, supervised methods avoid these\nchallenges altogether by relying on explicit ground truth optical flow obtained\ndirectly from synthetic or real data. In the case of synthetic data, the ground\ntruth provides an exact and explicit description of what optical flow to assign\nto a given scene. However, the domain gap between synthetic data and real data\noften limits the ability of a trained network to generalize. In the case of\nreal data, the ground truth is obtained through multiple sensors and additional\ndata processing, which might introduce persistent errors and contaminate it. As\na solution to these issues, we introduce a novel method to build a training set\nof pseudo-real images that can be used to train optical flow in a supervised\nmanner. Our dataset uses two unpaired frames from real data and creates pairs\nof frames by simulating random warps, occlusions with super-pixels, shadows and\nillumination changes, and associates them to their corresponding exact optical\nflow. We thus obtain the benefit of directly training on real data while having\naccess to an exact ground truth.

It is\ncapable of yielding highly accurate results for molecular integrals over a wide\nrange of orbital parameters and quantum numbers. Additionally, the program\npackage provides numerous tools such as efficient calculation for the angular\nmomentum coefficients arising in the product of two normalized associated\nLegendre functions centered on different atomic positions, the rotation angular\nfunctions used for both complex and real spherical harmonics. Sample\ncalculations are performed for two-center one-electron integrals over\nnon-integer Slater-type orbitals. The results prove that the package is robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 09:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

There are ample advantages of MIMO that have been\nhighlighted that can improve the spatial resolution of the observations and\nalso the accuracy of the radar variables. These concepts have been introduced\nhere pertaining to weather radar observations with supporting simulations\ndemonstrating improvements to existing phased array technology. Already MIMO is\nbeing used in a big way for hard target detection and tracking and also in the\nautomotive radar industry and it offers similar improvements for weather radar\nobservations.

Noura, Ola Salman, Rapha\\\"el Couturier","title":"A Deep Learning Scheme for Efficient Multimedia IoT Data Compression","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.MM","license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","abstract":"  Given the voluminous nature of the multimedia sensed data, the Multimedia\nInternet of Things (MIoT) devices and networks will present several limitations\nin terms of power and communication overhead. One traditional solution to cope\nwith the large-size data challenge is to use lossy compression. However,\ncurrent lossy compression schemes require low compression rate to guarantee\nacceptable perceived image quality, which results in a low reduction of the\ncommunicated data size and consequently a low reduction in the energy and\nbandwidth consumption. Thus, an efficient compression solution is required for\nstriking a good balance between data size (and consequently communication\noverhead) and visual degradation. In this paper, a Deep-Learning (DL)\nsuper-resolution model is applied to recuperate high quality images (at the\napplication server side) given as input degraded images with a high compression\nratio (at the sender side). The experimental analysis shows the effectiveness\nof the proposed solution in enhancing the visual quality of the compressed and\ndown-scaled images. Consequently, the proposed solution reduces the overall\ncommunication overhead and power consumption of limited MIoT devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 08:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}
