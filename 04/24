We proposed a new model called\nGenetic Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoder (GCGVAE) to solve this\nproblem. We trained our model based on the data of various viruses' protein\nstructure, including that of the SARS, HIV, Hep3, and MERS, and used it to\ngenerate possible drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Several optimization algorithms,\nincluding valency masking and genetic algorithm, are deployed to fine tune our\nmodel. According to the simulation, our generated molecules have great\neffectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. We quantitatively calculated the scores\nof our generated molecules and compared it with the scores of existing drugs,\nand the result shows our generated molecules scores much better than those\nexisting drugs. Moreover, our model can be also applied to generate effective\ndrugs for treating other viruses given their protein structure, which could be\nused to generate drugs for future viruses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

A characterisation of the problem\nsolvability is deduced. We point out that the ideal problems cannot be solved\nin practice because they unrealistically require that the Brownian motion\naffecting the system is available for feedback. Drawing from the ideal\nsolution, we formulate and solve approximate versions of the full-information\nand output-feedback problems, which do not yield perfect asymptotic tracking\nbut can be solved in a realistic scenario. These solutions rely on two key\nideas: first we introduce a discrete-time a-posteriori estimator of the\nvariations of the Brownian motion obtained causally by sampling the system\nstate or output; second we introduce a hybrid state observer and a hybrid\nregulator scheme which employ the estimated Brownian variations. The\napproximate solution tends to the ideal as the sampling period tends to zero.\nThe proposed theory is validated by the regulation of a circuit subject to\nelectromagnetic noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

In this paper, we study synthesis of deceptive\nwinning strategies in two-player turn-based zero-sum reachability games on\ngraphs with one-sided incomplete information of action sets. In particular, we\nconsider the class of games in which Player 1 (P1) starts with a non-empty set\nof private actions, which she may 'reveal' to Player 2 (P2) during the course\nof the game. P2 is equipped with an inference mechanism using which he updates\nhis perception of P1's action set whenever a new action is revealed. Under this\ninformation structure, the objective of P1 is to reach a set of goal states in\nthe game graph while that of P2 is to prevent it. We address the question: how\ncan P1 leverage her information advantages to deceive P2 into choosing actions\nthat in turn benefit P1? To this end, we introduce a dynamic hypergame model to\ncapture the reachability game with evolving misperception of P2. Analyzing the\ngame qualitatively, we design algorithms to synthesize deceptive sure and\nalmost-sure winning regions, and establish two key results: (1) under\nsure-winning condition, deceptive winning strategy is equivalent to the\nnon-deceptive winning strategy - i.e. use of deception has no advantages, (2)\nunder almost-sure winning condition, the deceptive winning strategy could be\nmore powerful than the non-deceptive strategy. We illustrate our algorithms\nusing a capture-the-flag game, and demonstrate the use of proposed approach to\na larger class of games with temporal logic objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Future systems will be increasingly heterogeneous, integrating\nmultiple specialized and programmable accelerators, each with different memory\ndemands. Traditionally, communication between accelerators has been\ninefficient, typically orchestrated through explicit DMA transfers between\ndifferent address spaces. More recently, industry has proposed unified coherent\nmemory which enables implicit data movement and more data reuse, but often\nthese interfaces limit the coherence flexibility available to heterogeneous\nsystems. This paper demonstrates the benefits of fine-grained coherence\nspecialization for heterogeneous systems. We propose an architecture that\nenables low-complexity independent specialization of each individual coherence\nrequest in heterogeneous workloads by building upon a simple and flexible\nbaseline coherence interface, Spandex. We then describe how to optimize\nindividual memory requests to improve cache reuse and performance-critical\nmemory latency in emerging heterogeneous workloads.

This is\nmany times the observed scale height of the canonical pulsar population, which\nsuggests this pulsar may have been born far out of the plane.

This technique leaves a small but finite fraction of the\ncoherent carrier power that can be highly detrimental in applications requiring\nincoherent light. This paper shows that the carrier suppression in a laser\nbroadened by this technique can be calculated for an arbitrary noise\nprobability density function. The carrier suppression can be varied\nexperimentally by adjusting the noise voltage standard deviation $Gv_{\\sigma}$\nand saturation voltage $V_{sat}$ of the amplifier that amplifies the noise\nsource that drives the EOM. Simulations show that suppressions better than -30\ndB are attainable for reasonable tolerances in $Gv_{\\sigma}$, for example an\nEOM with a $V_{\\pi}$ of 4.7 V, a $V_{sat}$ of 6.3V, and $Gv_{\\sigma}/V_{\\pi} =\n0.73\\pm0.03$. Even greater tolerances can be achieved with a higher $V_{sat}$\n(21 V), lower $V_\\pi$ (3.5 V), and $Gv_{\\sigma}/V_{\\pi} \\approx 3.2 \\pm 2.3$.\nThis model aids in selecting these parameters such that the carrier suppression\nis resilient to fluctuations in these voltages due to temperature variations\nand aging of the components. The model predictions are validated by testing a\nfiber optic gyroscope interrogated with a broadened laser for various\n$Gv_{\\sigma}$ and $V_{sat}$ and inferring the carrier suppression from its\nmeasured noise. A -44-dB carrier suppression was observed for a nonlinear\namplifier with $Gv_{\\sigma}$ = 3.43 V, $V_{sat}$ = 6.3 V, and an EOM with\n$V_{\\pi}$ = 4.7 V, in agreement with predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Companies that operate\nacross many product categories have a unique opportunity, insofar as they can\nuse purchasing data from one category to augment their insights in another.\nSuch cross-category insights are especially crucial in situations where\npurchasing data may be rich in one category, and scarce in another. An\nimportant aspect of how consumers behave across categories is dynamics:\npreferences are not stable over time, and changes in individual-level\npreference parameters in one category may be indicative of changes in other\ncategories, especially if those changes are driven by external factors. Yet,\ndespite the rich history of modeling cross-category preferences, the marketing\nliterature lacks a framework that flexibly accounts for \\textit{correlated\ndynamics}, or the cross-category interlinkages of individual-level sensitivity\ndynamics. In this work, we propose such a framework, leveraging\nindividual-level, latent, multi-output Gaussian processes to build a\nnonparametric Bayesian choice model that allows information sharing of\npreference parameters across customers, time, and categories.

A final\nexperiment investigates the correlation between common GAN evaluation metrics\nand the performance of a trained face detector. Although all tested\nanonymization methods lower the performance of trained face detectors, faces\nanonymized using GANs cause far smaller performance degradation than\nconventional methods. As the most important finding, the best-performing GAN,\nDeepPrivacy, removes identifiable faces for a face detector trained on\nanonymized data, resulting in a modest decrease from 91.0 to 88.3 mAP.

Namely, the coupling constant $\\lambda$ in front of the pair\npotential, which is Coulombic, scales like $N^{-\\theta}$ for some $\\theta \\in\n(0,1)$, in contrast to the usual mean-field scaling $\\lambda\\sim N^{-1}$.\nAssuming $\\theta\\in (1-\\frac{2}{d(d+1)},1)$, they showed that the empirical\nmeasure of the system is effectively described by the solution to the Euler\nequation as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$.

It is already clear that its rate is enhanced by\nturbulence, and that reconnection itself may increase its stochasticity, but\nthe main mechanism that connects these two effects is still not completely\nunderstood. The aim of this work is to identify, from the terms of the\nelectromotive force, the dominant physical process responsible for enhancing\nthe reconnection rate in turbulent plasmas. We employ full three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of turbulence driven by stochastic reconnection and\nestimate the production and dissipation of turbulent energy and cross-helicity,\nthe amount of produced residual helicity, and determine the relation between\nthese quantities and the reconnection rate. We observe the development of the\nelectromotive force in the studied models with plasma-$\\beta = 0.1 - 2$ and the\nLundquist number $S=10^{-5}-10^{-4}$. The turbulent energy and residual\nhelicity develop in the large-scale current sheet, with the latter decreasing\nthe effects of turbulent magnetic diffusion. We demonstrate that the stochastic\nreconnection, apart from the turbulence, can produce a significant amount of\ncross-helicity as well. The cross-helicity to turbulent energy ratio, however,\nhas no correlation with the reconnection rate. We show that its sufficiently\nlarge value is not a necessary condition for fast reconnection to occur. The\nresults suggest that cross-helicity is inherent to turbulent fields, but the\nreconnection rate enhancement is possibly caused by the effects of magnetic\nturbulent diffusion and controlled by the residual helicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In order to investigate some of its\nproperties, a model of multimodular autoassociator is studied. Each of the many\nmodules represents a neocortical functional ensemble of recurrently connected\nneurons and operates as a Hebbian autoassociator, storing a number of local\nfeatures which it can recall upon cue. The global memory patterns are made of\ncombinations of features sparsely distributed across the modules. Intermodular\nconnections are modelled as a finite-connectivity random graph. Any pair of\nfeatures in any respective pair of modules is allowed to be involved in several\nmemory patterns; the coarse-grained modular network dynamics is defined in such\na way as to overcome the consequent ambiguity of associations.

Using\nthis duality, we study non-trivially deformed strongly coupled quantum field\ntheories at large-$N_c$. The corresponding dual classical gravity constructions\nentail the use of radially non-monotonic D-brane distributions. The gravity\nbackgrounds are supersymmetric and hence perturbatively stable, and do not\npossess curvature singularities. There are no short-cuts through the bulk\nspacetime for signal propagation which assures that the field theory duals are\ncausal.

In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to investigate the\nrelations between clusters of synthetic planets with similar properties and\ntheir formation history. We trained a Gaussian Mixture Model on typical\nexoplanet observables computed by a global model of planet formation to\nidentify clusters of similar planets. We then traced back the formation\nhistories of the planets associated with them. Using cluster affiliation as\nlabels, we trained a Random Forest classifier to predict planet species from\nproperties of the originating protoplanetary disk. Without presupposing any\nplanet types, we identified four distinct classes in our synthetic population.\nThey roughly correspond to the observed populations of (sub-)Neptunes, giant\nplanets, and (super-)Earths, plus an additional unobserved class we denote as\n\"icy cores\". These groups emerge already within the first 0.1 Myr of the\nformation phase and are predicted from disk properties with an overall accuracy\nof >90%. The most reliable predictors are the initial orbital distance of\nplanetary nuclei and the total planetesimal mass available. Giant planets form\nonly in a particular region of this parameter space that is in agreement with\npurely analytical predictions. Including N-body interactions between the\nplanets decreases the predictability, especially for sub-Neptunes that\nfrequently undergo giant collisions and turn into super-Earths. The impact of\ngravitational interactions highlights the need for N-body integrators for\nrealistic predictions of systems of low-mass planets.

Their mass and angular momentum at the onset of the instability are key\nin many respects, in particular regarding the possibility for observational\nsignatures of direct collapse. Here, we study the stability of rotating,\nrapidly accreting SMSs against GR and derive the properties of these stars at\ndeath. On the basis of hylotropic structures, relevant for rapidly accreting\nSMSs, we define rotation profiles under the assumption of local angular\nmomentum conservation in radiative regions, which allows for differential\nrotation. We find that rotation favours the stability of rapidly accreting SMSs\nas soon as the accreted angular momentum represents a fraction f > 0.1% of the\nKeplerian angular momentum. For f = 0.3%-0.5% the maximum masses consistent\nwith GR stability are increased by an order of magnitude compared to the\nnon-rotating case. For f = 1%, the GR instability cannot be reached if the\nstellar mass does not exceed 10^7-10^8 Msun. These results imply that, like in\nthe non-rotating case, the final masses of the progenitors of direct collapse\nblack holes range in distinct intervals depending on the scenario considered:\n10^5 Msun < M < 10^6 Msun for primordial atomically cooled haloes; 10^6 Msun <\nM < 10^9 Msun for metal-rich galaxy mergers. The models suggest that the\ncentrifugal barrier is inefficient to prevent the direct formation of a\nsupermassive black hole at the collapse of a SMS. Moreover, the conditions of\ngalaxy mergers appear as more favorable than those of atomically cooled haloes\nfor detectable gravitational wave emission and ultra-long gamma-ray bursts at\nblack hole formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Total 41 probable cluster members were identified based on the\nspatial distributions of spectral-energy-distribution slopes derived from the\nNIR $K_S$ and IRAC bands and extinctions of the sources. The cumulative\ndistribution of the SED slopes for the S208 cluster was not significantly\ndifferent from those of other clusters in solar-metallicity environments with\napproximately the same age for intermediate-mass stars, if one also considers\nnon-detected MIR sources identified as S208 cluster members from NIR\nobservations.

The\nfraction of stars with MIR disk emissions for the cluster members with\n$\\ge$1-$M_\\odot$ mass was 64%-93%, which is comparable to the results in\nsolar-metallicity environments. Although this may suggest that dominant\ndisk-dispersal mechanisms for intermediate-mass stars have either no, or very\nweak, dependence on metallicity, it can be argued alternatively that this may\nsuggest that the disk dispersal process does not work effectively at this young\nstage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 18:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Here, the (electrified)\ngraphite-NaCl(aq) interface was examined using constant chemical potential\nmolecular dynamics simulations; this approach avoids ion depletion (due to\nsurface adsorption) and maintains a constant concentration of ions beyond the\nsurface. Specific Na+ adsorption at the graphite basal surface causes charging\nof the interface in the absence of an applied potential. At moderate bulk\nconcentrations, this leads to accumulation of counter-ions in a diffuse layer\nto balance the effective surface charge, consistent with established models of\nthe electrical double layer (DL).

In the standard\napplications of quantum mechanics, the quantum canonical equation is equivalent\nto the Heisenberg equation. At the same time, this equation is applicable to\nc-number canonical variables and then coincides with the canonical equation in\nclassical mechanics.

Similarly to\nthe classical case, the shifted version of the Berenstein-Kirillov group also\nacts on the straight-shaped shifted tableau crystals introduced by Gillespie,\nLevinson and Purbhoo (2020), via partial Sch\\\"utzenberger involutions, thus\ncoinciding with the action of the cactus group on the same crystal, due to the\nauthor. Following the works of Halacheva (2016, 2020), and Chmutov, Glick and\nPylyavskyy (2020), on the relation between the actions of the\nBerenstein-Kirillov group and the cactus group on a crystal of straight-shaped\nYoung tableaux, we also show that the shifted Berenstein-Kirillov group is\nisomorphic to a quotient of the cactus group. Not all the known relations that\nhold in the classic Berenstein-Kirillov group need to be satisfied by the\nshifted Bender-Knuth involutions, but the ones implying the relations of the\ncactus group are verified. Hence, we have an alternative presentation for the\ncactus group in terms of the shifted Bender-Knuth involutions. We also use the\nshifted growth diagrams due to Thomas and Yong (2016) to provide an alternative\nproof concerning the mentioned cactus group action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 19:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

The bi-continuous phase, in which both the neutron gas and nuclear\nmatter extend continuously in all dimensions and therefore protons are\ndelocalized, appears over a large range of depths. Our results support the idea\nthat nuclear pasta is a glassy system. Multiple pasta configurations coexist in\na given layer of the crust.

We\ntest how well an internal age spread can be resolved as a function of cluster\nage, population mass fraction, and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. For this test,\nthe two ages (Age (SSP1) and Age (SSP2)) are free parameters along with the\nmass fraction of SSP1. We perform the analysis on 118,800 mock star clusters\ncovering all ages in the range 6.8 < log (age/yr) < 10.2, with mass fractions\nfrom 10% to 90% for two age gaps (0.2 dex and 0.5 dex). Random noise is added\nto the model spectra to achieve S/N ratios between 50 to 100 per wavelength\npixel. We find that the mean of the derived Age (SSP1) generally matches the\nreal Age (SSP1) to within 0.1 dex up to ages around log (age/yr) = 9.5. The\nprecision decreases for log (age/yr) > 9.6 for any mass fraction or S/N, due to\nthe similarity of SED shapes for those ages. In terms of the recovery of age\nspreads, we find that the derived age spreads are often larger than the real\nones, especially for log(age/yr) < 8.0 and high mass fractions of SSP1.\nIncreasing the age gap in the mock clusters improves the derived parameters,\nbut Age (SSP2) is still overestimated for the younger ages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 03:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Prior works implement channel pruning in an\nunexplainable manner, which tends to reduce the final classification errors\nwhile failing to consider the internal influence of each channel. In this\npaper, we conduct channel pruning in a white box. Through deep visualization of\nfeature maps activated by different channels, we observe that different\nchannels have a varying contribution to different categories in image\nclassification. Inspired by this, we choose to preserve channels contributing\nto most categories. Specifically, to model the contribution of each channel to\ndifferentiating categories, we develop a class-wise mask for each channel,\nimplemented in a dynamic training manner w.r.t. the input image's category. On\nthe basis of the learned class-wise mask, we perform a global voting mechanism\nto remove channels with less category discrimination.

Nevertheless, constructing textual descriptions for math\nexpressions is nontrivial. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to\nautomatically construct descriptions for math expressions. But there are two\nchallenges that need to be addressed: 1) finding relevant documents since a\nmath equation understanding usually requires several topics, but these topics\nare often explained in different documents. 2) the sparsity of the collected\nrelevant documents making it difficult to extract reasonable descriptions.\nDifferent documents mainly focus on different topics which makes model hard to\nextract salient information and organize them to form a description of math\nexpressions. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model (MathDes) which\ncontains two important modules: Selector and Summarizer.

Direct measurement\nof brain motion at an adequate frame-rate during impacts has been a persistent\nchallenge. Here we present the ultrasound observation of shear shock waves in\nthe acoustically challenging environment of the in situ porcine brain during a\nsingle-shot impact. The brain was attached to a plate source which was vibrated\nat a moderate amplitude of 25g, to propagate a 40 Hz shear wave into the brain.\nSimultaneously, images of the moving brain were acquired at 2193 images/s,\nusing a custom imaging sequence with 8 interleaved ultrasound transmit-receive\nevents, designed to accurately track shear shocks. To achieve a long\nfield-of-view, wide-beam emissions were designed using time-reversal ultrasound\nsimulations and no compounding was used to avoid motion blurring. A peak\nacceleration of 102g was measured at the shock-front, 7.1 mm deep inside the\nbrain. It is also shown that experimental shear velocity, acceleration, and\nstrain-rate waveforms in brain are in excellent agreement with theoretical\npredictions from a custom higher-order finite volume method hence demonstrating\nthe capabilities to measure rapid brain motion even in the presence of strong\nacoustical reverberations from the porcine skull.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 08:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

In\nparticular, it was speculated that the echoes are closely connected with\nspecific characteristics of the exotic compact objects, and moreover, possibly\nprovide an access to the quantum nature of gravity. Recently, it was shown that\nthe discontinuity in the black hole metric substantially modifies the\nasymptotical behavior of quasinormal frequencies. In the present study, we\nproceed further and argue that a discontinuity planted into the metric\nfurnishes an alternative mechanism for the black hole echoes. Physically, the\nlatter may correspond to an uneven matter distribution inside the surrounding\nhalo. To demonstrate the results, we first numerically investigate the temporal\nevolution of the scalar perturbations around a black hole that possesses a\nnonsmooth effective potential. It is shown that the phenomenon persists even\nthough the discontinuity can be located further away from the horizon with\nrather insignificant strength. Besides, we show that the echoes in the present\nmodel can be derived analytically based on the modified pole structure of the\nassociated Green function. The asymptotical properties of the quasinormal mode\nspectrum and the echoes are found to be closely connected, as both features can\nbe attributed to the same origin. In particular, the period of the echoes in\nthe time domain $T$ is shown to be related to the asymptotic spacing between\nsuccessive poles along the real axis in the frequency domain\n$\\Delta(\\Re\\omega)$, by a simple relation\n$\\lim\\limits_{\\Re\\omega\\to+\\infty}\\Delta(\\Re\\omega) = 2\\pi/T$.

This paper shows that modeling an\neffective message-passing flow through an attention mechanism can be critical\nto tackling the compositionality and long-tail challenges in VRR.

In\naddition to using the conditional GAN to generate class balanced supplementary\ntraining data, an innovative ensemble learning loss function ensuring each\ndiscriminator makes up for the deficiencies of the others is designed to\novercome the class imbalanced problem, and an active learning algorithm is\nintroduced to significantly reduce the cost of labeling real-world data.

Luminosity\ndistance information can be obtained from GW observations, and one can perform\ncosmological inference if redshift information can also be extracted, which\nwould be straightforward if an electromagnetic counterpart exists. In this\npaper, we concentrate on the conservative scenario where the EM counterparts\nare not available, and comprehensively study if cosmological parameters can be\ninferred through a statistical approach, utilizing the non-uniform distribution\nof galaxies as well as the black hole mass-host galaxy bulge luminosity\nrelationship. By adopting different massive black hole binary merger models,\nand assuming different detector configurations, we conclude that the\nstatistical inference of cosmological parameters is indeed possible. TianQin is\nexpected to constrain the Hubble constant to a relative error of about 4%-7%,\ndepending on the underlying model. The multidetector network of TianQin and\nLISA can significantly improve the precision of cosmological parameters. In the\nmost favorable model, it is possible to achieve a level of 1.7% with a network\nof TianQin and LISA. We find that without EM counterparts, constraints on all\nother parameters need a larger number of events or more precise sky\nlocalization of GW sources, which can be achieved by the multidetector network\nor under a favorable model for massive black hole mergers.

The key differences are the finite sizes of the\nmagnetospheres limited by their physical boundaries, the presence of a strong\nplanetary background magnetic field and spatially very inhomogeneous plasma\nproperties within the magnetospheres. Typical turbulent fluctuations possess\namplitudes much smaller than the background field and are characterized by\nAlfv\\'en times, which can be smaller than the non-linear interaction time\nscales. The magnetospheres of the outer planets are thus interesting\nlaboratories of plasma turbulence. In Jupiter's and Saturn's magnetospheres,\nturbulence is well established thanks to the in-situ measurements by several\nspacecraft, in particular by the Galileo and Cassini orbiter. In contrast, the\nfluctuations in Uranus' and Neptune's magnetospheres are poorly understood due\nto the lack of sufficient data. Turbulence in the outer planets' magnetospheres\nhave important effects on the systems as a whole. The dissipation of the\nturbulent fluctuations through wave-particle interaction is a significant heat\nsource, which can explain the large magnetospheric plasma temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 14:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

Many design construction techniques in the existing\nliterature are only applicable for rectangular bounded space, but in real world\napplications, the input space can often be non-rectangular because of\nconstraints on the input variables. One solution to generate designs in a\nconstrained space is to first generate uniformly distributed samples in the\nfeasible region, and then use them as the candidate set to construct the\ndesigns.

It\nshows elastic properties for short time scales and behaves viscous for longer\ntime scales. Hence, realistic simulations of cell shape dynamics require a\nmodel capturing the entire elastic to viscous spectrum. However, currently\nthere are no numerical methods to simulate deforming viscoelastic surfaces.\nThus models for the cell cortex, or other viscoelastic surfaces, are usually\nbased on assumptions or simplifications which limit their applicability. In\nthis paper we develop a first numerical approach for simulation of deforming\nviscoelastic surfaces. To this end, we derive the surface equivalent of the\nupper convected Maxwell model using the GENERIC formulation of nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics. The model distinguishes between shear dynamics and dilatational\nsurface dynamics. The viscoelastic surface is embedded in a viscous fluid\nmodelled by the Navier-Stokes equation. Both systems are solved using Finite\nElements. The fluid and surface are combined using an Arbitrary\nLagrange-Eulerian (ALE) Method that conserves the surface grid spacing during\nrotations and translations of the surface. We verify this numerical\nimplementation against analytic solutions and find good agreement. To\ndemonstrate its potential we simulate the experimentally observed tumbling and\ntank-treading of vesicles in shear flow. We also supply a phase-diagram to\ndemonstrate the influence of the viscoelastic parameters on the behaviour of a\nvesicle in shear flow. Finally, we explore cytokinesis as a future application\nof the numerical method by simulating the start of cytokinesis using a\nspatially dependent function for the surface tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 15:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

To study the non-equilibrium\nthermodynamic features of a Brownian particle that hops in a medium where its\nviscosity varies on time, a Brownian particle that walks on a periodic\nisothermal medium (in the presence or absence of load) is considered.

This is reasonable since any system which is in contact with a\nuniform temperature should obey the detail balance condition in a long time\nlimit.

The first two\nmodels are short range interaction (SRI), whereas the last one includes coulomb\nlike interactions which is pretty long range (long-range interactions, LRI). By\nexamining various dynamical observables we show that the critical exponents of\nSRI IP are robust against the control parameters (temperature in the Ising\nmodel and occupation probability in site percolation), whereas its properties\nin the LRI (RCP) supports are completely different from the normal IP (i.e. on\nthe regular lattice).

A useful method is to employ neural networks with attention to\ngenerate sentences representations in a way that information from pair\nsentences can mutually influence the computation of representations. In this\nwork, an effective architecture,multi-size neural network with attention\nmechanism (AM-MSNN),is introduced into the answer selection task. This\narchitecture captures more levels of language granularities in parallel,\nbecause of the various sizes of filters comparing with single-layer CNN and\nmulti-layer CNNs. Meanwhile it extends the sentence representations by\nattention mechanism, thus containing more information for different types of\nquestions. The empirical study on three various benchmark tasks of answer\nselection demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model in all the benchmarks\nand its superiority over competitors. The experimental results show that (1)\nmulti-size neural network (MSNN) is a more useful method to capture abstract\nfeatures on different levels of granularities than single/multi-layer CNNs; (2)\nthe attention mechanism (AM) is a better strategy to derive more informative\nrepresentations; (3) AM-MSNN is a better architecture for the answer selection\ntask for the moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 02:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}
