Several of the most popular and empirically successful\nalgorithms are, at their core, a simple walk along a pruned near neighbor\ngraph.

However, graph traversal\napplications often suffer from poor memory access patterns, and near neighbor\nsearch is no exception to this rule. Our measurements show that popular search\nindices such as the hierarchical navigable small-world graph (HNSW) can have\npoor cache miss performance. To address this problem, we apply graph reordering\nalgorithms to near neighbor graphs. Graph reordering is a memory layout\noptimization that groups commonly-accessed nodes together in memory. We present\nexhaustive experiments applying several reordering algorithms to a leading\ngraph-based near neighbor method based on the HNSW index.

If the central components are represented only by a\nbulge/bar, for a point estimate of the SMBH Galactocentric velocity, the\noscillation amplitude does not exceed 7 pc in the case that a classical bulge\nis present and reaches 25 pc if there is no bulge; with SMBH velocity\ncomponents within the $2\\sigma$ significance level, the amplitude can reach 15\nand 50 pc, respectively. However, when taking into account the nuclear stellar\ndisk (NSD), even in the absence of a bulge, the oscillation amplitude is only 5\npc for the point estimate of the SMBH velocity, and 10 pc for the $2\\sigma$\nsignificance level. Thus, the possible oscillations of the SMBH + NSC complex\nfrom the confirmed components of the Galaxy's potential are mostly limited by\nthe NSD, and even taking into account the uncertainty of the mass of the\nlatter, the oscillation amplitude can hardly exceed $13\\,\\text{pc}=6'$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 16:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

On the other hand, traffickers use social media\nto groom and recruit people into trafficking situations. There is the\nopportunity to use social media data to better provide support for people\nexperiencing trafficking.\n  While AI and Machine Learning (ML) have been used in work against sex\ntrafficking, they predominantly focus on detecting Child Sexual Abuse Material.\nWork using social media data has not been done with the intention to provide\ncommunity level support to people of all ages experiencing trafficking. Within\nthis context, this thesis explores the use of semi-supervised classification to\nidentify social media posts that are a part of the sex industry.\n  Several methods were explored for ML. However, the primary method used was\nsemi-supervised learning, which has the benefit of providing automated\nclassification with a limited set of labelled data. Social media posts were\nembedded into low-dimensional vectors using FastText and Doc2Vec models. The\ndata were then clustered using k-means clustering, and cross-validation was\nused to determine label propagation accuracy.\n  The results of the semi-supervised algorithm were encouraging. The FastText\nCBOW model provided 98.6% accuracy to over 12,000 posts in clusters where label\npropagation was applied. The results of this thesis suggest that further\nsemi-supervised learning, in conjunction with manual labeling, may allow for\nthe entire dataset containing over 50,000 posts to be accurately labeled.\n  A fully labeled dataset could be used to develop a tool to identify an\noverview of where and when social media is used within the sex industry. This\ncould be used to help determine better ways to provide support to people\nexperiencing trafficking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 16:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

Two\ncorrections to the measured muon precession frequency $\\omega_a^m$ are\nassociated with well-known effects owing to the use of electrostatic quadrupole\n(ESQ) vertical focusing in the storage ring. An average vertically oriented\nmotional magnetic field is felt by relativistic muons passing transversely\nthrough the radial electric field components created by the ESQ system. The\ncorrection depends on the stored momentum distribution and the tunes of the\nring, which has relatively weak vertical focusing. Vertical betatron motions\nimply that the muons do not orbit the ring in a plane exactly orthogonal to the\nvertical magnetic field direction. A correction is necessary to account for an\naverage pitch angle associated with their trajectories. A third small\ncorrection is necessary because muons that escape the ring during the storage\ntime are slightly biased in initial spin phase compared to the parent\ndistribution. Finally, because two high-voltage resistors in the ESQ network\nhad longer than designed RC time constants, the vertical and horizontal\ncentroids and envelopes of the stored muon beam drifted slightly, but\ncoherently, during each storage ring fill. This led to the discovery of an\nimportant phase-acceptance relationship that requires a correction. The sum of\nthe corrections to $\\omega_a^m$ is 0.50 $\\pm$ 0.09 ppm; the uncertainty is\nsmall compared to the 0.43 ppm statistical precision of $\\omega_a^m$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 16:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 21:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

This is an important\nproblem in many scientific endeavors, and it has been the subject of recent\nworks introducing non-parametric estimators of $U$ that are minimax\nnear-optimal and consistent all the way up to $\\lambda \\asymp\\log n$. These\nworks do not rely on any assumption on the underlying unknown distribution $p$\nof the population, and therefore, while providing a theory in its greatest\ngenerality, worst-case distributions may severely hamper the estimation of $U$\nin concrete applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of\nstrengthening the non-parametric framework for estimating $U$. Inspired by the\nestimation of rare probabilities in extreme value theory, and motivated by the\nubiquitous power-law type distributions in many natural and social phenomena,\nwe make use of a semi-parametric assumption regular variation of index $\\alpha\n\\in (0,1)$ for the tail behaviour of $p$. Under this assumption, we introduce\nan estimator of $U$ that is simple, linear in the sampling information,\ncomputationally efficient, and scalable to massive datasets. Then, uniformly\nover our class of regularly varying tail distributions, we show that the\nproposed estimator has provable guarantees: i) it is minimax near-optimal, up\nto a power of $\\log n$ factor; ii) it is consistent all of the way up to\n$\\log\\lambda \\asymp n^{\\alpha/2}/\\sqrt{\\log n}$, and this range is the best\npossible.

It is\ntantalizing to consider the loop effects of a heavy axion (in the general\nsense, also known as an axion-like particle) coupling to leptons and photons as\nan explanation for this discrepancy. We provide an updated analysis of the\nnecessary couplings, including two-loop contributions, and find that the new\nphysics operators point to an axion decay constant on the order of 10s of GeV.\nThis poses major problems for such an explanation, as the axion couplings to\nleptons and photons must be generated at low scales. We outline some\npossibilities for how such couplings can arise, and find that these scenarios\npredict new charged matter at or below the weak scale and new scalars can mix\nwith the Higgs boson, raising numerous phenomenological challenges. These\nscenarios also all predict additional contributions to the muon $g-2$ itself,\ncalling the initial application of the axion effective theory into question. We\nconclude that there is little reason to favor an axion explanation of the muon\n$g-2$ measurement relative to other models postulating new weak-scale matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 17:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 19:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

However, only recently has the study of the counterpart to demand response\nfor electric power in natural gas started to receive similar levels of\nattention. Natural gas systems are increasingly operating at or near capacity,\nwhich challenges these systems to meet all the needs for gas, especially during\nsevere winter weather. However, unlike demand response programs in electrical\nnetworks, demand response in gas networks cannot shift peak usage. Here, we\ndevelop analogues to demand response that can help improve the resilience of\nnatural gas systems by reducing peak consumption and thereby limiting potential\ndisruptions such events can cause. This paper develops a mathematical\nformulation to support a residential-level demand response analogue for natural\ngas based on current and anticipated smart thermostat technologies. The\nmathematical formulation takes the form of an optimal control problem (OCP)\nthat leverages physics constraints to model temperature changes, balance\nequitable service, and optimize the gas consumption for collections of houses.\nOn test problems, the formulation demonstrates significant benefits, including\nthe ability to cut peak demand by 15% while still ensuring equitable service to\ncustomers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 17:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 16:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 02:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Our\napproach enables us to obtain approximately optimal controls in real-time\nwithout having to solve an optimization problem. Once the policy function is\ntrained, generating a control at a given space-time location takes\nmilliseconds; in contrast, efficient nonlinear programming methods typically\nperform the same task in seconds. We train the NN offline using the objective\nfunction of the control problem and penalty terms that enforce the HJB\nequations. Therefore, our training algorithm does not involve data generated by\nanother algorithm. By training on a distribution of initial states, we ensure\nthe controls' optimality on a large portion of the state-space. Our grid-free\napproach scales efficiently to dimensions where grids become impractical or\ninfeasible. We apply our approach to several multi-agent collision-avoidance\nproblems in up to 150 dimensions.

Key to SST are two crucial observations: (1) domain-agnostic\nunlabeled images enable us to learn better models with a few labeled examples\nwithout any additional knowledge or supervision; and (2) learning is a\ncontinuous process and can be done by constructing a schedule of learning\nupdates that iterates between pre-training on novel segments of the streams of\nunlabeled data, and fine-tuning on the small and fixed labeled dataset. This\nallows SST to overcome the need for a large number of domain-specific labeled\nand unlabeled examples, exorbitant computational resources, and\ndomain/task-specific knowledge. In this setting, classical semi-supervised\napproaches require a large amount of domain-specific labeled and unlabeled\nexamples, immense resources to process data, and expert knowledge of a\nparticular task. Due to these reasons, semi-supervised learning has been\nrestricted to a few places that can house required computational and human\nresources. In this work, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate our\nfindings for a wide range of visual recognition tasks including fine-grained\nimage classification, surface normal estimation, and semantic segmentation. We\nalso demonstrate our findings for diverse domains including medical, satellite,\nand agricultural imagery, where there does not exist a large amount of labeled\nor unlabeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 17:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

We introduce a new differentiable physics\nbenchmark called PasticineLab, which includes a diverse collection of soft body\nmanipulation tasks.

The optical\nlight-curve shows a clear orbital modulation that can be well explained as a\ncombination of two processes: excess emission stemming from wind-wind\ncollisions and double wind eclipses. Our light-curve model implies an orbital\ninclination of i=60.4+-1.5deg, resulting in accurately constrained dynamical\nmasses of 74+-4 and 69+-4 Msun. Assuming that both binary components are core\nH-burning, these masses are difficult to reconcile with the derived\nluminosities (logL1,2 = 6.44, 6.39 [Lsun]), which correspond to evolutionary\nmasses of the order of 110 and 100Msun, respectively. Taken at face value, our\nresults imply that both stars have high classical Eddington factors of Gamma_e\n= 0.78+-0.1. If the stars are on the main sequence, their derived radii\n(~25Rsun) suggest that they are only slightly inflated, even at this high\nEddington factor. Alternatively, the stars could be core-He burning, strongly\ninflated from the regular size of classical Wolf-Rayet stars (~1Rsun), a\nscenario that could help resolve the observed mass discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 06:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Given a transmission mode set, we aim to\nminimize the total base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the\nbeamforming and the transmission mode selection policy taking into account the\nquality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear energy\nharvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm\ndesign is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we\nsolve it optimally by applying the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which\nentails a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between optimality\nand computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal algorithm\ncapitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation.

Part of the reason lies in the lack of a\ncommon domain, for geometric data such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds,\nwhere a universal perturbation can be defined. In this paper, we offer a change\nin perspective and demonstrate the existence of universal attacks for geometric\ndata (shapes). We introduce a computational procedure that operates entirely in\nthe spectral domain, where the attacks take the form of small perturbations to\nshort eigenvalue sequences; the resulting geometry is then synthesized via\nshape-from-spectrum recovery.

For this ventilation scheme, a cool lower zone is established beneath the\nwarm upper zone with the interface height h depending on ACH.

An\neasy, but often strong upper bound for the run time can then be derived by\nadding the reciprocals of the probabilities to leave the levels (or upper\nbounds for these). Unfortunately, a similarly effective method for proving\nlower bounds has not yet been established. The strongest such method, proposed\nby Sudholt (2013), requires a careful choice of the viscosity parameters\n$\\gamma_{i,j}$, $0 \\le i < j \\le n$.\n  In this paper we present two new variants of the method, one for upper and\none for lower bounds. Besides the level leaving probabilities, they only rely\non the probabilities that levels are visited at all. We show that these can be\ncomputed or estimated without greater difficulties and apply our method to\nreprove the following known results in an easy and natural way. (i) The precise\nrun time of the (1+1) EA on \\textsc{LeadingOnes}. (ii) A lower bound for the\nrun time of the (1+1) EA on \\textsc{OneMax}, tight apart from an $O(n)$ term.\n(iii) A lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on long $k$-paths. We also\nprove a tighter lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on jump functions\nby showing that, regardless of the jump size, only with probability $O(2^{-n})$\nthe algorithm can avoid to jump over the valley of low fitness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 19:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 09:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 08:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

Rather than refer\nto principles of self-organization and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to\ndescribe a developing embryo from its active cellular constituents, a purely\ngeometric theory is constructed that references the properties of the ambient\nspace that the embryo occupies. In 1975 the Fields laureate Ren\\'{e} Thom\ndeveloped a system of techniques and local dynamical models that are capable of\nreconstructing the local dynamic of an embryo at each new growth event of the\nsystem. Each new growth event (the development of a limb, for example) is a\ntopological change in the dynamic of the system that can be classified only\naccording to the properties of space. The local models can be non-conservative\nflows with robust attractor behavior that serve as organizing centers for\nsystems development. Hamiltonian flows can also be considered with novel,\nself-reproducing vague attractor behavior. The set of growth events become an\nunfolding space related to the differentiable manifold of states. The set of\ngrowth events, which Thom refers to as the catastrophe set, has special\nalgebraic properties which permit these models to be low dimensional--the local\nmodel contains few parameters. We present Thom's work as a research program\noutlining a framework for the construction of these local models, and,\nultimately, the synthesis of these models into a full theoretical description\nof a developing biological organism.

We use commissioning data taken by the EUI instrument\nonboard the recently launched Solar Orbiter mission. On 2020 May 30, EUI was\nsituated at 0.556AU from the Sun. Its HRIEUV telescope 17.4nm passband reached\nan exceptionally high two-pixel spatial resolution of 400km. The size and\nduration of small-scale structures is determined in the HRIEUV data, while\ntheir height is estimated from triangulation with the simultaneous SDO/AIA\ndata. This is the first stereoscopy of small scale brightenings at high\nresolution. We observed small localised brightenings (\"campfires\") in a quiet\nSun region with lengthscales between 400km and 4000km and durations between 10\nand 200s. The smallest and weakest of these HRIEUV brightenings have not been\nobserved before. Simultaneous HRILYA observations do not show localised\nbrightening events, but the locations of the HRIEUV events correspond clearly\nto the chromospheric network. Comparison with simultaneous AIA images shows\nthat most events can also be identified in the 17.1nm, 19.3nm, 21.1nm, and\n30.4nm passbands of AIA, although they appear weaker and blurred. DEM analysis\nindicates coronal temperatures peaking at log(T)~6.1-6.15. We determined the\nheight of a few campfires, which is between 1000 and 5000km above the\nphotosphere. We conclude that \"campfires\" are mostly coronal in nature and are\nrooted in the magnetic flux concentrations of the chromospheric network. We\ninterpret these events as a new extension to the flare/microflare/nanoflare\nfamily. Given their low height, the EUI \"campfires\" could be a new element of\nthe fine structure of the transition region/low corona: apexes of small-scale\nloops that are internally heated to coronal temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 20:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Here we present a purely geometrical mechanism to induce ionic\nselectivity and electroosmotic flow in uncharged nanopores and we tested it via\nmolecular dynamics simulations. Our approach exploits the accumulation of\ncharges, driven by an external electric field, in a coaxial cavity that\ndecorates the membrane close to the pore entrance.

Here, we tackle two types of leakage\nproblems: 1) Data leakage is caused when the networks access real training data\nduring an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is caused when\nclass-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order\nto address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the\npre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using the generated images. However,\nconverted SNNs remain vulnerable to class leakage since the weight parameters\nhave the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we\nencrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule.\nUpdating weight parameters with temporal data makes SNNs difficult to be\ninterpreted in the spatial domain.

Providing that wall-based quantities can\nbe measured, we know today how to obtain good predictions for two and\nthree-dimensional steady and periodic flows. In these flows, the separation is\ndefined on a fixed line attached to a material surface. The last case to\nelucidate is the one where this line is no longer attached to the wall but on\nthe contrary is contained within the flow. This moving separation is probably,\nhowever, the most common case of separation in natural flows and industrial\napplications. Since this case has received less attention during the past few\nyears, we propose in this study to examine some properties of moving separation\nin two-dimensional, unsteady flows where the separation does not leave a\nsignature on the wall.

In practice, the separation point and profile are initially extracted\nby detecting the most attracting Lagrangian coherent structure near the wall,\nand can then be advected in time for following instants.

Objective:\nPresenting two new Petri net slicing algorithms to isolate those places and\ntransitions of a Petri net (the slice) that may contribute tokens to one or\nmore places given (the slicing criterion). Method: The two algorithms proposed\nare formalized. The maximality of the first algorithm and the minimality of the\nsecond algorithm are formally proven. Both algorithms, together with three\nother state-of-the-art algorithms, have been implemented and integrated into a\nsingle tool so that we have been able to carry out a fair empirical evaluation.\nResults: Besides the two new Petri net slicing algorithms, a public, free, and\nopen-source implementation of five algorithms is reported. The results of an\nempirical evaluation of the new algorithms and the slices they produce are also\npresented. Conclusions: The first algorithm collects all places and transitions\nthat may contribute tokens (in any computation) to the slicing criterion, while\nthe second algorithm collects the places and transitions needed to fire the\nshortest transition sequence that contributes tokens to some place in the\nslicing criterion. Therefore, the net computed by the first algorithm can\nreproduce any computation that contributes tokens to any place of interest. In\ncontrast, the second algorithm loses this possibility, but it often produces a\nmuch more reduced subnet (which still can reproduce some computations that\ncontribute tokens to some places of interest). The first algorithm is proven\nmaximal, and the second one is proven minimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 23:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 21:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 14:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 02:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 05:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

These techniques,\ntypically, employ many approximations to achieve computational efficiency while\nimplementing semi-empirical scaling parameters to retain accuracy. We\ninvestigate three of the main approximations ubiquitous to WPMD: a restricted\nbasis set, approximations to exchange, and the lack of correlation. We examine\neach of these approximations in atomic and molecular hydrogen in addition to a\ndense hydrogen plasma. We find that the biggest improvement to WPMD comes from\ncombining a two Gaussian basis with a semi-empirical correction based on the\nvalence-bond wave function. A single parameter scales this correction to match\nexperimental pressures of dense hydrogen. Ultimately, we find that\nsemi-empirical scaling parameters are necessary to correct for the main\napproximations in WPMD. However, reducing the scaling parameters for more\nab-initio terms gives more accurate results and displays the underlying physics\nmore readily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 00:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

However,\nRIS-based communication systems' practical implementation may face challenges\nsuch as noise generated by the RIS structure.

For special case with a single-antenna BS,\nwe derive the exact closed-form SOP expressions and propose a novel\nring-penalty based successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to design\npower allocation and phase shifts jointly. While for the more general and\nchallenging case with a multi-antenna BS, we adopt the Bernstein-type\ninequality to approximate the SOP constraints by a deterministic convex form.\nTo proceed, an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed\nto solve the considered problem. Numerical results validate the advantages of\nthe proposed algorithms over the baseline schemes. Particularly, two\ninteresting phenomena on distributed IRS deployment are revealed: 1) the\nsecrecy rate peak is achieved only when distributed IRSs share the reflecting\nelements equally; and 2) the distributed IRS deployment does not always\noutperform the centralized IRS deployment, due to the tradeoff between the\nnumber of IRSs and the reflecting elements equipped at each IRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 01:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 12:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 13:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

The underlying relationship between catalytic performance\nand the topological surface state is explicitly verified by artificially hole\ndoping, external strain and similar electride without the Fermi arcs, where the\nGibbs free energies are significantly increased when the Fermi arcs is shifted\nto higher energy level. This work offers a guiding principle for understanding\ncatalytic nature of electrides and the topological quantum catalysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 02:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 02:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

One type of the previous methods lifts 2D joints, obtained by\nresorting to external 2D pose detectors, to the 3D space. However, this type of\napproaches discards the contextual information of images which are strong cues\nfor 3D pose estimation. Meanwhile, some other methods predict the joints\ndirectly from monocular images but adopt a 2.5D output representation $P^{2.5D}\n= (u,v,z^{r}) $ where both $u$ and $v$ are in the image space but $z^{r}$ in\nroot-relative 3D space. Thus, the ground-truth information (e.g., the depth of\nroot joint from the camera) is normally utilized to transform the 2.5D output\nto the 3D space, which limits the applicability in practice. In this work, we\npropose a novel end-to-end framework that not only exploits the contextual\ninformation but also produces the output directly in the 3D space via cascaded\ndimension-lifting.

Previous studies on the\nsize distribution have primarily focused on either the whole group or\nindividual spot areas. In this paper, we investigate the organization of spot\nareas within sunspot groups. In particular, we analyze the ratio, $\\rm{R}$, of\nthe area of the biggest spot ($\\rm{A_{big\\_spot}}$) inside a group, to the\ntotal area of that group ($\\rm{A_{group}}$). We use sunspot observations from\nKislovodsk, Pulkovo and Debrecen observatories, together covering solar cycles\n17 to 24. We find that at the time when the group area reaches its maximum, the\nsingle biggest spot in a group typically occupies about 60% of the group area.\nFor half of all groups, $\\rm R$ lies in the range between roughly 50% and 70%.\nWe also find R to change with the group area, $\\rm{A_{group}}$, such that\n$\\rm{R}$ reaches a maximum of about 0.65 for groups with $\\rm{A_{group}}\\approx\n200\\mu$Hem and then remains at about 0.6 for lager groups. Our findings imply a\nscale invariant emergence pattern, providing an observational constraint on the\nemergence process. Furthermore, extrapolation of our results to larger sunspot\ngroups may have a bearing on the giant unresolved starspot features found in\nDoppler images of highly active sun-like stars.

The sample-mixing methods are known to\nenhance the accuracy and robustness in the wide range of classification\nproblems, and can naturally be applicable to GANs because the role of the\ndiscriminator can be interpreted as the classification between real and fake\nsamples. We also proposed a new formalism applying the sample-mixing methods to\nGANs with the saturated losses which do not have a clear \"label\" of real and\nfake.

Similar to the recently launched\nParker Solar Probe, and unlike earlier missions, Solar Orbiter carries\ninstruments designed to measure the low frequency DC electric fields. In this\npaper we assess the quality of the low-frequency DC electric field measured by\nthe Radio and Plasma Waves instrument (RPW) on Solar Orbiter. In particular we\ninvestigate the possibility of using Solar Orbiter's DC electric and magnetic\nfield data to estimate the solar wind speed. We use deHoffmann-Teller (HT)\nanalysis based on measurements of the electric and magnetic fields to find the\nvelocity of solar wind current sheets which minimizes a single component of the\nelectric field. By comparing the HT velocity to proton velocity measured by the\nProton and Alpha particle Sensor (PAS) we develop a simple model for the\neffective antenna length, $L_\\text{eff}$ of the E-field probes. We then use the\nHT method to estimate the speed of the solar wind. Using the HT method, we find\nthat the observed variations in $E_y$ are often in excellent agreement with the\nvariations in the magnetic field. The magnitude of $E_y$, however, is uncertain\ndue to the fact that the $L_\\text{eff}$ depends on the plasma environment. We\nderive an empirical model relating $L_\\text{eff}$ to the Debye length, which we\ncan use to improve the estimate of $E_y$ and consequently the estimated solar\nwind speed. The low frequency electric field provided by RPW is of high\nquality.

For systems\nwith rapidly changing dynamics, an equidistant discretization is often\ninadvisable as it either results in prohibitively large errors or computational\neffort. To this end, adaptive schemes, such as solvers based on Runge--Kutta\npairs, have been developed which adapt the step size based on local error\nestimations at each step. While the classical schemes apply very generally and\nare highly efficient on regular systems, they can behave sub-optimal when an\ninefficient step rejection mechanism is triggered by structurally complex\nsystems such as chaotic systems. To overcome these issues, we propose a method\nto tailor numerical schemes to the problem class at hand.

The twist of magnetic field lines\naround the rope axis reveals information about flux rope formation processes\nand geoeffectivity. During propagation, MC flux ropes may erode via\nreconnection with the ambient solar wind. Any erosion reduces the magnetic flux\nand helicity of the ropes, and changes their cross-sectional twist profiles.\nThis study relates twist profiles in MC flux ropes observed at 1 AU to the\namount of erosion undergone by the MCs in interplanetary space. The twist\nprofiles of two well-identified MC flux ropes associated with the clear\nappearance of post eruption arcades in the solar corona are analysed. To infer\nthe amount of erosion, the magnetic flux content of the ropes in the solar\natmosphere is estimated, and compared to estimates at 1 AU. The first MC shows\na monotonically decreasing twist from the axis to periphery, while the second\ndisplays high twist at the axis, rising twist near the edges, and lower twist\nin between. The first MC displays a larger reduction in magnetic flux between\nthe Sun and 1 AU, suggesting more erosion, than that seen in the second MC. In\nthe second cloud, rising twist at the rope edges may have been due to an\nenvelope of overlying coronal field lines with relatively high twist, formed by\nreconnection beneath the erupting flux rope in the low corona. This high-twist\nenvelope remained almost intact from the Sun to 1 AU due to the low erosion\nlevels. In contrast, the high-twist envelope of the first cloud may have been\nentirely peeled away via erosion by the time it reaches 1 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 07:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

First, we find\nthat different input forms, either matrices or tensors both originated from\nreal MCMs, can affect the precise locations of the predicted transition points.\nNext, due to the complex nature of OPEEs, we extract three spatially dependent\nquantities from OPEEs, one related to the \"intensity\", and the other two\nrelated to \"phases\" of particle and hole components. We show that similar to\ntaking OPES directly as inputs, solely using \"intensity\" quantity can only\ndistinguish topological phases from trivial ones, whereas using either whole\nMCMs or complete OPEE-extracted quantities can provide sufficient information\nfor deep learning to distinguish between phases of matter with different $U(1)$\ngauges or Chern numbers.

Attributed Community Search (ACS), a related problem, is more\nchallenging since it finds communities with both cohesive structures and\nhomogeneous vertex attributes. However, most methods for the CS task rely on\ninflexible pre-defined structures and studies for ACS treat each attribute\nindependently. Moreover, the most popular ACS strategies decompose ACS into two\nseparate sub-problems, i.e., the CS task and subsequent attribute filtering\ntask. However, in real-world graphs, the community structure and the vertex\nattributes are closely correlated to each other. This correlation is vital for\nthe ACS problem. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Network models for both\nCS and ACS problems, i.e., Query Driven-GNN and Attributed Query Driven-GNN. In\nQD-GNN, we combine the local query-dependent structure and global graph\nembedding. In order to extend QD-GNN to handle attributes, we model vertex\nattributes as a bipartite graph and capture the relation between attributes by\nconstructing GNNs on this bipartite graph. With a Feature Fusion operator,\nAQD-GNN processes the structure and attribute simultaneously and predicts\ncommunities according to each attributed query. Experiments on real-world\ngraphs with ground-truth communities demonstrate that the proposed models\noutperform existing CS and ACS algorithms in terms of both efficiency and\neffectiveness. More recently, an interactive setting for CS is proposed that\nallows users to adjust the predicted communities.

It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on\nsegmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the\npreferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed\nat interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules.\nThis has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to\neffectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper,\nwe rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two\npositional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data,\ninstead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel\nperceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall\nanswer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge\nof perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual\nquestion-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by\ngenerating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution\nis therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each\ngenerated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow\ninsights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual\norganization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping\nnetwork directly generates answer patterns from scratch.

One pervasive but challenging\ncondition for model-guide compatibility is absolute continuity, which requires\nthat the model and guide programs define probability distributions with the\nsame support.\n  This paper presents a new probabilistic programming language that guarantees\nabsolute continuity, and features general programming constructs, such as\nbranching and recursion. Model and guide programs are implemented as coroutines\nthat communicate with each other to synchronize the set of random variables\nthey sample during their execution. Novel guide types describe and enforce\ncommunication protocols between coroutines. If the model and guide are\nwell-typed using the same protocol, then they are guaranteed to enjoy absolute\ncontinuity. An efficient algorithm infers guide types from code so that users\ndo not have to specify the types. The new programming language is evaluated\nwith an implementation that includes the type-inference algorithm and a\nprototype compiler that targets Pyro. Experiments show that our language is\ncapable of expressing a variety of probabilistic models with nontrivial control\nflow and recursion, and that the coroutine-based computation does not introduce\nsignificant overhead in actual Bayesian inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 08:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

In natural language processing (NLP) self-supervised learning and\ntransformers are already the methods of choice. The recent literature suggests\nthat the transformers are becoming increasingly popular also in computer\nvision. So far, the vision transformers have been shown to work well when\npretrained either using a large scale supervised data or with some kind of\nco-supervision, e.g. in terms of teacher network. These supervised pretrained\nvision transformers achieve very good results in downstream tasks with minimal\nchanges. In this work we investigate the merits of self-supervised learning for\npretraining image/vision transformers and then using them for downstream\nclassification tasks. We propose Self-supervised vIsion Transformers (SiT) and\ndiscuss several self-supervised training mechanisms to obtain a pretext model.\nThe architectural flexibility of SiT allows us to use it as an autoencoder and\nwork with multiple self-supervised tasks seamlessly. We show that a pretrained\nSiT can be finetuned for a downstream classification task on small scale\ndatasets, consisting of a few thousand images rather than several millions. The\nproposed approach is evaluated on standard datasets using common protocols. The\nresults demonstrate the strength of the transformers and their suitability for\nself-supervised learning.

Deploying successful RUL prediction methods in real-life\napplications is a prerequisite for the design of intelligent maintenance\nstrategies with the potential of drastically reducing maintenance costs and\nmachine downtimes. In light of their superior performance in a wide range of\nengineering fields, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are natural candidates to\ntackle the challenges involved in the design of intelligent maintenance\nsystems. In particular, given the potentially catastrophic consequences or\nsubstantial costs associated with maintenance decisions that are either too\nlate or too early, it is desirable that ML algorithms provide uncertainty\nestimates alongside their predictions. However, standard data-driven methods\nused for uncertainty estimation in RUL problems do not scale well to large\ndatasets or are not sufficiently expressive to model the high-dimensional\nmapping from raw sensor data to RUL estimates. In this work, we consider Deep\nGaussian Processes (DGPs) as possible solutions to the aforementioned\nlimitations.

Therefore,\ncurrently, generating an intense attosecond pulse would be one of the highest\npriority goals. In this paper, we review a TW-class parallel three-channel\nwaveform synthesizer for generating a gigawatt-scale soft-x-ray isolated\nattosecond pulse (IAP) using high-order harmonics generation (HHG).\nSimultaneously, using several stabilization methods, namely, the\nlow-repetition-rate laser carrier-envelope phase stabilization, Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer, balanced optical cross-correlator, and beam-pointing\nstabilizer, we demonstrate a stable 50-mJ three-channel optical-waveform\nsynthesizer with a peak power at the multi-TW level. This optical-waveform\nsynthesizer is capable of creating a stable intense optical field for\ngenerating an intense continuum harmonic beam thanks to the successful\nstabilization of all the parameters. Furthermore, the precision control of\nshot-to-shot reproducible synthesized waveforms is achieved. Through the HHG\nprocess employing a loose-focusing geometry, an intense shot-to-shot stable\nsupercontinuum (50-70 eV) is generated in an argon gas cell. This continuum\nspectrum supports an IAP with a transform-limited duration of 170 as and a\nsubmicrojoule pulse energy, which allows the generation of a GW-scale IAP.\nAnother supercontinuum in the soft-x-ray region with higher photon energy of\napproximately 100-130 eV is also generated in neon gas from the synthesizer.\nThe transform-limited pulse duration is 106 as. According to this work, the\nenhancement of HHG output through optimized waveform synthesis is\nexperimentally proved. The high-energy multicycle pulse with 10-Hz repetition\nrate is proved to have the same controllability for optimized waveform\nsynthesis for HHG as few- or subcycle pulses from a 1-kHz laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 09:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

In this paper, we address the puzzling question how these local\nmoments can be screened and what determines the additionally emerging low\ntemperature scale. We review the initial problem for half-filled conduction\nbands from two complementary perspectives: By a single-particle supercell\nanalysis in the uncorrelated limit and by the Lieb-Mathis theorem for systems\nwith a large Coulomb interaction $U$. We proof that the stable local moments\nare subject to screening by three different mechanisms. Firstly the local\nmoments are delocalized by a finite $U$ beyond the single-particle bound state.\nWe find a Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition governed by an exponentially\nsuppressed low energy scale of a counterintuitive Kondo form with $J_{\\rm eff}\n\\propto U^n$ for small $U$, where $n>1$ depends on the precise model. Secondly,\nwe show that away from half-filling the local moment phase becomes unstable and\nis replaced by two types of singlet phases that are adiabatically connected. At\na critical value for the band center, the physics is governed by an\nexponentially suppressed Kondo scale approaching the strong coupling phase that\nis replaced by an singlet formation via antiferromagnetic RKKY interaction for\nlarge deviation from the critical values. Thirdly, we show that the local\nmagnetic moment can be screened by a Kondo hole orbital at finite energy, even\nthough the orbital occupation is negligible: An additional low energy scale\nemerges below which the localized moment is quenched.

If much of a test case that triggered a bug does not contribute\nto the actual failure, then the time required to fix the bug can increase\nconsiderably. However, test case reduction itself can be a time consuming task,\nespecially if done manually. Therefore, automated minimization techniques have\nbeen proposed, the minimizing Delta Debugging (DDMIN) and the Hierarchical\nDelta Debugging (HDD) algorithms being the most well known. DDMIN does not need\nany information about the structure of the test case, thus it works for any\nkind of input.

We have evaluated various combinations of pruning\nand hoisting on multiple test suites and found that hoisting can help to\nfurther reduce the size of test cases by as much as 80% compared to the\nbaseline HDD.

It is a\ncrucial but challenging problem for indoor scene understanding. In this work,\nwe present a novel framework named Scene-Instance-Scene Network\n(\\textit{SISNet}), which takes advantages of both instance and scene level\nsemantic information. Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape\ndetails as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily\nmixed-up. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely\ncompleted semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the\nreconstruction of instances and the overall scene. SISNet conducts iterative\nscene-to-instance (SI) and instance-to-scene (IS) semantic completion.\nSpecifically, the SI is able to encode objects' surrounding context for\neffectively decoupling instances from the scene and each instance could be\nvoxelized into higher resolution to capture finer details. With IS,\nfine-grained instance information can be integrated back into the 3D scene and\nthus leads to more accurate semantic scene completion.

The half-unit weighted bilinear algorithm (HWB) proposed in our\nprevious work is used to enhance darker areas according to the darker map\ncontent of its HSV's component V.

It has a great advantage over other real-time models that its\nmodelling paradigm supports a deterministic concurrent behaviour of systems.\nVarious approaches have been utilized for verification of synchronous models\nbased on different techniques, such as model checking, SAT/SMT sovling, term\nrewriting, type inference and so on. In this paper, we propose a verification\napproach for synchronous models based on compositional reasoning and term\nrewriting.

SDL extends the regular program model\nof first-order dynamic logic (FODL) with necessary primitives to capture the\nnotion of synchrony and synchronous communication between parallel programs,\nand enriches FODL formulas with temporal dynamic logical formulas to specify\nsafety properties -- a type of properties mainly concerned in reactive systems.\nTo rightly capture the synchronous communications, we define a constructive\nsemantics for the program model of SDL. We build a sound and relatively\ncomplete proof system for SDL. Compared to previous verification approaches,\nSDL provides a divide and conquer way to analyze and verify synchronous models\nbased on compositional reasoning of the syntactic structure of the programs of\nSDL. To illustrate the usefulness of SDL, we apply SDL to specify and verify a\nsmall example in the synchronous model SyncChart, which shows the potential of\nSDL to be used in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 11:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

One critical\nchallenge is that, as data and business scope grow in real applications,\nexisting taxonomies need to be expanded to incorporate new concepts. Previous\nworks on taxonomy expansion process the new concepts independently and\nsimultaneously, ignoring the potential relationships among them and the\nappropriate order of inserting operations. However, in reality, the new\nconcepts tend to be mutually correlated and form local hypernym-hyponym\nstructures. In such a scenario, ignoring the dependencies of new concepts and\nthe order of insertion may trigger error propagation. For example, existing\ntaxonomy expansion systems may insert hyponyms to existing taxonomies before\ntheir hypernym, leading to sub-optimal expanded taxonomies. To complement\nexisting taxonomy expansion systems, we propose TaxoOrder, a novel\nself-supervised framework that simultaneously discovers the local\nhypernym-hyponym structure among new concepts and decides the order of\ninsertion. TaxoOrder can be directly plugged into any taxonomy expansion system\nand improve the quality of expanded taxonomies.

In generic systems the stickiness induces correlations in the\ncell visits. The distribution of recurrence times exhibits a separation of\ntimescales because of the dynamical trapping. We model the recurrence time\ndistributions to cells inside sticky areas as a mixture of exponential\ndistributions with different decay times. We introduce the variable S, which is\nthe ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of the recurrence times\nas a measure of stickiness.

The cation replacement at the A-site to form the solid\nsolution causes an increase tilting of the inorganic PbI6 octahedra: in the\nFA-rich compounds the replacement of FA by a smaller cation like MA is to\ncompensate the reduced space filling offered by the smaller cation, whereas in\nthe MA-rich compounds is to expand the space needed for the larger cation.

In the simple case where\nthe $B$-points are placed in an hexagonal grid, we show that all $k$-th order\nVoronoi areas are equal and thus all degrees follow a Poisson distribution.\nHowever, this observation does not hold for Poisson distributed $B$-points, for\nwhich we show that the degree distribution follows a compound Poisson-Erlang\ndistribution in the 1-dimensional case. We then approximate the degree\ndistribution in the 2-dimensional case with a compound Poisson-Gamma degree\ndistribution and show that this one-parameter fit performs well for different\nvalues of $k$. Moreover, we show that for increasing $k$, these degree\ndistributions become more concentrated around the mean. This means that\n$k$-connected $AB$ random graphs balance the loads of $B$-type nodes more\nevenly as $k$ increases. Finally, we provide a case study on real data of base\nstations. We show that with little shadowing in the distances between users and\nbase stations, the Poisson distribution does not capture the degree\ndistribution of these data, especially for $k>1$. However, under strong\nshadowing, our degree approximations perform quite good even for these\nnon-Poissonian location data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 11:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

This measurement provides\ndirect evidence to the hypothesis that the Galactic cosmic rays can be\naccelerated beyond PeV energies. In this work, we try to explain the sub-PeV\ndiffuse gamma-ray spectrum within cosmic rays diffusive propagation model. We\nfind there is a tension between the sub-PeV diffuse gamma rays and the local\ncosmic ray spectrum. To describe the sub-PeV diffuse gamma-ray flux, it\ngenerally requires larger local cosmic-ray flux than measurement in the knee\nregion. We further calculate the PeV neutrino flux from the cosmic ray\npropagation model. Even all of these sub-PeV diffuse gamma rays originate from\nthe propagation, the Galactic neutrinos only account for less than ~15% of\nobserved flux, most of which are still from extragalactic sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 12:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

A generic Hamiltonian formulation for systems with space-dependent\nbalanced loss and gain is discussed.

Several exactly solvable models based on translational and\nrotational symmetry are discussed which include coupled cubic oscillators,\nLandau Hamiltonian etc. The role of PT-symmetry on the existence of periodic\nsolution in systems with balanced loss and gain is critically analyzed. A few\nnon-PT-symmetric Hamiltonian as well as non-Hamiltonian systems with balanced\nloss and gain, which include mechanical as well as extended system, are shown\nto admit periodic solutions.

An adversary with the capability to perturb the graph might\nmake the shortest path between two nodes route traffic through advantageous\nportions of the graph (e.g., a toll road he owns). In this paper, we introduce\nthe Force Path Cut problem, in which there is a specific route the adversary\nwants to promote by removing a minimum number of edges in the graph. We show\nthat Force Path Cut is NP-complete, but also that it can be recast as an\ninstance of the Weighted Set Cover problem, enabling the use of approximation\nalgorithms. The size of the universe for the set cover problem is potentially\nfactorial in the number of nodes. To overcome this hurdle, we propose the\nPATHATTACK algorithm, which via constraint generation considers only a small\nsubset of paths -- at most 5% of the number of edges in 99% of our experiments.\nAcross a diverse set of synthetic and real networks, the linear programming\nformulation of Weighted Set Cover yields the optimal solution in over 98% of\ncases.

Simulation results show that significant fuel\nsavings can be achieved proportional to the number of velocity events and the\ndifference between current velocity and final desired velocity for each event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 14:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

One example is low-density parity-check (LDPC)\nerror-correcting decoder, which has broad applications in digital\ncommunications and storage. This paper proposes two algorithmic-level\nobfuscation methods for LDPC decoders. By modifying the decoding process and\nlocking the stopping criterion, our new designs substantially degrade the\ndecoder throughput and/or error-correcting performance when the wrong key is\nused. Besides, our designs are also resistant to the SAT, AppSAT and removal\nattacks. For an example LDPC decoder, our proposed methods reduce the\nthroughput to less than 1/3 and/or increase the decoder error rate by at least\ntwo orders of magnitude with only 0.33% area overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 14:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 13:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 23:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

These services often require more\ncomputation resources than can entirely be satisfied on local IoT devices.\nCloud computing is traditionally used to provide unlimited computation\nresources at distant servers. However, such remote computation may not address\nthe short-delay constraints that many of today's IoT applications require. Edge\ncomputing allows offloading computing close to end users to overcome\ncomputation and delay issues. Nonetheless, the edge servers may suffer from\ncomputing inefficiencies. Indeed, some IoT applications are invoked multiple\ntimes by multiple devices. These invocations are often used with the same or\nsimilar input data, which leads to the same computational output (results).\nStill, the edge server willfully executes all received redundant tasks. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of the computation reuse concept at the edge\nserver. We design a network-based computation reuse architecture for IoT\napplications. The architecture stores previously executed results and reuses\nthem to satisfy newly arrived similar tasks instead of performing computation\nfrom scratch.

The eternal distance-$k$ domination number of a graph is the minimum\nnumber of guards needed to defend against any sequence of attacks. The process\nis well-studied for the situation where $k=1$. We introduce eternal\ndistance-$k$ domination for $k > 1$.\n  Determining whether a given set is an eternal distance-$k$ domination set is\nin EXP, and in this paper we provide a number of results for paths and cycles,\nand relate this parameter to graph powers and domination in general. For trees\nwe use decomposition arguments to bound the eternal distance-$k$ domination\nnumbers, and solve the problem entirely in the case of perfect $m$-ary trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 15:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 17:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

In contrast to existing approaches that adopts an integral\nstress-strain constitutive relation, the displacement-driven approach is\npredicated on an integral strain-displacement relation. The most remarkable\nconsequence of this reformulation is that the (total) strain energy is\nguaranteed to be convex and positive-definite without imposing any constraint\non the symmetry of the kernels. This feature is critical to enable the\napplication of nonlocal formulations to general continua exhibiting asymmetric\ninteractions; ultimately a manifestation of material heterogeneity. Remarkably,\nthe proposed approach also enables a strong satisfaction of the locality\nrecovery condition and of the laws of thermodynamics, which are not foregone\nconclusions in most classical nonlocal elasticity theories. Additionally, the\nformulation is frame-invariant and the nonlocal operator remains physically\nconsistent at boundaries. The study is complemented by a detailed analysis of\nthe dynamic response of the nonlocal continuum and of its intrinsic dispersion\nleading to the consideration that the choice of nonlocal kernels should depend\non the specific material. Examples of exponential or power-law kernels are\npresented in order to demonstrate the applicability of the method to different\nclasses of nonlocal media. The ability to admit generalized kernels reinforces\nthe generalized nature of the displacement-driven approach over existing\nintegral methodologies, which typically lead to simplified differential models\nbased on exponential kernels. The theoretical formulation is also leveraged to\nsimulate the static response of nonlocal beams and plates illustrating the\nintrinsic consistency of the approach, which is free from unwanted boundary\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 00:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Video coding standards such as H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC are\nwidely deployed in the market to enable efficient use of bandwidth and storage\nfor many video applications. To reduce the coding artifacts and improve the\ncompression efficiency, neural network based loop filtering of the\nreconstructed video has been developed in the literature. However, loop\nfiltering is a challenging task due to the variation in video content and\nsampling densities. In this paper, we propose a on-line scaling based\nmulti-density attention network for loop filtering in video compression. The\ncore of our approach lies in several aspects: (a) parallel multi-resolution\nconvolution streams for extracting multi-density features, (b) single attention\nbranch to learn the sample correlations and generate mask maps, (c) a\nchannel-mutual attention procedure to fuse the data from multiple branches, (d)\non-line scaling technique to further optimize the output results of network\naccording to the actual signal. The proposed multi-density attention network\nlearns rich features from multiple sampling densities and performs robustly on\nvideo content of different resolutions. Moreover, the online scaling process\nenhances the signal adaptability of the off-line pre-trained model.\nExperimental results show that 10.18% bit-rate reduction at the same video\nquality can be achieved over the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard.\nThe objective performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods and the subjective quality improvement is obvious in\nterms of detail preservation and artifact alleviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 05:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

We first use the zero-bias dense layer\nto increase the explainability of DNN. We provide a solution to convert\nzero-bias DNN classifiers into performance assured binary abnormality\ndetectors. Using the converted abnormality detector, we then present a\nsequential quickest detection scheme that provides the theoretically assured\nlowest abnormal event detection delay under false alarm constraints. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using both massive signal\nrecords from real-world aviation communication systems and simulated data.
