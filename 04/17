The\npresent description tracks the momentum of the particle through a sequence of\nframes in which the electric field vanishes, in the spirit of the original\nFermi scenario. It connects the sources of energy gain (or loss) to the\ngradients of the velocity of the magnetic field lines, in particular the\nacceleration and the shear of their velocity flow projected along the field\nline direction, as well as their compression in the transverse plane. Those\nvelocity gradients are subject to strong intermittency: they are spatially\nlocalized and their strengths obey power law distributions, as demonstrated\nthrough direct measurements in the incompressible MHD simulation of the Johns\nHopkins University database. This intermittency impacts the acceleration\nprocess in a significant way, which opens up prospects for a rich\nphenomenology. In particular, the momentum distribution, which is here captured\nthrough an analytical random walk model, displays extended power law tails with\nsoft-to-hard evolution in time, in general agreement with recent kinetic\nnumerical simulations.

The\ngas physics and chemistry are tightly connected to these dust properties and\nare therefore affected by dust evolution and especially the nano-grain\ndepletion in the outer irradiated part of PDRs. We highlight the influence of\nnano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry in the Horsehead nebula,\na prototypical PDR. We used a model for atomic and molecular gas in PDRs, the\nMeudon PDR code, using diffuse ISM-like dust and Horsehead-like dust to study\nthe influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry,\nfocusing on the impact on photoelectric heating and H2 formation and,\ntherefore, on the H2 gas lines. We find that nano-grain depletion in the\nHorsehead strongly affects gas heating through the photoelectric effect and\nthus the gas temperature and the H2 formation, hence the H -> H2 position.\nConsequently, the first four pure rotational lines of H2 (e.g. 0-0 S(0), S(1),\nS(2), and S(3)) vary by a factor of 2 to 14. The 0-0 S(3) line that is often\nunderestimated in models is underestimated even more when taking nano-grain\ndepletion into account due to the decrease in gas heating through the\nphotoelectric effect. This strongly suggests that our understanding of the\nexcitation of H2 and/or of heating processes in the Horsehead, and more\ngenerally in PDRs, is still incomplete. Nano-grain depletion in the outer part\nof the Horsehead has a strong influence on several gas tracers that will be\nprominent in JWST observations of irradiated clouds.

Examples are phase and amplitude errors, as\nwell as staircase diffractions. Such errors can be reduced in two general ways.\nIn the first approach, the interface can be anti-aliased (i.e., with an\nanti-aliased step-function, or a lowpass filter). Alternatively, the interface\nmay be replaced with an equivalent medium (i.e., using Schoenberg \\& Muir (SM)\ncalculus or orthorhombic averaging). We test these strategies in acoustic,\nelastic isotropic, and elastic anisotropic settings. Computed FD solutions are\ncompared to analytical solutions. We find that in acoustic media, anti-aliasing\nmethods lead to the smallest errors. Conversely, in elastic media, the SM\ncalculus provides the best accuracy. The downside of the SM calculus is that it\nrequires an anisotropic FD solver even to model an interface between two\nisotropic materials. As a result, the computational cost increases compared to\nwhen using isotropic FD solvers. However, since coarser grid spacings can be\nused to represent the dipping interfaces, the two effects (an expensive FD\nsolver on a coarser FD grid) equal out. Hence, the SM calculus can provide an\nefficient means to reduce errors, also in elastic isotropic media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 16:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 13:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

The deconvolved half-light radii of the 220GHz continuum sources are\nbetween <60-350 pc (median 90pc). We associate these regions with the regions\nemitting the bulk of the infrared luminosity. The good agreement, within a\nfactor of 2, between the 220GHz fluxes and the extrapolation of the infrared\ngray-body, and the small synchrotron and free-free contributions support this\nassumption. The cold molecular gas emission sizes, r_CO, are 60-700 pc and are\nsimilar in advanced mergers and early interacting systems. On average, r_CO are\n2.5 times larger than the continuum. We derive L_IR and cold molecular gas\nsurface densities: log Sigma(L_IR)=11.5-14.3 Lsun/kpc^2 and log\nSigma(H2)=2.9-4.2 Msun/pc^2. Assuming that the L_IR is produced by\nstar-formation, this corresponds to median Sigma(SFR)=2500 Msun/yr/kpc^2 which\nwould imply extremely short depletion times, <1-15 Myr, and unphysical SF\nefficiencies >1 for 70% of the sample. Therefore, this favors the presence of\nobscured AGN that could dominate the L_IR. We also classify the ULIRG nuclei in\ntwo groups: (a) compact nuclei (r<130 pc) with high mid-IR excess emission\nfound in optically classified AGN; and (b) nuclei following a relation with\ndecreasing mid-IR excess for decreasing r. 60% of the interacting nuclei lie in\nthe low end (<130 pc) of this relation, while only 30% of the advanced mergers\ndo so, suggesting that in the early interaction phases the activity occurs in\nmore compact and obscured regions.

Here we\naddress the questions whether it is possible to predict gene synchronization\nfrom network structure alone. We have recently shown that synchronized gene\nexpression may be predicted from symmetries in the gene regulatory networks\n(GRN) and described by the concept of symmetry fibrations. We showed that\nsymmetry fibrations partition the genes into groups called fibers based on the\nsymmetries of their 'input trees', the set of paths in the network through\nwhich signals can reach a gene. In idealized dynamic gene expression models,\nall genes in a fiber are perfectly synchronized, while less idealized models -\nwith gene input functions differencing between genes - predict symmetry\nbreaking and desynchronization.\n  Results: To study the functional role of gene fibers and to test whether some\nof the fiber-induced coexpression remains in reality, we analyze gene\nfibrations for the gene regulatory networks of E. coli and B. subtilis and\nconfront them with expression data. We find approximate gene coexpression\npatterns consistent with symmetry fibrations with idealized gene expression\ndynamics. This shows that network structure alone provides useful information\nabout gene synchronization, and suggest that gene input functions within fibers\nmay be further streamlined by evolutionary pressures to realize a coexpression\nof genes.\n  Conclusions: Thus, gene fibrations provides a sound conceptual tool to\ndescribe tunable coexpression induced by network topology and shaped by\nmechanistic details of gene expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 17:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The radio plasma, ejected at nearly light speed from the\ncentral AGN, have displaced the intra-cluster medium, leaving two pairs of\ncavities observable in the X-ray, associated to two different outbursts, and\nhave distributed energy to the surrounding medium. In this work we have\nperformed for the first time a detailed, high-resolution spectral study of the\nsource at radio frequencies and investigated its duty cycle to be compared with\nprevious X-ray estimates. We have used new observations at 144 MHz produced\nwith the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) together with archival data at higher\nfrequencies. At LOFAR frequency, the source presents two large outer radio\nlobes, wider than at higher frequencies, and a smaller Intermediate lobe\nlocated south-west of the core. A new inspection of X-ray data, allowed us to\nidentify an intermediate cavity, associated with that lobe, indicating the\npresence of a further phase of jet activity. The radio lobes have a steep\nspectrum even at LOFAR frequencies, reaching $\\alpha_{144}^{610}=2.9$ in the\nouter lobes and $\\alpha_{144}^{610}=2.1$ in the Intermediate lobe. Fitting the\nlobe spectra using a single injection model of particle ageing, we derived a\ntotal age of the source between 170 and 106 Myr, in agreement with the buoyancy\nand sound crossing time-scales derived from X-ray data. We then reconstructed\nthe duty cycle of the source. There were three phases of jet activity, with the\nAGN being active for most of the time with only brief quiescent phases,\nensuring the repeated heating of the central gas. Finally, energetic estimates\nrevealed that a source of additional pressure support must be present to\nsustain the bubbles against the pressure of the external medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 18:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

As the theory does not\nintroduce extra free parameters, it fits within the minimal six parameter space\nof standard $\\Lambda$CDM.

Inclusion of BAO data however reduces $H_0$, reflecting\nfurthermore systematic deviations from data that are also present in supernova\ndistances and the growth rate of structure (increasing the apparent tension in\nthe latter case). As the theory, unlike other viable $f(T)$ models, does not\nreduce to $\\Lambda$CDM through extra free parameters, those conclusions are\ngeneric; applying to any modified gravity or dynamical dark energy with phantom\nbehaviour.

Increasingly larger batches are particularly appealing in\nsettings where data can be annotated in parallel, and model training is\ncomputationally expensive. A key challenge here is scale - typical active\nlearning methods rely on diversity techniques, which select a diverse set of\ndata points to annotate, from an unlabeled pool.

Compared with our WHT/ISIS spectrum from September 2015, the\nbroad, red wings of the emission lines most closely associated with the flaring\nevent, including HeII(4686), NIII(4100,4640) and HeI(5876), have substantially\ndeclined in flux.

In terms of the nature of the flare event, we speculate that\nthe properties of the F01004-2237 flare may be the result of a tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) occurring in an object with pre-existing AGN activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 18:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In contrast, Asynchronous Parallel\n(ASP) can have higher throughput, but its convergence and accuracy can be\nimpacted by stale gradients. To improve the performance of synchronization\nprotocol, recent work often focuses on designing new protocols with a heavy\nreliance on hard-to-tune hyper-parameters. In this paper, we design a hybrid\nsynchronization approach that exploits the benefits of both BSP and ASP, i.e.,\nreducing training time while simultaneously maintaining the converged accuracy.\nBased on extensive empirical profiling, we devise a collection of adaptive\npolicies that determine how and when to switch between synchronization\nprotocols.

However, some\ncritical problems still exist and are worth more investigation. One of the\nsignificant challenges in the deception detection tasks is the data scarcity\nproblem. Until now, only one multi-modal benchmark open dataset for human\ndeception detection has been released, which contains 121 video clips for\ndeception detection (i.e., 61 for deceptive class and 60 for truthful class).\nSuch an amount of data is hard to drive deep neural network-based methods.\nHence, those existing models often suffer from overfitting problems and low\ngeneralization ability.

We consider an active shape\nmodel, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential\nCAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard\nformulation where pose and shape estimation are formulated as a non-convex\noptimization.

We traced\nmeasured solar wind flows from the spacecraft position down to the surface of\nthe Sun to identify their potential source regions and used a global MHD model\nof the corona and solar wind to relate them to the rotational state of the low\nsolar corona. We identified regions of the solar corona for which solar wind\nspeed and rotational shear are important and long-lived, that can be favourable\nto the development of magnetic deflections and to their propagation across\nextended heights in the solar wind. We show that coronal rotation is highly\nstructured and that enhanced flow shear develops near the boundaries between\ncoronal holes and streamers, around and above pseudo-streamers, even when such\nboundaries are aligned with the direction of solar rotation. A large fraction\nof the switchbacks identified by PSP map back to these regions, both in terms\nof instantaneous magnetic field connectivity and of the trajectories of wind\nstreams that reach the spacecraft. These regions of strong shears are likely to\nleave an imprint on the solar wind over large distances and to increase the\ntransverse speed variability in the slow solar wind.

A major challenge of SWIPT is the\nenergy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive\nlow-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and\nenergy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the\nreceived RF signal is first rectified before being used for information\ndecoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF\ncomponents such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel\nmodulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on\npulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of\nthe pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the\nPeak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's\nnonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the\ninformation can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the\nposition of the pulse in a certain symbol duration.

To harness the benefits of both relaying and RISs, a multi-user\ncommunication system is proposed in this paper wherein a relay and an RIS\ncooperate to improve performance in terms of energy efficiency. Using singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD), semidefinite programming (SDP), and function\napproximations, we propose different solutions for optimizing the beamforming\nmatrices at the base-station (BS), the relay, and the phase shifts at the RIS\nto minimize the total transmit power subject to quality-of-service (QoS)\nconstraints.

Simulation results are provided to\ncompare the performance of the system with and without the RIS or the relay in\nboth full-duplex and half-duplex modes, under different optimization solutions.\nGenerally, the results show that the system with full-duplex relay and RIS\ncooperation outperforms all the other scenarios, and the contribution of\nfull-duplex relay is higher than that of the RIS.

This issue is also pertinent in the\ndevelopment of physics informed neural networks (PINN) for the solution of\npartial differential equations. We introduce geometry-aware trial functions in\nartifical neural networks to improve the training in deep learning for partial\ndifferential equations. To this end, we use concepts from constructive solid\ngeometry (R-functions) and generalized barycentric coordinates (mean value\npotential fields) to construct $\\phi$, an approximate distance function to the\nboundary of a domain. To exactly impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary\nconditions, the trial function is taken as $\\phi$ multiplied by the PINN\napproximation, and its generalization via transfinite interpolation is used to\na priori satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential), Neumann (natural), and\nRobin boundary conditions on complex geometries. In doing so, we eliminate\nmodeling error associated with the satisfaction of boundary conditions in a\ncollocation method and ensure that kinematic admissibility is met pointwise in\na Ritz method.

Most of the existing state-of-the-art solutions are based on deep\nneural networks, which need a large amount of data and heavy computations for\ntraining the models. In this letter, a novel non-learning depth completion\nmethod is proposed by exploiting the local surface geometry that is enhanced by\nan outlier removal algorithm. The proposed surface geometry model is inspired\nby the observation that most pixels with unknown depth have a nearby LiDAR\npoint. Therefore, it is assumed those pixels share the same surface with the\nnearest LiDAR point, and their respective depth can be estimated as the nearest\nLiDAR depth value plus a residual error. The residual error is calculated by\nusing a derived equation with several physical parameters as input, including\nthe known camera intrinsic parameters, estimated normal vector, and offset\ndistance on the image plane. The proposed method is further enhanced by an\noutlier removal algorithm that is designed to remove incorrectly mapped LiDAR\npoints from occluded regions. On KITTI dataset, the proposed solution achieves\nthe best error performance among all existing non-learning methods and is\ncomparable to the best self-supervised learning method and some supervised\nlearning methods. Moreover, since outlier points from occluded regions is a\ncommonly existing problem, the proposed outlier removal algorithm is a general\npreprocessing step that is applicable to many robotic systems with both camera\nand LiDAR sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 06:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Triggered by this analysis we propose a novel classification scheme, in\nwhich the NOTA category is represented as learned vectors, shown empirically to\nbe an appealing option for FSL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 08:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

In many real-world problems though, the utility\nof a decision depends on the underlying context $x$ and decision $y$. However,\ndirectly incorporating these utilities into the learning objective is often\ninfeasible since these can be quite complex and difficult for humans to\nspecify.\n  We formally study this as agnostic learning with unknown utilities: given a\ndataset $S = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ where each data point $x_i \\sim\n\\mathcal{D}$, the objective of the learner is to output a function $f$ in some\nclass of decision functions $\\mathcal{F}$ with small excess risk. This risk\nmeasures the performance of the output predictor $f$ with respect to the best\npredictor in the class $\\mathcal{F}$ on the unknown underlying utility $u^*$.\nThis utility $u^*$ is not assumed to have any specific structure. This raises\nan interesting question whether learning is even possible in our setup, given\nthat obtaining a generalizable estimate of utility $u^*$ might not be possible\nfrom finitely many samples. Surprisingly, we show that estimating the utilities\nof only the sampled points~$S$ suffices to learn a decision function which\ngeneralizes well.\n  We study mechanisms for eliciting information which allow a learner to\nestimate the utilities $u^*$ on the set $S$. We introduce a family of\nelicitation mechanisms by generalizing comparisons, called the $k$-comparison\noracle, which enables the learner to ask for comparisons across $k$ different\ninputs $x$ at once. We show that the excess risk in our agnostic learning\nframework decreases at a rate of $O\\left(\\frac{1}{k} \\right)$. This result\nbrings out an interesting accuracy-elicitation trade-off -- as the order $k$ of\nthe oracle increases, the comparative queries become harder to elicit from\nhumans but allow for more accurate learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 08:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

This is optimal in the sense that as\nlong as the exponent of $T$ is independent of $n, T$, it cannot be improved\nwhile retaining the dependency on $n$; this as follows from the lower bound of\nEden and Rosenbaum [APPROX/RANDOM 2018]. Our algorithm improves upon the state\nof the art when $T = \\omega(1)$ and $T = o(n)$.\n  We also consider the problem of approximate triangle counting in sparse\ngraphs, parameterizing by the number of edges $m$. The best known algorithm\nruns in time $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{m^{3/2}}{T}\\big)$ [Eden et al., SIAM Journal\non Computing, 2017]. There is also a well known algorithm for exact triangle\ncounting that runs in time $\\tilde{O}(m^{2\\omega/(\\omega + 1)})$. We again get\nan algorithm that retains the exponent of $m$ while running faster on graphs\nwith larger number of triangles. Specifically, our algorithm runs in time\n$O\\Big(\\frac{m^{2\\omega/(\\omega+1)}}{ T^{2(\\omega-1)/(\\omega+1)}}\\Big) \\cdot\n\\text{poly}(n^{o(1)}/\\epsilon)$. This is again optimal in the sense that if the\nexponent of $T$ is to be constant, it cannot be improved without worsening the\ndependency on $m$. This algorithm improves upon the state of the art when $T =\n\\omega(1)$ and $T = o(\\sqrt{m})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 09:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 18:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Since radial location of rotation zero-crossing plays a key role in\ndetermining the threshold for field penetration of RMP, plasma response may be\ndifferent in low input torque plasmas. In this work, the linear MHD code MARS-F\nis applied to reveal the dependence of plasma response to RMP on rotation\nzero-crossing by a scan of rotation profiles based on an EAST equilibrium. It\nis shown that the plasma response is enhanced when zero-crossing occurs near\nrational surfaces. The dependence of plasma response on the location of\nrotation zero-crossing is well fitted by a double Gaussian, indicating two\neffects in this enhancement. One is induced by rotation screening effect shown\nas a wide base (with a width around 10-20 krad/s), and the other is related to\nresistive singular layer effect characterized by a localized peak (with a width\naround 3-4 krad/s). The width of the peak scales with the resistive singular\nlayer width. The plasma displacement suggests the response is tearing like when\nzero-crossing is within the singular layer, while it is kink like when\nzero-crossing is far from the layer. The enhancement of magnetic islands width\nat the peak is only around a factor of two, when the absolute value of local\nrotation is not larger than 10-20 krad/s. It is further confirmed in a modeling\nof plasma response in an EAST ELM suppression discharge. Though there is a\nzero-crossing in $E\\times B$ rotation but not in electron perpendicular\nrotation, no significant difference in plasma response is obtained using these\ntwo rotation profiles. This suggests that the rotation near pedestal top should\nnot be far away from zero but may not be necessary to have zero-crossing for\naccessing ELM suppression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 11:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 13:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

In current clinical practice, the ophthalmologist\nmanually detects potential presence of such GA based on fundus autofluorescence\n(FAF) images, and hence diagnoses the disease, when relevant. However, in view\nof the general scarcity of ophthalmologists relative to the large number of\nsubjects seeking eyecare, especially in remote regions, it becomes imperative\nto develop methods to direct expert time and effort to medically significant\ncases. Further, subjects from either disadvantaged background or remote\nlocalities, who face considerable economic/physical barrier in consulting\ntrained ophthalmologists, tend to seek medical attention only after being\nreasonably certain that an adverse condition exists. To serve the interest of\nboth the ophthalmologist and the potential patient, we plan a screening step,\nwhere healthy and diseased eyes are algorithmically differentiated with limited\ninput from only optometrists who are relatively more abundant in number.\nSpecifically, an early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid is\nplaced by an optometrist on each FAF image, based on which sectoral statistics\nare automatically collected. Using such statistics as features, healthy and\ndiseased eyes are proposed to be classified by training an algorithm using\navailable medical records.

Specifically, we consider SVM with linear as\nwell as radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and observe satisfactory\nperformance of both variants. Among those, we recommend the latter in view of\nits slight superiority in terms of classification accuracy (90.55% at a\nstandard training-to-test ratio of 80:20), and practical class-conditional\ncosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 11:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

The goal of multi-perspective answer summarization is to produce\na summary that includes all perspectives of the answer. A major obstacle for\nmulti-perspective, abstractive answer summarization is the absence of a dataset\nto provide supervision for producing such summaries. This work introduces a\nnovel dataset creation method to automatically create multi-perspective,\nbullet-point abstractive summaries from an existing CQA forum. Supervision\nprovided by this dataset trains models to inherently produce multi-perspective\nsummaries. Additionally, to train models to output more diverse, faithful\nanswer summaries while retaining multiple perspectives, we propose a\nmulti-reward optimization technique coupled with a sentence-relevance\nprediction multi-task loss.

A recent proposal of tunable CycleGAN with Adaptive Instance\nNormalization (AdaIN) alleviates the problem in part by using a single\ngenerator.

To solve this problem, here we present a novel\ncycle-free Cycle-GAN architecture, which consists of a single generator and a\ndiscriminator but still guarantees cycle consistency. The main innovation comes\nfrom the observation that the use of an invertible generator automatically\nfulfills the cycle consistency condition and eliminates the additional\ndiscriminator in the CycleGAN formulation. To make the invertible generator\nmore effective, our network is implemented in the wavelet residual domain.\nExtensive experiments using various levels of low-dose CT images confirm that\nour method can significantly improve denoising performance using only 10% of\nlearnable parameters and faster training time compared to the conventional\nCycleGAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 13:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

To achieve better performance, it is necessary\nto train the deep CTR models on huge volume of training data efficiently, which\nmakes speeding up the training process an essential problem. Different from the\nmodels with dense training data, the training data for CTR models is usually\nhigh-dimensional and sparse. To transform the high-dimensional sparse input\ninto low-dimensional dense real-value vectors, almost all deep CTR models adopt\nthe embedding layer, which easily reaches hundreds of GB or even TB. Since a\nsingle GPU cannot afford to accommodate all the embedding parameters, when\nperforming distributed training, it is not reasonable to conduct the\ndata-parallelism only. Therefore, existing distributed training platforms for\nrecommendation adopt model-parallelism. Specifically, they use CPU (Host)\nmemory of servers to maintain and update the embedding parameters and utilize\nGPU worker to conduct forward and backward computations. Unfortunately, these\nplatforms suffer from two bottlenecks: (1) the latency of pull \\& push\noperations between Host and GPU; (2) parameters update and synchronization in\nthe CPU servers. To address such bottlenecks, in this paper, we propose the\nScaleFreeCTR: a MixCache-based distributed training system for CTR models.\nSpecifically, in SFCTR, we also store huge embedding table in CPU but utilize\nGPU instead of CPU to conduct embedding synchronization efficiently.

To overcome these limitations in the EVCS system, this\npaper analyses the impact of False Data Injection (FDI) and Distributed Denial\nof Services (DDoS) attacks on the operation of EVCS. This work is an extension\nof our previously published conference paper about the EVCS. As new features,\nthis paper simulates the FDI attack and the syn flood DDoS attacks on 5G\nenabled remote Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that\ncontrols the solar photovoltaics (PV) controller, Battery Energy Storage (BES)\ncontroller, and EV controller of the EVCS. The attacks make the EVCS system\noscillate or shift the DC operating point. The frequency of oscillation, its\ndamping, and the system's resiliency are found to be related to the attacks'\nintensity and target controller. Finally, we propose the novel stacked Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) solely based\non the electrical fingerprint. This model can detect the stealthy cyberattacks\nthat bypass the cyber layer and go unnoticed in the monitoring system with\nnearly 100% detection accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 14:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Promising\nresults for accurate vessel segmentation have been known. However, their\neffectiveness in segmenting tiny vessels is still limited. In this paper, we\nstudy retinal vessel segmentation by incorporating tiny vessel segmentation\ninto our framework for the overall accurate vessel segmentation. To achieve\nthis, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which divides\nvessel segmentation into two separate objectives. Specifically, we consider the\noverall accurate vessel segmentation and tiny vessel segmentation as two\nindividual objectives. Then, by exploiting the objective-dependent\n(homoscedastic) uncertainty, we enable the network to learn both objectives\nsimultaneously. Further, to improve the individual objectives, we propose: (a)\na vessel weight map based auxiliary loss for enhancing tiny vessel connectivity\n(i.e., improving tiny vessel segmentation), and (b) an enhanced encoder-decoder\narchitecture for improved localization (i.e., for accurate vessel\nsegmentation). Using 3 public retinal vessel segmentation datasets (CHASE_DB1,\nDRIVE, and STARE), we verify the superiority of our proposed framework in\nsegmenting tiny vessels (8.3% average improvement in sensitivity) while\nachieving better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 14:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Most existing cache channels exploit the timing difference\nbetween cache hits and cache misses. However, we introduce a new and broader\nclassification of cache covert channel attacks: Hit+Miss, Hit+Hit, and\nMiss+Miss. We highlight that cache misses for cache lines in different states\nmay have more significant time differences, and these can be used as timing\nchannels. Based on this classification, we propose a new stable and stealthy\nMiss+Miss cache channel. Write-back caches are widely deployed in modern\nprocessors. This paper presents in detail a way in which replacement latency\ndifferences can be used to construct timing-based channels (called WB channels)\nto leak information in a write-back cache. Any modification to a cache line by\na sender will set it to the dirty state, and the receiver can observe this\nthrough measuring the latency of replacing this cache set. We also demonstrate\nhow senders could exploit a different number of dirty cache lines in a cache\nset to improve transmission bandwidth with symbols encoding multiple bits. The\npeak transmission bandwidths of the WB channels in commercial systems can vary\nbetween 1300 and 4400~kbps per cache set in a hyper-threaded setting without\nshared memory between the sender and the receiver. In contrast to most existing\ncache channels, which always target specific memory addresses, the new WB\nchannels focus on the cache set and cache line states, making it difficult for\nthe channel to be disturbed by other processes on the core, and they can still\nwork in a cache using a random replacement policy. We also analyzed the\nstealthiness of WB channels from the perspective of the number of cache loads\nand cache miss rates. We discuss and evaluate possible defenses. The paper\nfinishes by discussing various forms of side-channel attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 14:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Hence, state-of-the-art approaches\nto multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or few-shot) cross-lingual transfer\nfrom resource-rich languages (almost exclusively English), either by means of\nmachine translation or multilingual representations. These approaches are\ncurrently viable only for typologically similar languages and languages with\nparallel / monolingual corpora available. On the other hand, their\neffectiveness beyond these boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the\nlack of linguistically diverse benchmarks (especially for natural language\ngeneration and end-to-end evaluation). To overcome this limitation, we draw\nparallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks, which can\ninspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list\nadditional challenges that multilinguality poses for related areas (such as\nspeech and human-centred evaluation), and indicate future directions that hold\npromise to further expand language coverage and dialogue capabilities of\ncurrent ToD systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 15:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 12:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 00:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

Overcoming catastrophic forgetting is of significant importance to\nemulate the process of \"incremental learning\", where the model is capable of\nlearning from sequential experience in an efficient and robust way.\nState-of-the-art techniques for incremental learning make use of knowledge\ndistillation towards preventing catastrophic forgetting.

This in practice is done by\nminimizing the dissimilarity between current and previous responses of the\nnetwork one way or another.
