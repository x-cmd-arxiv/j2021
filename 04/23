However, rather than normal diffusion, anomalous\nsubdiffusion is observed in many systems and is especially prevalent in cell\nbiology. What are the reaction-subdiffusion equations describing a system that\ninvolves first-order reactions and subdiffusive motion? In this paper, we\nanswer this question. We derive fractional reaction-subdiffusion equations\ndescribing an arbitrary number of molecular species which react at first-order\nrates and move subdiffusively with general space-dependent diffusivities and\ndrifts. Importantly, different species may have different diffusivities and\ndrifts, which contrasts previous approaches to this question which assume that\neach species has the same movement dynamics. We derive the equations by\ncombining results on time-dependent fractional Fokker-Planck equations with\nmethods of analyzing stochastically switching evolution equations.

This\nstochastic description involves subordinating a diffusion process whose\ndynamics are controlled by a subordinated Markov jump process. We illustrate\nour results in several examples and show that solutions of the\nreaction-subdiffusion equations agree with stochastic simulations of individual\nmolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 16:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

Hence, trust is a necessary\ncondition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). Despite its crucial role, it is\nlargely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human interactions\nwith nonhuman artefacts. Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot\ninteraction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early\nmodels of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and\ncompetence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of\nshared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then\nintroduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory\nexchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the\ncognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of\nHRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In\nthis setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the\ntrustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important\nimplications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it\nallows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of\nactive inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model\nsuggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and\nover-reliance on the system. Finally, we examine the role of shared behavior in\nthe genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration,\nsuggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of\nhuman-robot collaborative systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 16:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

Gault is an asteroid belonging to the Phocaea dynamical family and\nwas not previously known to be active, nor was any other member of the Phocaea\nfamily. In this work we present the results of photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations that commenced soon after the discovery of activity.

We find that\nGault has a rotation period of $P = 2.4929 \\pm 0.0003$ hours with a lightcurve\namplitude of $0.06$ magnitude. This short rotation period close to the spin\nbarrier limit is consistent with Gault having a density no smaller than $\\rho =\n1.85$~g/cm$^3$ and its activity being triggered by the YORP spin-up mechanism.\nAnalysis of the Gault phase curve over phase angles ranging from $0.4^{\\circ}$\nto $23.6^{\\circ}$ provides an absolute magnitude of $H = 14.81 \\pm 0.04$,\n$G1=0.25 \\pm 0.07$, and $G2= 0.38 \\pm 0.04$.

We further propose the method to predict interaction\nclasses by estimating the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the\nmanipulated objects, jointly from RGB images. Our method models both inter- and\nintra-dependencies between both hands and objects by learning the topology of a\ngraph convolutional network that predicts interactions. We show that our method\nfacilitated by this dataset establishes a strong baseline for joint hand-object\npose estimation and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for first person\ninteraction recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 17:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 15:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

This system of equations, though, is\nunderdetermined and has to be accompanied by constraining supplementary\nconditions, even in its simplest version, which is the pole-dipole\napproximation corresponding to a spinning test body. In particular, imposing a\nspin supplementary condition (SSC) fixes the center of the mass of the spinning\nbody, i.e. the centroid of the body. In the present study, we examine whether\ncharacteristic features of the centroid of a spinning test body, moving in a\ncircular equatorial orbit around a massive black hole, are preserved under the\ntransition to another centroid of the same physical body, governed by a\ndifferent SSC. For this purpose, we establish an analytical algorithm for\nderiving the orbital frequency of a spinning body, moving in the background of\nan arbitrary, stationary, axisymmetric spacetime with reflection symmetry, for\nthe Tulzcyjew-Dixon, the Mathisson-Pirani and the Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\\'{a}k\nSSCs. Then, we focus on the Schwarzschild black hole background and a power\nseries expansion method is developed, in order to investigate the discrepancies\nin the orbital frequencies expanded in power series of the spin among the\ndifferent SSCs. Lastly, by employing the fact that the position of the centroid\nand the measure of the spin alters under the centroid's transition, we impose\nproper corrections to the power expansion of the orbital frequencies, which\nallows to improve the convergence between the SSCs. Our concluding argument is\nthat when we shift from one circular equatorial orbit to another in the\nSchwarzschild background, under the change of a SSC, the convergence between\nthe SSCs holds only up to certain powers in the spin expansion, and it cannot\nbe achieved for the whole power series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 17:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Most of current researches\nmainly deploy efforts to categorize an aerial image into one scene-level label,\nwhile in real-world scenarios, there often exist multiple scenes in a single\nimage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to take a step forward to a more\npractical and challenging task, namely multi-scene recognition in single\nimages. Moreover, we note that manually yielding annotations for such a task is\nextraordinarily time- and labor-consuming. To address this, we propose a\nprototype-based memory network to recognize multiple scenes in a single image\nby leveraging massive well-annotated single-scene images. The proposed network\nconsists of three key components: 1) a prototype learning module, 2) a\nprototype-inhabiting external memory, and 3) a multi-head attention-based\nmemory retrieval module. To be more specific, we first learn the prototype\nrepresentation of each aerial scene from single-scene aerial image datasets and\nstore it in an external memory. Afterwards, a multi-head attention-based memory\nretrieval module is devised to retrieve scene prototypes relevant to query\nmulti-scene images for final predictions. Notably, only a limited number of\nannotated multi-scene images are needed in the training phase. To facilitate\nthe progress of aerial scene recognition, we produce a new multi-scene aerial\nimage (MAI) dataset. Experimental results on variant dataset configurations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our network. Our dataset and codes are\npublicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 17:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

However, most RL algorithms use a carefully\nengineered setup in order to collect data, requiring human supervision and\nintervention to provide episodic resets. This is particularly evident in\nchallenging robotics problems, such as dexterous manipulation. To make data\ncollection scalable, such applications require reset-free algorithms that are\nable to learn autonomously, without explicit instrumentation or human\nintervention. Most prior work in this area handles single-task learning.\nHowever, we might also want robots that can perform large repertoires of\nskills. At first, this would appear to only make the problem harder. However,\nthe key observation we make in this work is that an appropriately chosen\nmulti-task RL setting actually alleviates the reset-free learning challenge,\nwith minimal additional machinery required. In effect, solving a multi-task\nproblem can directly solve the reset-free problem since different combinations\nof tasks can serve to perform resets for other tasks. By learning multiple\ntasks together and appropriately sequencing them, we can effectively learn all\nof the tasks together reset-free. This type of multi-task learning can\neffectively scale reset-free learning schemes to much more complex problems, as\nwe demonstrate in our experiments. We propose a simple scheme for multi-task\nlearning that tackles the reset-free learning problem, and show its\neffectiveness at learning to solve complex dexterous manipulation tasks in both\nhardware and simulation without any explicit resets. This work shows the\nability to learn dexterous manipulation behaviors in the real world with RL\nwithout any human intervention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 17:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

Holographic aperture masking (HAM) aims at (i)\nincreasing the throughput of sparse aperture masking (SAM) by selectively\ncombining all subapertures across a telescope pupil in multiple interferograms\nusing a phase mask, and (ii) adding low-resolution spectroscopic capabilities.\nUsing liquid-crystal geometric phase patterns, we manufacture a HAM mask that\nuses an 11-hole SAM design as the central component and a holographic component\ncomprising 19 different subapertures. Thanks to a multilayer liquid-crystal\nimplementation, the mask has a diffraction efficiency higher than 96% from 1.1\nto 2.5 micron.

For instance, when resizing an\nimage, e.g., with a bilinear or bicubic kernel, signal processing principles\nmandate adjusting prefilter width depending on the downsampling factor, to\nantialias to the appropriate bandwidth. However, commonly-used implementations\nuse a fixed-width prefilter, resulting in aliasing artifacts. Such aliasing\nleads to corruptions in the feature extraction downstream. Next, lossy\ncompression, such as JPEG, is commonly used to reduce the file size of an\nimage. Although designed to minimally degrade the perceptual quality of an\nimage, the operation also produces variations downstream.

One of\nthe later additions, Gaia-Enceladus, has contributed a considerable mass to the\ninner Galaxy, but also generously donated to the outer halo. So far,\nassociations with present-day MW globular clusters (GCs) have been chiefly\nbased on their kinematics and ages. Here, we present a chemical abundance study\nof the outer halo (R$_{\\rm GC}$=18 kpc) GC NGC 1261, which has been suggested\nto be an accreted object. We measured 31 species of 29 elements in two stars\nfrom high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra and find that the cluster is\nmoderately metal poor, at [Fe/H]=-1.26. NGC 1261 is moderately\n$\\alpha$-enhanced to the 0.3-dex level. While from the small sample alone it is\ndifficult to assert any abundance correlations, the light elements Na,O,Mg, and\nAl differ significantly between the two stars in contrast to the majority of\nother elements with smaller scatter; this argues in favour of multiple\ngenerations of stars coexisting in this GC. Intriguingly for its metallicity,\nNGC 1261 shows heavy element abundances that are consistent with $r$-process\nnucleosynthesis and we discuss their origin in various sites. In particular the\nEu overabundance quantitatively suggests that one single $r$-process event,\nsuch as a neutron-star neutron-star merger or a rare kind of supernova, can be\nresponsible for the stellar enhancement or even the enrichment of the cluster\nwith the excess $r$-material. Its heavy element pattern makes NGC 1261 resemble\nthe moderately enhanced r-I stars that are commonly found in the halo and have\nbeen detected in Gaia-Enceladus as well. Therefore, combining all kinematical,\nage, and chemical evidence we conclude that NGC 1261 is a chemically intriguing\nGC that was born in Gaia-Enceladus and has been subsequently accreted into the\nMW halo.

However, questions, including\nhow the torus mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray emission are related remain\nunanswered. In this work, we study whether the dust continuum at mid-IR and gas\nreflection at X-rays have the same distribution in a sample of AGN. We\ncarefully selected a sample of 36 nearby AGN with NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra\navailable in both archives. We derived the properties of the nuclear dust and\ngas through a spectral fitting, using models developed for mid-IR and X-ray\nwavelengths assuming smooth and clumpy distributions for this structure. We\nfound that a combination of smooth and clumpy distributions of gas and dust,\nrespectively, is preferred for ~80% of sources with good spectral fits\naccording to the Akaike criterion. However, considering extra information about\neach individual source, such as the absorption variability, we found that ~50%\nof our sources are best described by a clumpy distribution of both dust and\ngas.

The results presented in\nthis paper suggest that the distribution of the gas and dust in AGN is complex.\nWe find at least six scenarios to explain the observed properties of our\nsample.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the\nstate-of-the-art method for various computer vision tasks, has had limited\nsuccess in predicting expressions from faces having extreme poses,\nillumination, and occlusion conditions. To mitigate this issue, CNNs are often\naccompanied by techniques like transfer, multi-task, or ensemble learning that\noften provide high accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity.\nIn this work, we propose a Part-based Ensemble Transfer Learning network that\nmodels how humans recognize facial expressions by correlating the spatial\norientation pattern of the facial features with a specific expression.

To make matters worse, many tables do not have\nmachine-readable data, such as tables saved as images, making most extraction\nmethods completely ineffective. In order to address these issues, a novel,\ngeneral format table extractor tool, Tablext, is proposed. This tool uses a\ncombination of computer vision techniques and machine learning methods to\nefficiently and effectively identify and extract data from tables. Tablext\nbegins by using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and\nseparate all potential tables. The identification process is optimized by\ncombining the custom CNN with the YOLO object detection network. Then, the\nhigh-level structure of each table is identified with computer vision methods.\nThis high-level, structural meta-data is used by another CNN to identify exact\ncell locations. As a final step, Optical Characters Recognition (OCR) is\nperformed on every individual cell to extract their content without needing\nmachine-readable text. This multi-stage algorithm allows for the neural\nnetworks to focus on completing complex tasks, while letting image processing\nmethods efficiently complete the simpler ones.

As an alternative, self-supervised methods are becoming\nmore popular to mitigate this challenge.

Stereo correspondences are further enhanced by incorporating\nsemantic information to the proposed attention mechanism. More specifically,\nthe optimal transport algorithm is used to suppress attention and eliminate\noutliers in areas not visible in both cameras.

For each\nchurch, we measured the azimuth and the angular height of the horizon taken in\nthe direction towards which the altar of each temple points.

Finally, for the study of the sample, various\nanalyzes were carried out: statistical, calendarical and orographic, trying to\nfind clues that would allow us to understand the pattern of orientations found.\nFrom this analysis, we can infer that in some places the canonical tradition of\norienting Christian temples in the solar range was respected.

Roughly, the operator shifting technique is a matrix analogue of the\nJames-Stein estimator. The key insight is that a shift of the matrix inverse\nestimate in an appropriately chosen direction will reduce average error. In our\nextension, we interrogate a number of questions -- namely, whether or not\nshifting towards the origin for general matrix inverses always reduces error as\nit does in the elliptic case.

To survive they must avoid predation and\nfind efficient energy sources. A major difficulty in analysing possible\nsurvival strategies is that the time series of environmental cues in non-linear\nflow is complex, and that it depends on the decisions taken by the organism.\nOne way of determining and evaluating optimal strategies is reinforcement\nlearning. In a proof-of-principle study, Colabrese et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n(2017)] used this method to find out how a micro-swimmer in a vortex flow can\nnavigate towards the surface as quickly as possible, given a fixed swimming\nspeed. The swimmer measured its instantaneous swimming direction and the local\nflow vorticity in the laboratory frame, and reacted to these cues by swimming\neither left, right, up, or down. However, usually a motile microorganism\nmeasures the local flow rather than global information, and it can only react\nin relation to the local flow, because in general it cannot access global\ninformation (such as up or down in the laboratory frame). Here we analyse\noptimal strategies with local signals and actions that do not refer to the\nlaboratory frame. We demonstrate that symmetry-breaking is required in order to\nlearn vertical migration in a meaningful way.

However,\nthe long time series or large sample size attributes to high power and time\nconsumption in data collection for both training and testing. This will also\nundoubtedly be detrimental to user experience as the waiting time of getting\nenough samples is quite long. Therefore, this paper proposes a new real-time\nNLOS/LOS identification method for smartphone-based indoor positioning system\nusing WiFi RTT and RSS. Based on our extensive analysis of RSS and RTT\nfeatures, a machine learning-based method using random forest was chosen and\ndeveloped to separate the samples for NLOS/LOS conditions.

Therefore, video stream companies\nadopted cloud technology to store their video streams. Generally, having all\nvideo streams stored in one type of cloud storage, the cost rises gradually.\nMore importantly, the variation of the access pattern to frequently accessed\nvideo streams impacts negatively the storage cost and increases it\nsignificantly. To optimize storage usage and lower its cost, we propose a\nmethod that manages the cloud hierarchy storage.

Most\nresonances are located at high spin values above 960 times the mean motion\n(such as 964:1 or 4169:4), corresponding to rotation periods of a few days.

These\ntwo objectives are known to be typically in competition, but it is not known\nhow to simultaneously optimize them. We consider this problem through the lens\nof multi-objective optimization theory: we develop a genetic algorithm to\ncompute the Pareto fronts characterizing the tradeoff between equilibrium\nprobability and folding rate, for a model system of small polymers of colloids\nwith tunable short-ranged interaction energies. We use a coarse-grained model\nfor the particles' dynamics that allows us to efficiently search over\nparameters, for systems small enough to be enumerated. For most target states\nthere is a tradeoff when the number of types of particles is small, with\nmedium-weak bonds favouring fast folding, and strong bonds favouring high\nequilibrium probability. The tradeoff disappears when the number of particle\ntypes reaches a value $m_*$, that is usually much less than the total number of\nparticles. This general approach of computing Pareto fronts allows one to\nidentify the minimum number of design parameters to avoid a\nthermodynamic-kinetic tradeoff. However, we argue, by contrasting our\ncoarse-grained model's predictions with those of Brownian dynamics simulations,\nthat particles with short-ranged isotropic interactions should generically have\na tradeoff, and avoiding it in larger systems will require\norientation-dependent interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 19:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

The actual task typically requires a\nmuch longer horizon than is computationally tractable, and is specified via a\ncost function that cumulates over that full horizon. For instance, an\nautonomous car may have a cost function that makes a desired trade-off between\nefficiency, safety, and obeying traffic laws. In this work, we challenge the\ncommon assumption that the cost we optimize using MPC should be the same as the\nground truth cost for the task (plus a terminal cost). MPC solvers can suffer\nfrom short planning horizons, local optima, incorrect dynamics models, and,\nimportantly, fail to account for future replanning ability. Thus, we propose\nthat in many tasks it could be beneficial to purposefully choose a different\ncost function for MPC to optimize: one that results in the MPC rollout having\nlow ground truth cost, rather than the MPC planned trajectory. We formalize\nthis as an optimal cost design problem, and propose a zeroth-order\noptimization-based approach that enables us to design optimal costs for an MPC\nplanning robot in continuous MDPs. We test our approach in an autonomous\ndriving domain where we find costs different from the ground truth that\nimplicitly compensate for replanning, short horizon, incorrect dynamics models,\nand local minima issues. As an example, the learned cost incentivizes MPC to\ndelay its decision until later, implicitly accounting for the fact that it will\nget more information in the future and be able to make a better decision.

An endeavor\nduring the past 16 years viewing causality as real physical notion so as to\nformulate it from first principles, however, seems to go unnoticed. This study\nintroduces to the community this line of work, with a long-due generalization\nof the information flow-based bivariate time series causal inference to\nmultivariate series, based on the recent advance in theoretical development.\nThe resulting formula is transparent, and can be implemented as a\ncomputationally very efficient algorithm for application. It can be normalized,\nand tested for statistical significance. Different from the previous work along\nthis line where only information flows are estimated, here an algorithm is also\nimplemented to quantify the influence of a unit to itself. While this forms a\nchallenge in some causal inferences, here it comes naturally, and hence the\nidentification of self-loops in a causal graph is fulfilled automatically as\nthe causalities along edges are inferred.\n  To demonstrate the power of the approach, presented here are two applications\nin extreme situations. The first is a network of multivariate processes buried\nin heavy noises (with the noise-to-signal ratio exceeding 100), and the second\na network with nearly synchronized chaotic oscillators. In both graphs,\nconfounding processes exist. While it seems to be a huge challenge to\nreconstruct from given series these causal graphs, an easy application of the\nalgorithm immediately reveals the desideratum. Particularly, the confounding\nprocesses have been accurately differentiated. Considering the surge of\ninterest in the community, this study is very timely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

In this paper we\nlook at how different trust questionnaires fare given these challenges that\npull in different directions (being general vs. being exploratory) by studying\nwhether people think the items in these questionnaires are applicable to\ndifferent kinds of robots and interactions. In Study 1 we show that after being\npresented with a robot (non-humanoid) and an interaction scenario (fire\nevacuation), participants rated multiple questionnaire items such as \"This\nrobot is principled\" as \"Non-applicable to robots in general\" or\n\"Non-applicable to this robot\".

Finally,\nwhile overall trust scores remained robust to N/A ratings, our results revealed\npotential fallacies in the way these scores are commonly interpreted.

A common query categorization task is to select the relevant\nfine-grained product categories in a product taxonomy.

However, for more rare queries, which cover a\nlarge volume of search traffic, relying solely on customer behavior may not\nsuffice due to the lack of this signal. To improve categorization of rare\nqueries, we adapt the Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) approach to utilize the\nlatent knowledge embedded in semantically or lexically similar product\ndocuments to enrich the representation of the more rare queries. To this end,\nwe propose a novel deep neural model named Attentive Pseudo Relevance Feedback\nNetwork (APRF-Net) to enhance the representation of rare queries for query\ncategorization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect\nsearch queries from a large commercial search engine, and compare APRF-Net to\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models for text classification.

The generation mechanism is still\nmysterious. We have proposed a generation mechanism of both repeating and\none-off FRBs. They arise from the axion star collision with neutron star or\nmagnetized accretion disk of galactic black hole. Once we accept the existence\nof the axions, we find that the mechanism well explain previously observed\nspectral-temporal features. In this paper we show that it also explains\nrecently observed phenomena such as downward drifting in the repeating FRBs,\netc.. Analysis of the downward drifting based on Doppler effects has been\npresented in recent papers, in which a superradiance system of molecular or\natom has been proposed as a source of FRBs. We apply the analysis to our\nmechanism and find that it well explains the relation between the downward\ndrifting rate and the duration of the repeating FRBs. The Doppler effects lead\nto the fact that the duration of radio burst with higher center frequency is\nshorter than that of radio burst with lower center frequency in the repeating\nFRBs. Our generation mechanism naturally explain polarization angle swing\nobserved in the repeating FRB180301 and one-off FRBs.

Designing interactive QA systems has always been a\nchallenging task in natural language processing and used as a benchmark to\nevaluate a machine's ability of natural language understanding. However, such\nsystems often struggle when the question answering is carried out in multiple\nturns by the users to seek more information based on what they have already\nlearned, thus, giving rise to another complicated form called Conversational\nQuestion Answering (CQA). CQA systems are often criticized for not\nunderstanding or utilizing the previous context of the conversation when\nanswering the questions. To address the research gap, in this paper, we explore\nhow to integrate conversational history into the neural machine comprehension\nsystem. On one hand, we introduce a framework based on a publically available\npre-trained language model called BERT for incorporating history turns into the\nsystem. On the other hand, we propose a history selection mechanism that\nselects the turns that are relevant and contributes the most to answer the\ncurrent question. Experimentation results revealed that our framework is\ncomparable in performance with the state-of-the-art models on the QuAC leader\nboard. We also conduct a number of experiments to show the side effects of\nusing entire context information which brings unnecessary information and noise\nsignals resulting in a decline in the model's performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 03:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

In this paper, we propose a non-invasive fast method of\nusing infant cry signals with convolutional neural network (CNN) based age\nclassification to diagnose the abnormality of the vocal tract development as\nearly as 4-month age. We study F0, F1, F2, and spectrograms and relate them to\nthe postnatal development of infant vocalization. A novel CNN based age\nclassification is performed with binary age pairs to discover the pattern and\ntendency of the vocal tract changes. The effectiveness of this approach is\nevaluated on Baby2020 with healthy infant cries and Baby Chillanto database\nwith pathological infant cries. The results show that our approach yields\n79.20% accuracy for healthy cries, 84.80% for asphyxiated cries, and 91.20% for\ndeaf cries. Our method first reveals that infants' vocal tract develops to a\ncertain level at 4-month age and infants can start controlling the vocal folds\nto produce discontinuous cry sounds leading to babbling. Early diagnosis of\ngrowth abnormality of the vocal tract can help parents keep vigilant and adopt\nmedical treatment or training therapy for their infants as early as possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 03:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

However, some quantum algorithms and the corresponding\nquantum circuits can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer if the\ninput quantum state is a low-rank tensor and all intermediate states of the\nquantum algorithm can be represented or approximated by low-rank tensors. In\nthis paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms\nby using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input\nand all intermediate states of these algorithms. Two rank reduction algorithms\nare used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms\npreserve the low-rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently\nsimulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states\nin other quantum algorithms can increase rapidly, making efficient simulation\nmore difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or\nsuperiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer. As a result,\nunderstanding the low-rank structure of a quantum algorithm allows us to\nidentify algorithms that can benefit significantly from quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 03:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

UO2 is\na paramagnet at room temperature. The magnetic susceptibility, however,\ndeviates from Curie-Weiss (CW) like paramagnetic behavior below T = 280 K.\nFurther down the temperature UO2 undergoes phase transition to an\nantiferromagnetic state below TN = 30.6 K. The zero field cooled (ZFC) and\nfield cooled (FC) magnetizations exhibit some distinct thermomagnetic\nirreversibility below TN. The temperature dependence of the FC magnetization is\nmore like a ferromagnet, whereas ZFC magnetization exhibits distinct structures\nnot usually observed in the antiferromagnets. In low applied magnetic field\nthis thermomagnetic irreversibility in magnetization exists in a subtle way\neven in the paramagnetic regime above TN up to a fairly high temperature, but\nvanishes in high applied magnetic fields. Deviation from CW law and\nirreversibility between ZFC and FC magnetization indicate that the paramagnetic\nstate above TN is not a trivial one. Magnetic response below TN changes\nsignificantly with the increase in the applied magnetic field.

They are the leading cause of death in\npatients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs). Positron emission\ntomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is regarded as the imaging modality of\nchoice for the management of STSs. It is difficult to determine from imaging\nstudies which STS patients will develop metastases. 'Radiomics' refers to the\nextraction and analysis of quantitative features from medical images and it has\nbeen employed to help identify such tumors. The state-of-the-art in radiomics\nis based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Most CNNs are designed for\nsingle-modality imaging data (CT or PET alone) and do not exploit the\ninformation embedded in PET-CT where there is a combination of an anatomical\nand functional imaging modality. Furthermore, most radiomic methods rely on\nmanual input from imaging specialists for tumor delineation, definition and\nselection of radiomic features. This approach, however, may not be scalable to\ntumors with complex boundaries and where there are multiple other sites of\ndisease. We outline a new 3D CNN to help predict DM in STS patients from PET-CT\ndata. The 3D CNN uses a constrained feature learning module and a hierarchical\nmulti-modality feature learning module that leverages the complementary\ninformation from the modalities to focus on semantically important regions. Our\nresults on a public PET-CT dataset of STS patients show that multi-modal\ninformation improves the ability to identify those patients who develop DM.\nFurther our method outperformed all other related state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 05:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Besides the difficulties commonly discussed, the challenges of\nthis task also come from the ambiguous labels provided by annotators, since\ndeep learning models may learn, even amplify, the bias embedded in them. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-view \"divide-and-rule\" (MV-DAR) model to learn\nfrom both reliable and ambiguous annotations for lung nodule malignancy\nprediction. According to the consistency and reliability of their annotations,\nwe divide nodules into three sets: a consistent and reliable set (CR-Set), an\ninconsistent set (IC-Set), and a low reliable set (LR-Set). The nodule in\nIC-Set is annotated by multiple radiologists inconsistently, and the nodule in\nLR-Set is annotated by only one radiologist. The proposed MV-DAR contains three\nDAR submodels to characterize a lung nodule from three orthographic views. Each\nDAR consists of a prediction network (Prd-Net), a counterfactual network\n(CF-Net), and a low reliable network (LR-Net), learning on CR-Set, IC-Set, and\nLR-Set, respectively. The image representation ability learned by CF-Net and\nLR-Net is then transferred to Prd-Net by negative-attention module (NA-Module)\nand consistent-attention module (CA-Module), aiming to boost the prediction\nability of Prd-Net. The MV-DAR model has been evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI\ndataset and LUNGx dataset. Our results indicate not only the effectiveness of\nthe proposed MV-DAR model in learning from ambiguous labels but also its\nsuperiority over present noisy label-learning models in lung nodule malignancy\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

The long-term scenarios\nsuggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and\ntargets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to-month collision rates (by half)\ncould have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this\nscenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations\nsuggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044.\nThe main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting\nunreasonable safety targets that are often missed.

We conduct the theoretical analysis about the\neffectiveness of RND against query-based black-box attacks and the\ncorresponding adaptive attacks. Our theoretical results reveal that the defense\nperformance of RND is determined by the magnitude ratio between the noise\ninduced by RND and the noise added by the attackers for gradient estimation or\nlocal search.

Here, we use optimization techniques to squeeze the charge\ndistribution of Abelian anyons in lattice fractional quantum Hall models, and\nwe show that the squeezed anyons can be exchanged within a smaller area with a\nclose to ideal outcome.

We address these issues by providing a formal framework for\ndecentralised monitoring of LTL formulas with quantitative operators.

Several explanations have been proposed to explain this\ndifference, including various Li depletion processes as well as non standard\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis, but the main question remains unanswered. In this\npaper, we present detailed chemical evolution models for dwarf spheroidal and\nultra faint galaxies, compute the galactic evolution of 7Li abundance in these\nobjects and compare it with observations of similar objects. In our models, Li\nis mainly produced by novae and cosmic rays and to a minor extent by low and\nintermediate mass stars. We adopt the yield combination which best fits the Li\nabundances in the Milky Way stars. It is evident that the observations of dwarf\nobjects define a Spite plateau, identical to that observed in the Milky Way,\nthus suggesting that the Spite plateau could be a universal feature and its\nmeaning should be discussed. The predictions of our models for dwarf galaxies,\nare obtained by assuming as Li primordial abundance either the one detected in\nthe atmospheres of the oldest halo stars (Spite plateau; A(Li)=2.2 dex), or the\none from cosmological observations (WMAP; A(Li)=2.66 dex).

While\nimpressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied\nwhenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the\npresence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by\nintegrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose\nfor converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of\nconvolutionally low-rank.

The strict constraint of ultra-reliability corresponds to the packet\nerror rate (PER) in the range of $10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ within the acceptable\nlatency on the order of milliseconds. Extreme value theory (EVT) is a robust\nframework for modeling the statistical behavior of extreme events in the\nchannel data. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on EVT to model the\nextreme events of a non-stationary wireless channel for the ultra-reliable\nregime of operation. This methodology includes techniques for splitting the\nchannel data sequence into multiple groups concerning the environmental factors\ncausing non-stationarity, and fitting the lower tail distribution of the\nreceived power in each group to the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). The\nproposed approach also consists of optimally determining the time-varying\nthreshold over which the tail statistics are derived as a function of time, and\nassessing the validity of the derived Pareto model. Finally, the proposed\napproach chooses the best model with minimum complexity that represents the\ntime variation behavior of the non-stationary channel data sequence. Based on\nthe data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea under various\nengine vibrations and driving scenarios, we demonstrate the capability of the\nproposed methodology in providing the best fit to the extremes of the\nnon-stationary data, significantly outperforming the channel modeling approach\nin characterizing the extreme events with the stationary channel assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 10:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

We show that\neven under this bias polarization eventually vanishes (converges to zero) if\nthe influence graph is strongly-connected. If the influence graph is a regular\nsymmetric circulation, we determine the unique belief value to which all agents\nconverge. Our more insightful result establishes that, under some natural\nassumptions, if polarization does not eventually vanish then either there is a\ndisconnected subgroup of agents, or some agent influences others more than she\nis influenced.

While, the latter one directly\nextracts multi-modal features from the input RGB-D images and then focuses on\nexploiting cross-level complementary information. However, two-stream structure\nbased models inevitably require more parameters and single-stream structure\nbased ones cannot well exploit the cross-modal complementary information since\nthey ignore the modality difference. To address these issues, we propose to\nemploy the middle-level fusion structure for designing lightweight RGB-D SOD\nmodel in this paper, which first employs two sub-networks to extract low- and\nmiddle-level unimodal features, respectively, and then fuses those extracted\nmiddle-level unimodal features for extracting corresponding high-level\nmulti-modal features in the subsequent sub-network.

To address these issues we present four novel contributions.\nFirstly, we define an arbitrary task in terms of perceptual states, and discuss\ntwo extremes of a domain of possible solutions. Secondly, we define the\nintensional solution. Optimal by some definitions of intelligence, it describes\nthe purpose of a task. An agent possessed of it has a rationale for its\ndecisions in terms of that purpose, expressed in a perceptual symbol system\ngrounded in hardware. Thirdly, to communicate that rationale requires natural\nlanguage, a means of encoding and decoding perceptual states. We propose a\ntheory of meaning in which, to acquire language, an agent should model the\nworld a language describes rather than the language itself. If the utterances\nof humans are of predictive value to the agent's goals, then the agent will\nimbue those utterances with meaning in terms of its own goals and perceptual\nstates. In the context of Peircean semiotics, a community of agents must share\nrough approximations of signs, referents and interpretants in order to\ncommunicate. Meaning exists only in the context of intent, so to communicate\nwith humans an agent must have comparable experiences and goals. An agent that\nlearns intensional solutions, compelled by objective functions somewhat\nanalogous to human motivators such as hunger and pain, may be capable of\nexplaining its rationale not just in terms of its own intent, but in terms of\nwhat its audience understands and intends. It forms some approximation of the\nperceptual states of humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Various life-threatening diseases\nare known to alter the density of healthy capillaries and the flow velocity of\nerythrocytes within the capillaries. In previous studies, capillary density and\nflow velocity were manually assessed by trained specialists. However, manual\nanalysis of a standard 20-second microvascular video requires 20 minutes on\naverage and necessitates extensive training. Thus, manual analysis has been\nreported to hinder the application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical\nenvironment.

The proposed\nmethod combines the speed of traditional computer vision algorithms with the\naccuracy of convolutional neural networks to enable clinical capillary\nanalysis. The results show that the proposed system fully automates capillary\ndetection with an accuracy exceeding that of trained analysts and measures\nseveral novel microvascular parameters that had eluded quantification thus far,\nnamely, capillary hematocrit and intracapillary flow velocity heterogeneity.\nThe proposed end-to-end system, named CapillaryNet, can detect capillaries at\n$\\sim$0.9 seconds per frame with $\\sim$93\\% accuracy.

It is shown that the subquadratic power leads directly to a white\nL\\'evy noise, and to a L\\'evy-fractional Fokker-Planck equation for radial\ntransport of test particles (via wave-particle interactions). In a\nself-consistent description the avalanches, which are driven by the white\nL\\'evy noise, interact with the jet zonal flows, which form a system of\nsemi-permeable barriers to radial transport. We argue that the plasma staircase\nsaturates at a state of marginal stability, in whose vicinity the avalanches\nundergo an ever-pursuing localization-delocalization transition.

The full-wave\nsolution of first-principle equations based on finite-difference time-domain\nand particle-in-cell (FDTD/PIC) is performed to simulate inverse-Compton\nscattering (ICS) off both free and confined electrons. It is shown that the\nstrong space-charge effect in a low-energy electron beam (5 MeV) is the main\nobstacle in acquiring coherent gain through the ICS mechanism with a\n10-micrometer laser. Subsequently, it is shown that by confining the electron\nbeam at the field nodes of an optical cavity, the space-charge effect is\ncompensated, and additionally, the ultrahigh charge density enables high\nFEL-gain at confinement spots. The full-wave numerical simulations predict\nenhancement of about three orders of magnitude in the radiation efficiency when\nICS is carried out with confined electrons compared to free electrons.

At the water ice\nline, the water ice on the inward drifting pebbles evaporates and is released\ninto the gas phase, resulting in water-rich gas and dry pebbles that move into\nthe inner disk regions. Large planetary cores can block the inward drifting\npebbles by forming a pressure bump outside their orbit in the protoplanetary\ndisk. Depending on the relative position of a growing planetary core relative\nto the water ice line, water-rich pebbles might be blocked outside or inside\nthe water ice line. Pebbles blocked outside the water ice line do not evaporate\nand thus do not release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in a\ndry inner disk, while pebbles blocked inside the water ice line release their\nwater vapor into the gas phase, resulting in water vapor diffusing into the\ninner disk. As a consequence, close-in sub-Neptunes that accrete some gas from\nthe disk should be dry or wet, respectively, if outer gas giants are outside or\ninside the water ice line, assuming that giant planets form fast, as has been\nsuggested for Jupiter in our Solar System. Alternatively, a sub-Neptune could\nform outside the water ice line, accreting a large amount of icy pebbles and\nthen migrating inward as a very wet sub-Neptune. We suggest that the water\ncontent of inner sub-Neptunes in systems with giant planets that can\nefficiently block the inward drifting pebbles could constrain the formation\nconditions of these systems, thus making these sub-Neptunes exciting targets\nfor detailed characterization (e.g., with JWST, ELT, or ARIEL).

While traditionally\nimplemented via scanning probe microscopy techniques, recently it has been\nshown that the beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope can be used\nfor targeted manipulation of individual atoms. However, the process is highly\ndynamic in nature and proceeds via a large number of weakly-understood\nindividual steps. Hence, harnessing an electron beam towards atomic assembly\nrequires automated methods to control the parameters and positioning of the\nbeam in such a way as to fabricate atomic-scale structures reliably.

The method uses self-organizing neural networks\nto build a three-layer cognitive architecture. The unique features of an action\nsequence are represented as a series of elicited key activations by the\nfirst-layer self-organizing map. An average length of a key activation vector\nis calculated for all action sequences in a training set and adjusted in\nlearning trials to generate input patterns to the second-layer self-organizing\nmap. The pattern vectors are clustered in the second layer, and the clusters\nare then labeled by an action identity in the third layer neural network. The\nexperiment results show that although the performance drops slightly in online\nexperiments compared to the offline tests, the ability of the proposed\narchitecture to deal with the unsegmented action sequences as well as the\nonline performance makes the system more plausible and practical in real-case\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

However, experimentally no particle can be a perfect sphere, and the\nasymmetric shape, mass distribution or catalysis coating can induce an active\ntorque on the particle, which makes it a chiral active particle. Here using\ncomputer simulations and dynamic mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the\nlarge enough torque of circle active Brownian particles (cABPs) in two\ndimensions generates a dynamical clustering state interrupting the conventional\nMIPS. Multiple clusters arise from the combination of the conventional MIPS\ncohesion, and the circulating current caused disintegration. The non-vanishing\ncurrent in non-equilibrium steady states microscopically originates from the\nmotility ``relieved'' by automatic rotation, which breaks the detailed balance\nat the continuum level. This suggests that no equilibrium-like phase separation\ntheory can be constructed for chiral active colloids even with tiny active\ntorque, in which no visible collective motion exists. This mechanism also sheds\nlight on the understanding of dynamic clusters observed in a variety of active\nmatter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 08:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 14:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 09:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 02:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Many authors have reported evidence for so-called \"$Q\n\\sim 0$\" order that involves broken inversion, mirror, chiral, or time-reversal\nsymmetry that is uniform in space. Not all these observations are well\nunderstood and new experimental probes are needed. Here we use resonant soft\nx-ray scattering (RSXS) to search for $Q \\sim 0$ order in\nBi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) by measuring the region of a\nforbidden Bragg peak, $(0,0,3)$, which is normally extinguished by symmetry but\nmay become allowed on resonance if valence band order is present. Using\ncircularly polarized light, we found that this reflection becomes allowed on\nthe Cu $L_3$ resonance for temperatures $T_c < T < T^\\ast$, though remains\nabsent in linear polarization and at other temperatures. This observation\nsuggests the existence of spatially uniform valence band order near the\npseudogap temperature. In addition, we observed periodic oscillations in the\nspecular reflectivity from the sample surface that resemble thin film\ninterference fringes, though no known film is present. These fringes are highly\nresonant, appear in all polarizations, and exhibit a period that depends on the\nlocation where the beam strikes the sample surface. We speculate that these\nfringes arise from interaction between some intrinsic valence band instability\nand extrinsic structural surface morphologies of the material. Our study\nsupports the existence of some kind of $Q \\sim 0$ broken symmetry state in\nBi-2212 at intermediate temperatures, and calls for further study using a\nmicrofocused beam that could disentangle microscopic effects from macroscopic\nheterogeneities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

While for some sports tracking players is sufficient for\ngame analysis, sports like hockey, tennis and polo may require additional\ndetections, that include the object the player is holding (e.g. racket, stick).\nThe baseline solution for this problem involves detecting these objects as\nseparate classes, and matching them to player detections based on the\nintersection over union (IoU). This approach, however, leads to poor matching\nperformance in crowded situations, as it does not model the relationship\nbetween players and objects. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient\nway to detect and match players and related objects at once without extra cost,\nby considering an implicit association for prediction of multiple objects\nthrough the same proposal box. We evaluate the method on a dataset of broadcast\nice hockey videos, and also a new public dataset we introduce called COCO\n+Torso.

In this paper, we study\nthe I-Love-Q relations for superfluid neutron stars for a general relativistic\ntwo-fluid model: one fluid being the neutron superfluid and the other a\nconglomerate of all charged components. We study to what extent the two-fluid\ndynamics might affect the robustness of the I-Love-Q relations by using a\nsimple two-component polytropic model and a relativistic mean field model with\nentrainment for the equation-of-state. Our results depend crucially on the spin\nratio $\\Omega_{\\rm n}/\\Omega_{\\rm p}$ between the angular velocities of the\nneutron superfluid and the normal component. We find that the I-Love-Q\nrelations can still be satisfied to high accuracy for superfluid neutron stars\nas long as the two fluids are nearly co-rotating $\\Omega_{\\rm n}/\\Omega_{\\rm p}\n\\approx 1$. However, the deviations from the I-Love-Q relations increase as the\nspin ratio deviates from unity. In particular, the deviation of the Q-Love\nrelation can be as large as $O(10\\%)$ if $\\Omega_{\\rm n}/\\Omega_{\\rm p}$ differ\nfrom unity by a few tens of percent. As $\\Omega_{\\rm n}/\\Omega_{\\rm p} \\approx\n1$ is expected for realistic neutron stars, our results suggest that the\ntwo-fluid dynamics should not affect the accuracy of any gravitational waveform\nmodels for neutron star binaries that employ the relation to connect the\nspin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 06:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

This task,\nhowever, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and\nvisual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing\nmethods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve\nthis task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global\ncaption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information\ncannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we\nseek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of\nan image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1)\nit is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase;\n2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts\nin an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still\nan open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method.\nSpecifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid\nmore attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor,\nwe group its relevant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph\n(ACG).
