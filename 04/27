One significant challenge in supervised all-words WSD is\nto classify among senses for a majority of words that lie in the long-tail\ndistribution.

In this work, we propose\nMetricWSD, a non-parametric few-shot learning approach to mitigate this data\nimbalance issue. By learning to compute distances among the senses of a given\nword through episodic training, MetricWSD transfers knowledge (a learned metric\nspace) from high-frequency words to infrequent ones. MetricWSD constructs the\ntraining episodes tailored to word frequencies and explicitly addresses the\nproblem of the skewed distribution, as opposed to mixing all the words trained\nwith parametric models in previous work. Without resorting to any lexical\nresources, MetricWSD obtains strong performance against parametric\nalternatives, achieving a 75.1 F1 score on the unified WSD evaluation benchmark\n(Raganato et al., 2017b).

By allowing model aggregation across\ndifferent edge clusters, SD-FEEL enjoys the benefit of FEEL in reducing the\ntraining latency, while improving the learning performance by accessing richer\ntraining data from multiple edge clusters. A training algorithm for SD-FEEL\nwith three main procedures in each round is presented, including local model\nupdates, intra-cluster and inter-cluster model aggregations, which is proved to\nconverge on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We also\ncharacterize the interplay between the network topology of the edge servers and\nthe communication overhead of inter-cluster model aggregation on the training\nperformance.

In particular it is well known that Niels Bohr\nand Albert Einstein were of quite different opinions on the possible\ninterpretation of QM. The focus of their debate was on the possibility that QM\nis incomplete because of its feature of probabilistic theory. Bohr was denying\nthat, while Einstein tried to prove its incompleteness. The underlying question\nof this debate is if one can have a 'realistic' physical picture of QM, or, on\nthe contrary, we have to remain at the level of macroscopic description of\nphenomena and experiments. In this paper we take the line of thought that QM is\nincomplete, but that the wave function is still the proper representation of\nphysical systems. The starting point is the introduction of an hyperfinite\nlattice in the nonstandard real axis \\Rns\\ for the space coordinates. This\nextension of the standard real axis \\Rs\\ introduces additional nonstandard\ndegrees of freedom. With additional assumptions the model is able to formulate\na physical description of several so called QM 'paradoxes', as well as to\nhandle the measurement problem. The latter is described by a stochastic process\nthat arises from the model itself, and it is in line with the general scheme by\nPearle. Furthermore the entanglement between distant systems gets a natural\nrepresentation. In this sense the measurement process and the entanglement turn\nout to have a common physical origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 16:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 11:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 09:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

This enables us to learn generalizable concepts from very limited visual\nexamples. However, current few-shot learning (FSL) methods use numerical class\nlabels to denote object classes which do not provide rich semantic meanings\nabout the learned concepts. In this work, we show that by using 'class-level'\nlanguage descriptions, that can be acquired with minimal annotation cost, we\ncan improve the FSL performance. Given a support set and queries, our main idea\nis to create a bottleneck visual feature (hybrid prototype) which is then used\nto generate language descriptions of the classes as an auxiliary task during\ntraining. We develop a Transformer based forward and backward encoding\nmechanism to relate visual and semantic tokens that can encode intricate\nrelationships between the two modalities. Forcing the prototypes to retain\nsemantic information about class description acts as a regularizer on the\nvisual features, improving their generalization to novel classes at inference.\nFurthermore, this strategy imposes a human prior on the learned\nrepresentations, ensuring that the model is faithfully relating visual and\nsemantic concepts, thereby improving model interpretability.

However, the Schwarzschild\nmetric itself is regular in this limit, it is reduced to the Minkowski metric\nand there are no reasons to believe that the temperature becomes infinite. This\ndiscrepancy may be due to the singularity of the Kruskal coordinates in this\nlimit.\n  To improve the situation, new coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric are\nintroduced, called thermal coordinates, which depend on the black hole mass $ M\n$ and the parameter $b$. The thermal coordinates are regular in the limit $M\\to\n0$ when the Schwarzschild metric reduces to Minkowski metric, written in\ncoordinates dual to the Rindler coordinates. Using the thermal coordinates the\nSchwarzschild black hole radiation is reconsidered and it is found that the\nHawking formula for temperature is valid only for large black holes while for\nsmall black holes the temperature is $T=1/2\\pi(4M+b)$. The thermal observer in\nMinkowski space sees radiation with temperature $T=1/2\\pi b$, similar to the\nUnruh effect with non-constant acceleration.\n  During evaporation, in the thermal coordinates the black hole mass is\ndecreasing inverse proportional to time and the black hole lifetime is\ninfinite.

In quantum field theory, this statement\ntranslates to the long-standing conjecture that probabilities for observing the\ntwo scenarios in a scattering experiment are described by one and the same\nfunction. Why could we expect it to be true? In this work we examine this\nquestion in a simplified setup and take steps towards illuminating a possible\nphysical interpretation of crossing symmetry. To be more concrete, we consider\nplanar scattering amplitudes involving any number of particles with arbitrary\nspins and masses to all loop orders in perturbation theory. We show that by\ndeformations of the external momenta one can smoothly interpolate between pairs\nof crossing channels without encountering singularities or violating mass-shell\nconditions and momentum conservation. The analytic continuation can be realized\nusing two types of moves. The first one makes use of an $i\\varepsilon$\nprescription for avoiding singularities near the physical kinematics and allows\nus to adjust the momenta of the external particles relative to one another\nwithin their lightcones. The second, more violent, step involves a rotation of\nsubsets of particle momenta via their complexified lightcones from the future\nto the past and vice versa. We show that any singularity along such a\ndeformation would have to correspond to two beams of particles scattering off\neach other. For planar Feynman diagrams, these kinds of singularities are\nabsent because of the particular flow of energies through their propagators. We\nprescribe a five-step sequence of such moves that combined together proves\ncrossing symmetry for planar scattering amplitudes in perturbation theory,\npaving a way towards settling this question for more general scattering\nprocesses in quantum field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

The relation between\nSFE$_{\\rm HI}$ and sSFR shows significant scatter and strong systematic\ndependence on all of the key galaxy properties that we have explored.

The\nfacts that SFE$_{\\rm H_2}$-sSFR relation is independent of other key galaxy\nproperties, and that sSFR is directly related to the cosmic time and acts as\nthe cosmic clock, make it natural and very simple to study how different galaxy\npopulations (with different properties and undergoing different processes)\nevolve on the same SFE$_{\\rm H_2}$-sSFR $\\sim t$ relation.

By requiring\nthat the only singularities of the gauge field inside the handlebody must be\ncompatible with Wilson loop insertions, we find that the Wilson loop shifts the\nholonomy of the initial state. Together with an appropriate choice of\nnormalization, this procedure selects a unique state in the Hilbert space\nobtained from a K\\\"ahler quantization of the theory on the constant-radius\nRiemann surfaces. Radial quantization allows us to find the partition functions\nof Abelian Chern-Simons theories for handlebodies of arbitrary genus. For\nnon-Abelian compact gauge groups, we show that our method reproduces the known\npartition function at genus one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 18:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 01:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Special emphasis is placed on certifying the\naccuracy of the reduced-order model. For this purpose, a sharp state error\nestimator is proposed. Standard a posteriori state error estimation for model\norder reduction relies on the inf-sup constant. For parametric systems, the\ninf-sup constant is parameter-dependent. The a posteriori error estimation for\nsystems with very small or vanishing inf-sup constant poses a challenge, since\nit is inversely proportional to the inf-sup constant, resulting in rather\nuseless, overly pessimistic error estimators. Such systems appear in\nelectromagnetics since the inf-sup constant values are close to zero at points\nclose to resonant frequencies, where they eventually vanish. We propose a novel\na posteriori state error estimator which avoids the calculation of the inf-sup\nconstant.

Prior methods have exploited diversity and\nuncertainty in submodular objective functions for choosing subsets. In addition\nto these measures, we show that balancing constraints on predicted class labels\nand decision boundaries are beneficial. We propose a novel formulation of these\nconstraints using matroids, an algebraic structure that generalizes linear\nindependence in vector spaces, and present an efficient greedy algorithm with\nconstant approximation guarantees. We outperform competing baselines on\nstandard classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, as well\nas long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 19:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 16:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

Existing efforts can be mainly\ncategorized as spectral-based and spatial-based methods. The major challenge\nfor the former is to find an appropriate graph filter to distill discriminative\ninformation from input signals for learning. Recently, myriads of explorations\nare made to achieve better graph filters, e.g., Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN), which leverages Chebyshev polynomial truncation to seek an approximation\nof graph filters and bridge these two families of methods. Nevertheless, it has\nbeen shown in recent studies that GCN and its variants are essentially\nemploying fixed low-pass filters to perform information denoising. Thus their\nlearning capability is rather limited and may over-smooth node representations\nat deeper layers. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel graph neural\nnetwork framework AdaGNN with a well-designed adaptive frequency response\nfilter. At its core, AdaGNN leverages a simple but elegant trainable filter\nthat spans across multiple layers to capture the varying importance of\ndifferent frequency components for node representation learning. The inherent\ndifferences among different feature channels are also well captured by the\nfilter. As such, it empowers AdaGNN with stronger expressiveness and naturally\nalleviates the over-smoothing problem. We empirically validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework on various benchmark datasets.\nTheoretical analysis is also provided to show the superiority of the proposed\nAdaGNN.

At high\nmolecular weights, influence of contour length fluctuations and con-straint\nrelease cease and pure reptation prevails. With the broad frequency range\ndielectric spectroscopy can fol-low polymer dynamics over a very broad\ntemperature range, with the additional advantage of recording the spec-tral\nshape which contains information on reptation. Here we investigate the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the molecular weight for the onset of pure reptation from the\nmolecular weight dependence and the spectral shape. We examined the popular\nderivative method and compared it with a version that includes higher order\nterms. Higher order terms lead to a more accurate peak shape and position than\nthose determined with the simpler version. This becomes important if\nexperimental spectra contain conductivity and polarization contributions.\nHigher order terms require the introduction of an interpolating function to\nanalyze experimental spectra, which lets the Havriliak-Negami function appear\nto be a more robust, yet reliable tool to determine the peak shapes. We reach\nthe conclusion that molecular weight dependence and spectral shape can be both\nstrongly affected by conductivity and polarization contributions. While this\nleaves uncertainties on the accurate value of the transition molecular weight,\nthe peak shape points to the existence of reptation and contour length\nfluctuations in polyisoprene with a molecular weight greater than 1000 kg/mol,\nwhich would imply a ten times greater threshold molecular weight than expected\nfrom previous estimates using the molecular weight dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 19:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The search is focused on heavy resonances, where the\ndecay products of each top quark or W boson are expected to be reconstructed as\na single, large-radius jet with a distinct substructure. The production of an\nexcited bottom quark, b*, is used as a benchmark when setting limits on the\ncross section for a heavy resonance decaying to a top quark and a W boson. The\nhypotheses of b* quarks with left-handed, right-handed, and vector-like\nchiralities are excluded at 95% confidence level for masses below 2.6, 2.8, and\n3.1 TeV, respectively.

The dry\nsystem shows a signature of the entire family of equatorial waves, while the\nmoist simulations only show low frequency Rossby, Kelvin and mixed Rossby\ngravity waves with an equivalent depth that matches rapid condensation\nestimates. Further, runs with interactive moisture exhibit spontaneous\naggregation with the equilibrium moist energy spectrum obeying a -2 power-law.\nSynoptic scale moisture anomalies form in heterogeneous background saturation,\nand are sustained by advection and convergence, within rotational gyres that\ndominate the tropical region. In that case, along with equatorial waves and\nturbulence, a large-scale eastward moving moisture wave appears in the\nmidlatitudes.

The super-rotating flow is driven by\nrotational eddy momentum fluxes due to enhanced equatorial Rossby wave activity\nin the moist runs. The nature of eddies is such that the tropical circulation\nin the dry and moist cases tends to homogenize and exaggerate potential\nvorticity gradients, respectively.

Many of the automated\napproaches mainly rely on analyzing system models, source code, or extracting\nthe usage pattern of the system during the execution. However, such information\nand artifacts are not always available. Moreover, all the transactions within a\ngenerated workload do not impact the performance of the system the same way, a\nfinely tuned workload could accomplish the test objective in an efficient way.\nModel-free reinforcement learning is widely used for finding the optimal\nbehavior to accomplish an objective in many decision-making problems without\nrelying on a model of the system. This paper proposes that if the optimal\npolicy (way) for generating test workload to meet a test objective can be\nlearned by a test agent, then efficient test automation would be possible\nwithout relying on system models or source code. We present a self-adaptive\nreinforcement learning-driven load testing agent, RELOAD, that learns the\noptimal policy for test workload generation and generates an effective workload\nefficiently to meet the test objective. Once the agent learns the optimal\npolicy, it can reuse the learned policy in subsequent testing activities. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed intelligent load test agent can accomplish\nthe test objective with lower test cost compared to common load testing\nprocedures, and results in higher test efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 22:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Inspired by this observation, the paper proposes a super-class\nguided network (SGNet) to integrate the high-level semantic information into\nthe network so as to increase its performance in inference. SGNet takes\ntwo-level class annotations that contain both super-class and finer class\nlabels.

A super-class branch (SCB), trained on\nsuper-class labels, is introduced to guide finer class prediction.

Since static traffic assignment\ndoes not have a notion of time, it is not designed to represent temporal\ndynamics that arise as vehicles flow through the network and demand varies\nthrough the day. Dynamic traffic assignment methods attempt to resolve these\nissues, but require significant computational resources if modeling urban-scale\nregions (on the order of millions of links and vehicles) and often take days of\ncompute time to complete. The focus of this work is two-fold: 1) to introduce a\nnew traffic assignment approach - a quasi-dynamic traffic assignment (QDTA)\nmodel and 2) to describe how we parallelized the QDTA algorithms to leverage\nHigh-Performance Computing (HPC) and scale to large metropolitan areas while\ndramatically reducing compute time. We examine and compare different scenarios,\nincluding a baseline static traffic assignment (STA) and a quasi-dynamic\nscenario inspired by the user-equilibrium (UET). Results are presented for the\nSan Francisco Bay Area which accounts for 19M trips/day and an urban road\nnetwork of 1M links. We utilize an iterative gradient descent method, where the\nstep size is selected using a Quasi-Newton method with parallelized cost\nfunction evaluations and compare it to using pre-defined step sizes (MSA).\nUsing the parallelized line search provides a 16 percent reduction in total\nexecution time due to a reduction in the number of gradient descent iterations\nrequired for convergence. The full day QDTA comprising 96 optimization steps\nover 15 minute intervals runs in about 4 minutes on 1,024 cores of the NERSC\nCori computer, which represents a speedup of over 36x versus serial execution.\nTo our knowledge, this compute time is significantly lower than other traffic\nassignment solutions for a problem of this scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 23:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 23:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Inverse UQ (IUQ), in which\nthe information flow is from the model outputs and experimental data to the\ninputs, is an equally important component of UQ but has been significantly\nunderrated until recently.

The voluntary motions of animals are\ntypically initiated by high level intentions created in the primary cortex\nthrough a combination of perceptions of the current state of the environment\nalong with memories of past reactions to similar states. Muscle movements are\nproduced as a result of neural processes in which the parallel activity of\nlarge multiplicities of neurons generate signals that collectively lead to\ndesired actions. Essential to coordinated muscle movement are intentionality,\nprediction, regions of the cortex dealing with misperceptions of sensory cues,\nand a significant level of resilience with respect to disruptions in the neural\npathways through which signals must propagate. While linear models of feedback\ncontrol systems have been well studied over decades, this paper proposes and\nanalyzes a class of models whose aims are to capture some of the essential\nfeatures of neural control of movement. Whereas most linear models of feedback\nsystems entail a state component whose dimension is higher than the number of\ninputs or outputs, the work that follows will treat models in which the numbers\nof input and output channels greatly exceed the state dimension.

Within\nthe proposed class of models, the paper will study resilience to channel\ndropouts, the ways in which noise and uncertainty can be mitigated by an\nappropriate notion of consensus among noisy inputs, and finally, by a simple\nmodel in which binary activations of a multiplicity of input channels produce a\ndynamic response that closely approximates the dynamics of a prescribed linear\nsystem whose inputs are continuous functions of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 00:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 18:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Using a simple routine, idealized\nthree-dimensional dust-grains are constructed, atom by atom, with varying\ndegrees of porosity. Diffusive chemistry is then simulated on these surfaces\nusing the off-lattice microscopic Monte Carlo chemical kinetics model, MIMICK,\nassuming physical conditions appropriate to dark interstellar clouds. On the\nporous grain surface, the build-up of ice mantles, mostly composed of water,\nleads to the covering over of the pores, leaving empty pockets. Once the pores\nare completely covered, the chemical and structural behavior is similar to\nnon-porous grains of the same size. The most prominent chemical effect of the\npresence of grain porosity is the trapping of molecular hydrogen, formed on the\ngrain surfaces, within the ices and voids inside the grain pores. Trapping of\nH2 in this way may indicate that other volatiles, such as inert gases not\nincluded in these models, could be trapped within dust-grain porous structures\nwhen ices begin to form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 02:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

One numerical method for evaluating the distributions uses the fact\nthat they can be represented as Fredholm determinants involving the so-called\nAiry integral operator. When the spectrum of the integral operator is computed\nby discretizing it directly, the eigenvalues are known to at most absolute\nprecision. Remarkably, the Airy integral operator is an example of a so-called\nbispectral operator, which admits a commuting differential operator that shares\nthe same eigenfunctions. In this manuscript, we develop an efficient numerical\nalgorithm for evaluating the eigendecomposition of the Airy integral operator\nto full relative precision, using the eigendecomposition of the commuting\ndifferential operator. This allows us to rapidly evaluate the distributions of\nthe $k$-th largest level to full relative precision rapidly everywhere except\nin the left tail, where they are computed to absolute precision.

The analyses have been done with an assumption\nthat these objects are black holes by limiting the spin prior to the Kerr\nbound. However, the above assumption is not valid for superspinars, which have\nthe Kerr geometry but rotate beyond the Kerr bound. In this study, we\ninvestigate whether and how the limited spin prior range causes a bias in\nparameter estimation for superspinars if they are detected. To this end, we\nestimate binary parameters of the simulated inspiral signals of the\ngravitational waves of compact binaries by assuming that at least one component\nof them is a superspinar. We have found that when the primary is a superspinar,\nboth mass and spin parameters are biased in parameter estimation due to the\nlimited spin prior range. In this case, the extended prior range is strongly\nfavored compared to the limited one. On the other hand, when the primary is a\nblack hole, we do not see much bias in parameter estimation due to the limited\nspin prior range, even though the secondary is a superspinar. We also apply the\nanalysis to black hole binary merger events GW170608 and GW190814, which have a\nlong and loud inspiral signal. We do not see any preference of superspinars\nfrom the model selection for both events. We conclude that the extension of the\nspin prior range is necessary for accurate parameter estimation if highly\nspinning primary objects are found, while it is difficult to identify\nsuperspinars if they are only the secondary objects. Nevertheless, the bias in\nparameter estimation of spin for the limited spin prior range can be a clue of\nthe existence of superspinars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 04:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 07:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

As an\nalternative to constructing accurate galaxy bias models, requiring\nunderstanding galaxy formation, we propose to construct likelihood\ndistributions for Bayesian forward modeling approaches that are insensitive to\nlinear, scale-dependent bias and provide robustness against model\nmisspecification. We use maximum entropy arguments to construct likelihood\ndistributions designed to account only for correlations between data and\ninferred quantities.

Since video\nis resilient to data loss, throwing away less important video packets can ease\nnetwork congestion with minimal damage to video quality and free up bandwidth\nfor other data flows. Frame type is one of the features that can be used to\ndetermine the importance of video packets, but this information is stored in\nthe packet payload. Due to limited processing power of devices in high\nthroughput/speed networks, data encryption and user credibility issues, it is\ncostly for the network to find the frame type of each packet.

The attention module searches for potential small targets in\nthe predicted areas of the input image and enhances their contrast against\ncomplex background. The STMD-based neural network receives the\ncontrast-enhanced image and discriminates small moving targets from background\nfalse positives. The prediction module foresees future positions of the\ndetected targets and generates a prediction map for the attention module. The\nthree subsystems are connected in a recurrent architecture allowing information\nto be processed sequentially to activate specific areas for small target\ndetection. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed visual system for\ndetecting small, low-contrast moving targets against complex natural\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 01:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 07:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 07:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 11:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 06:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 01:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Here, we present a new\napproach for quantum self-testing in Bell non-locality scenarios, motivated by\nthe following observation: the quantum maximum of a given Bell inequality is,\nin general, difficult to characterize.

This implies that, for the cases where the\nquantum maximum and the maximum within the theta body (known as the Lov\\'asz\ntheta number) of $(G,w)$ coincide, self-testing can be demonstrated by just\nproving self-testability with the theta body of $G$. This graph-theoretic\nframework allows us to (i) recover the self-testability of several quantum\ncorrelations that are known to permit self-testing (like those violating the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and three-party Mermin Bell inequalities for\nprojective measurements of arbitrary rank, and chained Bell inequalities for\nrank-one projective measurements), (ii) prove the self-testability of quantum\ncorrelations that were not known using existing self-testing techniques (e.g.,\nthose violating the Abner Shimony Bell inequality for rank-one projective\nmeasurements). Additionally, the analysis of the chained Bell inequalities\ngives us a closed-form expression of the Lov\\'asz theta number for a family of\nwell-studied graphs known as the M\\\"obius ladders, which might be of\nindependent interest in the community of discrete mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 08:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Fact checking methods typically use knowledge graphs\n(KGs) as external repositories and develop reasoning mechanism to retrieve\nevidence for verifying the triple claim. However, existing methods only focus\non verifying a single claim. As real-world rumorous information is more complex\nand a textual statement is often composed of multiple clauses (i.e. represented\nas multiple claims instead of a single one), multiclaim fact checking is not\nonly necessary but more important for practical applications. Although previous\nmethods for verifying a single triple can be applied repeatedly to verify\nmultiple triples one by one, they ignore the contextual information implied in\na multi-claim statement and could not learn the rich semantic information in\nthe statement as a whole. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end knowledge\nenhanced learning and verification method for multi-claim fact checking. Our\nmethod consists of two modules, KG-based learning enhancement and multi-claim\nsemantic composition. To fully utilize the contextual information, the KG-based\nlearning enhancement module learns the dynamic context-specific representations\nvia selectively aggregating relevant attributes of entities. To capture the\ncompositional semantics of multiple triples, the multi-claim semantic\ncomposition module constructs the graph structure to model claim-level\ninteractions, and integrates global and salient local semantics with multi-head\nattention. Experimental results on a real-world dataset and two benchmark\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our method for multi-claim fact checking\nover KG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 08:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The\nAncillary Services Acquisition Model (ASAM) combines the agent-based modeling\nframework MESA with the toolbox Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA). The\nmodel provides various design parameters per market and agent-specific\nstrategies as well as detailed clearing algorithms for the day-ahead market,\nintra-day continuous trading, redispatch, and imbalances.

The results displayed the following implications from order\ntypes in redispatch markets with multi-period all-or-none design: (1) The order\ndesign provides few risks for market parties, as orders are fully cleared.

In this\nwork, we propose Confined Gradient Descent (CGD) that enhances privacy of\nfederated learning by eliminating the sharing of global model parameters.

In this problem, it is essential to model multiple source domains\nand target domain jointly, and an effective domain combination scheme is also\nhighly required. The graphical structure among different domains is useful to\ntackle these challenges, in which the interdependency among various\ninstances/categories can be effectively modeled. In this work, we propose two\ntypes of graphical models, i.e. Conditional Random Field for MSDA (CRF-MSDA)\nand Markov Random Field for MSDA (MRF-MSDA), for cross-domain joint modeling\nand learnable domain combination. In a nutshell, given an observation set\ncomposed of a query sample and the semantic prototypes (i.e. representative\ncategory embeddings) on various domains, the CRF-MSDA model seeks to learn the\njoint distribution of labels conditioned on the observations. We attain this\ngoal by constructing a relational graph over all observations and conducting\nlocal message passing on it. By comparison, MRF-MSDA aims to model the joint\ndistribution of observations over different Markov networks via an energy-based\nformulation, and it can naturally perform label prediction by summing the joint\nlikelihoods over several specific networks. Compared to the CRF-MSDA\ncounterpart, the MRF-MSDA model is more expressive and possesses lower\ncomputational cost. We evaluate these two models on four standard benchmark\ndata sets of MSDA with distinct domain shift and data complexity, and both\nmodels achieve superior performance over existing methods on all benchmarks. In\naddition, the analytical studies illustrate the effect of different model\ncomponents and provide insights about how the cross-domain joint modeling\nperforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 09:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 09:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

The AA is widely used due to\nits simplicity and explicit physical interpretation. However, the level\ncrossings in the spectrum of the QRM predicted by the AA are determined by the\nzeros of Laguerre polynomials, which deviate from the exact points. We propose\na new approximation to the QRM that predicts the level crossings correctly.\nThis is done by exploiting a surprising connection between isolated exact\nsolutions to the QRM and the Laguerre polynomials in the AA. We thus refer to\nthis approach as the generalized adiabatic approximation (GAA).

Aims: Our aim is to determine if standing slow waves in\nsolar atmospheric structures such as coronal loops, and also prominence\nthreads, sunspots, and pores, can trigger the KHI due to the oscillating shear\nflow at the structure's boundary. Methods: We used linearized nonstationary MHD\nto work out an analytical model in a cartesian reference frame. The model\ndescribes a compressible plasma near a discontinuous interface separating two\nregions of homogeneous plasma, each harboring an oscillating velocity field\nwith a constant amplitude which is parallel to the background magnetic field\nand aligned with the interface. The obtained analytical results were then used\nto determine the stability of said interface, both in coronal and photospheric\nconditions. Results: We find that the stability of the interface is determined\nby a Mathieu equation. In function of the parameters of this equation, the\ninterface can either be stable or unstable. For coronal as well as photospheric\nconditions, we find that the interface is stable with respect to the KHI.\nTheoretically, it can, however, be unstable with respect to a parametric\nresonance instability, although it seems physically unlikely. We conclude that,\nin this simplified setup, a standing slow wave does not trigger the KHI without\nthe involvement of additional physical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 09:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

We hypothesize that 18-W could also mitigate\nthe problem of washout, as PET (F-18) isotopes created inside live cells would\nremain trapped in the form of fluoride anions.\n  To test our hypothesis, we designed an experiment to prove that 18-W can\nincorporate enough O-18 into a living organism to produce a detectable signal\nfrom F-18 after proton irradiation, and to determine the amount of activity\nthat remains trapped inside the cells. The experiment was performed on a\nchicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane tumor model of head and neck cancer.\nSeven eggs with visible tumors were infused with 18-W and irradiated with 8-MeV\nprotons, equivalent to clinical protons at the end of particle range. The\nactivity produced after irradiation was detected and quantified in a\nsmall-animal PET-CT scanner.

F-18 produced inside cells suffers from minimal biological\nwashout, allowing for a sharper localization with longer PET acquisitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 10:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Some existing models employ a few-shot relation's multi-hop neighbor\ninformation to enhance its semantic representation. However, noise neighbor\ninformation might be amplified when the neighborhood is excessively sparse and\nno neighbor is available to represent the few-shot relation. Moreover, modeling\nand inferring complex relations of one-to-many (1-N), many-to-one (N-1), and\nmany-to-many (N-N) by previous knowledge graph completion approaches requires\nhigh model complexity and a large amount of training instances. Thus, inferring\ncomplex relations in the few-shot scenario is difficult for FKGC models due to\nlimited training instances. In this paper, we propose a few-shot relational\nlearning with global-local framework to address the above issues. At the global\nstage, a novel gated and attentive neighbor aggregator is built for accurately\nintegrating the semantics of a few-shot relation's neighborhood, which helps\nfiltering the noise neighbors even if a KG contains extremely sparse\nneighborhoods.

In this paper we study\nMinimum Stable Cut, the problem of finding a stable cut of minimum weight.\nSince this problem is NP-hard, we study its complexity on graphs of low\ntreewidth, low degree, or both. We begin by showing that the problem remains\nweakly NP-hard on severely restricted trees, so bounding treewidth alone cannot\nmake it tractable. We match this hardness with a pseudo-polynomial DP algorithm\nsolving the problem in time $(\\Delta\\cdot W)^{O(tw)}n^{O(1)}$, where $tw$ is\nthe treewidth, $\\Delta$ the maximum degree, and $W$ the maximum weight. On the\nother hand, bounding $\\Delta$ is also not enough, as the problem is NP-hard for\nunweighted graphs of bounded degree. We therefore parameterize Minimum Stable\nCut by both $tw$ and $\\Delta$ and obtain an FPT algorithm running in time\n$2^{O(\\Delta tw)}(n+\\log W)^{O(1)}$. Our main result for the weighted problem\nis to provide a reduction showing that both aforementioned algorithms are\nessentially optimal, even if we replace treewidth by pathwidth: if there exists\nan algorithm running in $(nW)^{o(pw)}$ or $2^{o(\\Delta pw)}(n+\\log W)^{O(1)}$,\nthen the ETH is false. Complementing this, we show that we can, however, obtain\nan FPT approximation scheme parameterized by treewidth, if we consider\nalmost-stable solutions, that is, solutions where no single vertex can\nunilaterally increase the weight of its incident cut edges by more than a\nfactor of $(1+\\varepsilon)$.\n  Motivated by these mostly negative results, we consider Unweighted Minimum\nStable Cut. Here our results already imply a much faster exact algorithm\nrunning in time $\\Delta^{O(tw)}n^{O(1)}$.

In this work we use simulations to investigate\nthe competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous crystallization. We\nreport simulations of wall-induced nucleation for different confining walls.\nCombining the results of these simulations with earlier studies of homogeneous\nallows us to asses the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous\nnucleation as a function of wall type, fluid density and the system size. On at\nwalls, heterogeneous nucleation will typically overwhelm homogeneous\nnucleation. However, even for surfaces randomly coated with spheres with a\ndiameter that was some three times larger than that of the fluid spheres - as\nhas been used in some experiments - heterogeneous nucleation is likely to be\ndominant for volume fractions smaller than 0.535. Only for a disordered coating\nthat has the same structure as the liquid holds promise did we find the\nnucleation was likely to occur in the bulk. Hence, such coatings might be used\nto suppress heterogeneous nucleation in experiments. Finally, we report the\napparent homogeneous nucleation rate taking into account the formation of\ncrystallites both in the bulk and at the walls. We find that the apparent\noverall nucleation rates coincides with those reported in \"homogeneous\nnucleation\" experiments. This suggests that heterogeneous nucleation at the\nwalls could partly explain the large discrepancies found between experimental\nmeasurements and simulation estimates of the homogeneous nucleation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 11:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

This yields (a) a\nsimple proof of soundness and completeness for first-order combinatorial\nproofs, and (b) a full completeness theorem: every combinatorial proof is the\nimage of a syntactic proof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 11:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In this paper we ask whether this\noptimization in a two-compartment domain can also be achieved by passive\nBrownian particles. We consider a Brownian motion with different diffusion\nconstants in the two shells and a potential barrier between the two and\ninvestigate the narrow escape problem by calculating the MFPT for Brownian\nparticles to reach a small window on the external boundary. In two and three\ndimensions, we derive asymptotic expressions for the MFPT in the thin cortex\nand small escape region limits confirmed by numerical calculations of the MFPT\nusing the finite element method and stochastic simulations. From this\nanalytical and numeric analysis we finally extract the dependence of the MFPT\non the ratio of diffusion constants, the potential barrier height and the width\nof the outer shell. The first two are monotonous whereas the last one may have\na minimum for a sufficiently attractive cortex, for which we propose an\nanalytical expression of the potential barrier height matching very well the\nnumerical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 11:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 12:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

To achieve blockchain\nconsensus in wireless network, one of the important steps is to broadcast new\nblock using wireless channel. Under wireless network protocols, the block\ntransmitting will be affected significantly. In this work, we focus on the\nconsensus process in blockchain-based wireless local area network (B-WLAN) by\ninvestigating the impact of the media access control (MAC) protocol, CSMA/CA.\nWith the randomness of the backoff counter in CSMA/CA, it is possible for\nlatter blocks to catch up or outpace the earlier one, which complicates\nblockchain forking problem. In view of this, we propose mining strategies to\npause mining for reducing the forking probability, and a discard strategy to\nremove the forking blocks that already exist in CSMA/CA backoff procedure.\nBased on the proposed strategies, we design Block Access Control (BAC)\napproaches to effectively schedule block mining and transmitting for improving\nthe performance of B-WLAN. Then, Markov chain models are presented to conduct\nperformance analysis in B-WLAN. The results show that BAC approaches can help\nthe network to achieve a high transaction throughput while improving block\nutilization and saving computational power. Meanwhile, the trade-off between\ntransaction throughput and block utilization is demonstrated, which can act as\na guidance for practical deployment of blockchain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 12:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

By deviating from the conventional modelling\napproach that treats the array elements as sizeless points, we explicitly model\ntheir physical area/aperture, which enables a unified modelling for the\nclassical discrete antenna arrays and the emerging continuous surfaces. As\nsuch, a generic array/surface model that accurately takes into account the\nvariations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across array\nelements is proposed. Based on the proposed model, a closed-form expression of\nthe resulting SNR with the optimal single-user MRC/MRT beamforming is derived.\nThe expression reveals that instead of scaling linearly with the antenna number\nM as in conventional UPW modelling, the SNR with the more generic model\nincreases with M with diminishing return, which is governed by the collective\nproperties of the array, such as the array occupation ratio and the physical\nsizes of the array along each dimension, while irrespective of the properties\nof the individual array element.

A major advantage of handmade\nMcKibben muscles, as well as its commercial versions, lies in the possibility\nit offers of realizing antagonist muscle actuator on the model of the\nbiceps-triceps system. If pressures are independently controlled in each\nartificial muscle, it is then possible to define a position-stiffness control\nof the antagonist actuator by analogy with natural neural control of antagonist\nskeletal muscles. Such a control however requires a knowledge model of the\nactuator making possible a stiffness estimation provided by control pressures,\nwhile position closed-loop control is facilitated by a feedforward model of\nthis highly nonlinear actuation device. We discuss this issue in the particular\ncase of the antagonist Festo air muscle actuator, and we propose a simplified\nstatic actuator model derived from the classic static theoretical model of the\nMcKibben artificial muscle, simple enough for a future MIMO position-stiffness\ncontroller be able to integrate it.

From a quantum jump\n(trajectory) perspective, the appearance of multiple steady states is related\nto underlying dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) at the fluctuating level,\nleading to a dynamical coexistence of different transport channels classified\nby symmetry. In this paper, we investigate how strong symmetries affect both\nthe transport properties and the activity patterns of a particular class of\nMarkovian open quantum system, a three-qubit model under the action of a\nmagnetic field and in contact with a thermal bath. We find a pair of twin DPTs\nin exciton current statistics, induced by the strong symmetry and related by\ntime reversibility, where a zero-current exchange-antisymmetric phase coexists\nwith a symmetric phase of negative exciton current. On the other hand, the\nactivity statistics exhibits a single DPT where the symmetric and antisymmetric\nphases of different but nonzero activities dynamically coexists.

Counting\nk-cliques is typically done by traversing search trees starting at each vertex\nin the graph. Parallelizing k-clique counting has been well-studied on CPUs and\nmany solutions exist. However, there are no performant solutions for k-clique\ncounting on GPUs.\n  Parallelizing k-clique counting on GPUs comes with numerous challenges such\nas the need for extracting fine-grain multi-level parallelism, sensitivity to\nload imbalance, and constrained physical memory capacity. While there has been\nwork on related problems such as finding maximal cliques and generalized\nsub-graph matching on GPUs, k-clique counting in particular has yet to be\nexplored in depth. In this paper, we present the first parallel GPU solution\nspecialized for the k-clique counting problem. Our solution supports both graph\norientation and pivoting for eliminating redundant clique discovery. It\nincorporates both vertex-centric and edge-centric parallelization schemes for\ndistributing work across thread blocks, and further partitions work within each\nthread block to extract fine-grain multi-level parallelism while tolerating\nload imbalance. It also includes optimizations such as binary encoding of\ninduced sub-graphs and sub-warp partitioning to limit memory consumption and\nimprove the utilization of execution resources.\n  Our evaluation shows that our best GPU implementation outperforms the best\nstate-of-the-art parallel CPU implementation by a geometric mean of 12.39x,\n6.21x, and 18.99x for k=4, 7, and 10, respectively.

In contrast, synaptic coupling between neurons in the\ncentral nervous system is regulated by dynamic permeabilities of ion channels.\nSo far, the computational role of these membrane conductances remains unclear\nand is often considered an artifact of the biological substrate. Here we\ndemonstrate that conductance-based synaptic coupling allow neurons to\nrepresent, process and learn uncertainties.

Using zoom-in dark\nmatter-only simulations of MW-mass haloes and concentrating on subhaloes that\nare thought to be capable of hosting dwarf galaxies, we demonstrate that the\ninfall of a massive progenitor is accompanied with the accretion and\ndestruction of a large number of subhaloes. Massive accreted progenitors do not\nincrease the total number of infalling subhaloes onto a MW-mass host, but\ninstead focus surrounding subhaloes onto the host causing a clustering in the\ninfall time of subhaloes. This leads to a temporary elevation in the number of\nsubhaloes as well as changes in their cumulative radial profile within the\nvirial radius of the host.

The German telescope eROSITA was installed on\nSRG under an agreement between Roskosmos and the DLR, the German Aerospace\nAgency.

By mid-June 2021, the third six-month all-sky survey had been\ncompleted. Over a period of four years, it is planned to obtain eight\nindependent maps of the entire sky in each of the energy ranges. The sum of\nthese maps will provide high sensitivity and reveal more than three million\nquasars and over one hundred thousand massive galaxy clusters and galaxy\ngroups. The availability of eight sky maps will enable monitoring of long-term\nvariability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic and Galactic\nX-ray sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars with hot coronae. The\nrotation of the satellite around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period\nof four hours enables tracking the faster variability of bright X-ray sources\nduring one day every half year.

The presence of predictive\ninformation among non-social colocators raises privacy concerns: given the\nincreasing availability of real-time mobility traces from smartphones,\nindividuals sharing data may be providing actionable information not just about\ntheir own movements but the movements of others whose data are absent, both\nknown and unknown individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 15:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

However, data privacy concerns\nsuch as the protection of trade secrets have hindered adoption of blockchain\ntechnology. Although consortium blockchains only allow authorised supply chain\nentities to read/write to the ledger, privacy preservation of trade secrets\ncannot be ascertained. In this work, we propose a privacy-preservation\nframework, PrivChain, to protect sensitive data on blockchain using zero\nknowledge proofs. PrivChain provides provenance and traceability without\nrevealing any sensitive information to end-consumers or supply chain entities.\nIts novelty stems from: a) its ability to allow data owners to protect trade\nrelated information and instead provide proofs on the data, and b) an\nintegrated incentive mechanism for entities providing valid proofs over\nprovenance data. In particular, PrivChain uses Zero Knowledge Range Proofs\n(ZKRPs), an efficient variant of ZKPs, to provide origin information without\ndisclosing the exact location of a supply chain product. Furthermore, the\nframework allows to compute proofs and commitments off-line, decoupling the\ncomputational overhead from blockchain. The proof verification process and\nincentive payment initiation are automated using blockchain transactions, smart\ncontracts, and events. A proof of concept implementation on Hyperledger Fabric\nreveals a minimal overhead of using PrivChain for blockchain enabled supply\nchains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 04:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the\nquery and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching.\nVID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video\ninference process across nodes.

However, this mistrust is not mirrored in our\nexpectations of human readers. Despite well-proven idiosyncrasies and biases in\nhuman decision making, we take comfort from the assumption that others make\ndecisions in a way as we do, and we trust our own decision making. Despite poor\nability to explain decision making processes in humans, we accept explanations\nof decisions given by other humans. Because the goal of radiology is the most\naccurate radiologic interpretation, our expectations of radiologists and AI\nshould be similar, and both should reflect a healthy mistrust of complicated\nand partially opaque decision processes undergoing in computer algorithms and\nhuman brains. This is generally not the case now.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 14:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

Sociotechnical inquiry is\nneeded to mitigate the harms of new technologies whose potential impacts remain\npoorly understood. To date, subfields of AI research develop primarily\nindividual views on their relationship with sociotechnics, while tools for\nexternal investigation, comparison, and cross-pollination are lacking. In this\npaper, we propose four directions for inquiry into new and evolving areas of\ntechnological development: value--what progress and direction does a field\npromote, optimization--how the defined system within a problem formulation\nrelates to broader dynamics, consensus--how agreement is achieved and who is\nincluded in building it, and failure--what methods are pursued when the problem\nspecification is found wanting. The paper provides a lexicon for sociotechnical\ninquiry and illustrates it through the example of consumer drone technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 16:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}
