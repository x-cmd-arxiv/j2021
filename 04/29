In this study, we\nextend the work on Occupancy Networks by exploiting cross-domain learning of\nimage and point cloud domains.

The focus of the\nprevious work was on the alignment of input images and pseudo-captions at the\nsentence level. However, pseudo-captions contain many words that are irrelevant\nto a given image.

TSN is widely recognized as the\nlong-term replacement of proprietary technologies for industrial control\nsystems.

The fifth-generation (5G)\nmobile/cellular technology has been designed with native support for\nultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC). 5G is promising to meet the\nstringent requirements of industrial systems in the wireless domain. Converged\noperation of 5G and TSN systems is crucial for achieving end-to-end\ndeterministic connectivity in industrial networks.

However, the most suitable positions for inferring\ndifferent targets, i.e., the object category and boundaries, are generally\ndifferent. Predicting all these targets from the same grid location thus may\nlead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we analyze the suitable inference\npositions for object category and boundaries, and propose a\nprediction-target-decoupled detector named PDNet to establish a more flexible\ndetection paradigm. Our PDNet with the prediction decoupling mechanism encodes\ndifferent targets separately in different locations. A learnable prediction\ncollection module is devised with two sets of dynamic points, i.e., dynamic\nboundary points and semantic points, to collect and aggregate the predictions\nfrom the favorable regions for localization and classification. We adopt a\ntwo-step strategy to learn these dynamic point positions, where the prior\npositions are estimated for different targets first, and the network further\npredicts residual offsets to the positions with better perceptions of the\nobject properties. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO benchmark demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

More\nspecifically, let $C$ be a class of strategies. It turns out that in many\ncases, to show that all two-player games on graphs with a given payoff function\nare determined in $C$, it is sufficient to do so for one-player games. That is,\nin many cases the determinacy in $C$ can be \"lifted\" from one-player games to\ntwo-player games. Namely, Gimbert and Zielonka~(CONCUR 2005) have shown this\nfor the class of positional strategies. Recently, Bouyer et al. (CONCUR 2020)\nhave extended this to the classes of arena-independent finite-memory\nstrategies. Informally, these are finite-memory strategies that use the same\nway of storing memory in all game graphs.\n  In this paper, we put the lifting technique into the context of memory\ncomplexity. The memory complexity of a payoff function measures, how many\nstates of memory we need to play optimally in game graphs with up to $n$ nodes,\ndepending on $n$. Now, assume that we know the memory complexity of our payoff\nfunction in one-player games. Then what can be said about its memory complexity\nin two-player games?

DW images (DWIs) are usually\nacquired in multi-slice settings where lesion areas in two consecutive 2D\nslices are highly discontinuous due to large slice thickness and sometimes even\nslice gaps. Therefore, although DWIs contain rich 3D information, they cannot\nbe treated as regular 3D or 2D images. Instead, DWIs are somewhere in-between\n(or 2.5D) due to the volumetric nature but inter-slice discontinuities. Thus,\nit is not ideal to apply most existing segmentation methods as they are\ndesigned for either 2D or 3D images. To tackle this problem, we propose a new\nneural network architecture tailored for segmenting highly-discontinuous 2.5D\ndata such as DWIs. Our network, termed LambdaUNet, extends UNet by replacing\nconvolutional layers with our proposed Lambda+ layers. In particular, Lambda+\nlayers transform both intra-slice and inter-slice context around a pixel into\nlinear functions, called lambdas, which are then applied to the pixel to\nproduce informative 2.5D features. LambdaUNet is simple yet effective in\ncombining sparse inter-slice information from adjacent slices while also\ncapturing dense contextual features within a single slice. Experiments on a\nunique clinical dataset demonstrate that LambdaUNet outperforms existing 3D/2D\nimage segmentation methods including recent variants of UNet.

Here, we introduce the Titans metal-poor reference stars: a sample of\n41 dwarf and subgiant stars with accurate parameters. Effective temperatures\n(Teff) were derived by fitting observed H$\\alpha$ profiles with synthetic lines\ncomputed using 3D hydrodynamic NLTE models. Surface gravities (logg) were\ncomputed using evolutionary tracks and parallaxes from Gaia EDR3. The same\nmethods recover the Teff values of the Gaia benchmark stars, which are mostly\nbased on interferometric measurements, with a 1$\\sigma$ dispersion of $\\pm 50$\nK. We assume this to be the accuracy of the H$\\alpha$ profiles computed from 3D\nnon-LTE models for metal-poor dwarfs and subgiants. We achieved an internal\nprecision typically between 30-40 K, these errors dominated by instrumental\neffects. The final total uncertainty for the Teff values of the Titans are thus\nestimated to be of the order of $1\\%$. The typical error for logg is $\\leq$\n0.04 dex. In addition, we identified a few members of Gaia-Enceladus, of\nSequoia, and of the Helmi stream in our sample.

In this work, we propose Monet, a novel and\nhighly accurate motion-guided non-local spatial-temporal network for video\ncrowd counting. Monet first takes people flow (motion information) as guidance\nto coarsely segment the regions of pixels where a person may be. Given these\nregions, Monet then uses a non-local spatial-temporal network to extract\nspatial-temporally both short and long-range contextual information. The whole\nnetwork is finally trained end-to-end with a fused loss to generate a\nhigh-quality density map.

It provides new opportunities to delineate how cells from\ndifferent origins form tissues with distinctive structures and functions. One\nimmediate question in spatial molecular profiling data analysis is to identify\ngenes whose expressions exhibit spatially correlated patterns, called spatially\nvariable genes. Most current methods to identify spatially variable genes are\nbuilt upon the geostatistical model with Gaussian process to capture the\nspatial patterns, which rely on ad hoc kernels that could limit the models'\nability to identify complex spatial patterns. In order to overcome this\nchallenge and capture more types of spatial patterns, we introduce a Bayesian\napproach to identify spatially variable genes via a modified Ising model. The\nkey idea is to use the energy interaction parameter of the Ising model to\ncharacterize spatial expression patterns. We use auxiliary variable Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample from the posterior distribution with an\nintractable normalizing constant in the model. Simulation studies using both\nsimulated and synthetic data showed that the energy-based modeling approach led\nto higher accuracy in detecting spatially variable genes than those\nkernel-based methods.

It is known\nthat MOND fails at explaining the observed velocity dispersion of the\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) with the justification that UFDs are more\nprone to tidal disruption in MOND compared to cold dark matter model. We show\nthat: (i) the ratio of tidal to internal acceleration in UFDs is extremely low,\n(ii) there is no correlation between the deviation of UFDs from MOND's\nprediction as a function of tidal susceptibility, and (iii) recent constraints\nfrom Gaia proper motion analysis on the orbital parameters of the UFDs\nexacerbates the challenge to MOND. In particular, Gaia data indicates that Ursa\nMajor I is experiencing a recent infall into the Milky Way's halo, and its\ninconsistency with MOND at 7-$\\sigma$ level can not be attributed to being an\nearly infall satellite. Moreover, the new data from Gaia DR2 shows Willman I to\nhave the least eccentric orbit of all UFDs, and its deviation from MOND at\n4-$\\sigma$ level can not be attributed to a highly eccentric orbit as\npreviously suggested. Finally, given that Tucana III is the only UFD observed\nto show tidal features, Reticulum II and Segue I are two other UFDs that\npotentially challenge MOND as they have comparable galactocentric distances to\nTucana III while showing no tidal features. Whether wide binaries have inflated\nthe velocity dispersion of the UFDs remains an open question to be addressed\nwith future multi-epoch observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 18:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 14:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

However, a\nnumber of applications such as community detection, clustering, or bottleneck\nidentification in large scale graph data-sets rely upon identifying the lowest\nsingular values and the singular corresponding vectors. For example, the lowest\nsingular values of a graph Laplacian reveal the number of isolated clusters\n(zero singular values) or bottlenecks (lowest non-zero singular values) for\nundirected, acyclic graphs. A naive approach here would be to perform a full\nSVD however, this quickly becomes infeasible for practical big data\napplications due to the enormous memory requirements.

Many methods have been proposed to solve the problem of\nselecting the number of clusters, considering it to be a problem with regard to\nmodel selection. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that automatically\nselects a suitable number of clusters based on a probability distribution model\nframework. The algorithm includes the following two components. First, a\ngeneralization of Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) is introduced. In\nKohonen's SOM, clusters are modeled as mean vectors. In the generalized SOM,\neach cluster is modeled as a probabilistic distribution and constructed by\nsamples classified based on the likelihood. Second, the dynamically updating\nmethod of the SOM structure is introduced. In Kohonen's SOM, each cluster is\ntied to a node of a fixed two-dimensional lattice space and learned using\nneighborhood relations between nodes based on Euclidean distance. The extended\nSOM defines a graph with clusters as vertices and neighborhood relations as\nlinks and updates the graph structure by cutting weakly-connection and\nunnecessary vertex deletions. The weakness of a link is measured using the\nKullback--Leibler divergence, and the redundancy of a vertex is measured using\nthe minimum description length. Those extensions make it efficient to determine\nthe appropriate number of clusters.

This can happen, for instance, when some\norganic molecule binds from one side to the substrate and from the other side\nto an atom or any other polarizable system.

However, when\ntalking with women in technology companies' leadership roles, a list of\nproblems women face grows fast. We invite women in software engineering\nmanagement roles to answer the questions from an empathy map canvas. We used\nthematic analysis for coding the answers and group the codes into themes. From\nthe analysis, we identified seven themes that support us to list the main\nchallenges they face in their careers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 19:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

Neuromorphic systems are extremely\nenergy-efficient and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs\nand GPUs. They have the potential to drive critical use cases such as\nautonomous vehicles, edge computing and internet of things in the future. For\nthis reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future\ncomputing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based\nmachine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning\napplications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based\nsimulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be\ncapable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of\nneuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove\nthat neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of\ngeneral-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic\ncomputing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two\nsynaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for\ncomputing all the {\\mu}-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and\nprojection functions) and all the {\\mu}-recursive operators (i.e., composition,\nprimitive recursion and minimization operators).

First, a nominal safety model for obstacle avoidance\nis derived, where realistic system constraints are considered. The nominal\nmodel is well-suited for safety control design for obstacle avoidance,\ngeofencing, and border patrol with analytically proven stability results. The\nsafety control utilizes distance measurement to maintain a safe distance by\ncompensating the robot's angular velocity. A supervisory logic is constructed\nto guarantee the overall stability and safety of the system. Operational safety\nand precision tracking are proven under parametric uncertainty and\nenvironmental uncertainty.

An IRS is\ndeployed to enhance the performance of wireless energy transfer (WET) and\nwireless information transfer (WIT) by intelligently adjusting phase shifts of\neach reflecting elements. To achieve its self-sustainability, the IRS needs to\ncollect energy from energy station to support its control circuit operation.\nOur proposed policy for the considered WPSN is called IRS assisted\nharvest-then-transmit time switching, which is able to schedule the\ntransmission time slots by switching between energy collection and energy\nreflection modes. We study the achievable sum throughput of the proposed\ntransmission policy and investigate a joint design of the transmission time\nslots, the power allocation, as well as the discrete phase shifts of the WET\nand WIT. This formulates the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program,\nwhich is NP-hard and non-convex. We first relax it to one with continuous phase\nshifts, and then propose a two-step approach and decompose the original problem\ninto two sub-problems. We solve the first sub-problem with respect to the phase\nshifts of the WIT in terms of closed-form expression.

Then we generalise the case with the circuit power of\neach sensor node, which can be solved via employing a semi-definite programming\nrelaxation. The optimal discrete phase shifts can be obtained by quantizing the\ncontinuous values.

We review the arguments made on both sides of this debate, and\nconclude that the repeated sampling variance is more appropriate. We review\ndifferent approaches for estimating the frequentist variance, and suggest a\nrecent proposal for combining bootstrapping with multiple imputation as a\nwidely applicable general solution. At the same time, in light of the\nconsequences of reference based assumptions for frequentist variance, we\nbelieve further scrutiny of these methods is warranted to determine whether the\nthe strength of their assumptions are generally justifiable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 20:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

The finalized protocol\nwas implemented at three different resolutions and the reproducibility was\nevaluated.

The method consists of stacking collected temporal snapshots into a\nmatrix and mapping the nonlinear dynamics using a linear operator. The standard\nprocedure considers that snapshots possess the same dimensionality for all the\nobservable data. However, this often does not occur in numerical simulations\nwith adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening schemes (AMR/C). This paper proposes a\nstrategy to enable DMD to extract features from observations with different\nmesh topologies and dimensions, such as those found in AMR/C simulations. For\nthis purpose, the adaptive snapshots are projected onto the same reference\nfunction space, enabling the use of snapshot-based methods such as DMD. The\npresent strategy is applied to challenging AMR/C simulations: a continuous\ndiffusion-reaction epidemiological model for COVID-19, a density-driven gravity\ncurrent simulation, and a bubble rising problem. We also evaluate the DMD\nefficiency to reconstruct the dynamics and some relevant quantities of\ninterest. In particular, for the SEIRD model and the bubble rising problem, we\nevaluate DMD's ability to extrapolate in time (short-time future estimates).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Dusty debris disks exist exclusively around white dwarfs\ncooler than 27,000 K. This is all the more enigmatic given that the formation\nprocesses of dusty debris disks should favor younger, hotter white dwarfs,\nwhich likely host more dynamically unstable planetary systems. Here we apply a\nsophisticated material sublimation model to white dwarf systems to show that\nthese statistics are actually a natural result of the interplay of thermal and\ntidal forces, and show how they define the circumstellar regions where dusty\ndebris disks can form. We demonstrate that these processes tend to prevent\nstability against both sublimative destruction and reaccretion into\nplanetesimals for rocky materials until white dwarfs cool to below\n~25,000-32,000 K, in agreement with the observed limit of ~27,000 K. For pure\nwater ice, this critical temperature is less than 2,700 K (requiring a cooling\nage older the universe); this precludes pure water ice-rich debris disks\nforming through the accepted two-step mechanism. The critical temperature is\nsize-dependent; more massive white dwarfs could potentially host dusty debris\ndisks at warmer temperatures. Our model suggests that the location of the disks\nwithin the PG 0010+280, GD 56, GD 362, and PG 1541+651 systems are consistent\nwith a forsterite-dominated olivine composition. We also find that very cool\nwhite dwarfs may simultaneously host multiple, independently formed dusty\ndebris disks, consistent with observations of the LSPM J0207+3331 system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

We study this edge performance inversion problem through an\nanalytic comparison of edge and cloud latencies and analyze conditions under\nwhich the edge can yield worse performance than the cloud. To verify our\nanalytic results, we conduct a detailed experimental comparison of the edge and\nthe cloud latencies using a realistic application and real cloud workloads.\nBoth our analytical and experimental results show that even at moderate\nutilizations, the edge queuing delays can offset the benefits of lower network\nlatencies, and even result in performance inversion where running in the cloud\nwould provide superior latencies. We finally discuss practical implications of\nour results and provide insights into how application designers and service\nproviders should design edge applications and systems to avoid these pitfalls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 00:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

To the extent possible, the candidates are presented through the use\nof a global coordinate patch -- some of the prior literature (especially\nconcerning traversable wormholes) has often proposed coordinate systems for\ndesirable solutions to the Einstein equations requiring a multi-patch atlas.\nThe most interesting cases include the so-called `exponential metric' --\nwell-favoured by proponents of alternative theories of gravity but which\nactually has a standard classical interpretation, and the `black-bounce' to\ntraversable wormhole case -- where a metric is explored which represents either\na traversable wormhole or a regular black hole, depending on the value of the\nnewly introduced scalar parameter $a$. This notion of `black-bounce' is defined\nas the case where the spherical boundary of a regular black hole forces one to\ntravel towards a one-way traversable `bounce' into a future reincarnation of\nour own universe.

(I) The late bump followed by a steep decay is strongly reminiscent of\nthe afterglows of GRB 170817A, which is attributed to an off-axis observed\nexternal-forward shock (eFS) propagating in an interstellar medium. (II)\nObservations seem to feature a long shallow decay before the late optical bump,\nwhich is different from the afterglow of GRB 170817A.

The\nlate simultaneous bumps/plateaux in the optical and X-ray afterglows are really\nfound around the jet break for high-viewing-angle observers. Moreover, there is\na long plateau or shallow decay before the late bump in the theoretical\nlight-curves, which is formed during the eFS propagating in the free-wind. For\nlow-viewing-angle observers, the above bumps appear only in the situation that\nthe structured jet has a low characteristic angle and the deceleration radius\nof the on-axis jet flow is at around or beyond the free-wind boundary. As\nexamples, the X-ray and optical afterglows of GRBs 120326A, 120404A, and\n100814A are fitted.

To this end, we attempt\nto recover possible diffusion links based on user similarities, which are\nextracted by embedding users into a latent space. Following this, we further\nderive the condition under which users will be overloaded, and formulate the\ncompeting processes where users' behaviors differ before and after information\noverload. By establishing the explicit expressions of competing dynamics, we\ndisclose that information overload acts as the critical \"boundary line\", before\nwhich the \"winner takes all\" phenomenon will definitively occur, whereas after\ninformation overload the share of influences gradually stabilizes and is\njointly affected by their initial spreading conditions, influence powers and\nthe advent of overload. Numerous experiments are conducted to validate our\ntheoretical results where favorable agreement is found. Our work sheds light on\nthe intrinsic driving forces behind real-world dynamics, thus providing useful\ninsights into effective information engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 03:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

This paper contributes\nan information flow control type system for linear session types. The type\nsystem stands in close correspondence with intuitionistic linear logic.\nIntuitionistic linear logic typing ensures that process configurations form a\ntree such that client processes are parent nodes and provider processes child\nnodes. To control the propagation of secret messages, the type system is\nenriched with secrecy levels and arranges these levels to be aligned with the\nconfiguration tree.

The\nsketch size can be as small as the effective dimension of the data matrix to\nguarantee linear convergence. However, a major difficulty in choosing the\nsketch size in terms of the effective dimension lies in the fact that the\nlatter is usually unknown in practice. Current sketching-based solvers for\nregularized least-squares fall short on addressing this issue. Our main\ncontribution is to propose adaptive versions of standard sketching-based\niterative solvers, namely, the iterative Hessian sketch and the preconditioned\nconjugate gradient method, that do not require a priori estimation of the\neffective dimension. We propose an adaptive mechanism to control the sketch\nsize according to the progress made in each step of the iterative solver. If\nenough progress is not made, the sketch size increases to improve the\nconvergence rate.

Consequently, our adaptive methods improve the\nstate-of-the-art complexity for solving dense, ill-conditioned least-squares\nproblems.

To balance model freshness and label certainty, previous\nmethods set a short waiting window or even do not wait for the conversion\nsignal. If conversion happens outside the waiting window, this sample will be\nduplicated and ingested into the training pipeline with a positive label.\nHowever, these methods have some issues. First, they assume the observed\nfeature distribution remains the same as the actual distribution. But this\nassumption does not hold due to the ingestion of duplicated samples. Second,\nthe certainty of the conversion action only comes from the positives. But the\npositives are scarce as conversions are sparse in commercial systems. These\nissues induce bias during the modeling of delayed feedback. In this paper, we\npropose DElayed FEedback modeling with Real negatives (DEFER) method to address\nthese issues. The proposed method ingests real negative samples into the\ntraining pipeline. The ingestion of real negatives ensures the observed feature\ndistribution is equivalent to the actual distribution, thus reducing the bias.\nThe ingestion of real negatives also brings more certainty information of the\nconversion. To correct the distribution shift, DEFER employs importance\nsampling to weigh the loss function. Experimental results on industrial\ndatasets validate the superiority of DEFER. DEFER have been deployed in the\ndisplay advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining over 6.0% improvement on CVR\nin several scenarios.

In this\napproach, it is common to use bilevel optimization where one optimizes the\nmodel weights over the training data (inner problem) and various\nhyperparameters such as the configuration of the architecture over the\nvalidation data (outer problem). This paper explores the statistical aspects of\nsuch problems with train-validation splits. In practice, the inner problem is\noften overparameterized and can easily achieve zero loss. Thus, a-priori it\nseems impossible to distinguish the right hyperparameters based on training\nloss alone which motivates a better understanding of the role of\ntrain-validation split. To this aim this work establishes the following\nresults. (1) We show that refined properties of the validation loss such as\nrisk and hyper-gradients are indicative of those of the true test loss. This\nreveals that the outer problem helps select the most generalizable model and\nprevent overfitting with a near-minimal validation sample size. This is\nestablished for continuous search spaces which are relevant for differentiable\nschemes. Extensions to transfer learning are developed in terms of the mismatch\nbetween training & validation distributions.

When\noptimized with gradient-descent, we show that the train-validation procedure\nreturns the best (model, architecture) pair even if all architectures can\nperfectly fit the training data to achieve zero error.

However, there is also a third, poorly understood\nregime in which the accretion flow consists of a torus of diamagnetic blobs\nthat encircles the WD. This mode of accretion is expected to exist at\nmass-transfer rates below those observed during disk-fed accretion, but above\nthose observed during pure stream-fed accretion. We invoke the diamagnetic-blob\nregime to explain the exceptional TESS light curve of the intermediate polar TX\nCol, which transitioned into and out of states of enhanced accretion during\nCycles 1 and 3. Power-spectral analysis reveals that the accretion was\nprincipally stream-fed. However, when the mass-transfer rate spiked,\nlarge-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) abruptly appeared and\ndominated the light curve for weeks. The QPOs have two striking properties:\nthey appear in a stream-fed geometry at elevated accretion rates, and they\noccur preferentially within a well-defined range of frequencies (~10-25 cycles\nper day). We propose that during episodes of enhanced accretion, a torus of\ndiamagnetic blobs forms near the binary's circularization radius and that the\nQPOs are beats between the white dwarf's spin frequency and unstable blob\norbits within the WD's magnetosphere. We discuss how such a torus could be a\ncritical step in producing an accretion disk in a formerly diskless system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 06:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 05:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 19:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Several approaches presented good\nperformance on reconstructing 3D shapes by learning solely from images, i.e.,\nwithout using 3D models in training. Challenges, however, remain in texture\ngeneration due to the gap between 2D and 3D modals.

Two\neffects that deteriorates the signal in MCvD are noise and inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI). The expected channel impulse response of MCvD has a long\nand slow attenuating tail due to molecular diffusion which causes ISI and\nfurther limits the slow data rate of MCvD. The extent that ISI and noise are\nsuppressed in an MCvD system determines its effectiveness, especially at a high\ndata rate. Although ISI-suppression approaches have been investigated, most of\nthem are addressed as non-essential parts in other topics, such as signal\ndetection or modulation. Furthermore, most of the state-of-the-art\nISI-suppression approaches are performed by subtracting the estimated ISI from\nthe total signal. In this work, we investigate ISI-suppression from a new\nperspective of filters to filter ISI out without any ISI estimation. The\nprinciples for a good design of ISI-suppression filters in MCvD are\ninvestigated. Based on the principles, an ISI-suppression filter with good\nanti-noise capability and an associated signal detection scheme is proposed for\nMCvD scenarios with both ISI and noise. We compare the proposed scheme with the\nstate-of-the-art ISI-suppression approaches. The result manifests that the\nproposed ISI-suppression scheme could recover signals deteriorated severely by\nboth ISI and noise, which could not be effectively detected by the\nstate-of-the-art ISI-suppression approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 05:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 14:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

While these models are\nconvenient for detailed simulations, their size is often an obstacle to\nderiving mechanistic insights. One way to address this issue is to perform an\nexact model reduction by finding a self-consistent lower-dimensional projection\nof the corresponding dynamical system. Recently, a new algorithm CLUE has been\ndesigned and implemented, which allows one to construct an exact linear\nreduction of the smallest possible dimension such that the fixed variables of\ninterest are preserved. It turned out that allowing arbitrary linear\ncombinations (as opposed to zero-one combinations used in the prior approaches)\nmay yield a much smaller reduction. However, there was a drawback: some of the\nnew variables did not have clear physical meaning, thus making the reduced\nmodel harder to interpret. We design and implement an algorithm that, given an\nexact linear reduction, re-parametrizes it by performing an invertible\ntransformation of the new coordinates to improve the interpretability of the\nnew variables. We apply our algorithm to three case studies and show that\n\"uninterpretable\" variables disappear entirely in all the case studies.

Therefore, the current state-of-the-art EIG and SVD\nimplementations may achieve only a small fraction of the system's sustained\npeak performance. The QR-based Dynamically Weighted Halley (QDWH) algorithm may\nbe used as a pre-processing step toward the EIG and SVD solvers, while\nmitigating the aforementioned bottleneck.

Since the applicability of the\nIsrael-Stewart hydrodynamics assumes the perturbative character of the viscous\nstress tensor, $\\pi^{\\mu\\nu}$, which should not exceed the ideal\nenergy-momentum tensor, $T_{\\rm id}^{\\mu\\nu}$, hydrodynamical codes usually\nrescale the shear stress tensor if the inequality $\\|\\pi^{\\mu\\nu}\\|\\ll \\|T_{\\rm\nid}^{\\mu\\nu}\\|$ is not fulfilled in some sense.

Existing studies regard the\ntime information as a single type of feature and focus on how to associate it\nwith user preferences on items. However, we argue they are insufficient for\nfully learning the time information because the temporal patterns of user\npreference are usually heterogeneous. A user's preference for a particular item\nmay 1) increase periodically or 2) evolve over time under the influence of\nsignificant recent events, and each of these two kinds of temporal pattern\nappears with some unique characteristics. In this paper, we first define the\nunique characteristics of the two kinds of temporal pattern of user preference\nthat should be considered in time-aware recommender systems. Then we propose a\nnovel recommender system for timely recommendations, called TimelyRec, which\njointly learns the heterogeneous temporal patterns of user preference\nconsidering all of the defined characteristics. In TimelyRec, a cascade of two\nencoders captures the temporal patterns of user preference using a proposed\nattention module for each encoder. Moreover, we introduce an evaluation\nscenario that evaluates the performance on predicting an interesting item and\nwhen to recommend the item simultaneously in top-K recommendation (i.e.,\nitem-timing recommendation). Our extensive experiments on a scenario for item\nrecommendation and the proposed scenario for item-timing recommendation on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TimelyRec and the proposed\nattention modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 08:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

Namely, we find that\nfor small outlet diameters $D$ the flow rate increased with $f$, while for\nlarger $D$ a non-monotonic behavior is confirmed. Furthermore, using a\ncoarse-graining technique, we compute the macroscopic density, momentum, and\nthe stress tensor fields. These results show conclusively that changes in the\ndischarge process are directly related to changes in the flow pattern from\nfunnel flow to mass flow. Moreover, by decomposing the mass flux (linear\nmomentum field) at the orifice into two main factors: macroscopic velocity and\ndensity fields, we obtain that the non-monotonic behavior of the linear\nmomentum is caused by density changes rather than by changes in the macroscopic\nvelocity. In addition, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the kinetic\nstress, we find that for small orifices increasing rotational shear enhances\nthe mean kinetic pressure $\\langle p^k \\rangle$ and the system dilatancy. This\nreduces the stability of the arches, and, consequently, the volumetric flow\nrate increases monotonically.

However, due to the lack of\nknowledge or information, time pressure, complex context, etc., various\nuncertainties emerge during the development, leading to assumptions made in DL\nframeworks. Though not all the assumptions are negative to the frameworks,\nbeing unaware of certain assumptions can result in critical problems (e.g.,\nsystem vulnerability and failures, inconsistencies, and increased cost). As the\nfirst step of addressing the critical problems, there is a need to explore and\nunderstand the assumptions made in DL frameworks. To this end, we conducted an\nexploratory study to understand self-claimed assumptions (SCAs) about their\ndistribution, classification, and impacts using code comments from nine popular\nDL framework projects on GitHub. The results are that: (1) 3,084 SCAs are\nscattered across 1,775 files in the nine DL frameworks, ranging from 1,460\n(TensorFlow) to 8 (Keras) SCAs. (2) There are four types of validity of SCAs:\nValid SCA, Invalid SCA, Conditional SCA, and Unknown SCA, and four types of\nSCAs based on their content: Configuration and Context SCA, Design SCA, Tensor\nand Variable SCA, and Miscellaneous SCA. (3) Both valid and invalid SCAs may\nhave an impact within a specific scope (e.g., in a function) on the DL\nframeworks. Certain technical debt is induced when making SCAs. There are\nsource code written and decisions made based on SCAs. This is the first study\non investigating SCAs in DL frameworks, which helps researchers and\npractitioners to get a comprehensive understanding on the assumptions made. We\nalso provide the first dataset of SCAs for further research and practice in\nthis area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 08:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

In several applications, ensuring the fairness of the node (or graph)\nrepresentations with respect to some protected attributes is crucial for their\ncorrect deployment. Yet, fairness in graph deep learning remains\nunder-explored, with few solutions available. In particular, the tendency of\nsimilar nodes to cluster on several real-world graphs (i.e., homophily) can\ndramatically worsen the fairness of these procedures. In this paper, we propose\na novel biased edge dropout algorithm (FairDrop) to counter-act homophily and\nimprove fairness in graph representation learning. FairDrop can be plugged in\neasily on many existing algorithms, is efficient, adaptable, and can be\ncombined with other fairness-inducing solutions. After describing the general\nalgorithm, we demonstrate its application on two benchmark tasks, specifically,\nas a random walk model for producing node embeddings, and to a graph\nconvolutional network for link prediction. We prove that the proposed algorithm\ncan successfully improve the fairness of all models up to a small or negligible\ndrop in accuracy, and compares favourably with existing state-of-the-art\nsolutions. In an ablation study, we demonstrate that our algorithm can flexibly\ninterpolate between biasing towards fairness and an unbiased edge dropout.\nFurthermore, to better evaluate the gains, we propose a new dyadic group\ndefinition to measure the bias of a link prediction task when paired with\ngroup-based fairness metrics. In particular, we extend the metric used to\nmeasure the bias in the node embeddings to take into account the graph\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 08:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

By results of Tinhofer (1986, 1991)\nand Dvo\\v{r}\\'ak (2010), two graphs G and H are fractionally isomorphic if and\nonly if, for every tree T, the number of homomorphisms from T to G equals the\ncorresponding number from T to H, which means that the tree distance of G and H\nis zero. Our main result is that this correspondence between the equivalence\nrelations \"fractional isomorphism\" and \"equal tree homomorphism densities\" can\nbe extended to a correspondence between the associated distance measures.

The origin of hot exozodiacal dust and its connection\nwith outer dust reservoirs remains unclear. Aims.

We use precision near-infrared\ninterferometry with VLTI/PIONIER to search for resolved emission at H band\naround a selected sample of nearby stars. Results. Our observations reveal the\npresence of resolved near-infrared emission around 17 out of 52 stars, four of\nwhich are shown to be due to a previously unknown stellar companion.

The\nshort timescales of these transitions present a challenge to the unified model\nof AGN and the physical processes causing these transitions remain poorly\nunderstood. CLQs also provide interesting samples for the study of AGN host\ngalaxies since the central emission disappears almost entirely. Previous\nsearches for CLQs have utilised photometric variability or SDSS classification\nchanges to systematically identify CLQs, this approach may miss lower\nluminosity CLQs. In this paper, we aim to use spectroscopic data to asses if\nanalysis difference spectra can be used to detect further changing look quasars\nmissed by photometric searches. We search SDSS-II DR 7 repeat spectra for\nsources that exhibit either a disappearance or appearance of both broad line\nemission and accretion disk continuum emission by directly analysing the\ndifference spectrum between two epochs of observation. From a sample of 24,782\nobjects with difference spectra, our search yielded six CLQs within the\nredshift range $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.3$, including four newly identified sources.\nSpectral analysis indicates that changes in accretion rate can explain the\nchanging-look behaviour. While a change in dust extinction fits the changes in\nspectral shape, the time-scales of the changes observed are too short for\nobscuration from torus clouds. Using difference spectra was shown to be an\neffective and sensitive way to detect CLQs. We recover CLQs an order of\nmagnitude lower in luminosities than those found by photometric searches and\nachieve higher completeness than spectroscopic searches relying on pipeline\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 09:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The assessment can be performed using\nElectronic Medical Records (EMRs). Patient similarity measurement requires\nconverting heterogeneous EMRs into comparable formats to calculate their\ndistance. While versatile document representation learning methods have been\ndeveloped in recent years, it is still unclear how complex EMR data should be\nprocessed to create the most useful patient representations. This study\npresents a new data representation method for EMRs that takes the information\nin clinical narratives into account. To address the limitations of previous\napproaches in handling complex parts of EMR data, an unsupervised method is\nproposed for building a patient representation, which integrates unstructured\ndata with structured data extracted from patients' EMRs. In order to model the\nextracted data, we employed a tree structure that captures the temporal\nrelations of multiple medical events from EMR. We processed clinical notes to\nextract symptoms, signs, and diseases using different tools such as medspaCy,\nMetaMap, and scispaCy and mapped entities to the Unified Medical Language\nSystem (UMLS). After creating a tree data structure, we utilized two novel\nrelabeling methods for the non-leaf nodes of the tree to capture two temporal\naspects of the extracted events. By traversing the tree, we generated a\nsequence that could create an embedding vector for each patient.

For extinct and smooth enough sources, we show\nthat all observable quantities are uniquely and analytically determined by the\nholomorphic Fourier transform of the anisotropic stress correlator. Both the\nstrain power spectrum and the energy density parameter are shown to have an\noscillatory fine structure, they significantly differ on large scales while\nrunning in phase opposition at large wavenumbers $k$. We then discuss scaling\nsources that are never extinct nor smooth and which generate a singular Fourier\ntransform of the anisotropic stress correlator. For these, we find the\nappearance of interferences on top of the above-mentioned fine-structure as\nwell as atypical behaviour at small scales. For instance, we expect the\nrescaled strain power spectrum $k^2 \\mathcal{P}_h$ generated by long cosmic\nstrings in the matter era to oscillate around a scale invariant plateau. These\nsingular sources are also shown to produce orders of magnitude difference\nbetween the rescaled strain spectra and the energy density parameter suggesting\nthat only the former should be used for making reliable observable predictions.\nFinally, we discuss how measuring such a fine structure in the SGWB could\ndisambiguate the possible cosmological sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 09:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

However, a substantial amount of signal processing is\nneeded since the dip in the signal detected, an indication that there is a\nplanet in transit, is minuscule compared to the overall background signal due\nmainly to its host star. In this paper, we put forth a doable and\nstraightforward method to enhance the signal and reduce noise. We discuss how\nto achieve higher planetary signals by subtracting equal halves of the host\nstar - a folded detection. This results in a light curve with a double\npeak-to-peak signal, 2R_p^2/R_s^2, compared to the usual transit. We derive an\nexpression of the light curve and investigate the effect of two common noises:\nthe white Gaussian background noise and the noise due to the occurrences of\nsunspots. We show that in both simulation and analytical expression, the folded\ntransit reduces the effective noise by a factor of 1/sqrt(2). This reduction\nand the doubling of the signal enables (1) less number of transit measurements\nto get a definitive transiting planet signal and (2) detection of smaller\nplanetary radii with the usual transit with the same number of transit data.\nFurthermore, we show that in the presence of multiple sunspots, the estimation\nof planetary parameters is more accurate.

In this work,\nwe put forward a quantum radiative compression method to post-compress a highly\naccelerated proton beam and convert it to a dense quasi-monoenergetic one. We\nfind that when the relativistic plasma produced by radiation pressure\nacceleration collides head-on with an ultraintense laser beam, large-amplitude\nplasma oscillations are excited due to quantum radiation-reaction and the\nponderomotive force, which induce compression of the phase space of protons\nlocated in its acceleration phase with negative gradient. Our three-dimensional\nspin-resolved QED particle-in-cell simulations show that hollow-structure\nproton beams with a peak energy $\\sim$ GeV, relative energy spread of few\npercents and number $N_p\\sim10^{10}$ (or $N_p\\sim 10^9$ with a $1\\%$ energy\nspread) can be produced in near future laser facilities, which may fulfill the\nrequirements of important applications, such as, for radiography of ultra-thick\ndense materials, or as injectors of hadron colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 10:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

With the introduction of ULFM (User Level Fault Mitigation\nlibrary), it has been provided with a possible way to overtake a fault during\nthe application execution at the cost of code modifications. ULFM is intrusive\nin the application and requires also a deep understanding of its recovery\nprocedures.\n  In this paper we propose Legio, a framework that lowers the complexity of\nintroducing resiliency in an embarrassingly parallel MPI application. By hiding\nULFM behind the MPI calls, the library is capable to expose resiliency features\nto the application in a transparent manner thus removing any integration\neffort. Upon fault, the failed nodes are discarded and the execution continues\nonly with the non-failed ones.

The key role in the description of inflation is played by the\nheteroclinic orbits which run from the asymptotic saddle points to the late\ntime attractor point and are approximated by nonminimal slow roll conditions.\nTo seek the asymptotic fixed points we outline a heuristic method in terms of\nthe \"effective potential\" and \"effective mass\", which can be applied for any\nnonminimally coupled theories. As particular examples we study positive\nquadratic nonminimal couplings with quadratic and quartic potentials, and note\nhow the portraits differ qualitatively from the known scalar-curvature\ncounterparts. For quadratic models inflation can only occur at small nonminimal\ncoupling to torsion, as for larger coupling the asymptotic de Sitter saddle\npoint disappears from the physical phase space.

The proposal of long-time\nrange (ms) bio-mimetic synaptic waveforms is a challenge to compact and power\nefficient neuromorphic hardware.

In addition to\nrelevance-based retrieval, these results can be further used for skill\nassessment and irregularity detection in cataract surgery videos. In this\npaper, a three-module framework is proposed to detect and classify the relevant\nphase segments in cataract videos. Taking advantage of an idle frame\nrecognition network, the video is divided into idle and action segments. To\nboost the performance in relevance detection, the cornea where the relevant\nsurgical actions are conducted is detected in all frames using Mask R-CNN. The\nspatiotemporally localized segments containing higher-resolution information\nabout the pupil texture and actions, and complementary temporal information\nfrom the same phase are fed into the relevance detection module. This module\nconsists of four parallel recurrent CNNs being responsible to detect four\nrelevant phases that have been defined with medical experts. The results will\nthen be integrated to classify the action phases as irrelevant or one of four\nrelevant phases.

This paper proposes\nleveraging online shopping behaviors as a proxy for personal lifestyle choices\nto improve chronic disease prevention literacy, targeted for times when\ne-commerce user experience has been assimilated into most people's everyday\nlives.\n  Methods: Longitudinal query logs and purchase records from 15 million online\nshoppers were accessed, constructing a broad spectrum of lifestyle features\ncovering various product categories and buyer personas. Using the\nlifestyle-related information preceding online shoppers' first purchases of\nspecific prescription drugs, we could determine associations between their past\nlifestyle choices and whether they suffered from a particular chronic disease.\n  Results: Novel lifestyle risk factors were discovered in two\nexemplars--depression and type 2 diabetes, most of which showed reasonable\nconsistency with existing healthcare knowledge.

One of the main limitations arises\nfrom the randomly-fluctuating local oscillator (LO) frequency, which introduces\n\"phase slips\" for long interrogation times and hence failure of the\nfrequency-feedback loop. Here we propose a strategy to improve the stability of\natomic clocks by interrogating two out-of-phase state sharing the same LO.\nWhile standard Ramsey interrogation can only determine phases unambiguously in\nthe interval $[-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]$, the joint interrogation allows for an extension\nto $[-\\pi,\\pi]$, resulting in a relaxed restriction of the Ramsey time and\nimprovement of absolute clock stability. Theoretical predictions are supported\nby ab-initio numerical simulation for white and correlated LO noise. While our\nbasic protocol uses uncorrelated atoms, we have further extended it to include\nspin-squeezing and further improving the scaling of clock stability with the\nnumber of atoms.

It is of paramount importance for understanding the\ninformation diffusion process such as the spread of rumors and the propagation\nof new technologies in social networks.

However, these models do\nnot take into account social factors such as personality traits which drive\nhuman's participation in the information diffusion process.

However, within\nquantum theory, the idea of physical realism is not well established. A\nframework to analyse how observations in experiments can be described using\nsome physical states of reality was recently developed, known as ontological\nmodels framework. Different principles when imposed on the ontological level\ngive rise to different theories, the validity of which can be tested based on\nthe statistics generated by these theories. Using the ontological models\nframework, we formulate a novel notion of classicality termed\nontic-distinguishability, which is based upon the physical principles that in\nclassical theories extremal states are physical states of reality and every\nsharp measurement observes the state of the system perfectly. We construct a\ncommunication task in which the success probability is bounded from above for\nontological models satisfying the notion of ontic-distinguishability. Contrary\nto previous notions of classicality which either required systems of dimension\nstrictly greater than two or atleast three preparations, a violation of\nontic-distinguishability can be observed using just a pair of qubits and a pair\nof incompatible measurements. We further show that violation of previously\nknown notions of classicality such as preparation non-contextuality and Bell's\nlocal causality is a violation of ontic-distinguishability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 10:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to\ngravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In\nparticular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark\nmatter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of\ncaptured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on\neither the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions,\nwe account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form\nfactors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects\npertinent to sub-GeV dark matter. Electrons are treated as relativistic,\ndegenerate targets, with Pauli blocking, finite temperature and multiple\nscattering effects all taken into account. We also estimate the dark matter\nevaporation rate. The DM-nucleon/electron scattering cross sections can be\nconstrained by comparing the heating rate due to dark matter capture with\nobservations of cold white dwarfs in dark matter-rich environments. We apply\nthis technique to observations of old white dwarfs in the globular cluster\nMessier 4, which we assume to be located in a DM subhalo. For DM-nucleon\nscattering, we find that white dwarfs can probe the sub-GeV mass range\ninaccessible to direct detection searches, with the low mass reach limited only\nby either evaporation or dominant DM annihilation to neutrinos, and can be\ncompetitive with direct detection in the $1-10^4$ GeV range.

Colorization to translate a nighttime TIR image\ninto a daytime color (NTIR2DC) image may be a promising way to facilitate\nnighttime scene perception. Despite recent impressive advances in image\ntranslation, semantic encoding entanglement and geometric distortion in the\nNTIR2DC task remain under-addressed. Hence, we propose a toP-down attEntion And\ngRadient aLignment based GAN, referred to as PearlGAN. A top-down guided\nattention module and an elaborate attentional loss are first designed to reduce\nthe semantic encoding ambiguity during translation. Then, a structured gradient\nalignment loss is introduced to encourage edge consistency between the\ntranslated and input images. In addition, pixel-level annotation is carried out\non a subset of FLIR and KAIST datasets to evaluate the semantic preservation\nperformance of multiple translation methods. Furthermore, a new metric is\ndevised to evaluate the geometric consistency in the translation process.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PearlGAN over\nother image translation methods for the NTIR2DC task.

These two processes commute and both of them commute with the\nunitary evolution controlled by the systems Hamiltonian. The corresponding\nmemory kernel gives rise to semi-Markov evolution of the diagonal elements of\nthe density matrix. However, the corresponding evolution needs not be\ncompletely positive. The role of decoherence generator is to restore complete\npositivity. Hence, to pose the dynamical problem one needs two processes\ngenerated by classical semi-Markov memory kernel and purely quantum decoherence\ngenerator. This scheme is illustrated for a qubit evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this\nproblem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling\ndecisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary\napproaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly\nadapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that\nare slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need\nfor scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile\nenvironments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a\nGradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with\nrespect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive\ndigital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled\nSimulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create\na hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of\nService (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches\nallow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments. Experiments\nconducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI*\nmethods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption,\nresponse time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4,\nand 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 17:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 13:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

Here, we further advance the modeling of water by\nbuilding a more accurate model on the fourth rung of Jacob's ladder with the\nhybrid functional, SCAN0. In particular, we carry out both classical and\nFeynman path-integral molecular dynamics calculations of water with the SCAN0\nfunctional and the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. In order to generate the\nequilibrated structure of water, a deep neural network potential is trained\nfrom the atomic potential energy surface based on ab initio data obtained from\nSCAN0 DFT calculations. For the electronic properties of water, a separate deep\nneural network potential is trained using the Deep Wannier method based on the\nmaximally localized Wannier functions of the equilibrated trajectory at the\nSCAN0 level. The structural, dynamic, and electric properties of water were\nanalyzed. The hydrogen-bond structures, density, infrared spectra, diffusion\ncoefficients, and dielectric constants of water, in the electronic ground\nstate, are computed using a large simulation box and long simulation time. For\nthe properties involving electronic excitations, we apply the GW approximation\nwithin many-body perturbation theory to calculate the quasiparticle density of\nstates and bandgap of water. Compared to the SCAN functional, mixing exact\nexchange mitigates the self-interaction error in the meta-generalized-gradient\napproximation and further softens liquid water towards the experimental\ndirection. For most of the water properties, the SCAN0 functional shows a\nsystematic improvement over the SCAN functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

PSR J0537-6910 is a young energetic X-ray pulsar and is the\nmost frequent glitcher known. The inter-glitch braking index of the pulsar\nsuggests that gravitational-wave emission due to r-mode oscillations may play\nan important role in the spin evolution of this pulsar. Theoretical models\nconfirm this possibility and predict emission at a level that can be probed by\nground-based detectors. In order to explore this scenario, we search for r-mode\nemission in the epochs between glitches by using a contemporaneous timing\nephemeris obtained from NICER data. We do not detect any signals in the\ntheoretically expected band of 86-97 Hz, and report upper limits on the\namplitude of the gravitational waves. Our results improve on previous amplitude\nupper limits from r-modes in J0537-6910 by a factor of up to 3 and place\nstringent constraints on theoretical models for r-mode driven spin-down in PSR\nJ0537-6910, especially for higher frequencies at which our results reach below\nthe spin-down limit defined by energy conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 12:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Conventionally, fixed air filters are not used as\na key pandemic prevention method for public indoor spaces because they are\nunable to trap the airborne pathogens in time in the entire room. However, by\ncombining the mobility of a robot with air filtration, the efficacy of cleaning\nup the air around multiple people is largely increased. A disinfection co-robot\nprototype is thus developed to provide continuous and occupant-friendly\nprotection to people gathering indoors, specifically for students in a\nclassroom scenario. In a static classroom with students sitting in a grid\npattern, the mobile robot is able to serve up to 14 students per cycle while\nreducing the worst-case pathogen dosage by 20%, and with higher robustness\ncompared to a static filter. The extent of robot protection is optimized by\ntuning the passing distance and speed, such that a robot is able to serve more\npeople given a threshold of worst-case dosage a person can receive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

Recently, deep learning-based cloud detection methods have\nsurpassed classical methods based on rules and physical models of clouds.\nHowever, most of these deep models are very large which limits their\napplicability and explainability, while other models do not make use of the\nfull spectral information in multi-spectral images such as Sentinel-2. In this\npaper, we propose a lightweight network for cloud detection, fusing multi-scale\nspectral and spatial features (CDFM3SF) and tailored for processing all\nspectral bands in Sentinel- 2A images. The proposed method consists of an\nencoder and a decoder. In the encoder, three input branches are designed to\nhandle spectral bands at their native resolution and extract multiscale\nspectral features. Three novel components are designed: a mixed depth-wise\nseparable convolution (MDSC) and a shared and dilated residual block (SDRB) to\nextract multi-scale spatial features, and a concatenation and sum (CS)\noperation to fuse multi-scale spectral and spatial features with little\ncalculation and no additional parameters. The decoder of CD-FM3SF outputs three\ncloud masks at the same resolution as input bands to enhance the supervision\ninformation of small, middle and large clouds. To validate the performance of\nthe proposed method, we manually labeled 36 Sentinel-2A scenes evenly\ndistributed over mainland China. The experiment results demonstrate that\nCD-FM3SF outperforms traditional cloud detection methods and state-of-theart\ndeep learning-based methods in both accuracy and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 09:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Ultimately this is leading to a\nWork-Life Balance for the workers. But how is this possible? It is practically\npossible with the Machine Learning algorithms to predict, calculate the factors\naffecting the feelings of the worker's work-life balance. In order to actually\ndo this, a sizeable amount of 12,756 people's data has been taken under\nconsideration. Upon analysing the data and calculating under various factors,\nwe have found out the correlation of various factors and WLB(Work-Life Balance\nin short). There are some factors that have to be taken into serious\nconsideration as they play a major role in WLB. We have trained 80% of our data\nwith Random Forest Classifier, SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms.

To this\npurpose, possibly the most widespread tool is provided by the so-called plug-in\nestimator, whose statistical properties in terms of bias and variance were\ninvestigated since the first decade after the publication of Shannon's seminal\nworks. In the case of an underlying multinomial distribution, while the bias\ncan be evaluated by knowing support and data set size, variance is far more\nelusive. The aim of the present work is to investigate, in the multinomial\ncase, the statistical properties of an estimator of a parameter that describes\nthe variance of the plug-in estimator of Shannon entropy. We then exactly\ndetermine the probability distributions that maximize that parameter. The\nresults presented here allow to set upper limits to the uncertainty of entropy\nassessments under the hypothesis of memoryless underlying stochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 09:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 09:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}
