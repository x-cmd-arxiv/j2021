A na\\\"ive method is to decompose\nit into two sub-tasks: video frame interpolation (VFI) and video\nsuper-resolution (VSR). Nevertheless, temporal interpolation and spatial\nupscaling are intra-related in this problem. Two-stage approaches cannot fully\nmake use of this natural property. Besides, state-of-the-art VFI or VSR deep\nnetworks usually have a large frame reconstruction module in order to obtain\nhigh-quality photo-realistic video frames, which makes the two-stage approaches\nhave large models and thus be relatively time-consuming. To overcome the\nissues, we present a one-stage space-time video super-resolution framework,\nwhich can directly reconstruct an HR slow-motion video sequence from an input\nLR and LFR video. Instead of reconstructing missing LR intermediate frames as\nVFI models do, we temporally interpolate LR frame features of the missing LR\nframes capturing local temporal contexts by a feature temporal interpolation\nmodule. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that the\nproposed framework not only achieves better qualitative and quantitative\nperformance on both clean and noisy LR frames but also is several times faster\nthan recent state-of-the-art two-stage networks.

These regions\nare often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while\nsuppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention\nMechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and\nMaxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to\nsuppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves\nhigh-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two\nmodules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to\nobtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration\nduring the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the\ninference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied\nit to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently\nimprove the networks performance, and for those originally with attention\nmechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters\nand increases the inference speed.

Recent work [5, 10, 15] has shown that\ndistributed monetary systems do not require consensus and can operate using a\nbroadcast primitive with weaker guarantees, such as reliable broadcast.\nHowever, these protocols assume that some number of agents may be Byzantine and\nthe remaining agents are perfectly correct. For the application of a monetary\nsystem in which the agents are real people with economic interests, the\nassumption that agents are perfectly correct may be too strong. We expand upon\nthis line of thought by weakening the assumption of correctness and instead\nadopting a fault tolerance model which allows up to $t < \\frac{N}{3}$ agents to\nbe Byzantine and the remaining agents to be rational. A rational agent is one\nwhich will deviate from the protocol if it is in their own best interest. Under\nthis fault tolerance model, Hearsay implements a monetary system in which all\nrational agents achieve agreement on executed transactions. Moreover, Hearsay\nrequires only a single broadcast per transaction. In order to incentivize\nrational agents to behave correctly in Hearsay, agents are rewarded with\ntransaction fees for participation in the protocol and punished for noticeable\ndeviations from the protocol. Additionally, Hearsay uses a novel broadcast\nprimitive called Rational Reliable Broadcast to ensure that agents can\nbroadcast messages under Hearsay's fault tolerance model. Rational Reliable\nBroadcast achieves equivalent guarantees to Byzantine Reliable Broadcast [7]\nbut can tolerate the presence of rational agents. To show this, we prove that\nfollowing the Rational Reliable Broadcast protocol constitutes a Nash\nequilibrium between rational agents and may therefore be of independent\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

In\nthis paper, we aim to address such questions with a general class of\ninterventional, input perturbation-based analyses of representations from\npretrained language models. Importing from computational and cognitive\nneuroscience the notion of representational invariance, we perform a series of\nprobes designed to test the sensitivity of these representations to several\nkinds of structure in sentences. Each probe involves swapping words in a\nsentence and comparing the representations from perturbed sentences against the\noriginal.

One way of\nachieving it is to simply move the electron between two quantum registers.\nPrecise control over the electron shuttling through a chain of tunnel-coupled\nquantum dots is possible when interdot energy detunings are changed\nadiabatically. Deterministic character of shuttling is however endangered by\ncoupling of the transferred electron to thermal reservoirs: sources of\nfluctuations of electric fields, and lattice vibrations. We theoretically\nanalyse how the electron transfer between two quantum dots is affected by\nelectron-phonon scattering, and interaction with sources of $1/f$ and Johnson\ncharge noise in both detuning and tunnel coupling. The electron-phonon\nscattering turns out to be irrelevant in Si quantum dots, while a competition\nbetween the effects of charge noise and Landau-Zener effect leads to an\nexistence of optimal detuning sweep rate, at which probability of leaving the\nelectron behind is minimal. In GaAs quantum dots, on the other hand, coupling\nto phonons is strong enough to make the phonon-assisted processes of interdot\ntransfer dominate over influence of charge noise. The probability of leaving\nthe electron behind depends then monotonically on detuning sweep rate, and\nvalues much smaller than in silicon can be obtained for slow sweeps. However,\nafter taking into account limitations on transfer time imposed by need for\npreservation of electron's spin coherence, minimal probabilities of leaving the\nelectron behind in both GaAs- and Si-based double quantum dots turn out to be\nof the same order of magnitude.

In this\nwork, we address this problem with a simple yet surprisingly powerful\nobservation: operations on sets of vertices, such as intersection or union,\nform a large part of many complex graph mining algorithms, and can offer rich\nand simple parallelism at multiple levels. This observation drives our\ncross-layer design, in which we (1) expose set operations using a novel\nprogramming paradigm, (2) express and execute these operations efficiently with\ncarefully designed set-centric ISA extensions called SISA, and (3) use PIM to\naccelerate SISA instructions. The key design idea is to alleviate the bandwidth\nneeds of SISA instructions by mapping set operations to two types of PIM:\nin-DRAM bulk bitwise computing for bitvectors representing high-degree\nvertices, and near-memory logic layers for integer arrays representing\nlow-degree vertices. Set-centric SISA-enhanced algorithms are efficient and\noutperform hand-tuned baselines, offering more than 10x speedup over the\nestablished Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for listing maximal cliques.

Without such knowledge, the\nfull picture of the operation mechanism of the solar dynamo cannot be formed.\nThe magnetic helicity spectrum provides important information about the\n$\\alpha$ effect. Here we demonstrate a formalism in spherical geometry to infer\nmagnetic helicity spectra directly from observations of the magnetic field,\ntaking into account the sign change of magnetic helicity across the Sun's\nequator. Using an angular correlation function of the magnetic field, we\ndevelop a method to infer spectra for magnetic energy and helicity. The\nretrieval of the latter relies on a fundamental definition of helicity in terms\nof linkage of magnetic flux. We apply the two-scale approach, previously used\nin Cartesian geometry, to spherical geometry for systems where a sign reversal\nof helicity is expected across the equator at both small and large scales. We\ntest the method by applying it to an analytical model of a fully helical field,\nand to magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent dynamo. The helicity\nspectra computed from the vector potential available in the models are in\nexcellent agreement to the spectra computed solely from the magnetic field\nusing our method. In a next test, we use our method to obtain the helicity\nspectrum from a synoptic magnetic field map corresponding to a Carrington\nrotation. We observe clear signs of a bihelical spectrum of magnetic helicity.\nOur formalism makes it possible to infer magnetic helicity in spherical\ngeometry, without the necessity of computing the magnetic vector potential.\nThis has the advantage of being gauge invariant. It has many applications in\nsolar and stellar observations, but can also be used to analyze global\nmagnetoconvection models of stars and compare them with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

A promising approach to tackle this challenge, which has been proposed\nrecently, is to characterize the quantum dynamics of a many-body system and its\nproperties as a bath via the Feynman-Vernon influence matrix (IM), which is an\noperator in the space of time trajectories of local degrees of freedom.\nPhysical understanding of the general scaling of the IM's temporal entanglement\nand its relation to basic dynamical properties is highly incomplete to present\nday. In this Article, we analytically compute the exact IM for a family of\nintegrable Floquet models - the transverse-field kicked Ising chain - finding a\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like \"wavefunction\" on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour\nwith algebraically decaying correlations. We demonstrate that the IM exhibits\narea-law temporal entanglement scaling for all parameter values.

Near\ncriticality, a non-trivial scaling behavior of temporal entanglement is found.\nThe area-law temporal entanglement allows us to efficiently describe the\neffects of sizeable integrability-breaking perturbations for long evolution\ntimes by using matrix product state methods.

Unlike axial-flow turbines, the influence of geometric\nparameters on turbine performance is not well-understood, in part because there\nare neither generalized analytical formulations nor inexpensive, accurate\nnumerical models that describe their fluid dynamics. Here, we experimentally\ninvestigate the effect of aspect ratio - the ratio of the blade span to rotor\ndiameter - on the performance of a straight-bladed cross-flow turbine in a\nwater channel. To isolate the effect of aspect ratio, all other non-dimensional\nparameters are held constant, including the relative confinement, Froude\nnumber, and Reynolds number. The coefficient of performance is found to be\ninvariant for the range of aspect ratios tested (0.95 - 1.63), which we ascribe\nto minimal blade-support interactions for this turbine design. Finally, a\nsubset of experiments is repeated without controlling for the Froude number and\nthe coefficient of performance is found to increase, a consequence of Froude\nnumber variation that could mistakenly be ascribed to aspect ratio. This\nhighlights the importance of rigorous experimental design when exploring the\neffect of geometric parameters on cross-flow turbine performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 17:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Recent work uses\nneural networks to parameterize local surface elements.

However, naively using\nsuch methods to model 3D clothed humans fails to capture fine-grained local\ndeformations and generalizes poorly.

The\noutcomes show that for all the examples the accuracy of the results are\ncomparable with those obtained in conjunction with conventional nonlinear\nprojection matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 13:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

In\naddition, if the fraction of primordial BHs $f_{\\rm pBH}$ is large enough,\ngravitational waves emitted by their mergers in the nuclear galactic regions\ncould be detected by future interferometers like Einsten Telescope, DECIGO and\nLISA. As for the associated stochastic gravitational wave background, we\npredict that it extends over the wide frequency band $10^{-6}\\lesssim f [{\\rm\nHz}]\\lesssim 10$, which is very different from the typical range originated by\nmergers of isolated binary compact objects. On the one hand, the detection of\nsuch a background could be a smoking gun to test the proposed seed growth\nmechanism; on the other hand, it constitutes a relevant contaminant from\nastrophysical sources to be characterized and subtracted, in the challenging\nsearch for a primordial background of cosmological origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 08:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The\ndifficulty of this scenario lies in the delivery of BBH to such a small\ndistance to a SMBH. Here we revisit the theoretical models for the migration of\ncompact objects (COs) in the accretion discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nWe find that when the accretion rate is high so that the disc is best described\nby the slim disc model, the COs in the disc could migrate to a radius close to\nthe innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and be trapped there for the\nremaining lifetime of the AGN. The exact trapping radius coincides with the\ntransition region between the sub- and super-Keplerian rotation of the slim\ndisc.

This\ndata movement bottleneck can be alleviated using Processing-in-Memory (PiM).\nOne category of PiM is Processing-using-Memory (PuM), in which computation\ntakes place inside the memory array by exploiting intrinsic analog properties\nof the memory device. PuM yields high performance and energy efficiency, but\nexisting PuM techniques support a limited range of operations. As a result,\ncurrent PuM architectures cannot efficiently perform some complex operations\n(e.g., multiplication, division, exponentiation) without large increases in\nchip area and design complexity.\n  To overcome these limitations of existing PuM architectures, we introduce\npLUTo (processing-using-memory with lookup table (LUT) operations), a\nDRAM-based PuM architecture that leverages the high storage density of DRAM to\nenable the massively parallel storing and querying of lookup tables (LUTs). The\nkey idea of pLUTo is to replace complex operations with low-cost, bulk memory\nreads (i.e., LUT queries) instead of relying on complex extra logic.\n  We evaluate pLUTo across 11 real-world workloads that showcase the\nlimitations of prior PuM approaches and show that our solution outperforms\noptimized CPU and GPU baselines by an average of 713$\\times$ and 1.2$\\times$,\nrespectively, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by an average of\n1855$\\times$ and 39.5$\\times$. Across these workloads, pLUTo outperforms\nstate-of-the-art PiM architectures by an average of 18.3$\\times$. We also show\nthat different versions of pLUTo provide different levels of flexibility and\nperformance at different additional DRAM area overheads (between 10.2% and\n23.1%). pLUTo's source code is openly and fully available at\nhttps://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/pLUTo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 15:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 17:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:08:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 13:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

This theory proposes that turbulent\nmixing at a fractal bubble-shell interface leads to highly efficient cooling,\nin which the vast majority of the input wind energy is radiated away. This\nenergy loss renders the majority of the bubble evolution momentum-driven rather\nthan energy-driven, with expansion velocities and pressures orders of magnitude\nlower than in the classical Weaver77 solution. In this paper, we validate our\ntheory with three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations.

We quantify the few\nfree parameters in our theory, and show that the momentum exceeds the wind\ninput rate by only a factor ~ 1.2-4. We verify that the bubble/cloud interface\nis a fractal with dimension ~ 2.5-2.7. The measured turbulent amplitude (v_t ~\n200-400 km/s) in the hot gas near the interface is shown to be consistent with\ntheoretical requirements for turbulent diffusion to efficiently mix and radiate\naway most of the wind energy. The fraction of energy remaining after cooling is\nonly 1-\\Theta ~ 0.1-0.01, decreasing with time, explaining observations that\nindicate low hot-gas content and weak dynamical effects of stellar winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The resulting\nkernels effectively couple structural degrees of freedom to fluid variables on\nonly one side of the fluid-structure interface. This reduces spurious feedback\nforcing and internal flows that are typically observed in IB models that use\nisotropic kernel functions to couple the structure to fluid degrees of freedom\non both sides of the interface. The method developed here extends the original\nMLS methodology introduced by Vanella and Balaras (J Comput Phys, 2009). Prior\nIB/MLS methods have used isotropic kernel functions that coupled fluid\nvariables on both sides of the boundary to the interfacial degrees of freedom.\nThe original IB/MLS approach converts the cubic spline weights typically\nemployed in MLS reconstruction into an IB kernel function that satisfies\nparticular discrete moment conditions. This paper shows that the same approach\ncan be used to construct one-sided kernel functions (kernel functions are\nreferred to as generating functions in the MLS literature). We also examine the\nperformance of the new approach for a family of kernel functions introduced by\nPeskin. It is demonstrated that the one-sided MLS construction tends to\ngenerate non-monotone interpolation kernels with large over- and undershoots.\nWe present two simple weight shifting strategies to construct generating\nfunctions that are positive and monotone, which enhances the stability of the\nresulting IB methodology. Benchmark cases are used to test the order of\naccuracy and verify the one-sided IB/MLS simulations in both two and three\nspatial dimensions. This new IB/MLS method is also used to simulate flow over\nthe Ahmed car model, which highlights the applicability of this methodology for\nmodeling complex engineering flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

The $B/T$ mass ratio has only a mild evolution with\nredshift, but the bulge-to-disc ($B/D$) mass ratio shows a clear increase of\nthe disc component since redshift $z < 1$ for massive galaxies. The mass-size\nrelation for both bulges and discs describes an upturn at high galaxy stellar\nmasses (log{(M_{\\star}/M_{\\sun})} > 10.5). The relation holds for bulges but\nnot for discs when using their individual stellar masses.

The use of MC-PDFT with NEGF\nallows for the efficient inclusion of both static and dynamic electron\ncorrelation in the description of the junction's electronic structure.

This regime arises in various engineering\nsystems, such as mechanical components under tight rigid constraints,\nseismic-induced sloshing in partially-filled liquid storage tanks, and more.\nThe adaptive nonlinearity of the HVI oscillator is used by the HVI-nonlinear\nenergy sink as an effective vibration mitigation solution for broad energy and\nfrequency range. Due to the extreme nonlinearity of this regime, traditional\nanalytical methods are inapplicable for the description of its transient\ndynamics. In the current work, we model the HVI oscillator by a forced particle\nin a truncated quadratic potential well with infinite depth. The slow flow\ndynamics of the system in the vicinity of primary resonance is described by\ncanonical transformation to action-angle (AA) variables and the corresponding\nreduced resonance manifold (RM). Two types of bifurcation are examined. The\nformer is associated with the transition between linear oscillations and the\nHVI-regime and vice versa, and the latter with reaching a chosen maximal\ntransient energy level. The transition boundaries and frequency response curves\nare obtained analytically. Two underlying dynamical mechanisms that govern the\noccurrence of bifurcations are identified: the \"maximum\" and the \"saddle\"\nmechanisms. The latter, a potentially more dangerous scenario, involves abrupt\ntransitions of the system's energy response from a relatively small value to\nthe threshold energy level. Both mechanisms are universal for systems that\nundergo escape from a potential well. All theoretical results are in complete\nagreement with full-scale numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 20:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

Using the GW190521 posterior samples from\nthe analysis in Nitz & Capano (2021), we find an increase in Bayes factors in\nfavor of the gap. However, the overall conclusions are unchanged: There is no\npreference for a gap when using the Powerlaw+Peak model.

We then introduce a method to compute the energy released by\ndisorder induced heating using the pair correlation function. This disorder\ninduced heating energy was found to scale very near the theoretical result for\nstationary ultracold plasmas, and it accounts for over half of the emittance\ngrowth above mean-field simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 22:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

This paper explores the use of an ensemble approximation of the\nsensitivities of the RANS equations in training data-driven turbulence models\nwith indirect observations. A deep neural network representing the turbulence\nmodel is trained using the network's gradients obtained by backpropagation and\nthe ensemble approximation of the RANS sensitivities.

In all cases, the learned model predicts improved\nvelocities. However, it was observed that once the sensitivity of the velocity\nto the underlying model becomes small, the approximate nature of the ensemble\ngradient hinders further optimization of the underlying model.

We report here on a practical\nand computationally rapid implementation of this procedure for families of\nCalabi-Yau manifolds with one complex structure parameter phi. Although partly\nconjectural, it turns out to be possible to compute the matrix of the Frobenius\nmap on the third cohomology group of X(phi) directly from the Picard-Fuchs\ndifferential operator of the family. To illustrate our method, we compute\ntables of the quartic numerators of the zeta-functions for six manifolds of\nincreasing complexity as the parameter phi varies in Fp. For four of these\nmanifolds, we do this for the 500 primes p=5,7,...,3583, while for two\nmanifolds we extend the calculation to 1000 primes. The tables for 5 <= p <= 97\nare part of this article while the remaining tables are attached in electronic\nform. Interest attaches to the cases for which the numerators factorise. Some\nof these factorisations can be associated with parameter values for which the\nunderlying manifold becomes singular. For the cases we consider here, the\nsingularities are all of conifold or hyperconifold type. In these cases the\nnumerator degenerates to a cubic and this factorises into the product of a\nlinear and a quadratic factor. The quadratic term contains a coefficient that\nis the p'th coefficient of a modular form. Some of our examples have\nsingularities when the parameter satisfies a polynomial equation that does not\nfactorise over Q. When this happens, the corresponding forms are modular forms\nwith neben type or Hilbert modular forms. The numerator can also factorise into\ntwo quadrics. This happens when the Hodge structure of the manifold splits,\nsometimes this happens for algebraic values of the parameter and we identify,\nin this way, attractor points of rank two of the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 23:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

When current\nchatbots (explicitly provided with new factual content) introduce facts into a\nconversation, their generated responses do not acknowledge the prior turns.\nThis is because models trained with two contexts - new factual content and\nconversational history - generate responses that are non-specific w.r.t. one of\nthe contexts, typically the conversational history. We show that specificity\nw.r.t. conversational history is better captured by Pointwise Conditional\nMutual Information ($\\text{pcmi}_h$) than by the established use of Pointwise\nMutual Information ($\\text{pmi}$).

While APR tools can\nproduce patches that appear to fix the defect for 11-19% of the defects in\nreal-world software, most of the patches produced are not correct or acceptable\nto developers because they overfit to the tests used during the repair process.\nThis problem is known as the patch overfitting problem.

The approach combines lumped\nreaction steps for fuel thermal and oxidative pyrolysis with detailed chemistry\nfor the oxidation of the resulting pyrolysis products. However, the approach\nusually shows substantial discrepancies with experimental data within the\nNegative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) regime, as the low-temperature chemistry\nis more fuel-specific than high-temperature chemistry. This paper proposes a\nmachine learning approach to learn the HyChem models that can cover both\nhigh-temperature and low-temperature regimes. Specifically, we develop a HyChem\nmodel using the experimental datasets of ignition delay times covering a wide\nrange of temperatures and equivalence ratios. The chemical kinetic model is\ntreated as a neural network model, and we then employ stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD), a technique that was developed for deep learning, for the\ntraining. We demonstrate the approach in learning the HyChem model for F-24,\nwhich is a Jet-A derived fuel, and compare the results with previous work\nemploying genetic algorithms. The results show that the SGD approach can\nachieve comparable model performance with genetic algorithms but the\ncomputational cost is reduced by 1000 times. In addition, with regularization\nin SGD, the SGD approach changes the kinetic parameters from their original\nvalues much less than genetic algorithm and is thus more likely to retrain\nmechanistic meanings.

A reinforced\nrelation-aware neighbor selection mechanism is developed to choose the most\nsimilar neighbors of a targeting node within a relation before aggregating all\nneighborhood information from different relations to obtain the eventual node\nembedding.

However, most methods ignore the heterogeneity in real-world\ngraphs. Methods designed for heterogeneous graphs, on the other hand, fail to\nlearn complex semantic representations because they only use meta-paths instead\nof meta-graphs. Furthermore, they cannot fully capture the content-based\ncorrelations between nodes, as they either do not use the self-attention\nmechanism or only use it to consider the immediate neighbors of each node,\nignoring the higher-order neighbors. We propose a novel Higher-order\nAttribute-Enhancing (HAE) framework that enhances node embedding in a\nlayer-by-layer manner.

The unique higher-order\narchitecture of HAEGNN allows examining the first-order as well as higher-order\nneighborhoods. Moreover, HAEGNN shows good explainability as it learns the\nimportances of different meta-paths and meta-graphs.

Although progress has been made in\ninterpreting experimental data on the basis of one-phonon scattering,\nunderstanding the role of individual phonons can be sometimes hindered by\nmulti-phonon excitations. In Ref. [{\\it arXiv:2103.10108}] we have introduced a\nrigorous approach for the calculation of the all-phonon inelastic scattering\nintensity of solids from first-principles. In the present work, we describe our\nimplementation in detail and show that multi-phonon interactions are captured\nefficiently by exploiting translational and time-reversal symmetries of the\ncrystal. We demonstrate its predictive power by calculating the scattering\npatterns of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$), bulk MoS$_2$, and black\nphosphorus (bP), and we obtain excellent agreement with our measurements of\nthermal electron diffuse scattering. Remarkably, our results show that\nmulti-phonon excitations dominate in bP across multiple Brillouin zones, while\nin MoS$_2$ they play a less pronounced role.

This is due to the fact that the\nrepresentative tunneling energy lies in the vibrational ground state of the\nleast stable isomer up to approximately 150 K, making the reaction constants of\nthe isomerization from the least stable to the most stable isomer basically\nconstant.

Although various approaches have been proposed to solve this problem,\ntwo major limitations exist: (1) unsupervised approaches usually work much less\nefficiently due to the lack of supervisory signal, and (2) existing anomaly\ndetection methods only use local contextual information to detect anomalous\nnodes, e.g., one- or two-hop information, but ignore the global contextual\ninformation. Since anomalous nodes differ from normal nodes in structures and\nattributes, it is intuitive that the distance between anomalous nodes and their\nneighbors should be larger than that between normal nodes and their neighbors\nif we remove the edges connecting anomalous and normal nodes. Thus, hop counts\nbased on both global and local contextual information can be served as the\nindicators of anomaly. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a hop-count\nbased model (HCM) to detect anomalies by modeling both local and global\ncontextual information. To make better use of hop counts for anomaly\nidentification, we propose to use hop counts prediction as a self-supervised\ntask.

By further cooling to below\n$T_{\\rm N3}$ = 12.2 K, the magnetic ordering vector changes into $q_1 =\n({\\delta}_1 0 0)$ with ${\\delta}_1$ = 0.17 at 11.5 K and slightly shifts to\n${\\delta}_1$ = 0.194 at 4.3 K. No distinct change in the magnetic Bragg peak\nwas detected at $T_{\\rm N2}$=13.2 K and $T_{\\rm N4}$=10.0 K. The structural\nmodulation below $T_{\\rm CDW}$ with $q_{\\rm CDW}$ is characterized by the\nabsence of the superlattice peak in the (0 0 $l$) axis. As a similar CDW\ntransition was observed in SrAl$_4$, the structural modulation with $q_{\\rm\nCDW}$ could be mainly ascribed to the displacement of Al ions within the\ntetragonal $ab$-plane. Complex magnetic transitions are in stark contrast to a\nsimple collinear magnetic structure in isovalent EuGa$_4$. This could stem from\ndifferent electronic structures with the CDW transition between two compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

By applying the\nproposed principle, a neural network with human-understandable explanations is\ntrained which, in a user study, is shown to better align with human intuition.\nThis is likely to make the AI more trustworthy and opens the door to humans\nlearning from machines. In the case study, we specifically investigate and\nanalyze the behaviour of the human-imperceptible high spatial frequency\nfeatures in neural networks and XAI methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

Under\nthe influence of the inhomogeneous forces the particle carries out a\ntime-dependent smooth, but complicated motion described by a set of affine\ntransformations. The rotation of the particle enables one to record optical\nimages from a wide range of angles, which largely eliminates the \"missing cone\nproblem\" in optics. This advantage, however, comes at the price that the\nrotation axis in this scenario is not fixed, but continuously undergoes some\nvariations, and that the rotation angles are not equally spaced, which is in\ncontrast to standard tomographic reconstruction assumptions. In the present\nwork, we assume that the time-dependent motion parameters are known, and that\nthe particle's scattering potential is compatible with making the first order\nBorn or Rytov approximation.

Such circuits are studied in\nthe field of Knowledge Compilation and generalize a wide range of Boolean\ncircuits and binary decision diagrams classes, including binary decision trees\nand Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs).\n  We also establish the computational limits of the SHAP-score by observing\nthat computing it over a class of Boolean models is always polynomially as hard\nas the model counting problem for that class.

Due to the characteristics of data remaining localized and the\nuninspected on-device training process, there may exist Byzantine workers\nlaunching data poisoning and model poisoning attacks, which would seriously\ndeteriorate model performance or prevent the model from convergence. Most of\nthe existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes are either ineffective against several\nadvanced poisoning attacks or need to centralize a public validation dataset,\nwhich is intractable in FL. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of the\nexisting Byzantine-robust distributed learning methods could well exert its\npower in Non-Independent and Identically distributed (Non-IID) data among\nclients.

Lameness, a prevalent health\ndisorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A\ncow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models\nlearn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most\nanimal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame\nby frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static\ndeep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model\nthat includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the\nstatic and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples\nof 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy\ncows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to\nocclusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by\nadding artificial occlusions to the videos.The experiments showed that, on\nnon-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of\nCorrect Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach\noutperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data\nwas beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as\ndairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was\nevaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in\nthe training set). The results showed that the average PCKh@0.2 was of 93.8% on\nknown cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model was capable of\ngeneralizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new\nherds.

For decades, the lexical matching signal has dominated the ad-hoc\nretrieval process, but solely using this signal in retrieval may cause the\nvocabulary mismatch problem. In recent years, with the development of\nrepresentation learning techniques, many researchers turn to Dense Retrieval\n(DR) models for better ranking performance. Although several existing DR models\nhave already obtained promising results, their performance improvement heavily\nrelies on the sampling of training examples. Many effective sampling strategies\nare not efficient enough for practical usage, and for most of them, there still\nlacks theoretical analysis in how and why performance improvement happens. To\nshed light on these research questions, we theoretically investigate different\ntraining strategies for DR models and try to explain why hard negative sampling\nperforms better than random sampling. Through the analysis, we also find that\nthere are many potential risks in static hard negative sampling, which is\nemployed by many existing training methods. Therefore, we propose two training\nstrategies named a Stable Training Algorithm for dense Retrieval (STAR) and a\nquery-side training Algorithm for Directly Optimizing Ranking pErformance\n(ADORE), respectively. STAR improves the stability of DR training process by\nintroducing random negatives. ADORE replaces the widely-adopted static hard\nnegative sampling method with a dynamic one to directly optimize the ranking\nperformance. Experimental results on two publicly available retrieval benchmark\ndatasets show that either strategy gains significant improvements over existing\ncompetitive baselines and a combination of them leads to the best performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 11:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

We find that this bi-modality is still detectable in the\neastern regions of the galaxy out to a 10 deg distance from its centre.\nAdditionally, a background structure is detected in the North between 7 and 10\ndeg from the centre which might belong to the Counter Bridge, and a foreground\nstructure is detected in the South between 6 and 8 deg from the centre which\nmight be linked to the Old Bridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 12:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Simply put, cores are\ncharacteristic of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, but thermalizing\ncollisions are purposely suppressed in CDM simulations. When collisions are\nallowed, N-body numerical simulations develop cored density profiles, in\nperfect agreement with the theoretical expectation. We compare theory and two\ntypes of numerical simulations: (1) when DM particles are self-interacting\n(SIDM) with enough cross-section, then the effective two-body relaxation\ntimescale becomes shorter than the Hubble time resulting in cored DM haloes.\nThe haloes thus obtained, with masses from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters,\ncollapse to a single shape after normalization, and this shape agrees with the\npolytropic density profile theoretically expected. (2) The inner radii in\ncanonical N-body numerical simulations are always discarded because the use of\nfinite-mass DM particles artificially increases the two-body collision rate. We\nshow that the discarded radii develop cores that are larger than the employed\nnumerical softening and have polytropic shapes independently of halo mass. Our\nwork suggests that the presence of cores in simulated (or observed) density\nprofiles can used as evidence for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 12:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In\norder to study the formation of high-velocity winds, especially ultrafast\noutflows (UFOs), we perform two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations. Initially, a magnetic field is set to be weaker than the gas\npressure at the disk surface. In our simulations, line force operates on the\nregion like filaments because the X-ray radiation from corona is shielded by\ndense gas in the inner region at some angle. The location of filaments changes\nwith time and then the line-driven winds are exposed to X-ray and become highly\nionized. The line force at the UV bands does not directly drive the highly\nionized winds. In the sense of time average, the properties of high-velocity\nwinds meet the formation condition of UFOs. Compared with line force, the\nfunction of magnetic field is negligible in directly driving winds. In the MHD\nmodel, the region around the rotational axis becomes magnetic-pressure\ndominated, which prevents gases from spreading to higher latitudes and then\nenhances the gas column density at middle and low latitudes (20$^{\\rm\no}$--70$^{\\rm o}$). Higher column density is helpful to shield X-ray photons,\nwhich causes the line force to be more effective in the MHD model than in the\nhydrodynamic model.

Previous works have focused on modeling linguistic features first and\ndrawn conclusions on the language structures unique to each class of citation\nfunction based on the performance of a classification task or inter-annotator\nagreement. In this study, we start with a large sample of a pre-classified\ncitation corpus, 2 million citations from each class of the scite Smart\nCitation dataset (supporting, disputing, and mentioning citations), and analyze\nits corpus linguistics in order to reveal the unique and statistically\nsignificant language structures belonging to each type of citation. By\ngenerating comparison tables for each citation type we present a number of\ninteresting linguistic features that uniquely characterize citation type. What\nwe find is that within citation collocates, there is very low correlation\nbetween citation type and sentiment. Additionally, we find that the\nsubjectivity of citation collocates across classes is very low. These findings\nsuggest that the sentiment of collocates is not a predictor of citation\nfunction and that due to their low subjectivity, an opinion-expressing mode of\nunderstanding citations, implicit in previous citation sentiment analysis\nliterature, is inappropriate. Instead, we suggest that citations can be better\nunderstood as claims-making devices where the citation type can be explained by\nunderstanding how two claims are being compared.

Ap stars (magnetic A-type stars) are a prime\nexample of this. Access to precise and accurate determinations of their stellar\nfundamental properties, such as masses and ages, is crucial to understand the\norigin and evolution of fossil magnetic fields. We propose using the radii and\nluminosities determined from interferometric measurements, in addition to\nseismic constraints when available, to infer fundamental properties of 14 Ap\nstars pr\\'eviously characterised. We used a grid-based modelling approach,\nemploying stellar models computed with the \\textsc{cestam} stellar evolution\ncode, and the parameter search performed with the \\textsc{aims} optimisation\nmethod. The stellar model grid was built using a wide range of initial helium\nabundances and metallicities in order to avoid any bias originating from the\ninitial chemical composition. The large frequency separations ($\\Delta\\nu$) of\nHR\\,1217 (HD\\,24712) and $\\alpha$~Cir (HD\\,128898), two rapidly oscillating Ap\nstars of the sample, were used as seismic constraints. We inferred the\nfundamental properties of the 14 stars in the sample. The overall results are\nconsistent within $1\\sigma$ with previous studies, however, the stellar masses\ninferred in this study are higher. This trend likely originates from the\nbroader range of chemical compositions considered in this work. We show that\nthe use of $\\Delta\\nu$ in the modelling significantly improves our inferences,\nallowing us to set reasonable constraints on the initial metallicity which is,\notherwise, unconstrained. This gives an indication of the efficiency of atomic\ndiffusion in the atmospheres of roAp stars and opens the possibility of\ncharacterising the transport of chemical elements in their interiors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 13:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

In the recent years,\ndistributionally robust optimization has gained significant interest due to its\nability to make informed decisions under uncertainty, which are robust to\nmisrepresentations of the distributional information (e.g., from probabilistic\nforecasts). This is achieved by introducing an ambiguity set that describes the\npotential deviations from an empirical distribution of all uncertain\nparameters. However, this set typically overlooks the inherent dependencies of\nuncertainty, e.g., spatial dependencies of weather-dependent energy sources.\nThis paper goes beyond the state-of-the-art models by embedding such\ndependencies within the definition of ambiguity set. In particular, we propose\na new copula-based ambiguity set which is tailored to capture any type of\ndependencies. The resulting problem is reformulated as a conic program which is\nkept generic such that it can be applied to any decision-making problem under\nuncertainty in power systems. Given the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem as one\nof the main potential applications, we illustrate the performance of our\nproposed distributionally robust model applied to i) a DC-OPF problem for a\nmeshed transmission system and ii) an AC-OPF problem using LinDistFlow\napproximation for a radial distribution system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 13:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 20:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 09:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 10:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

We ended up with a sample of old (t$\\ge$ 10 Gyr), low-mass\nstellar tracers (208 RRLs: 169 fundamental, 38 first overtone, 1 mixed mode)\ncovering three dex in iron abundance (-3.00$\\le$[Fe/H]$\\le$0.24). We found that\nfield RRLs are $\\sim$0.3 dex more $\\alpha$-poor than typical Halo tracers in\nthe metal-rich regime, ([Fe/H]$\\ge$-1.2) while in the metal-poor regime\n([Fe/H]$\\le$-2.2) they seem to be on average $\\sim$0.1 dex more\n$\\alpha$-enhanced. This is the first time that the depletion in\n$\\alpha$-elements for solar iron abundances is detected on the basis of a\nlarge, homogeneous and coeval sample of old stellar tracers. Interestingly, we\nalso detected a close similarity in the [$\\alpha$/Fe] trend between\n$\\alpha$-poor, metal-rich RRLs and red giants (RGs) in the Sagittarius dwarf\ngalaxy as well as between $\\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor RRLs and RGs in ultra\nfaint dwarf galaxies. These results are supported by similar elemental\nabundances for 46 field Horizontal Branch (HB) stars. These stars share with\nRRLs the same evolutionary phase and the same progenitors. This evidence\nfurther supports the key role that old stellar tracers play in constraining the\nearly chemical enrichment of the Halo and, in particular, in investigating the\nimpact that dwarf galaxies have had in the mass assembly of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 13:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

To realistically quantify microstructures we\nuse two-point statistics, from which we derive scale-dependent effective wave\nproperties - wavespeed and attenuation - using strong-contrast expansions (SCE)\nfor (visco)elastic wavefields. By evaluating various two-point correlation\nfunctions we observe that both effective wavespeeds and attenuation of\nlong-scale waves predominantly depend on volume fraction and phase properties,\nand that especially attenuation at small scales is highly sensitive to the\ngeometry of microstructure heterogeneity (e.g. geometric hyperuniformity) due\nto incoherent inference of sub-wavelength multiple scattering. Our goal is to\ninfer microstructure properties from observed effective wave parameters. To\nthis end, we use the supervised machine learning method of Random Forests (RF)\nto construct a Bayesian inference approach. We can accurately resolve two-point\ncorrelation functions sampled from various microstructural configurations,\nincluding: a bead pack, Berea sandstone and Ketton limestone samples.\nImportantly, we show that inversion of small scale-induced effective elastic\nwaves yields the best results, particularly compared to single-wave-mode (e.g.,\nacoustic only) information. Additionally, we show that the retrieval of\nmicroscale medium contrasts is more difficult - as it is highly ill-posed - and\ncan only be achieved with specific a priori knowledge.

Studying\npedestrian behaviour in futuristic scenarios requires modern data sources that\nconsider both the Automated Vehicle (AV) and pedestrian perspectives. Current\nopen datasets on AVs predominantly fail to account for the latter, as they do\nnot include an adequate number of events and associated details that involve\npedestrian and vehicle interactions. To address this issue, we propose using\nVirtual Reality (VR) data as a complementary resource to current datasets,\nwhich can be designed to measure pedestrian behaviour under specific\nconditions. In this research, we focus on the context-aware pedestrian\ntrajectory prediction framework for automated vehicles at mid-block\nunsignalized crossings.

Clinical data\nwarehouses, gathering routine examinations from hospitals, offer great promises\nfor training and validation of ML models in a realistic setting. However, the\nuse of such clinical data warehouses requires quality control (QC) tools.\nVisual QC by experts is time-consuming and does not scale to large datasets. In\nthis paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic\nQC of 3D T1-weighted brain MRI for a large heterogeneous clinical data\nwarehouse. To that purpose, we used the data warehouse of the hospitals of the\nGreater Paris area (Assistance Publique-H\\^opitaux de Paris [AP-HP]).\nSpecifically, the objectives were: 1) to identify images which are not proper\nT1-weighted brain MRIs; 2) to identify acquisitions for which gadolinium was\ninjected; 3) to rate the overall image quality. We used 5000 images for\ntraining and validation and a separate set of 500 images for testing. In order\nto train/validate the CNN, the data were annotated by two trained raters\naccording to a visual QC protocol that we specifically designed for application\nin the setting of a data warehouse. For objectives 1 and 2, our approach\nachieved excellent accuracy (balanced accuracy and F1-score \\textgreater 90\\%),\nsimilar to the human raters. For objective 3, the performance was good but\nsubstantially lower than that of human raters. Nevertheless, the automatic\napproach accurately identified (balanced accuracy and F1-score \\textgreater\n80\\%) low quality images, which would typically need to be excluded. Overall,\nour approach shall be useful for exploiting hospital data warehouses in medical\nimage computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 14:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

Traditional approaches often rely on\nheavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of\nhuman poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods\nare proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose\ninitialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail\nto provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressing\njoint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very\nchallenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields\n(PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query\npoint in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine\nPTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based\nframework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point\ncorrespondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed\nhuman. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can\nbe effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently,\nrigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently\nvia a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences,\ncircumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from\nneural networks.

This limited stability has been shown to result\nfrom the interaction of charge carriers originating from the 2D semiconductors\nwith defects in the surrounding insulating materials. The resulting dynamically\ntrapped charges are particularly relevant in field effect transistors (FETs)\nand can lead to a large hysteresis, which endangers stable circuit operation.\nBased on the notion that charge trapping is highly sensitive to the energetic\nalignment of the channel Fermi-level with the defect band in the insulator, we\npropose to optimize device stability by deliberately tuning the channel\nFermi-level. Our approach aims to minimize the amount of electrically active\nborder traps without modifying the total number of traps in the insulator. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of this idea by using two differently doped\ngraphene layers in otherwise identical FETs with Al$_2$O$_3$ as a gate oxide\nmounted on a flexible substrate. Our results clearly show that by increasing\nthe distance of the Fermi-level to the defect band, the hysteresis is\nsignificantly reduced. Furthermore, since long-term reliability is also very\nsensitive to trapped charges, a corresponding improvement in reliability is\nboth expected theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. Our study paves\nthe way for the construction of more stable and reliable 2D FETs in which the\nchannel material is carefully chosen and tuned to maximize the energetic\ndistance between charge carriers in the channel and the defect bands in the\ninsulator employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 15:31:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 08:35:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 19:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The presence of charge or currents in electromagnetism or the\npresence of matter in cosmology are preventing scale invariance. The question\narises on how much matter within the horizon is necessary to kill scale\ninvariance. The scale invariant field equation, first written by Dirac in 1973\nand then revisited by Canuto et al. in 1977, provides the starting point to\naddress this question. The resulting cosmological models show that, as soon as\nmatter is present, the effects of scale invariance rapidly decline from \\rho=0\nto \\rho_c and are forbidden for densities above \\rho_c. The absence of scale\ninvariance in this case is consistent with considerations about causal\nconnection. Below \\rho_c, scale invariance appears as an open possibility,\nwhich also depends on the occurrence of inflation in the scale invariant\ncontext. In the present approach, we identify the scalar field of the empty\nspace in the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) context to the scalar field \\phi in\nthe energy density expression of the vacuum at inflation. This leads to some\nconstraints on the potential. This identification also solves the so-called\n``cosmological constant problem''. In the framework of scale invariance,an\ninflation with a large number of e-foldings is also predicted. We conclude that\nscale invariance for models with densities below \\rho_c is an open possibility;\nthe final answer may come from high redshift observations, where differences\nfrom the LCDM models appear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

Recently, the Deep Energy Method (DEM) has\nbeen proposed. DEM is based on energy minimization principles, contrary to PINN\nwhich is based on the residual of the PDEs. A significant advantage of DEM, is\nthat it requires the approximation of lower order derivatives compared to\nformulations that are based on strong form residuals. However both DEM and\nclassical PINN formulations struggle to resolve fine features of the stress and\ndisplacement fields, for example concentration features in solid mechanics\napplications. We propose an extension to the Deep Energy Method (DEM) to\nresolve these features for finite strain hyperelasticity. The developed\nframework termed mixed Deep Energy Method (mDEM) introduces stress measures as\nan additional output of the NN to the recently introduced pure displacement\nformulation. Using this approach, Neumann boundary conditions are approximated\nmore accurately and the accuracy around spatial features which are typically\nresponsible for high concentrations is increased. In order to make the proposed\napproach more versatile, we introduce a numerical integration scheme based on\nDelaunay integration, which enables the mDEM framework to be used for random\ntraining point position sets commonly needed for computational domains with\nstress concentrations. We highlight the advantages of the proposed approach\nwhile showing the shortcomings of classical PINN and DEM formulations. The\nmethod is offering comparable results to Finite-Element Method (FEM) on the\nforward calculation of challenging computational experiments involving domains\nwith fine geometric features and concentrated loads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 22:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

We will focus on the latter.\nAmong the different existing algorithms, in the last decade kernel based\nmethods, and Gaussian Processes (GPs) in particular, have provided useful and\ninformative solutions to such RTM inversion problems. This is in large part due\nto the confidence intervals they provide, and their predictive accuracy.\nHowever, RTMs are very complex, highly nonlinear, and typically hierarchical\nmodels, so that often a shallow GP model cannot capture complex feature\nrelations for inversion.

As variances are nonnegative, a transformation is chosen and applied to\nthese latent variables. The inference relies on the online variational Bayesian\nmethodology, which consists in minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence at each\ntime step. We observe that the minimum of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is an\nextension of the Kalman filter taking into account the variance uncertainty. We\ndesign a novel algorithm, named Viking, using these optimal recursive updates.\nFor auxiliary latent variables, we use second-order bounds whose optimum admit\nclosed-form solutions. Experiments on synthetic data show that Viking behaves\nwell and is robust to misspecification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 10:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

While the subjectivity view is\ncommonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty\nor aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long\ndiscovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of\nsubsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion\nof beauty - structural beauty - among people and even different peoples,\nregardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of\nstructural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a\nphysical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based\non the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for\ncomputing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of\nautomatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To\nverify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight\npairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock's\nBlue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally\nbeautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more\nstructurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies\nthat goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an\nopinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on\nstructural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or\naesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision,\narchitecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and\npsychology.\n  Keywords: Life; wholeness; figural goodness; head/tail breaks; computer\nvision\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

To identify how these processes are impacting nearshore oceanographic\nhabitats and, especially, long term trends of primary productivity in the\nHumboldt Upwelling Ecosystem (HUE), we analysed time series of sea level\npressure, wind stress, sea surface and atmospheric surface temperatures, and\nChlorophyll-a, as a proxy for primary productivity, along 26{\\deg} - 36{\\deg}\nS. We show that climate induced trends in primary productivity are highly\nheterogeneous across the region. On the one hand, the well documented poleward\nmigration of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) has led to decreased spring\nupwelling winds in the region between ca. 30{\\deg} and 34{\\deg} S, and to their\nintensification to the south. Decreased winds have produced slight increases in\nsea surface temperature and a pronounced and meridionally extensive decrease in\nsurface Chlorophyll-a in this region of central Chile. To the north of 30{\\deg}\nS, significant increases in upwelling winds, decreased SST, and enhanced\nChlorophyll-a concentration are observed in the nearshore. We show that this\nincreased in upwelling driven coastal productivity is probably produced by the\nincreased land-sea pressure gradients (Bakun's effect) that have occurred over\nthe past two decades north of 30{\\deg} S. Thus, climate drivers along the HUE\nare inducing contrasting trends in oceanographic conditions and primary\nproductivity, which can have far-reaching consequences for coastal pelagic and\nbenthic ecosystems and lead to geographic displacements of the major fisheries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 12:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Traditional dialog state tracking cannot be\napplied to such systems because it does not track the attributes in the social\ncontent.

DEUX has a module that keeps track of the movie attributes\n(e.g., favorite genres, actors,etc.) in both user utterances and system\nresponses. This allows the system to introduce new movie attributes in its\nsocial content. Then, DEUX has multiple values for the same attribute type\nwhich suits the recommendation task since a user may like multiple genres, for\ninstance. Experiments suggest that DEUX outperforms all the baselines on being\nmore consistent, fitting the user preferences better, and providing a more\nengaging chat experience.

Furthermore, it could be useful to assess solvation free\nenergy in the absence of a physical sample. In this study, we propose two novel\nmodels for the problem of free solvation energy predictions, based on the Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) architectures: Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) and\nGraph Attention Network (GAT). GNNs are capable of summarizing the predictive\ninformation of a molecule as low-dimensional features directly from its graph\nstructure without relying on an extensive amount of intra-molecular\ndescriptors. As a result, these models are capable of making accurate\npredictions of the molecular properties without the time consuming process of\nrunning an experiment on each molecule. We show that our proposed models\noutperform all quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics methods in addition to\nexisting alternative machine learning based approaches in the task of solvation\nfree energy prediction.

In aim of both providing assurances where required and not\nstifling innovation yet supporting it, herein it is proposed that such\nregulation should not be mandated for all AI-based systems and that rather it\nshould primarily provide a voluntary framework and only be mandated in sectors\nand activities where required and as deemed necessary by other authorities for\nregulated and critical areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

The power station consists of a Gas Core Reactor (GCR)\nwith magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator. A new model of gas core reactor which\nhas advantages by comparison with known models is suggested. It is shown that\n$200\\ ton$ system would generate $200\\ MW$ electricity. The gas core reactor\nconsists of a spherical cavity of $1\\ m$ to $1.5\\ m$ radius surrounded by a\n$50\\ cm$ thick liquid beryllium reflector within molybdenum--92 container. The\nfuel consists of $^{235}$UF$_4$, KF, and K. It is demonstrated that such power\nstation will work for gaseous fuel pressures of $50\\ atm$ to $100\\ atm$. The\nMonte-Carlo simulations describing paths of thousands of neutrons are\nperformed. These simulations yield neutronic results, i.e. the fractions of\nneutrons causing fission, being absorbed by moderator, and escaping the\nreactor. From this information one can calculate minimum needed pressure inside\nthe reactor, the reactor size, and moderator thickness. The conductivity of\nsuperheated fuel depending on temperature and pressure is also calculated. It\nis concluded that space propulsion is the best use of uranium resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 00:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

This paper proposes a distributed skin health monitoring\nsystem using a wireless body area network. The system is responsive to the\ndynamic changes in the skin health, and remotely reports on the same. The\nproposed algorithm detects the abnormal skin and creates an energy efficient\ndata aggregation tree covering the affected area while putting the unnecessary\nsensors to sleep mode. The algorithm responds to the changing conditions of the\nskin by dynamically adapting the size and shape of the monitoring trees to that\nof the abnormal skin areas thus providing a comprehensive monitoring.\nSimulation results demonstrate the application and utility of the proposed\nalgorithm for changing wound shapes and sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 20:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}
