We assume that the agents have line\nsensors of equal length. We propose procedures for designing cooperative\nsweeping processes that ensure successful completion of the task, thereby\nderiving conditions on the sweeping speed of the agents and their paths.\nSuccessful completion of the task means that evaders with a known limit on\ntheir speed cannot escape the sweeping agents. A simpler task for the sweeping\nswarm is the confinement of the evaders to their initial domain. The\nfeasibility of completing these tasks depends on geometric and dynamic\nconstraints that impose a lower bound on the speed the sweeping agent must\nhave. This critical speed is derived to ensure the satisfaction of the\nconfinement task. Increasing the speed above the lower bound enables the agents\nto complete the search task as well. We present a quantitative and qualitative\ncomparison analysis between the total search time of same-direction sweep\nprocesses and pincer-movement search strategies.

In this paper, we propose a\nhyperbolic-to-hyperbolic graph convolutional network (H2H-GCN) that directly\nworks on hyperbolic manifolds. Specifically, we developed a manifold-preserving\ngraph convolution that consists of a hyperbolic feature transformation and a\nhyperbolic neighborhood aggregation. The hyperbolic feature transformation\nworks as linear transformation on hyperbolic manifolds. It ensures the\ntransformed node representations still lie on the hyperbolic manifold by\nimposing the orthogonal constraint on the transformation sub-matrix. The\nhyperbolic neighborhood aggregation updates each node representation via the\nEinstein midpoint. The H2H-GCN avoids the distortion caused by tangent space\napproximations and keeps the global hyperbolic structure.

These\nfields are then amplified via a dynamo mechanism. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability is a fluid phenomenon that takes place in many astrophysical\nscenarios and can trigger the action of the Biermann battery and dynamo\nprocesses. We aim to investigate the effect that the ionisation degree of the\nplasma and the interaction between the charged and neutral species have on the\ngeneration and amplification of magnetic fields during the different stages of\nthe instability. We use the two-fluid model implemented in the numerical code\nMancha-2F. We perform 2D simulations starting from a configuration with no\ninitial magnetic field and which is unstable due to a velocity shear. We vary\nthe ionisation degree of the plasma and we analyse the role that the different\ncollisional terms included in the equations of the model play on the evolution\nof the instability and the generation of magnetic field. We find that when no\ncollisional coupling is considered between the two fluids, the effect of the\nBiermann battery mechanism does not depend on the ionisation degree. However,\nwhen elastic collisions are taken into account, the generation of magnetic\nfield is increased as the ionisation degree is reduced. This behaviour is\nslightly enhanced if the process of charge-exchange is also considered. We also\nfind a dependence on the total density of the plasma related to the dependence\non the coupling degree between the two fluids. As the total density is\nincreased, the results from the two-fluid model converge to the predictions of\nsingle-fluid models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

We utilize nanothermodynamics, based\non two postulates: that small systems can be treated self-consistently by\ncoupling to an ensemble of similarly small systems, and that a large ensemble\nof small systems forms its own thermodynamic bath. We adapt these ideas to\nstudy how a large system may subdivide into an ensemble of smaller subsystems,\ncausing internal heterogeneity across multiple size scales. For the\nsemi-classical ideal gas, maximum entropy favors subdividing a large system of\natoms into regions of variable size. The mechanism of region formation could\ncome from quantum exchange that makes atoms in each region indistinguishable,\nwhile decoherence between regions allows atoms in separate regions to be\ndistinguishable by location. Combining regions reduces the total entropy, as\nexpected when distinguishable particles become indistinguishable, and as\nrequired by theorems for sub-additive entropy. Combining large volumes of small\nregions gives the entropy of mixing for a semi-classical ideal gas, resolving\nGibbs paradox without invoking quantum symmetry for distant atoms.

It is well known that ${\\rm mc}(G)\\ge m/2$ for any $m$-edge graph\n$G$, and the difference ${\\rm mc}(G)-m/2$ is called the surplus of $G$. The\nstudy of the surplus of $H$-free graphs was initiated by Erd\\H{o}s and Lov\\'asz\nin the 70s, who in particular asked what happens for triangle-free graphs. This\nwas famously resolved by Alon, who showed that in the triangle-free case the\nsurplus is $\\Omega(m^{4/5})$, and found constructions matching this bound. We\nprove several new results in this area.\n  Firstly, we show that for every fixed odd $r\\ge 3$, any $C_r$-free graph with\n$m$ edges has surplus $\\Omega_r\\big(m^{\\frac{r+1}{r+2}}\\big)$. This is tight,\nas is shown by a construction of pseudorandom $C_r$-free graphs due to Alon and\nKahale. It improves previous results of several researchers, and complements a\nresult of Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov which is the same bound when $r$ is\neven.\n  Secondly, generalizing the result of Alon, we allow the graph to have\ntriangles, and show that if the number of triangles is a bit less than in a\nrandom graph with the same density, then the graph has large surplus.

In particular, a novel \"later-is-better\" principle is at the\nfront and center of resource rationing, which is validated empirically in\nseveral instances of wireless FL. We also point out technical challenges and\nresearch opportunities that are worth pursuing. Resource rationing highlights\nthe benefits of treating the emerging FL as a new class of service that has its\nown characteristics, and designing communication algorithms for this particular\nservice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In this paper, a hierarchical deep learning framework\nis proposed to verify the land use information. For this purpose, a two-step\nstrategy is applied. First, given high-resolution aerial images, the land cover\ninformation is determined. To achieve this, an encoder-decoder based\nconvolutional neural net-work (CNN) is proposed. Second, the pixel-wise land\ncover information along with the aerial images serves as input for another CNN\nto classify land use. Because the object catalogue of geospatial databases is\nfrequently constructed in a hierarchical manner, we propose a new CNN-based\nmethod aiming to predict land use in multiple levels hierarchically and\nsimultaneously. A so called Joint Optimization (JO) is proposed where\npredictions are made by selecting the hier-archical tuple over all levels which\nhas the maximum joint class scores, providing consistent results across the\ndifferent levels. The conducted experiments show that the CNN relying on JO\noutperforms previous results, achieving an overall accuracy up to 92.5%. In\naddition to the individual experiments on two test sites, we investigate\nwhether data showing different characteristics can improve the results of land\ncover and land use classification, when processed together. To do so, we\ncombine the two datasets and undertake some additional experiments. The results\nshow that adding more data helps both land cover and land use classification,\nespecially the identification of underrepre-sented categories, despite their\ndifferent characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In the literature on streaming codes, the\ncommonly-assumed Gilbert-Elliott channel model, is replaced by a more\ntractable, delay-constrained, sliding-window (DCSW) channel model that can\nintroduce either random or burst erasures. The known streaming codes that are\nrate optimal over the DCSW channel model are constructed by diagonally\nembedding a scalar block code across successive packets. These code\nconstructions have field size that is quadratic in the delay parameter $\\tau$\nand have a somewhat complex structure with an involved decoding procedure. This\nled to the introduction of simple streaming (SS) codes in which diagonal\nembedding is replaced by staggered-diagonal embedding (SDE). The SDE approach\nreduces the impact of a burst of erasures and makes it possible to construct\nnear-rate-optimal streaming codes using Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code\nhaving linear field size. The present paper takes this development one step\nfurther, by retaining the staggered-diagonal feature, but permitting the\nplacement of more than one code symbol from a given scalar codeword within each\npacket. These generalized, simple streaming codes allow us to improve upon the\nrate of SS codes, while retaining the simplicity of working with MDS codes. We\ncharacterize the maximum code rate of streaming codes under a constraint on the\nnumber of contiguous packets over which symbols of the underlying scalar code\nare dispersed. Such a constraint leads to simplified code construction and\nreduced-complexity decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Here, we investigate how salinity and\nthe partition of heat production between the silicate core and the ice shell\naffect ocean dynamics and the associated heat transport -- a key factor that\ndetermines the equilibrium ice shell geometry. Assuming steady state\nconditions, we show that the meridional overturning circulation of the ocean,\ndriven by heat and salt exchange with the ice, has opposing signs at very low\nand very high salinities. Regardless of these differing circulations, heat and\nfreshwater converge towards the equator, where the ice is thick, acting to\nhomogenize thickness variations. In order to maintain the observed ice\nthickness variation, the polar-amplified ice dissipation needs to be strong\nenough and ocean heat convergence cannot overwhelm well-constrained heat loss\nrates through the thick equatorial ice sheet. This requirement is found\nviolated if the main heat source is in the core rather than the ice shell, or\nif the ocean is very fresh or very salty. Instead, with a salinity of\nintermediate range, the temperature- and salinity-induced density gradient\nlargely cancel one another, leading to much reduced overturning and equatorial\nheat convergence rates and consistent budgets in appearance of a significant\nice dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 18:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 05:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

As the number of gravitational wave\nobservations grows, detecting lensed events will become more likely, and to\nassess how the mass-sheet degeneracy may affect them is crucial. Here we study\nboth analytically and numerically how the lensed waveforms are affected by the\nmass-sheet degeneracy computing the amplification factor from the diffraction\nintegral. In particular, we differentiate between the geometrical optics, wave\noptics and interference regimes, focusing on ground-based gravitational waves\ndetectors. In agreement with expectations of gravitational lensing of\nelectromagnetic radiation, we confirm how, in the geometrical optics scenario,\nthe mass-sheet degeneracy cannot be broken with only one lensed image. However,\nwe find that in the interference regime, and in part in the wave-optics regime,\nthe mass-sheet degeneracy can be broken with only one lensed waveform thanks to\nthe characteristic interference patterns of the signal. Finally, we quantify,\nthrough template matching, how well the mass-sheet degeneracy can be broken. We\nfind that, within present GW detector sensitivities and considering signals as\nstrong as those which have been detected so far, the mass-sheet degeneracy can\nlead to a $1\\sigma$ uncertainty on the lens mass of $\\sim 12\\%$.

The ability to register peri-procedurally acquired diagnostic\nimages into the intraprocedural environment can potentially improve the\nintra-procedural tumor targeting, which will significantly improve therapeutic\noutcomes. However, the intra-procedural CBCT often suffers from suboptimal\nimage quality due to lack of signal calibration for Hounsfield unit, limited\nFOV, and motion/metal artifacts. These non-ideal conditions make standard\nintensity-based multimodal registration methods infeasible to generate correct\ntransformation across modalities. While registration based on anatomic\nstructures, such as segmentation or landmarks, provides an efficient\nalternative, such anatomic structure information is not always available.

There-fore, the scale of the training dataset becomes more\ncru-cial. However, it is challenging to obtain large amount of3D dataset since\nachieving 3D annotation is expensive andtime-consuming.

M dwarfs do not lose angular\nmomentum as easily as earlier-type stars, which maintain the high levels of\nstellar activity for far longer. Studying young, fast-rotating M dwarfs is key\nto understanding their near stellar environment and the evolution of activity\nAims: We study stellar activity on the fast-rotating M dwarf GJ 3270. Methods:\nWe analyzed dedicated high cadence, simultaneous, photometric and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained with CARMENES of GJ 3270\nover 7.7 h, covering a total of eight flares of which two are strong enough to\nfacilitate a detailed analysis. We consult the TESS data, obtained in the month\nprior to our own observations, to study rotational modulation and to compare\nthe TESS flares to those observed in our campaign. Results: The TESS data\nexhibit rotational modulation with a period of 0.37 d. The strongest flare\ncovered by our observing campaign released a total energy of about 3.6e32 erg,\nputting it close to the superflare regime. This flare is visible in the B,V, r,\ni, and z photometric bands, which allows us to determine a peak temperature of\nabout 10,000 K. The flare also leaves clear marks in the spectral time series.\nIn particular, we observe an evolving, mainly blue asymmetry in chromospheric\nlines, which we attribute to a post-flare, corotating feature. To our knowledge\nthis is the first time such a feature has been seen on a star other than our\nSun. Conclusions: Our photometric and spectroscopic time series covers the\neruption of a strong flare followed up by a corotating feature analogous to a\npost-flare arcadal loop on the Sun with a possible failed ejection of material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 19:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Given the recent advances in computer technology and\nadditive manufacturing, topology optimization is increasingly being used to\ndesign complex porous structures, for example, microfluidic devices. For the\nflow of fluids in such miniature-sized porous structures, viscous shearing\nstress will be significant. But the Darcy model -- the most popular\nmathematical model describing the flow of a single-phase incompressible fluid\nin rigid porous media -- neglects the internal friction arising from viscous\nshearing stress.

We find a mean\nreduced chi squared of 3.5 for the Kelsall model and a chi squared of 2.0 for\nthe Wright model. The best description of our data is provided by a simple\nmodification to the Kelsall model which includes a free ZL offset parameter.\nThis adjusted model describes the data with a reduced chi squared of 1.5 and\nyields an inferred offset amplitude of 46 +- 19 nW m^-2 sr^-1 extrapolated to\n12500 Angstroms. These measurements elude to the potential existence of a dust\ncloud component in the inner Solar system whose intensity does not strongly\nmodulate with the Earth's motion around the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 20:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Individual young stars as\nmassive as O7-types are powering some HII regions.

However, all existing collaborative bandit learning\nsolutions impose a stationary assumption about the environment, i.e., both user\npreferences and the dependency among users are assumed static over time.\nUnfortunately, this assumption hardly holds in practice due to users'\never-changing interests and dependence relations, which inevitably costs a\nrecommender system sub-optimal performance in practice.\n  In this work, we develop a collaborative dynamic bandit solution to handle a\nchanging environment for recommendation. We explicitly model the underlying\nchanges in both user preferences and their dependency relation as a stochastic\nprocess. Individual user's preference is modeled by a mixture of globally\nshared contextual bandit models with a Dirichlet Process prior. Collaboration\namong users is thus achieved via Bayesian inference over the global bandit\nmodels. Model selection and arm selection for each user are done via Thompson\nsampling to balance exploitation and exploration. Our solution is proved to\nmaintain a standard $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{T})$ sublinear regret even in such a\nchallenging environment. And extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets further confirmed the necessity of modeling a changing\nenvironment and our algorithm's practical advantages against several\nstate-of-the-art online learning solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 22:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Due\nto lack of negative class data, it is often modeled as a one-class\nclassification problem. In practice, mobile devices are connected to a central\nserver, e.g, all android-based devices are connected to Google server through\ninternet. This device-server structure can be exploited by recently proposed\nFederated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) frameworks to perform\ncollaborative learning over the data distributed among multiple devices. Using\nFL/SL frameworks, we can alleviate the lack of negative data problem by\ntraining a user authentication model over multiple user data distributed across\ndevices. To this end, we propose a novel user active authentication training,\ntermed as Federated Active Authentication (FAA), that utilizes the principles\nof FL/SL. We first show that existing FL/SL methods are suboptimal for FAA as\nthey rely on the data to be distributed homogeneously (i.e. IID) across\ndevices, which is not true in the case of FAA. Subsequently, we propose a novel\nmethod that is able to tackle heterogeneous/non-IID distribution of data in\nFAA. Specifically, we first extract feature statistics such as mean and\nvariance corresponding to data from each user which are later combined in a\ncentral server to learn a multi-class classifier and sent back to the\nindividual devices. We conduct extensive experiments using three active\nauthentication benchmark datasets (MOBIO, UMDAA-01, UMDAA-02) and show that\nsuch approach performs better than state-of-the-art one-class based FAA methods\nand is also able to outperform traditional FL/SL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 22:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

The simulation results show that the control\nscheme with the proposed SMC-theory-based learning algorithm is able to not\nonly eliminate the steady-state error but also improve the transient response\nperformance of the spherical rolling robot without knowing its dynamic\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 23:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Knowledge distillation\n(KD) is a prominent model compression technique for deep neural networks in\nwhich the knowledge of a trained large teacher model is transferred to a\nsmaller student model. The success of knowledge distillation is mainly\nattributed to its training objective function, which exploits the soft-target\ninformation (also known as \"dark knowledge\") besides the given regular hard\nlabels in a training set. However, it is shown in the literature that the\nlarger the gap between the teacher and the student networks, the more difficult\nis their training using knowledge distillation. To address this shortcoming, we\npropose an improved knowledge distillation method (called Annealing-KD) by\nfeeding the rich information provided by the teacher's soft-targets\nincrementally and more efficiently. Our Annealing-KD technique is based on a\ngradual transition over annealed soft-targets generated by the teacher at\ndifferent temperatures in an iterative process, and therefore, the student is\ntrained to follow the annealed teacher output in a step-by-step manner. This\npaper includes theoretical and empirical evidence as well as practical\nexperiments to support the effectiveness of our Annealing-KD method.

Our previous tunneling study not only found evidence for the\nexistence of surface Dirac fermions, but it also uncovered that they inherently\ninteract with the spin excitons, collective excitations in the bulk. We have\nextended such a spectroscopic investigation into crystals containing a Sm\ndeficiency. The bulk hybridization gap is found to be insensitive to the\ndeficiency up to 1% studied here, but the surface states in Sm-deficient\ncrystals exhibit quite different temperature evolutions from those in\nstoichiometric ones. We attribute this to the topological surface states\nremaining incoherent down to the lowest measurement temperature due to their\ncontinued interaction with the spin excitons that remain uncondensed. This\nresult shows that the detailed topological nature of SmB$_6$ could vary\ndrastically in the presence of disorder in the lattice. This sensitiveness to\ndisorder is seemingly contradictory to the celebrated topological protection,\nbut it can be understood as being due to the intimate interplay between strong\ncorrelations and topological effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Using our\nproposed algorithm, a real-time face recognition accuracy of 78.40% at 15 px\nand 98.05% at 45 px have been achieved using the LRD200 database containing 200\nimages per person.

We constructively tighten the\nupper bound on the worst-case $L_1$ norm sampling cost to next order in $t$\nfrom $\\mathcal O(\\xi^t \\delta^{-2})$ if $\\delta^2 \\gg \\xi^{-t}$ to $\\mathcal\nO((\\xi^t{-}t) \\delta^{-2} )$ if $\\delta^2 \\gg (\\xi^t -t)^{-1}$, where $\\xi^t =\n2^{\\sim 0.228 t}$ is the stabilizer extent of the $t$-tensored $T$ gate magic\nstate. We accomplish this by replacing independent $L_1$ sampling in the\npopular SPARSIFY algorithm used in many weak simulators with correlated $L_1$\nsampling. As an aside, this result demonstrates that the $T$ gate magic state's\napproximate stabilizer state decomposition is not multiplicative with respect\nto $t$, for finite values, despite the multiplicativity of its stabilizer\nextent. This is the first weak simulation algorithm that has lowered this\nbound's dependence on finite $t$ in the worst-case to our knowledge and\nestablishes how to obtain further such reductions in $t$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 05:50:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 05:10:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 19:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

More seriously, it is hard to distinguish the\ndependency of interlocutors and the emotional influence among interlocutors by\nsimply assembling the features on top of RNNs. In this paper, we develop a\nseries of BERT-based models to specifically capture the inter-interlocutor and\nintra-interlocutor dependencies of the conversational emotion dynamics.\nConcretely, we first substitute BERT for RNNs to enrich the token\nrepresentations. Then, a Flat-structured BERT (F-BERT) is applied to link up\nutterances in a conversation directly, and a Hierarchically-structured BERT\n(H-BERT) is employed to distinguish the interlocutors when linking up\nutterances. More importantly, a Spatial-Temporal-structured BERT, namely\nST-BERT, is proposed to further determine the emotional influence among\ninterlocutors.

The connection between initial disc conditions and final orbital and\nphysical properties of planets is not well-understood. In this paper, we\nnumerically study the formation of planetary systems via pebble accretion and\ninvestigate the effects of disc properties such as masses, dissipation\ntimescales, and metallicities on planet formation outcomes. Methods. We\nimproved the N-body code SyMBA that was modified by taking account of new\nplanet-disc interaction models and type II migration. We adopted the 'two-alpha\ndisc' model to mimic the effects of both the standard disc turbulence and the\nmass accretion driven by the magnetic disc wind. Results. We successfully\nreproduced the overall distribution trends of semi-major axes, eccentricities,\nand planetary masses of extrasolar giant planets. We find that, when planet\nformation happens fast enough, giant planets are fully grown (Jupiter mass or\nhigher) and are distributed widely across the disc. On the other hand, when\nplanet formation is limited by the disc's dissipation, discs generally form\nlow-mass cold Jupiters (CJs). Our simulations also naturally explain why hot\nJupiters (HJs) tend to be alone and how the observed eccentricity-metallicity\ntrends arise. The low-metallicity discs tend to form nearly circular and\ncoplanar HJs in situ, because planet formation is slower than high-metallicity\ndiscs, and thus protoplanetary cores migrate significantly before gas\naccretion. The high-metallicity discs, on the other hand, generate HJs in situ\nor via tidal circularisation of eccentric orbits. Both pathways usually involve\ndynamical instabilities, and thus HJs tend to have broader eccentricity and\ninclination distributions. When giant planets with very wide orbits\n('super-cold Jupiters') are formed, we find that they often belong to\nmetal-rich stars, have eccentric orbits, and tend to have (~80%) companions\ninterior to their orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 06:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Though empirically strong, these\nmodels are typically bottlenecked by length prediction, as even small\ninaccuracies change the syntactic and semantic characteristics of resulting\nframes. In our work, we propose span pointer networks, non-autoregressive\nparsers which shift the decoding task from text generation to span prediction;\nthat is, when imputing utterance spans into frame slots, our model produces\nendpoints (e.g., [i, j]) as opposed to text (e.g., \"6pm\").

Because of\nhigh dimensionality and complex feedbacks between traits manifested in\ninfection and co-infection, the study of such systems remains a challenge. In\nthe case where strains are similar (quasi-neutrality assumption), we can model\ntrait variation as perturbations in parameters, which simplifies analysis.\nHere, we apply singular perturbation theory to many strain parameters\nsimultaneously, and advance analytically to obtain their explicit collective\ndynamics. We consider and study such a quasi-neutral model of\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics among N strains which vary in 5\nfitness dimensions: transmissibility, clearance rate of single-and\nco-infection, transmission probability from mixed coinfection, and\nco-colonization vulnerability factors encompassing cooperation and competition.\nThis quasi-neutral system is analyzed with a singular perturbation method\nthrough an appropriate slow-fast decomposition. The fast dynamics correspond to\nthe embedded neutral system, while the slow dynamics are governed by an\nN-dimensional replicator equation, describing the time evolution of strain\nfrequencies. The coefficients of this replicator system are pairwise invasion\nfitnesses between strains, which, in our model, are an explicit weighted sum of\npairwise asymmetries along all trait dimensions. Remarkably these weights\ndepend only on the parameters of the neutral system. Such model reduction\nhighlights the centrality of the neutral system for dynamics at the edge of\nneutrality, and exposes critical features for maintenance of diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 08:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

It is effective since graph convolution combines the\nstructural and attributive information for node embedding learning. However, a\nmajor limitation of such works is that the graph convolution only incorporates\nthe attribute information from the local neighborhood of nodes but fails to\nexploit the mutual affinities between nodes and attributes. In this regard, we\npropose a variational co-embedding learning model for attributed network\nclustering (VCLANC). VCLANC is composed of dual variational auto-encoders to\nsimultaneously embed nodes and attributes. Relying on this, the mutual affinity\ninformation between nodes and attributes could be reconstructed from the\nembedding space and served as extra self-supervised knowledge for\nrepresentation learning. At the same time, trainable Gaussian mixture model is\nused as priors to infer the node clustering assignments. To strengthen the\nperformance of the inferred clusters, we use a mutual distance loss on the\ncenters of the Gaussian priors and a clustering assignment hardening loss on\nthe node embeddings.

Most of the\nlarge-scale, spatially correlated structures in the nebula are thought to\noriginate from the interaction of the stellar wind with a companion. As part of\nthe Atomium large programme, we observed the M-type asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) star R Hydrae with ALMA. The morphology of the inner wind of R Hya, which\nhas a known companion at ~3500 au, was determined from maps of CO and SiO\nobtained at high angular resolution. A map of the CO emission reveals a\nmulti-layered structure consisting of a large elliptical feature at an angular\nscale of ~10'' that is oriented along the north-south axis. The wind morphology\nwithin the elliptical feature is dominated by two hollow bubbles. The bubbles\nare on opposite sides of the AGB star and lie along an axis with a position\nangle of ~115 deg. Both bubbles are offset from the central star, and their\nappearance in the SiO channel maps indicates that they might be shock waves\ntravelling through the AGB wind. An estimate of the dynamical age of the\nbubbles yields an age of the order of 100 yr, which is in agreement with the\npreviously proposed elapsed time since the star last underwent a thermal pulse.\nWhen the CO and SiO emission is examined on subarcsecond angular scales, there\nis evidence for an inclined, differentially rotating equatorial density\nenhancement, strongly suggesting the presence of a second nearby companion. The\nposition angle of the major axis of this disc is ~70 deg in the plane of the\nsky. We tentatively estimate that a lower limit on the mass of the nearby\ncompanion is ~0.65 Msol on the basis of the highest measured speeds in the disc\nand the location of its inner rim at ~6 au from the AGB star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 08:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Specifically, we introduce a\nmodified corner pooling layer to convert the bounding box estimate of the\ntarget into a pair of corner predictions (the bottom-right and the top-left\ncorners). By tracking a target as a pair of corners, we avoid the need to\ndesign the anchor boxes. This will make the entire tracking algorithm more\nflexible and simple than anchorbased trackers. In our network design, we\nfurther introduce a layer-wise feature aggregation strategy that enables the\ncorner pooling module to predict multiple corners for a tracking target in deep\nnetworks. We then introduce a new penalty term that is used to select an\noptimal tracking box in these candidate corners. Finally, SiamCorners achieves\nexperimental results that are comparable to the state-of-art tracker while\nmaintaining a high running speed. In particular, SiamCorners achieves a 53.7%\nAUC on NFS30 and a 61.4% AUC on UAV123, while still running at 42 frames per\nsecond (FPS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 08:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

A rich example of this phenomenon is the Portevin-Le Chatelier\neffect in alloys. The corresponding spatiotemporal patterns showed some\nuniversal features which provided a basis for a well-known phenomenological\nclassification. Recent studies revealed peculiar features in both the stress\nserration sequences and the kinematics of deformation bands in Al-based alloys\ncontaining fine microstructure elements, such as nanosize precipitates and (or)\nsubmicron grains. In the present work, jerky flow of an AlMgScZr alloy is\nstudied using statistical analysis of stress serrations and the accompanying\nacoustic emission. As in the case of coarse-grained binary AlMg alloys, the\namplitude distributions of acoustic events obey a power-law scaling which is\nusually considered as evidence of avalanchelike dynamics. However, the scaling\nexponents display specific dependences on the strain and strain rate for the\ninvestigated materials. The observed effects bear evidence to a competition\nbetween the phenomena of synchronization and randomization of dislocation\navalanches, which may shed light on the mechanisms leading to a high variety of\njerky flow patterns observed in applied alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 08:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Inverse\nRendering (MVIR) method called Spectral MVIR for jointly reconstructing the 3D\nshape and the spectral reflectance for each point of object surfaces from\nmulti-view images captured using a standard RGB camera and low-cost lighting\nequipment such as an LED bulb or an LED projector. Our main contributions are\ntwofold: (i) We present a rendering model that considers both geometric and\nphotometric principles in the image formation by explicitly considering camera\nspectral sensitivity, light's spectral power distribution, and light source\npositions. (ii) Based on the derived model, we build a cost-optimization MVIR\nframework for the joint reconstruction of the 3D shape and the per-vertex\nspectral reflectance while estimating the light source positions and the\nshadows. Different from most existing spectral-3D acquisition methods, our\nmethod does not require expensive special equipment and cumbersome geometric\ncalibration. Experimental results using both synthetic and real-world data\ndemonstrate that our Spectral MVIR can acquire a high-quality 3D model with\naccurate spectral reflectance property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 08:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

We consider a generic a_1 + i a_2 wave state, with a_1 and a_2 being\ndifferent symmetry indices such as (a_1,a_2) = (d,s), (p_x,p_y), and (d,d').The\ntime-reversal symmetry of the mixed-symmetry state with the a_1- and a_2-wave\ncomponents is broken when the phases of these components differ, and such a\nstate is called the time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) state. However,\ntheir phases are equated by Cooper-pair scattering between these components if\nit occurs; i.e., when the off-diagonal elements S_{a_1 a_2} = S_{a_2 a_1} of\nthe scattering matrix are nonzero, they destabilize the TRSB state. Hence, it\nhas often been believed that the TRSB state is stable only in systems with a\nspatial symmetry that guarantees S_{a_1 a_2}=0. We note that, contrary to this\nbelief, the TRSB state can remain stable in systems without the spatial\nsymmetry when the relative phase shifts so that S_{a_1 a_2} = 0 is restored,\nwhich results in a distorted TRSB (a_1 + a_2) + i a_2 wave state. Here, note\nthat the restoration of S_{a_1 a_2} = 0 does not imply that the symmetry of the\nquasi-particle energy E_k is recovered. This study shows that such\nstabilization of the TRSB state occurs when the distortion is sufficiently\nsmall and \\Delta_{a_1} \\Delta_{a_2} is sufficiently large, where \\Delta_a is\nthe amplitude of the a-wave component in the TRSB state in the absence of the\ndistortion. We clarify the manner in which the shift in the relative phase\neliminates S_{a_1 a_2} and prove that such a state yields a free-energy\nminimum. We also propose a formula for the upper bound of the degree of lattice\ndistortion, below which the TRSB state can be stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 09:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

From a\nmethodological standpoint, our work also illustrates that applying a\ntransformation to the eigenvalues of $\\hat\\Sigma$ before bootstrapping is an\nimportant consideration in high-dimensional settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 09:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Those data\ninevitably demand a massive off-chip memory capacity/bandwidth, and the\nsituation gets even worse if they are represented in high-precision\nfloating-point formats. Effort has been made for representing those data in\ndifferent 8-bit floating-point formats, nevertheless, a notable accuracy loss\nis still unavoidable. In this paper we introduce an extremely flexible 8-bit\nfloating-point (FFP8) format whose defining factors - the bit width of\nexponent/fraction field, the exponent bias, and even the presence of the sign\nbit - are all configurable. We also present a methodology to properly determine\nthose factors so that the accuracy of model inference can be maximized. The\nfoundation of this methodology is based on a key observation - both the maximum\nmagnitude and the value distribution are quite dissimilar between weights and\nactivations in most DNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed FFP8 format achieves an extremely low accuracy loss of $0.1\\%\\sim\n0.3\\%$ for several representative image classification models even without the\nneed of model retraining. Besides, it is easy to turn a classical\nfloating-point processing unit into an FFP8-compliant one, and the extra\nhardware cost is minor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 09:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 05:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

In this paper, we try to solve this\nproblem in a more effective way, by reformulating the regression-based depth\nestimation problem into a combination of depth plane classification and\nresidual regression. Our proposed approach is to initially densify sparse depth\ninformation by figuring out which plane a pixel should lie among a number of\ndiscretized depth planes, and then calculate the final depth value by\npredicting the distance from the specified plane. This will help the network to\nlessen the burden of directly regressing the absolute depth information from\nnone, and to effectively obtain more accurate depth prediction result with less\ncomputation power and inference time. To do so, we firstly introduce a novel\nway of interpreting depth information with the closest depth plane label $p$\nand a residual value $r$, as we call it, Plane-Residual (PR) representation. We\nalso propose a depth completion network utilizing PR representation consisting\nof a shared encoder and two decoders, where one classifies the pixel's depth\nplane label, while the other one regresses the normalized distance from the\nclassified depth plane.

However, in practical scenarios, beyond\nthe relevance between user interest and news content, the news click behaviors\nmay also be affected by other factors, such as the bias of news presentation in\nthe online platform. For example, news with higher positions and larger sizes\nare usually more likely to be clicked.

Over the years,\nresearch has identified many desired qualities for benchmark suites, such as\ndiverse topology, different difficulties, scalability, representativeness of\nreal-world problems among others. However, while the topology characteristics\nhave been subjected to previous studies, there is no study that has\nstatistically evaluated the difficulty level of benchmark functions, how well\nthey discriminate optimization algorithms and how suitable is a benchmark suite\nfor algorithm comparison. In this paper, we propose the use of an item response\ntheory (IRT) model, the Bayesian two-parameter logistic model for multiple\nattempts, to statistically evaluate these aspects with respect to the empirical\nsuccess rate of algorithms. With this model, we can assess the difficulty level\nof each benchmark, how well they discriminate different algorithms, the ability\nscore of an algorithm, and how much information the benchmark suite adds in the\nestimation of the ability scores. We demonstrate the use of this model in two\nwell-known benchmark suites, the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) for\ncontinuous optimization and the Pseudo Boolean Optimization (PBO) for discrete\noptimization. We found that most benchmark functions of BBOB suite have high\ndifficulty levels (compared to the optimization algorithms) and low\ndiscrimination. For the PBO, most functions have good discrimination parameters\nbut are often considered too easy. We discuss potential uses of IRT in\nbenchmarking, including its use to improve the design of benchmark suites, to\nmeasure multiple aspects of the algorithms, and to design adaptive suites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 11:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

However, almost\nall the existing backdoor works focused on the digital domain, while few\nstudies investigate the backdoor attacks in real physical world.

Under various complex physical conditions, by injecting only a very\nsmall ratio (0.5%) of backdoor instances, the attack success rate of physical\nbackdoor attacks with the PTB method on VGGFace is 82%, while the attack\nsuccess rate of backdoor attacks without the proposed PTB method is lower than\n11%.

We compute the time evolution of star-planet systems consisting of a\nplanet with initial mass between 0.02 and 2.5 M$_{ Jup}$ (6 and 800 M$_{\nEarth}$), in a quasi-circular orbit with an initial orbital distance between\n0.01 and 0.10 au, around a solar-type star evolving from the Pre-Main-Sequence\n(PMS) until the end of the Main-Sequence (MS) phase. We account for the\nevolution of: the stellar structure, the stellar angular momentum due to tides\nand magnetic braking, the tidal interactions (equilibrium and dynamical tides\nin stellar convective zones), the mass-evaporation of the planet, and the\nsecular evolution of the planetary orbit. We consider that at the beginning of\nthe evolution, the proto-planetary disk has fully dissipated and planet\nformation is complete. Both a rapid initial stellar rotation, and a more\nefficient angular momentum transport inside the star, in general, contribute\ntoward the enlargement of the domain which is devoid of planets after the PMS\nphase, in the plane of planet mass vs. orbital distance. Comparisons with the\nobserved distribution of exoplanets orbiting solar mass stars, in the plane of\nplanet mass vs. orbital distance (addressing the \"Neptunian desert\" feature),\nshow an encouraging agreement with the present simulations, especially since no\nattempts have been made to fine-tune initial parameters of the models to fit\nthe observations. We also obtain an upper limit for the orbital period of\nbare-core planets, that agrees with observations of the \"radius valley\" feature\nin the plane of planet radius vs. orbital period. The two effects, tides and\nplanet evaporation, should be accounted for simultaneously and in a consistent\nway, with a detailed model for the evolution of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 11:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

The first phase introduces a neighbor construction\nstrategy to construct a semantic neighbor set for each user and item according\nto the user-item historical interaction.

In a magnetised plasma, however, there are usually\nseveral pass and stop bands for the EM wave depending on the orientation of the\nmagnetic field with respect to the propagation direction. The EM wave while\npropagating in a plasma can excite electrostatic disturbances in the plasma [1,\n2]. In this work Particle - In - Cell simulations have been carried out to\nillustrate the complete transparency of the EM wave propagation inside a\nstrongly magnetised plasma. The external magnetic field is chosen to be\nperpendicular to both the wave propagation direction and the electric field of\nthe EM wave, which is the X mode configuration. Despite the presence of charged\nelectron and ion species the plasma medium behaves like a vacuum. The\nobservation is understood with the help of particle drifts. It is shown that\nthough the two particle species move under the influence of EM fields their\nmotion does not lead to any charge or current source to alter the dispersion\nrelation of the EM wave propagating in the medium. Furthermore, it is also\nshown that the stop band for EM wave in this regime shrinks to a zero width as\nboth the resonance and cut-off points approach each other. Thus transparency to\nthe EM radiation in such a strongly magnetised case appears to be a norm. This\nmay have important implications in astrophysical scenarios. For instance, the\nplasma surrounding objects like pulsars and magnetars is often threaded with\nstrong magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 12:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

Recently,\nremote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been developed as an intrinsic liveness\nclue for 3D mask PAD without relying on the mask appearance. However, the rPPG\nfeatures for 3D mask PAD are still needed expert knowledge to design manually,\nwhich limits its further progress in the deep learning and big data era. In\nthis letter, we propose a pure rPPG transformer (TransRPPG) framework for\nlearning intrinsic liveness representation efficiently. At first, rPPG-based\nmulti-scale spatial-temporal maps (MSTmap) are constructed from facial skin and\nbackground regions. Then the transformer fully mines the global relationship\nwithin MSTmaps for liveness representation, and gives a binary prediction for\n3D mask detection. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark\ndatasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the TransRPPG on both intra- and\ncross-dataset testings. Our TransRPPG is lightweight and efficient (with only\n547K parameters and 763M FLOPs), which is promising for mobile-level\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 12:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic\nGCN named Lorentzian graph convolutional network (LGCN), which rigorously\nguarantees the learned node features follow the hyperbolic geometry.\nSpecifically, we rebuild the graph operations of hyperbolic GCNs with\nLorentzian version, e.g., the feature transformation and non-linear activation.\nAlso, an elegant neighborhood aggregation method is designed based on the\ncentroid of Lorentzian distance.

Both offer valuable clues to dynamical processes during\nstellar core collapse and explosion. Moreover, they influence the evolution of\nstellar multiple systems and the gravitational-wave signals from their inspiral\nand merger. Observational evidence of possibly generic spin-kick alignment has\nbeen interpreted as indication that NS spins are either induced with the NS\nkicks or inherited from progenitor rotation, which thus might play a\ndynamically important role during stellar collapse. Current three-dimensional\nsupernova simulations suggest that NS kicks are transferred in the first\nseconds of the explosion, mainly by anisotropic mass ejection and, on a\nsecondary level, anisotropic neutrino emission. In contrast, the NS spins are\nonly determined minutes to hours later by angular momentum associated with\nfallback of matter that does not become gravitationally unbound in the\nsupernova. Here, we propose a novel scenario to explain spin-kick alignment as\na consequence of tangential vortex flows in the fallback matter that is\naccreted mostly from the direction of the NS's motion. For this effect the\ninitial NS kick is crucial, because it produces a growing offset of the NS away\nfrom the explosion center, thus promoting onesided accretion. In this new\nscenario conclusions based on traditional concepts are reversed. For example,\npre-kick NS spins are not required, and rapid progenitor-core rotation can\nhamper spin-kick alignment.

Unfortunately, MLMs also\ndemonstrate significantly worrying levels of social biases. We show that the\npreviously proposed evaluation metrics for quantifying the social biases in\nMLMs are problematic due to following reasons: (1) prediction accuracy of the\nmasked tokens itself tend to be low in some MLMs, which raises questions\nregarding the reliability of the evaluation metrics that use the (pseudo)\nlikelihood of the predicted tokens, and (2) the correlation between the\nprediction accuracy of the mask and the performance in downstream NLP tasks is\nnot taken into consideration, and (3) high frequency words in the training data\nare masked more often, introducing noise due to this selection bias in the test\ncases. To overcome the above-mentioned disfluencies, we propose All Unmasked\nLikelihood (AUL), a bias evaluation measure that predicts all tokens in a test\ncase given the MLM embedding of the unmasked input. We find that AUL accurately\ndetects different types of biases in MLMs. We also propose AUL with attention\nweights (AULA) to evaluate tokens based on their importance in a sentence.\nHowever, unlike AUL and AULA, previously proposed bias evaluation measures for\nMLMs systematically overestimate the measured biases, and are heavily\ninfluenced by the unmasked tokens in the context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

But since real federated settings are\nresource-constrained, FL is encountered with systems heterogeneity which causes\na lot of stragglers directly and then leads to significantly accuracy reduction\nindirectly. To solve the problems caused by systems heterogeneity, we introduce\na novel self-adaptive federated framework FedSAE which adjusts the training\ntask of devices automatically and selects participants actively to alleviate\nthe performance degradation. In this work, we 1) propose FedSAE which leverages\nthe complete information of devices' historical training tasks to predict the\naffordable training workloads for each device. In this way, FedSAE can estimate\nthe reliability of each device and self-adaptively adjust the amount of\ntraining load per client in each round. 2) combine our framework with Active\nLearning to self-adaptively select participants. Then the framework accelerates\nthe convergence of the global model. In our framework, the server evaluates\ndevices' value of training based on their training loss. Then the server\nselects those clients with bigger value for the global model to reduce\ncommunication overhead. The experimental result indicates that in a highly\nheterogeneous system, FedSAE converges faster than FedAvg, the vanilla FL\nframework. Furthermore, FedSAE outperforms than FedAvg on several federated\ndatasets - FedSAE improves test accuracy by 26.7% and reduces stragglers by\n90.3% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Beyond\nbasic closest-point rendering, we also introduce a fast, high-quality variant\nto reduce aliasing. We present and evaluate several variants of our proposed\nmethods with different flavors of optimization, in order to ensure their\napplicability and achieve optimal performance on a range of platforms and\narchitectures with varying support for novel GPU hardware features.

We compare different orderings and show that Morton sorted buffers\nare faster for some viewpoints, while shuffled vertex buffers are faster in\nothers. In contrast, combining both approaches by first sorting according to\nMorton-code and shuffling the resulting sequence in batches of 128 points leads\nto a vertex buffer layout with high rendering performance and low sensitivity\nto viewpoint changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

For\nthis reason, the proposed next-generation infrastructure Einstein Telescope in\nEurope would be realized underground aiming for an observation band that\nextends from 3 Hz to several kHz. However, it is known that ambient noise in\nthe low-frequency band 10 Hz - 20 Hz at current surface sites of the Virgo and\nLIGO detectors is predominantly produced by the detector infrastructure.

However, these methods perform well on restricted sets of activities in\ndomains for which there is a fully labeled dataset. It is still a challenge to\ncope with the intra- and inter-variability of activity execution among\ndifferent subjects in large scale real world deployment. Semi-supervised\nlearning approaches for HAR have been proposed to address the challenge of\nacquiring the large amount of labeled data that is necessary in realistic\nsettings. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and\nprivacy problems when the process involves a large number of users.

Indeed, FedHAR combines active learning and label\npropagation to semi-automatically annotate the local streams of unlabeled\nsensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity model in a scalable\nand privacy-aware fashion. FedHAR also includes a transfer learning strategy to\npersonalize the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two\npublic datasets, showing that FedHAR reaches recognition rates and\npersonalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art FL supervised\napproaches. As a major advantage, FedHAR only requires a very limited number of\nannotated data to populate a pre-trained model and a small number of active\nlearning questions that quickly decrease while using the system, leading to an\neffective and scalable solution for the data scarcity problem of HAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 12:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

While the accuracy of deep neural networks is increasing, the\nconfidence score, which indicates the reliability of the prediction results, is\nbecoming more important. Deep neural networks are seen as highly accurate but\nknown to be overconfident, making it important to calibrate the confidence\nscore. Many studies have been conducted on confidence calibration. They\ncalibrate the confidence score of the model to match its accuracy, but it is\nnot clear whether these confidence scores can improve the performance of\nsystems that use confidence scores. This paper focuses on cascade inference\nsystems, one kind of systems using confidence scores, and discusses the desired\nconfidence score to improve system performance in terms of inference accuracy\nand computational cost. Based on the discussion, we propose a new confidence\ncalibration method, Learning to Cascade. Learning to Cascade is a simple but\nnovel method that optimizes the loss term for confidence calibration\nsimultaneously with the original loss term. Experiments are conducted using two\ndatasets, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, in two system settings, and show that naive\napplication of existing calibration methods to cascade inference systems\nsometimes performs worse. However, Learning to Cascade always achieves a better\ntrade-off between inference accuracy and computational cost. The simplicity of\nLearning to Cascade allows it to be easily applied to improve the performance\nof existing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Ecosystem valuation is a method of assigning\na monetary value to an ecosystem with its goods and services,often referred to\nas ecosystem service value (ESV). With the rapid expansion of cities, a\nmismatch occurs between urban development and ecological development, and it is\nincreasingly urgent to establish a valid ecological assessment method. In this\nstudy, we propose an ecological evaluation standard framework by designing an\nESV monitoring workflow based on the establishment of multi-level grids. The\nproposed method is able to capture multi-scale features, facilitates\nmulti-level spatial expression, and can effectively reveal the spatial\nheterogeneity of ESV. Taking Haian city in the Jiangsu province as the study\ncase, we implemented the proposed dynamic multi-level grids-based (DMLG) to\ncalculate its urban ESV in 2016 and 2019. We found that the ESV of Haian city\nshowed considerable growth (increased by 24.54 million RMB). Negative ESVs are\nconcentrated in the central city, which presented a rapid trend of outward\nexpansion. The results illustrated that the ongoing urban expanse does not\nreduce the ecological value in the study area. The proposed unified grid\nframework can be applied to other geographical regions and is expected to\nbenefit future studies in ecosystem service evaluation in terms of capture\nmulti-level spatial heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Both supervised and\nunsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to\ndetect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been\ntrained and evaluated.

This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large\ndata, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable\npositive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while\npreserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized\nones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the\nfederated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants\npoisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model\naggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears\nhighly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary.

This behavior is induced\nby various screening effects that stem from the interactions between\nelectromagnetic (EM) fields and semiconductor carriers. In this work, these\nscreening effects are numerically analyzed for the first time using a\nfully-coupled multiphysics approach. Unlike the previously developed simulation\nframeworks, this approach rigorously models the nonlinear coupling between the\nEM fields and the carriers and therefore is capable of accounting for the\nscreening effects. It is demonstrated that the results obtained using this\nmultiphysics approach and actual experiments are in excellent agreement. The\noptical- and radiation-field screening effects are identified in the simulation\nresults and the optical-field screening is found to play a more dominant role\nin the saturation of the PCD output under high optical pump power levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 21:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Taking into consideration the\ncorrelation that exists between scientific impact and number of citations,\nresearch assessments can be based on citation counts. However, it is crucial to\nperform the counts in the heavy tail of citation distributions. Following this\nheavy tail approach, all measurements performed in Spanish universities show\nthat their research is inefficient because the proportion of highly cited\npapers is much lower than in the most scientifically advanced countries. The\nsame conclusion is reached when considering the number of researchers in the\nIoannidis, Boyack, and Baas lists of highly cited researchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Indeed, without shaped\nrewards, i.e., with only terminal rewards, present-day Embodied AI results\ndegrade significantly across Embodied AI problems from single-agent\nHabitat-based PointGoal Navigation (SPL drops from 55 to 0) and two-agent\nAI2-THOR-based Furniture Moving (success drops from 58% to 1%) to three-agent\nGoogle Football-based 3 vs. 1 with Keeper (game score drops from 0.6 to 0.1).\nAs training from shaped rewards doesn't scale to more realistic tasks, the\ncommunity needs to improve the success of training with terminal rewards. For\nthis we propose GridToPix: 1) train agents with terminal rewards in gridworlds\nthat generically mirror Embodied AI environments, i.e., they are independent of\nthe task; 2) distill the learned policy into agents that reside in complex\nvisual worlds. Despite learning from only terminal rewards with identical\nmodels and RL algorithms, GridToPix significantly improves results across\ntasks: from PointGoal Navigation (SPL improves from 0 to 64) and Furniture\nMoving (success improves from 1% to 25%) to football gameplay (game score\nimproves from 0.1 to 0.6). GridToPix even helps to improve the results of\nshaped reward training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}
