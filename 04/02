This paper deals with the study of conformal Ricci solitons\nwithin the framework of warped product manifolds which extends the notion of\nusual Riemannian product manifolds. First, we prove that if a warped product\nmanifold admits conformal Ricci soliton then the base and the fiber also share\nthe same property. In the next section the characterization of conformal Ricci\nsolitons on warped product manifolds in terms of Killing and conformal vector\nfields has been studied. Next, we prove that a warped product manifold\nadmitting conformal Ricci soliton with concurrent potential vector field is\nRicci flat. Finally, an application of conformal Ricci soliton on a class of\nwarped product spacetimes namely, generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes has\nbeen discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 16:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

A natural problem that arises is to determine under what conditions\nthese dimensions take each of the two possible values. In this paper for each\nof these two metric dimensions we characterize three graph configurations and\nprove that it takes the greater of the two possible values if and only if the\ngraph contains at least one of these configurations.

Despite the growing\ninterest, many fundamental questions related to the mechanisms controlling the\nappearance and stability of ferroelectric topological structures remain open.\nIn this context, ferroelectric nanoparticles provide a flexible playground for\nsuch investigations. Here, we present a theoretical study of ferroelectric\npolar textures in a cylindrical core-shell nanoparticle. The calculations\nreveal a chiral polarization structure containing two oppositely oriented\ndiffuse axial domains located near the cylinder ends, separated by a region\nwith a zero-axial polarization. We name this polarization configuration\n\"flexon\" to underline the flexoelectric nature of its axial polarization.\nAnalytical calculations and numerical simulation results show that the flexon's\nchirality can be switched by reversing the sign of the flexoelectric\ncoefficient. Furthermore, the anisotropy of the flexoelectric coupling is found\nto critically influence the polarization texture and domain morphology. The\nflexon rounded shape, combined with its distinct chiral properties and the\nlocalization nature near the surface, are reminiscent of Chiral Bobber\nstructures in magnetism. In the azimuthal plane, the flexon displays the\npolarization state of a vortex with an axially polarized core region, i.e., a\nmeron. The flexoelectric effect, which couples the electric polarization and\nelastic strain gradients, plays a determining role in the stabilization of\nthese chiral states. We discuss similarities between this interaction and the\nrecently predicted ferroelectric Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to\nchiral polarization states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 16:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 16:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Those phase diagrams have been\ncomputed using a variety of standard techniques, which suffer from physical and\ncomputational limitations. Here, we present an efficient and accurate method\nthat overcomes the drawbacks of previously used approaches. In particular,\nfinite-size effects are avoided as each phase is calculated separately; the\nplasma electrons and volume changes are explicitly taken into account; and\narbitrary analytic fits to simulation data are avoided. Furthermore, no\nsimulations at uninteresting state conditions, i.e., away from the phase\ncoexistence curves, are required, which improves the efficiency of the\ntechnique. The method consists of an adaptation of the so-called Gibbs-Duhem\nintegration approach to electron-ion plasmas, where the coexistence curve is\ndetermined by direct numerical integration of its underlying Clapeyron\nequation. The thermodynamics properties of the coexisting phases are evaluated\nseparately using Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric semi-grand canonical\nensemble. We describe this Monte Carlo-based Clapeyron integration method,\nincluding its basic principles, our extension to electron-ion plasmas, and our\nnumerical implementation. We illustrate its applicability and benefits with the\ncalculation of the melting curve of dense C/O plasmas under conditions relevant\nfor white dwarf cores and provide analytic fits to implement this new melting\ncurve in white dwarf models. While this work focuses on the liquid-solid phase\nboundary of dense two-component plasmas, a wider range of physical systems and\nphase boundaries are within the scope of the Clapeyron integration method,\nwhich had until now only been applied to simple model systems of neutral\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 16:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

In\nthis work we argue for another entry in the dictionary between Euclidean\ngravity and black hole physics, namely that Euclidean wormholes describe a\ncoarse-grained approximation to the energy level statistics of black hole\nmicrostates. To do so we use the method of constrained instantons to obtain an\nintegral representation of wormhole amplitudes in Einstein gravity and in\nfull-fledged AdS/CFT. These amplitudes are non-perturbative corrections to the\ntwo-boundary problem in AdS quantum gravity. The full amplitude is likely UV\nsensitive, dominated by small wormholes, but we show it admits an integral\ntransformation with a macroscopic, weakly curved saddle-point approximation.\nThe saddle is the \"double cone\" geometry of Saad, Shenker, and Stanford, with\nfixed moduli. In the boundary description this saddle appears to dominate a\nsmeared version of the connected two-point function of the black hole density\nof states, and suggests level repulsion in the microstate spectrum.

The\napproach exponentially suppresses errors and ultimately allows one to measure\nexpectation values in the pure state as the dominant eigenvector of the noisy\nquantum state. Interestingly this dominant eigenvector is, however, different\nthan the ideal computational state and it is the aim of the present work to\ncomprehensively explore the following fundamental question: how significantly\ndifferent are these two pure states?

As such, the present work rigorously establishes that in practically\nrelevant scenarios the coherent mismatch is exponentially less severe than the\nincoherent decay of the fidelity -- where the latter can be suppressed\nexponentially via the ESD/VD technique.

Measuring fidelity is based on statistical distances of\nlower-dimensional marginal distributions, which provide a model-free and\neasy-to-communicate empirical metric for the representativeness of a synthetic\ndataset.

Standard approaches rely on an eigendecomposition of a\nsmoothed covariance surface in order to extract the orthonormal functions\nrepresenting the major modes of variation.

In this article, we develop a Bayesian\napproach, which aims to determine the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve decomposition directly\nwithout the need to smooth and estimate a covariance surface. More\nspecifically, we develop a variational Bayesian algorithm via message passing\nover a factor graph, which is more commonly referred to as variational message\npassing. Message passing algorithms are a powerful tool for compartmentalizing\nthe algebra and coding required for inference in hierarchical statistical\nmodels. Recently, there has been much focus on formulating variational\ninference algorithms in the message passing framework because it removes the\nneed for rederiving approximate posterior density functions if there is a\nchange to the model. Instead, model changes are handled by changing specific\ncomputational units, known as fragments, within the factor graph.

Using capacitance\nmeasurements on graphite-gated van der Waals heterostructures, we find a\ncascade of density- and electronic displacement field tuned phase transitions\nmarked by negative electronic compressibility. The transitions define the\nboundaries between phases where quantum oscillations have either four-fold,\ntwo-fold, or one-fold degeneracy, associated with a spin and valley degenerate\nnormal metal, spin-polarized `half-metal', and spin and valley polarized\n`quarter metal', respectively. For electron doping, the salient features are\nwell captured by a phenomenological Stoner model with a valley-anisotropic\nHund's coupling, likely arising from interactions at the lattice scale.

Therefore, in this work we\npresent a method to release a graph's algebraic connectivity under a\ngraph-theoretic form of differential privacy, called edge differential privacy.\nEdge differential privacy obfuscates differences among graphs' edge sets and\nthus conceals the absence or presence of sensitive connections therein. We\nprovide privacy with bounded Laplace noise, which improves accuracy relative to\nconventional unbounded noise. The private algebraic connectivity values are\nanalytically shown to provide accurate estimates of consensus convergence\nrates, as well as accurate bounds on the diameter of a graph and the mean\ndistance between its nodes.

Our theoretical analysis shows that only\npromoting the orthogonality between gradients of base models is not enough to\nensure low transferability; in the meantime, the model smoothness is an\nimportant factor to control the transferability. We also provide the lower and\nupper bounds of adversarial transferability under certain conditions. Inspired\nby our theoretical analysis, we propose an effective Transferability Reduced\nSmooth(TRS) ensemble training strategy to train a robust ensemble with low\ntransferability by enforcing both gradient orthogonality and model smoothness\nbetween base models. We conduct extensive experiments on TRS and compare with 6\nstate-of-the-art ensemble baselines against 8 whitebox attacks on different\ndatasets, demonstrating that the proposed TRS outperforms all baselines\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 17:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 06:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, the effect of mergers on magnetic fields is still poorly\nunderstood. We use thermal polarized emission observations to trace the\nmagnetic fields in the molecular disk of the nearest radio active galaxy,\nCentaurus A, which is thought to be the remnant of a merger. Here, we detect\nthat the magnetic field orientations in the plane of the sky are tightly\nfollowing the $\\sim3.0$ kpc-scale molecular warped disk. Our simple regular\nlarge-scale axisymmetric spiral magnetic field model can explain, to some\nextent, the averaged magnetic field orientations across the disk projected on\nthe sky. Our observations also suggest the presence of small-scale turbulent\nfields, whose relative strength increases with velocity dispersion and column\ndensity. These results have strong implications for understanding the\ngeneration and role of magnetic fields in the formation of galaxies across\ncosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In this paper, we propose a multi-rate attention\narchitecture that breaks the latency and RTF bottlenecks by computing a compact\nrepresentation during encoding and recurrently generating the attention vector\nin a streaming manner during decoding. The proposed architecture achieves high\naudio quality (MOS of 4.31 compared to groundtruth 4.48), low latency, and low\nRTF at the same time. Meanwhile, both latency and RTF of the proposed system\nstay constant regardless of input lengths, making it ideal for real-time\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 18:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In graphene-based spin valves this is usually\nachieved by injection of spin-polarized electrons from ferromagnetic contacts\nvia a tunnel barrier, with Al2O3 and MgO used most widely as barrier materials.\nHowever, the requirement to make these barriers sufficiently thin often leads\nto pinholes and low contact resistances which in turn results in low spin\ninjection efficiencies, typically 5% at room temperature, due to the so-called\nresistance mismatch problem. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach to\nfabricate ultra-thin tunnel barrier contacts to graphene. We show that\nlaser-assisted chemical functionalization of graphene with sp3-bonded phenyl\ngroups effectively provides a seed layer for growth of ultrathin Al2O3 films,\nensuring smooth, high quality tunnel barriers and an enhanced spin injection\nefficiency. Importantly, the effect of functionalization on spin transport in\nthe graphene channel itself is relatively weak, so that the enhanced spin\ninjection dominates and leads to an order of magnitude increase in spin\nsignals. Furthermore, spatial control of functionalization using a focused\nlaser beam and lithographic techniques can in principle be used to limit\nfunctionalization to contact areas only, further reducing the effect on the\ngraphene channel.

The emerging mobile electric-vehicle-to-electric-vehicle (mE2)\ncharging technology, which allows an EV with the extra battery to charge the\nother EV on the move, offers a promising solution. Even though the physical\nfeasibility of this new technology has been confirmed, we still face many\noperation problems. For example, how can we efficiently pair and route an\nelectricity provider (EP) to a demand (ED) without introducing an extra detour?\nMotivated by this view, this study develops a Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS)\nplatform, which seeks to dispatches the commercial EPs to serve the EDs, for\ncultivating this emerging charging service towards the low EV penetration\nenvironment. Mathematically, the CaaS platform is modeled as a vehicle routing\nproblem (i.e., mE2-VRP), which optimally dispatches the EPs to approach and\nserve the EDs on the move while minimizing the EP fleet size and fulfilling all\nservice requests. To adapt the CaaS platform to the online application in\npractice, we develop the Clustering-aided Clarke and Wright Savings (CCWS)\nalgorithm to efficiently decompose and then solve the large-scale mE2-VRP by\nparallel computing. Our numerical experiments built upon citywide (Chicago) and\nstatewide (Florida) found that the CCWS algorithm outperforms existing\ncommercial solvers, and it enables us to investigate the performance of the\nCaaS platform under a realistic large-scale setup in a city or state. The CaaS\nperforms better in low EV penetration markets while traffic congestion is mild\nand EDs require energy earlier. We can improve the performance by developing\nproper pricing strategies according to the EDs' energy requests and trip\nlengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 19:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Many verification, synthesis, programming,\nand debugging tools rely on formal semantics of instruction sets, but different\ntools can use semantics in rather different ways. As a result, a central\nchallenge for that community is how semantics should be written and what\ntechniques should be used to connect them to new use cases. The best-known work\napplying single semantics across quite-different tools relies on\ndomain-specific languages like Sail, where the language and its translation\ntools are specialized to the realm of instruction sets. We decided to explore a\ndifferent approach, with semantics written in a carefully chosen subset of\nHaskell. This style does not depend on any new language translators, relying\ninstead on parameterization of semantics over type-class instances. As a\nresult, a semantics can be a first-class object within a logic, and application\nof a semantics for a new kind of tool can be a first-class operation in the\nlogic, allowing sharing of theorems across applications. Our case study is for\nthe open RISC-V instruction-set family, and we have used a single core\nsemantics to support testing, interactive proof, and model checking of both\nsoftware and hardware.

We evaluate the performance of NC-POPS by comparing between\nvarious noncoplanar and coplanar configurations. To evaluate plan quality, we\ncompute the homogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), and dose-volume\nhistogram (DVH) statistics for various organs-at-risk (OARs).

Unitarization is the problem of\ntaking $k$ input quantum circuits that produce orthogonal states from the all\n$0$ state, and create an output circuit implementing a unitary with its first\n$k$ columns as those states. That is, the output circuit takes the $k$th\ncomputational basis state to the state prepared by the $k$th input circuit. We\nallow the output circuit to use ancilla qubits initialized to $0$. But ancilla\nqubits must always be returned to $0$ for any input. The input circuits may use\nancilla qubits, but we are only guaranteed the they return ancilla qubits to\n$0$ on the all $0$ input.\n  The unitarization problem seems hard if the output states are neither\northogonal to or in the span of the computational basis states that need to map\nto them. In this work, we approximately solve this problem in the case where\ninput circuits are given as black box oracles by probably finding an\napproximate basis for our states.

The idea is to exploit the label hierarchy\n(e.g., the WordNet ontology) and consider graph distances as a proxy for\nmistake severity. Surprisingly, on examining mistake-severity distributions of\nthe top-1 prediction, we find that current state-of-the-art hierarchy-aware\ndeep classifiers do not always show practical improvement over the standard\ncross-entropy baseline in making better mistakes. The reason for the reduction\nin average mistake-severity can be attributed to the increase in low-severity\nmistakes, which may also explain the noticeable drop in their accuracy. To this\nend, we use the classical Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework for\nhierarchy-aware classification. Given a cost matrix and a reliable estimate of\nlikelihoods (obtained from a trained network), CRM simply amends mistakes at\ninference time; it needs no extra hyperparameters and requires adding just a\nfew lines of code to the standard cross-entropy baseline. It significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art and consistently obtains large reductions in\nthe average hierarchical distance of top-$k$ predictions across datasets, with\nvery little loss in accuracy.

For this initial investigation we restrict to plane-symmetric\nconfigurations of a conformal fluid in Minkowski spacetime. We consider\nevolution of three classes of initial data: a smooth (initially) stationary\nconcentration of energy, a standard shock tube setup, and a smooth shockwave\nsetup. We compare these solutions to those obtained with the\nMuller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) formalism, variants of which are the common tools\nused to model relativistic, viscous fluids. We find that for the two smooth\ninitial data cases, simple finite difference methods are adequate to obtain\nstable, convergent solutions to the BDNK equations. For low viscosity, the MIS\nand BDNK evolutions show good agreement. At high viscosity the solutions begin\nto differ in regions with large gradients, and there the BDNK solutions can (as\nexpected) exhibit violation of the weak energy condition. This behavior is\ntransient, and the solutions evolve toward a hydrodynamic regime in a way\nreminiscent of an approach to a universal attractor. For the shockwave problem,\nwe give evidence that if a hydrodynamic frame is chosen so that the maximum\ncharacteristic speed of the BDNK system is the speed of light (or larger),\narbitrarily strong shockwaves are smoothly resolved. Regarding the shock tube\nproblem, it is unclear whether discontinuous initial data is mathematically\nwell-posed for the BDNK system, even in a weak sense. Nevertheless we attempt\nnumerical solution, and then need to treat the perfect fluid terms using\nhigh-resolution shock-capturing methods.

A comprehensive search\nof 353 huge phage genomes revealed that up to 9% of the proteins have ATPase\ndomains. For example, ATPase proteins constitute ~3% of the genomes of Lak\nphages with ~550 kbp genomes that occur in the microbiomes of humans and other\nanimals. Statistical analysis shows the number of ATPase proteins increases\nlinearly with genome length, consistent with a large sink for host ATP during\nreplication of megaphages. Using metagenomic data from diverse environments, we\nfound 505 mobilome proteins with ATPase domains fused to diverse functional\ndomains.

However, many outstanding\nquestions remain unanswered regarding the atomic-scale structure and dynamic\nmeta-stability (i.e., fluxional behavior) of the interface $\\textit{during\ncatalysis}$. Here, we employ aberration-corrected $\\textit{operando}$ electron\nmicroscopy to visualize the structural dynamics occurring at and near\nPt/CeO$_{2}$ interfaces during CO oxidation. Finite element simulations are\nperformed to develop a reaction rate analysis wherein the atomic-level\nstructural observations are directly correlated with the catalyst's turnover\nfrequency for CO oxidation. We show that the increasing frequency of catalytic\nturnover correlates with dynamic fluxional behavior that (a) destablizes the\nsupported Pt particle, (b) marks an enhanced rate of oxygen vacancy creation\nand annihilation, and (c) leads to increased strain and reduction in the\nsurface of the CeO$_{2}$ support.

Our results show that the fundamental\nlimits of robust control have corresponding implications for the\nsample-efficiency and performance of learned perception-based controllers.\nVisit our project website https://jxu.ai/rl-vs-control-web for more\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 00:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In this paper, we first formalize the process of GPU\nperformance analysis and characterize the design requirements of visualizing\nexecution traces based on a survey study and interviews with GPU hardware\ndesigners. We contribute data and task abstraction for GPU performance\nanalysis. Based on our task analysis, we propose Daisen, a framework that\nsupports data collection from GPU simulators and provides visualization of the\nsimulator-generated GPU execution traces. Daisen features a data abstraction\nand trace format that can record simulator-generated GPU execution traces.\nDaisen also includes a web-based visualization tool that helps GPU hardware\ndesigners examine GPU execution traces, identify performance bottlenecks, and\nverify performance improvement. Our qualitative evaluation with GPU hardware\ndesigners demonstrates that the design of Daisen reflects the typical workflow\nof GPU hardware designers.

The seminal work\nof Eyster and Rabin [Econometrica'05] introduced a behavioral model aimed to\nexplain this observed anomaly. We term agents who display this bias \"cursed\nagents\". We adopt their model in the interdependent value setting, and aim to\ndevise mechanisms that prevent the cursed agents from obtaining negative\nutility. We design mechanisms that are cursed ex-post IC, that is, incentivize\nagents to bid their true signal even though they are cursed, while ensuring\nthat the outcome is individually rational -- the price the agents pay is no\nmore than the agents' true value.\n  Since the agents might over-estimate the good's value, such mechanisms might\nrequire the seller to make positive transfers to the agents to prevent agents\nfrom over-paying. For revenue maximization, we give the optimal deterministic\nand anonymous mechanism. For welfare maximization, we require ex-post budget\nbalance (EPBB), as positive transfers might lead to negative revenue. We\npropose a masking operation that takes any deterministic mechanism, and imposes\nthat the seller would not make positive transfers, enforcing EPBB. We show that\nin typical settings, EPBB implies that the mechanism cannot make any positive\ntransfers, implying that applying the masking operation on the fully efficient\nmechanism results in a socially optimal EPBB mechanism. This further implies\nthat if the valuation function is the maximum of agents' signals, the optimal\nEPBB mechanism obtains zero welfare. In contrast, we show that for sum-concave\nvaluations, which include weighted-sum valuations and l_p-norms, the welfare\noptimal EPBB mechanism obtains half of the optimal welfare as the number of\nagents grows large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 01:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 01:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 02:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 22:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

The presence of these grating sidelobes has\nmade calibration and image processing for 300 MHz MWA observations difficult.\nThis work presents a new calibration and imaging strategy which employs\nexisting techniques to process two example 300 MHz MWA observations.\nObservations are initially calibrated using a new 300 MHz sky-model which has\nbeen interpolated from low frequency and high frequency all-sky surveys. Using\nthis 300 MHz model in conjunction with the accurate MWA tile primary beam\nmodel, we perform sky-model calibration for the two example observations.

These\nmethods bring the following two problems. One is the training inconsistency\nbetween adjacent categories of similar sizes, and the other is that the learned\nmodel is lack of discrimination for tail categories which are semantically\nsimilar to some of the head categories. In this paper, we devise a novel\nAdaptive Class Suppression Loss (ACSL) to effectively tackle the above problems\nand improve the detection performance of tail categories. Specifically, we\nintroduce a statistic-free perspective to analyze the long-tail distribution,\nbreaking the limitation of manual grouping. According to this perspective, our\nACSL adjusts the suppression gradients for each sample of each class\nadaptively, ensuring the training consistency and boosting the discrimination\nfor rare categories.

However, previous methods either fail to capture diverse local\nstyles or cannot be generalized to a character with unseen components, e.g.,\nunseen language systems. To mitigate the issues, we propose a novel FFG method,\nnamed Multiple Localized Experts Few-shot Font Generation Network (MX-Font).\nMX-Font extracts multiple style features not explicitly conditioned on\ncomponent labels, but automatically by multiple experts to represent different\nlocal concepts, e.g., left-side sub-glyph.

Most methods use the straight-through estimator\n(STE) to train quantized networks, which avoids a zero-gradient problem by\nreplacing a derivative of a discretizer (i.e., a round function) with that of\nan identity function. Although quantized networks exploiting the STE have shown\ndecent performance, the STE is sub-optimal in that it simply propagates the\nsame gradient without considering discretization errors between inputs and\noutputs of the discretizer. In this paper, we propose an element-wise gradient\nscaling (EWGS), a simple yet effective alternative to the STE, training a\nquantized network better than the STE in terms of stability and accuracy. Given\na gradient of the discretizer output, EWGS adaptively scales up or down each\ngradient element, and uses the scaled gradient as the one for the discretizer\ninput to train quantized networks via backpropagation. The scaling is performed\ndepending on both the sign of each gradient element and an error between the\ncontinuous input and discrete output of the discretizer. We adjust a scaling\nfactor adaptively using Hessian information of a network. We show extensive\nexperimental results on the image classification datasets, including CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet, with diverse network architectures under a wide range of\nbit-width settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 06:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In\nparticular, the complicated diffuse emission associated with the galactic plane\nwas successfully reproduced only from one-week observation data to mimic a\nground truth (GT) generated from a one-year observation. Such ML algorithms can\nbe implemented relatively easily to provide sharper images without various\nassumptions of emission models.

Thus, the\nproposed ML methods are viable not only to improve the image quality of an ASM,\nbut also to detect variable sources, such as AGNs, algorithmically, i.e.,\nwithout human bias.

To predict the future precisely, it is required to capture which\nlong-term motion context (e.g., walking or running) the input motion (e.g., leg\nmovement) belongs to. The bottlenecks arising when dealing with the long-term\nmotion context are: (i) how to predict the long-term motion context naturally\nmatching input sequences with limited dynamics, (ii) how to predict the\nlong-term motion context with high-dimensionality (e.g., complex motion). To\naddress the issues, we propose novel motion context-aware video prediction. To\nsolve the bottleneck (i), we introduce a long-term motion context memory\n(LMC-Memory) with memory alignment learning. The proposed memory alignment\nlearning enables to store long-term motion contexts into the memory and to\nmatch them with sequences including limited dynamics. As a result, the\nlong-term context can be recalled from the limited input sequence.

Although this is well studied in\nunbounded domains, the analysis in biologically relevant environments such as\nconfinements is scarce. In this work, we study the motion of a Janus sphere in\nweak confinement. The particle is placed at an arbitrary location, with an\narbitrary orientation between the two walls. Using the method of reflections,\nwe study the effect of confining planar boundaries on the phoretic and\nhydrodynamic interactions, and their consequence on the Janus particle\ndynamics. The dynamical trajectories are analyzed using phase diagrams for\ndifferent surface coverage of activity and solute-particle interactions. In\naddition to near wall states such as `sliding' and `hovering', we demonstrate\nthat accounting for two planar boundaries reveals two new states:\nchannel-spanning oscillations and damped oscillations around the centerline,\nwhich were characterized as `scattering' or `reflection' by earlier analyses on\nsingle-wall interactions. Using phase diagrams, we highlight the differences in\ninert-facing and active-facing Janus particles. We also compare the dynamics of\nJanus particles with squirmers for contrasting the chemical interactions with\nhydrodynamic effects. Insights from the current work suggest that biological\nand artificial swimmers sense their surroundings through long-ranged\ninteractions, that can be modified by altering the surface properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 08:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 14:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 09:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Previous literature has developed bi-level models of the work\nstarting time choice considering both labor output and urban mobility. Yet,\nmost analytical studies assume the single trip purpose in peak hours (to work)\nonly and do not consider the household travels (daycare drop-off/pick-up). In\nfact, as one of the main reasons to adopt flextime, household travel plays an\ninfluential role in travelers' decision making on work schedule selection. On\nthis account, we incorporate household travels into the work starting time\nchoice model in this study. Both short-run travel behaviours and long-run work\nstart time selection of heterogenous commuters are examined under agglomeration\neconomies. If flextime is not flexible enough, commuters tend to agglomerate in\nwork schedule choice at long-run equilibrium. Further, we analyze optimal\nschedule choices with two system performance indicators. For total commuting\ncost, it is found that the rigid school schedule for households may impede the\nbenefits of flextime in commuting cost saving. In terms of total net benefit,\nwhile work schedule agglomeration of all commuters leads to the maximum in some\ncases, the polarized agglomeration of the two heterogenous groups can never\nachieve the optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 08:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

NFR increase the network performance, however, at the cost\nof being unfair towards certain contents when compared to the standard\nrecommendations. This unfairness is a side effect of NFR that has not been\nstudied in literature. Nevertheless, retaining fairness among contents is a key\noperational requirement for content providers. This paper is the first to study\nthe fairness in NFR, and design fair-NFR. Specifically, we use a set of metrics\nthat capture different notions of fairness, and study the unfairness created by\nexisting NFR schemes. Our analysis reveals that NFR can be significantly\nunfair. We identify an inherent trade-off between the network gains achieved by\nNFR and the resulting unfairness, and derive bounds for this trade-off. We show\nthat existing NFR schemes frequently operate far from the bounds, i.e., there\nis room for improvement. To this end, we formulate the design of Fair-NFR\n(i.e., NFR with fairness guarantees compared to the baseline recommendations)\nas a linear optimization problem. Our results show that the Fair-NFR can\nachieve high network gains (similar to non-fair-NFR) with little unfairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 09:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Earlier methods naively\ntrained a single CNN with many pairs of clean-noisy images. However, the\nconditional distribution of the clean image given a noisy one is too\ncomplicated and diverse, so that a single CNN cannot well learn such\ndistributions. Therefore, there have also been some methods that exploit\nadditional noise level parameters or train a separate CNN for a specific noise\nlevel parameter. These methods separate the original problem into easier\nsub-problems and thus have shown improved performance than the naively trained\nCNN. In this step, we raise two questions. The first one is whether it is an\noptimal approach to relate the conditional distribution only to noise level\nparameters. The second is what if we do not have noise level information, such\nas in a real-world scenario. To answer the questions and provide a better\nsolution, we propose a novel Bayesian framework based on the variational\napproximation of objective functions. This enables us to separate the\ncomplicated target distribution into simpler sub-distributions.

This procedure was then\nused to show that unique models follow for each order, namely classical\nelectrodynamics for $N = M = 1$ and linearized Gauss-Bonnet gravity for $N = M\n= 2$. In this article, the nature of the connection between these two well\nexplored physical models is further investigated by means of an additional\ncommon property; a complete dual formulation. First we give a review of\nGauss-Bonnet gravity and the dual formulation of classical electrodynamics. The\ndual formulation of linearized Gauss-Bonnet gravity is then developed. It is\nshown that the dual formulation of linearized Gauss-Bonnet gravity is analogous\nto the homogenous half of Maxwell's theory; both have equations of motion\ncorresponding to the (second) Bianchi identity, built from the dual form of\ntheir respective field strength tensors. In order to have a dually symmetric\ncounterpart analogous to the non-homogenous half of Maxwell's theory, the first\ninvariant derived from the procedure in $N = M = 2$ can be introduced. The\ncomplete gauge invariance of a model with respect to Noether's first theorem,\nand not just the equation of motion, is a necessary condition for this dual\nformulation. We show that this result can be generalized to the higher spin\ngauge theories, where the spin-$n$ curvature tensors for all $N = M = n$ are\nthe field strength tensors for each $n$. These completely gauge invariant\nmodels correspond to the Maxwell-like higher spin gauge theories whose\nequations of motion have been well explored in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 11:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Such exoplanets are likely to\nundergo planetary migration through magnetic and tidal interactions. We aim to\nfollow the orbital evolution of a planet along the structural and rotational\nevolution of its host star by taking into account simultaneously tidal and\nmagnetic torques, in order to explain some properties of the distribution of\nobserved close-in planets. We rely on a numerical model of a coplanar circular\nstar-planet system taking into account stellar structural changes, wind braking\nand star-planet interactions, called ESPEM. We browse the parameter space of\nstar-planet systems' configurations and assess the relative influence of\nmagnetic and tidal torques on secular evolution. We then synthesize star-planet\npopulations and confront their distribution in orbital and stellar rotation\nperiods to Kepler satellite data. First, we find that after the dissipation of\nthe protoplanetary disk, both types of interactions can dominate secular\nevolution depending on the initial configuration of the system and the\nevolutionary phase considered. Moreover, different populations of star-planet\nsystems emerge from the combined action of both kinds of interactions,\naccording to the evolutionary phase during which the planet migrates\nsignificantly. This may affect significantly the detectability of star-planet\nsystems as well as the validity of gyrochonology. All in all, star-planet\ninteractions significantly impact the global distribution in orbital periods\nduring the main sequence, while the global distribution in stellar rotation\nperiods is marginally affected. More precisely, star-planet magnetic\ninteractions significantly affect the distribution of super-Earths around\nslowly rotating stars, while tidal effects are found to shape the distribution\nof giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 12:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

For example in\nrobotics, providing kinesthetic demonstrations on a robotic manipulator\nrequires the teacher to control multiple degrees of freedom at once. The\ndifficulty of requiring optimal state action demonstrations limits the space of\nproblems where the teacher can provide quality feedback. As an alternative to\nstate action demonstrations, the teacher can provide corrective feedback such\nas their preferences or rewards. Prior work has created algorithms designed to\nlearn from specific types of noisy feedback, but across teachers and tasks\ndifferent forms of feedback may be required. Instead we propose that in order\nto learn from a diversity of scenarios we need to learn from a variety of\nfeedback. To learn from a variety of feedback we make the following insight:\nthe teacher's cost function is latent and we can model a stream of feedback as\na stream of loss functions. We then use any online learning algorithm to\nminimize the sum of these losses. With this insight we can learn from a\ndiversity of feedback that is weakly correlated with the teacher's true cost\nfunction. We unify prior work into a general corrective feedback meta-algorithm\nand show that regardless of feedback we can obtain the same regret bounds.

Method:\nWe conduct experiments with five base learners, optimizing their hyper\nparameters, on 13 datasets from PROMISE repository in order to compare the\nperformance of LSH with benchmark instance selection methods NN-Filter and GIS.\nResults: The statistical tests show six distinct groups for F-measure\nperformance.

In fact, for precision performance only three\nsignificantly distinct groups are detected by the tests where the top group is\ncomprised of NN-Filter variants only. Recall wise, 16 different groups are\nidentified where the top three groups contain only LSH methods, four of the\nnext six are GIS only and the bottom five contain only NN-Filter. Finally,\nNN-Filter benchmarks never outperform the LSH counterparts with the same base\nlearner, tuned or non-tuned. Further, they never even belong to the same rank\ngroup, meaning that LSH is always significantly better than NN-Filter with the\nsame learner and settings.

Statistically easy to learn linear\nsystem classes have sample complexity that is polynomial with the system\ndimension. Most prior research in the finite sample regime falls in this\ncategory, focusing on systems that are directly excited by process noise.\nStatistically hard to learn linear system classes have worst-case sample\ncomplexity that is at least exponential with the system dimension, regardless\nof the identification algorithm. Using tools from minimax theory, we show that\nclasses of linear systems can be hard to learn. Such classes include, for\nexample, under-actuated or under-excited systems with weak coupling among the\nstates. Having classified some systems as easy or hard to learn, a natural\nquestion arises as to what system properties fundamentally affect the hardness\nof system identifiability. Towards this direction, we characterize how the\ncontrollability index of linear systems affects the sample complexity of\nidentification. More specifically, we show that the sample complexity of\nrobustly controllable linear systems is upper bounded by an exponential\nfunction of the controllability index. This implies that identification is easy\nfor classes of linear systems with small controllability index and potentially\nhard if the controllability index is large.

Henri Poincar\\'e first made this connection by tracking\nconsecutive iterations of the continuous flow with a lower-dimensional,\ntransverse subspace. The mapping that iterates the dynamics through consecutive\nintersections of the flow with the subspace is now referred to as a Poincar\\'e\nmap, and it is the primary method available for interpreting and classifying\nchaotic dynamics. Unfortunately, in all but the simplest systems, an explicit\nform for such a mapping remains outstanding. This work proposes a method for\nobtaining explicit Poincar\\'e mappings by using deep learning to construct an\ninvertible coordinate transformation into a conjugate representation where the\ndynamics are governed by a relatively simple chaotic mapping. The invertible\nchange of variable is based on an autoencoder, which allows for dimensionality\nreduction, and has the advantage of classifying chaotic systems using the\nequivalence relation of topological conjugacies. Indeed, the enforcement of\ntopological conjugacies is the critical neural network regularization for\nlearning the coordinate and dynamics pairing.

A general polygonal complex is\na topological structure composed of polygons that are glued together along\ncertain edges. A polygonal complex is flat if none of its edges belong to more\nthan two polygons. A connected flat polygonal complex determines an orientable\nor nonorientable surface, possibly with boundary. A CCHC is then a connected\nflat polygonal complex all of whose polygons are hexagons and each of whose\nvertices belongs to at most two hexagonal faces. We prove that all CCHC are\nKekulean and give formulas for counting the perfect matchings in a series of\nexamples based on expansion of cubic graphs in which the edges are replaced by\nlinear polyacenes of equal length. As a preliminary assessment of the likely\nstability of molecules with CCHC structure, all-electron quantum chemical\ncalculations are applied to molecular structures based on several CCHC, using\neither linear or kinked unbranched catafused polyacenes as the expansion motif.\nThe systems examined all have closed shells according to H\\\"uckel theory and\nall correspond to minima on the potential surface, thus passing the most basic\ntest for plausibility as a chemical species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 08:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 16:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The analysis also constrains the omega\nvalue i.e., $\\Omega _{m_{0}}\\leq 0.269$ for the smooth evolution of the scalar\nfield EoS parameter. It is seen that energy density is higher for the effective\nenergy density of the matter field than energy density in the presence of a\nscalar field.

The swept rule is a technique\ndesigned to minimize these costs by obtaining a solution to unsteady equations\nat as many possible spatial locations and times prior to communicating. In this\nstudy, we implemented and tested the swept rule for solving two-dimensional\nproblems on heterogeneous computing systems across two distinct systems. Our\nsolver showed a speedup range of 0.22-2.71 for the heat diffusion equation and\n0.52-1.46 for the compressible Euler equations. We can conclude from this study\nthat the swept rule offers both potential for speedups and slowdowns and that\ncare should be taken when designing such a solver to maximize benefits.

We propose a solution\nvia Deep Delay Loop Reservoir Computing (DLR), a processing architecture that\nsupports general machine learning algorithms on compact mobile devices by\nleveraging delay-loop reservoir computing in combination with innovative\nelectrooptical hardware. With both digital and photonic realizations of our\ndesign of the loops, DLR delivers reductions in form factor, hardware\ncomplexity and latency, compared to the State-of-the-Art (SoA). The main impact\nof the reservoir is to project the input data into a higher dimensional space\nof reservoir state vectors in order to linearly separate the input classes.\nOnce the classes are well separated, traditionally complex, power-hungry\nclassification models are no longer needed for the learning process. Yet, even\nwith simple classifiers based on Ridge regression (RR), the complexity grows at\nleast quadratically with the input size. Hence, the hardware reduction required\nfor training on compact devices is in contradiction with the large dimension of\nstate vectors. DLR employs a RR-based classifier to exceed the SoA accuracy,\nwhile further reducing power consumption by leveraging the architecture of\nparallel (split) loops. We present DLR architectures composed of multiple\nsmaller loops whose state vectors are linearly combined to create a lower\ndimensional input into Ridge regression.
