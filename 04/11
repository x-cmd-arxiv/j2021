Our approach represents a scalar field as a\nlearned function, wherein a neural network maps a point in the domain to an\noutput scalar value. By setting the number of weights of the neural network to\nbe smaller than the input size, we achieve compressed representations of scalar\nfields, thus framing compression as a type of function approximation. Combined\nwith carefully quantizing network weights, we show that this approach yields\nhighly compact representations that outperform state-of-the-art volume\ncompression approaches. The conceptual simplicity of our approach enables a\nnumber of benefits, such as support for time-varying scalar fields, optimizing\nto preserve spatial gradients, and random-access field evaluation. We study the\nimpact of network design choices on compression performance, highlighting how\nsimple network architectures are effective for a broad range of volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 15:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

For geometric Brownian motion time changed with an inverse\nsubordinator, in the more general case when the subordinator's Laplace exponent\nis a special Bernstein function, we derive a time-fractional generalization of\nthe equation of Black and Scholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 17:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 14:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 11:38:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 16:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

However, the real-time energy management of\nmicrogrids with battery ESS is challenging in two aspects: 1) the evolution\nprocess of battery energy level is across-time coupled; 2) uncertainties\nunavoidably arise in the forecasting process for renewable generation. In this\npaper, a tube-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is innovatively\nproposed in accommodating the real-time energy management of microgrids with\nbattery ESS. Firstly, a real-time operation model of battery, including the\ndegradation cost and time-aware SoC range, is proposed for the battery ESS. In\nparticular, the battery feature shallower-cheaper is depicted and the terminal\nSoC requirement is achieved. Secondly, two cascaded MPC controllers are\ndesigned in the proposed tube-based MPC, in which reference trajectories are\ngenerated by the nominal MPC without uncertainties, and then the ancillary MPC\nsteers the actual trajectories to the nominal ones upon the realization of\nuncertainties. Specifically, in this paper, the battery SoC is viewed as the\nstate variable of the system, while the generator power output and exchange\npower with the utility are seen as control variables. Lastly, numerous case\nstudies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including both\nthe low and high penetration level of renewables. Additional Monte Carlo\nsimulations of consecutive 365 days show that the competitive ratio of the\nproposed approach is excellently below 1.10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 17:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

A blog, news article, or technical note is considered a relatively\nlong text since the reader aims to learn the subject based on keywords or\ntopics. Our approach consists of a combination of two models: graph centrality\nfeatures and textural features. The proposed method has been used to extract\nthe best keyword among the candidate keywords with an optimal combination of\ngraph centralities, such as degree, betweenness, eigenvector, closeness\ncentrality and etc, and textural, such as Casing, Term position, Term frequency\nnormalization, Term different sentence, Part Of Speech tagging.

In\nthis study the uncertainty in surface geometry is separated into two spatial\ncomponents; global error that affects the absolute position of the surface, and\nlocal error that varies from surface point to surface point. The global error\ncomponent is caused by inaccuracy in the satellite imaging process, mainly due\nto uncertainty in the satellite position and orientation (pose) during image\ncollection. A key result of the investigation is a new algorithm for\ndetermining the absolute geoposition of the DSM that takes into account the\npose covariance of each satellite during image collection. This covariance\ninformation is used to weigh the evidence from each image in the computation of\nthe global position of the DSM. The use of covariance information significantly\ndecreases the overall uncertainty in global position. The paper also describes\nan approach to the prediction of local error in the DSM surface.

Here a robot is envisioned as both a\nplacement and external support agent during fabrication - the unfinished\nstructure is supported in such a way that scaffolding is not required. The goal\nof this paper is to present and validate the efficacy of three cooperative\nfabrication approaches using two or three robots, for the scaffold-free\nconstruction of a stable masonry arch from which a medium-span vault is built.\nA simplified numerical method to represent a masonry structure is first\npresented and validated to analyse systems composed of discrete volumetric\nelements.

We address, in particular, the problem of inductive biases and\ntheir impact on the data collection process. To be effective and robust,\nactivity recognition systems must take these biases into account at all levels\nand model them as hyperparameters by which they can be controlled. Whether it\nis a bias related to sensor measurement, transmission protocol, sensor\ndeployment topology, heterogeneity, dynamicity, or stochastic effects, it is\nimportant to understand their substantial impact on the quality of activity\nrecognition models. This study highlights the need to separate the different\ntypes of biases arising in real situations so that machine learning models,\ne.g., adapt to the dynamicity of these environments, resist to sensor failures,\nand follow the evolution of the sensors topology. We propose a metamodeling\nprocess in which the sensor data is structured in layers. The lower layers\nencode the various biases linked to transformations, transmissions, and\ntopology of data. The upper layers encode biases related to the data itself.\nThis way, it becomes easier to model hyperparameters and follow changes in the\ndata acquisition infrastructure.

Such a formulation\ntreats the adversarial and the defending players equally, which is undesirable\nbecause only the defending player contributes to the generalization\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose Stackelberg Adversarial\nRegularization (SALT), which formulates adversarial regularization as a\nStackelberg game. This formulation induces a competition between a leader and a\nfollower, where the follower generates perturbations, and the leader trains the\nmodel subject to the perturbations. Different from conventional approaches, in\nSALT, the leader is in an advantageous position. When the leader moves, it\nrecognizes the strategy of the follower and takes the anticipated follower's\noutcomes into consideration. Such a leader's advantage enables us to improve\nthe model fitting to the unperturbed data. The leader's strategic information\nis captured by the Stackelberg gradient, which is obtained using an unrolling\nalgorithm.

For\ninstance, its uncertainty is characterized by a set of distributions which\ncovers not only classical normal with different variances, but additional\ndistributions typically having non-zero skewness. The $G$-moments of\n$G$-normals are defined by a class of fully nonlinear PDEs called $G$-heat\nequations. To understand $G$-normal in a probabilistic and stochastic way that\nis more friendly to statisticians and practitioners, we introduce a\nsubstructure called semi-$G$-normal, which behaves like a hybrid between normal\nand $G$-normal: it has variance uncertainty but zero-skewness. We will show\nthat the non-zero skewness arises when we impose the $G$-version sequential\nindependence on the semi-$G$-normal. More importantly, we provide a series of\nrepresentations of random vectors with semi-$G$-normal marginals under various\ntypes of independence.

The quantile forecast combination weights are\nestimated by optimizing the quantile loss. In the second step, the Expected\nShortfall (ES) is computed as a weighted average of combined quantiles. The\nquantiles weighting structure for ES forecasting is determined by minimizing a\nstrictly consistent joint VaR and ES loss function of the Fissler-Ziegel class.\nThe proposed framework is applied to six stock market indices and its\nforecasting performance is compared to each individual model in the universe, a\nsimple average approach and a weighted quantile approach.

A\npotential mechanism for such rapid circularization is the diffusive growth of\nthe tidally driven planetary f-mode. Such growth occurs if the f-mode's phase\nat pericenter varies chaotically from one pericenter passage to the next.\nPrevious studies focused on the variation of the orbital period due to tidal\nback-reaction on the orbit as the source of chaos. Here we show that nonlinear\nmode interactions can also be an important source. Specifically, we show that\nnonlinear interactions between a parent f-mode and daughter f-/p-modes induce\nan energy-dependent shift in the oscillation frequency of the parent. This\nfrequency shift varies randomly from orbit to orbit because the parent's energy\nvaries. As a result, the parent's phase at pericenter varies randomly, which we\nfind can trigger it to grow diffusively. We show that the phase shift induced\nby nonlinear mode interactions in fact dominates the shift induced by tidal\nback-reaction and significantly lowers the one-kick energy threshold for\ndiffusive growth by about a factor of 5 compared to the linear theory's\nprediction. Nonlinear interactions could thus enhance the formation rate of hot\nJupiters through the high-eccentricity migration channel and potentially\nmitigate the discrepancy between the observed and predicted occurrence rates\nfor close-in gas giants as compared to those further from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 06:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Many methods have been proposed for EL defect detection, but\nthese methods are still unsatisfactory due to the diversity of the defect and\nbackground. In this paper, we provide a new idea of using generative\nadversarial network (GAN) for defect segmentation. Firstly, the GAN-based\nmethod removes the defect region in the input defective image to get a\ndefect-free image, while keeping the background almost unchanged. Then, the\nsubtracted image is obtained by making difference between the defective input\nimage with the generated defect-free image. Finally, the defect region can be\nsegmented through thresholding the subtracted image. To keep the background\nunchanged before and after image generation, we propose a novel strong identity\nGAN (SIGAN), which adopts a novel strong identity loss to constraint the\nbackground consistency. The SIGAN can be used not only for defect segmentation,\nbut also small-samples defective dataset augmentation. Moreover, we release a\nnew solar cell EL image dataset named as EL-2019, which includes three types of\nimages: crack, finger interruption and defect-free. Experiments on EL-2019\ndataset show that the proposed method achieves 90.34% F-score, which\noutperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of solar cell defects\nsegmentation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 08:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Efficiently solving this problem requires\nusing precise cost models. These models predict whether applying a sequence of\ncode transformations reduces the execution time of the program. Building an\nanalytical cost model to do so is hard in modern x86 architectures due to the\ncomplexity of the microarchitecture. In this paper, we present a novel deep\nlearning based cost model for automatic code optimization. This model was\nintegrated in a search method and implemented in the Tiramisu compiler to\nselect the best code transformations. The input of the proposed model is a set\nof simple features representing the unoptimized code and a sequence of code\ntransformations. The model predicts the speedup expected when the code\ntransformations are applied. Unlike previous models, the proposed one works on\nfull programs and does not rely on any heavy feature engineering. The proposed\nmodel has only 16% of mean absolute percentage error in predicting speedups on\nfull programs. The proposed model enables Tiramisu to automatically find code\ntransformations that match or are better than state-of-the-art compilers\nwithout requiring the same level of heavy feature engineering required by those\ncompilers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 08:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Typically, ML algorithms are exploited to\nclassify/recognize data traffic on the basis of statistical features such as\ninter-arrival times, packets length distribution, mean number of flows, etc.\nDealing with the vast diversity and number of features that typically\ncharacterize data traffic is a hard problem. This results in the following\nissues: i) the presence of so many features leads to lengthy training processes\n(particularly when features are highly correlated), while prediction accuracy\ndoes not proportionally improve; ii) some of the features may introduce bias\nduring the classification process, particularly those that have scarce relation\nwith the data traffic to be classified.

In absence of noise the model is\npurely deterministic and the parameter space splits in two regions: (i) a\nregion with a globally attracting fixed point or a 2-cycle; (ii) a dynamical\ncore region, where the map could exhibit chaotic behavior.

Recently, contrastive learning has shown strong promise in\nleveraging unlabeled natural images to produce highly generalizable and\ndiscriminative features. However, extending its power to the medical image\ndomain is under-explored and highly non-trivial, since medical images are much\nless amendable to data augmentations. In contrast, their prior knowledge, as\nwell as radiomic features, is often crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose an\nend-to-end semi-supervised knowledge-augmented contrastive learning framework,\nthat simultaneously performs disease classification and localization tasks. The\nkey knob of our framework is a unique positive sampling approach tailored for\nthe medical images, by seamlessly integrating radiomic features as a knowledge\naugmentation. Specifically, we first apply an image encoder to classify the\nchest X-rays and to generate the image features. We next leverage Grad-CAM to\nhighlight the crucial (abnormal) regions for chest X-rays (even when\nunannotated), from which we extract radiomic features. The radiomic features\nare then passed through another dedicated encoder to act as the positive sample\nfor the image features generated from the same chest X-ray. In this way, our\nframework constitutes a feedback loop for image and radiomic modality features\nto mutually reinforce each other. Their contrasting yields knowledge-augmented\nrepresentations that are both robust and interpretable. Extensive experiments\non the NIH Chest X-ray dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nexisting baselines in both classification and localization tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 09:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 17:42:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 21:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 02:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 19:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

However, instabilities corresponding to negative pressure\nvalues in the low-energy density regime of the DM-admixed EoS are present, and\nthis effect becomes more prominent as we increase the DM Fermi momentum.

To address these challenges posited\nby the heterogeneity gap and the semantic gap, we propose integrating Shannon\ninformation theory and adversarial learning. In terms of the heterogeneity gap,\nwe integrate modality classification and information entropy maximization\nadversarially. For this purpose, a modality classifier (as a discriminator) is\nbuilt to distinguish the text and image modalities according to their different\nstatistical properties. This discriminator uses its output probabilities to\ncompute Shannon information entropy, which measures the uncertainty of the\nmodality classification it performs. Moreover, feature encoders (as a\ngenerator) project uni-modal features into a commonly shared space and attempt\nto fool the discriminator by maximizing its output information entropy. Thus,\nmaximizing information entropy gradually reduces the distribution discrepancy\nof cross-modal features, thereby achieving a domain confusion state where the\ndiscriminator cannot classify two modalities confidently. To reduce the\nsemantic gap, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and bi-directional triplet loss\nare used to associate the intra- and inter-modality similarity between features\nin the shared space. Furthermore, a regularization term based on KL-divergence\nwith temperature scaling is used to calibrate the biased label classifier\ncaused by the data imbalance issue. Extensive experiments with four deep models\non four benchmarks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 11:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

We aim at\nquantifying the efficiency of the lower-hybrid-drift instability to accelerate\nand/or heat electrons parallel to the ambient magnetic field.

Consequently, the hypermagnetic field and the\nfluid vorticity can directly affect each other, the manifestations of which we\nexplore in three scenarios. In the first scenario, we show that in the presence\nof a small vorticity and a large {\\eta}eR, helicity can be generated and\namplified for an initially strong Bz. The generation of the helical seed is due\nto the chiral vortical effect (CVE) and/or the advection term, while its growth\nis mainly due to the chiral magnetic effect (CME) which leads to the production\nof the baryon asymmetry, as well. The vorticity saturates to a nonzero value\nwhich depends on Bz, even in the presence of the viscosity, due to the\nback-reaction of Bz on the plasma. Increasing the initial vorticity, makes the\nvalues of the helicity, {\\eta}s, and vorticity reach their saturation curves\nsooner, but does not change their final values at the onset of the electroweak\nphase transition. The second scenario is similar to the first except we assume\nthat all initial {\\eta}s are zero. We find that much higher initial vorticity\nis required for the generation process.

After\na proper temporal discretization, the KFBI method is applied to solve the\nresulting homogeneous Neumann boundary value problems with a second-order\naccuracy. According to the potential theory, the boundary integral equations\nreformulated from the boundary value problems can be solved iteratively with\nthe simple Richardson iteration or the Krylov subspace iteration method. During\nthe iteration, the boundary and volume integrals are evaluated by limiting the\nstructured grid-based discrete solutions of the equivalent interface problems\nat quasi-uniform interface nodes without the need to know the analytical\nexpression of Green's functions.

The energy analysis was conducted under three\ndriving conditions: flat road, upslope, and downslope driving to examine the\nenergy consumption, with the energy-saving potential of the in-wheel-motor\ndriven powertrain system systematically explored and discussed. Considering the\nenergy recovery from the regenerative braking, energy consumption and\nregenerated energy were calculated in specific driving cycles based on vehicle\ndynamics and autonomous driving patterns. A case study was conducted using the\nbaseline electric vehicle driving data in West Los Angeles. It was found that\nan in-wheel motor driven autonomous electric vehicle can save up to 17.5% of\nenergy compared with a conventional electric vehicle during the slope driving.\nUsing the efficiency maps of a commercial in-wheel motor, the numerical energy\nmodel and validated results obtained from this study are in line with actual\nsituations, and can be used to support sustainable development of more\nenergy-efficient autonomous electric vehicles in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 16:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Reactors which produce fusion energy have existed since Princeton Large\nTorus Tokamak in 1978, nevertheless in all reactors built up to now, energy\nloss from plasma vastly exceeded fusion energy production. In order for a\nthermonuclear power plant to run, generated fusion energy must significantly\nexceed energy loss by the plasma. There are four processes by which plasma\nlooses energy -- neutron radiation, Bremsstrahlung radiation, synchrotron\nradiation, and heat conduction to the walls. For a deuterium -- tritium\nreactor, 80\\% of energy produced by fusion is lost to neutron radiation, about\n4\\% to 6\\% of fusion energy is lost to Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron\nradiation. For a deuterium -- $^3$He reactor, 5\\% of energy produced by fusion\nis lost to neutron radiation, about 50\\% to 75\\% of fusion energy is lost to\nBremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation. Increasing reactor operating\ntemperature decreases loss to Bremsstrahlung radiation and increases loss to\nsynchrotron radiation. Power loss to conduction is either independent or weakly\ndependent on fusion power production. Up to now, no single theoretical or\nexperimental model can accurately predict conduction power loss. For small\nTokamaks and Stellarators, conduction power loss vastly exceeds power generated\nby fusion. For large and powerful thermonuclear reactors which are yet to be\nbuilt, conduction power loss should be much lower then power produced by\nfusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 15:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 07:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Given time series for the units, a natural way to do this is to\nfind the information flowing from the unit of concern to the rest of the\nnetwork. In this study, we show that this flow can be rigorously derived in the\nsetting of a continuous-time dynamical system. With a linear assumption, a\nmaximum likelihood estimator can be obtained, allowing us to estimate it in an\neasy way. As expected, this \"cumulative information flow\" does not equal to the\nsum of the information flows to other individual units, reflecting the\ncollective phenomenon that a group is not the addition of the individual\nmembers. For the purpose of demonstration and validation, we have examined a\nnetwork made of Stuart-Landau oscillators. Depending on the topology, the\ncomputed information flow may differ. In some situations, the most crucial\nnodes for the network are not the hubs; they may have low degrees, and, if\ndepressed or attacked, will cause the failure of the entire network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 15:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

In\n2004 Gordon Rugg published a paper in which he proposed that this text is\nlikely to be meaningless, and could have been composed by an alternative\napplication of a so-called Cardan Grille, namely by moving a piece of cardboard\nwith holes over a large table of word fragments, and writing down the words\nthat thus appear. This paper caused considerable discussion in the circles of\npeople interested in the Voynich MS text, but it has not found many followers,\neven until today. The present paper takes a closer look at the mechanics of\nthis method. Based on this, a more generic method is proposed, which is\nconsiderably simpler, both to set up and to execute. It is shown that the\nunusual word length distribution of the Voynich MS, which is very close to\nbinomial, could be a consequence of the application of such a method.\nFurthermore, it is argued that this method could not only be used to create\nmeaningless text, but also to encode meaningful text. A first high-level\nanalysis looks at whether such a method could indeed have been applied to\ncreate the Voynich MS text, but this is certainly far from conclusive. The main\naim of this paper is to inspire further research of the Voynich MS text into a\nnew direction that has not yet been explored in great detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 06:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

Despite several advancements, learning discriminative\nidentity-sensitive and viewpoint invariant features for robust Person\nRe-identification is a major challenge owing to the large pose variation of\nhumans. This paper proposes a re-ID pipeline that utilizes the image generation\ncapability of Generative Adversarial Networks combined with pose clustering and\nfeature fusion to achieve pose invariant feature learning. The objective is to\nmodel a given person under different viewpoints and large pose changes and\nextract the most discriminative features from all the appearances. The pose\ntransformational GAN (pt-GAN) module is trained to generate a person's image in\nany given pose. In order to identify the most significant poses for\ndiscriminative feature extraction, a Pose Clustering module is proposed. The\ngiven instance of the person is modelled in varying poses and these features\nare effectively combined through the Feature Fusion Network. The final re-ID\nmodel consisting of these 3 sub-blocks, alleviates the pose dependence in\nperson re-ID. Also, The proposed model is robust to occlusion, scale, rotation\nand illumination, providing a framework for viewpoint invariant feature\nlearning. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN based models\nin 4 benchmark datasets. It also surpasses the state-of-the-art models that\nreport higher re-ID accuracy in terms of improvement over baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 15:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 10:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Typically,\nmodels of plastic ratcheting are calibrated against available experimental\ndata. Since actual experiments are not exactly accurate, one should check the\nidentification protocols for pathological dependencies on experimental errors.\nIn this paper, a step-by-step algorithm is presented to estimate the\nsensitivities of identified material parameters. As a part of the sensitivity\nanalysis method, a new mechanics-based metric in the space of material\nparameters is proposed especially for ratcheting-related applications. The\nsensitivity of material parameters to experimental errors is estimated, based\non this metric. For demonstration purposes, the accumulation of irreversible\nstrain in the titanium alloy VT6 (Russian analog of Ti-6Al-4V) is analysed.\nThree types of phenomenological models of plastic ratcheting are considered.\nThey are the Armstrong-Frederick model as well as the first and the second\nOhno-Wang models. Based on real data, a new rule of isotropic hardening is\nproposed for greater accuracy of simulation. The ability of the sensitivity\nanalysis to determine reliable and unreliable parameters is demonstrated. The\nplausibility of the new method is checked by alternative approaches, like the\nconsideration of correlation matrices and validation of identified parameters\non \"unseen\" data. A relation between pathological error sensitivity and\noverparametrization is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 08:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}
