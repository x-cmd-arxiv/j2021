We post a conjecture that DEDHP is hard in Sylow $q$-subquasigroups.\nNext, we instantiate an entropoid Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Due to\nthe non-commutativity and non-associativity, the entropoid based cryptographic\nprimitives are supposed to be resistant to quantum algorithms. At the same\ntime, due to the proposed succinct notation for the power indices, the\ncommunication overhead in the entropoid based Diffie-Hellman key exchange is\nvery low: for 128 bits of security, 64 bytes in total are communicated in both\ndirections, and for 256 bits of security, 128 bytes in total are communicated\nin both directions.\n  Our final contribution is in proposing two entropoid based digital signature\nschemes. The schemes are constructed with the Fiat-Shamir transformation of an\nidentification scheme which security relies on a new hardness assumption:\ncomputing roots in finite entropoids is hard. If this assumption withstands the\ntime's test, the first proposed signature scheme has excellent properties: for\nthe classical security levels between 128 and 256 bits, the public and private\nkey sizes are between 32 and 64, and the signature sizes are between 64 and 128\nbytes. The second signature scheme reduces the finding of the roots in finite\nentropoids to computing discrete entropoid logarithms.

Prior work focused on predicting the immediate future of a\nstory, such as one to a few sentences ahead. However, when novelists write long\nstories, generating a few sentences is not enough to help them gain high-level\ninsight to develop the follow-up story. In this paper, we formulate a long\nstory as a sequence of \"story blocks,\" where each block contains a fixed number\nof sentences (e.g., 10, 100, or 200). This formulation allows us to predict the\nfollow-up story arc beyond the scope of a few sentences. We represent a story\nblock using the term frequencies (TF) of semantic frames in it, normalized by\neach frame's inverse document frequency (IDF). We conduct semantic frame\nforecast experiments on 4,794 books from the Bookcorpus and 7,962 scientific\nabstracts from CODA-19, with block sizes ranging from 5 to 1,000 sentences. The\nresults show that automated models can forecast the follow-up story blocks\nbetter than the random, prior, and replay baselines, indicating the task's\nfeasibility. We also learn that the models using the frame representation as\nfeatures outperform all the existing approaches when the block size is over 150\nsentences.

The nonlinear mechanical waves of this type play a major role in\nmany modern applications involving the transmission of mechanical information\nin systems ranging from crystal lattices and metamaterials to macroscopic civil\nengineering structures. While many different classes of such dynamic fronts are\nknown, the interrelation between them remains obscure. Here we consider a\nminimal prototypical mechanical system, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chain with\npiecewise linear nonlinearity, and show that there are exactly three distinct\nclasses of switching fronts, which differ fundamentally in how (and whether)\nthey produce and transport oscillations. The fact that all three types of\nfronts could be obtained as explicit Wiener-Hopf solutions of the same discrete\nFPU problem, allows one to identify the exact mathematical origin of the\nparticular features of each class. To make the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics\nanalytically transparent, we construct a minimal quasicontinuum approximation\nof the FPU model that captures all three classes of the fronts and\ninterrelation between them. This approximation is of higher order than\nconventional ones (KdV, Boussinesq) and involves mixed space-time derivatives.\nThe proposed framework unifies previous attempts to classify the mechanical\ntransition fronts as radiative, dispersive, topological or compressive and\ncategorizes them instead as different types of dynamic lattice defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 17:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 21:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In ZSL, the common\npractice is to train a mapping function between the visual and semantic feature\nspaces with labeled seen class examples.

We built new sets of chemical yields from massive\nand very massive stars up to Mi ~ 350 Msun, by combining the wind ejecta\nextracted from our hydrostatic stellar evolution models with explosion ejecta\nfrom the literature. Using a simple chemical evolution code we analyse the\neffects of adopting different yield tables by comparing predictions against\nobservations of stars in the solar vicinity. After several tests, we focus on\nthe [O/Fe] ratio which best separates the chemical patterns of the two Milky\nWay components. We find that with a standard IMF, truncated at Mi ~ 100 Msun,\nwe can reproduce various observational constraints for thin-disc stars, but the\nsame IMF fails to account for the [O/Fe] ratios of thick-disc stars. The best\nresults are obtained by extending the IMF up to Mi = 350 Msun and including the\nchemical ejecta of very massive stars, in the form of winds and\npair-instability supernova explosions.Our study indicates that PISN played a\nsignificant role in shaping the chemical evolution of the Milky Way thick disc.\nBy including their chemical yields it is easier to reproduce not only the level\nof the alpha-enhancement but also the observed slope of thick-disc stars in the\n[O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] diagram.

While\nrecent studies have found optical signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nin a growing population of dwarf galaxies, these studies are biased against low\nmetallicity and relatively merger-free galaxies, thus missing precisely the\ndemographic in which to search for the relics of SMBH seeds.

The uGMRT observations,\ntogether with existing VLA and Chandra observations, allow us to study the\ncomplexity of the physical mechanisms active in this system. Our new images\nreveal that the central halo emission is more extended toward low frequencies.\nWe find that the integrated spectrum of the halo follows a power-law between\n150 MHz and 3 GHz, while its subregions show significantly different spectra,\nalso featuring high frequency spectral steepening. The halo also shows local\nregions in which the spectral index is significantly different from the average\nvalue. Our results highlight that an overall power-law spectrum, as observed in\nmany radio halos, may also arise from the superposition of different\nsubcomponents. The comparison of the radio surface brightness and spectral\nindex with the X-ray brightness and temperature reveals for the first time\ndifferent trends, indicating that the halo consists of two main components.

In the next decade, space missions like\nEuclid will collect photometric measurements for millions of galaxies. These\ndata should be complemented with upcoming ground-based observations to derive\nprecise and accurate photo-zs. In this paper, we explore how the tomographic\nredshift binning and depth of ground-based observations will affect the\ncosmological constraints expected from Euclid. We focus on GCph and extend the\nstudy to include galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL). We add a layer of complexity to\nthe analysis by simulating several realistic photo-z distributions based on the\nEuclid Consortium Flagship simulation and using a machine learning photo-z\nalgorithm. We use the Fisher matrix formalism and these galaxy samples to study\nthe cosmological constraining power as a function of redshift binning, survey\ndepth, and photo-z accuracy. We find that bins with equal width in redshift\nprovide a higher Figure of Merit (FoM) than equipopulated bins and that\nincreasing the number of redshift bins from 10 to 13 improves the FoM by 35%\nand 15% for GCph and its combination with GGL, respectively. For GCph, an\nincrease of the survey depth provides a higher FoM. But the addition of faint\ngalaxies beyond the limit of the spectroscopic training data decreases the FoM\ndue to the spurious photo-zs. When combining both probes, the number density of\nthe sample, which is set by the survey depth, is the main factor driving the\nvariations in the FoM. We conclude that there is more information that can be\nextracted beyond the nominal 10 tomographic redshift bins of Euclid and that we\nshould be cautious when adding faint galaxies into our sample, since they can\ndegrade the cosmological constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 17:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Here, by means of theory and numerical simulations, we shed light\non the main mechanisms driving the instability process, analysing the linear\nand nonlinear dynamics of a continuum compressible polar fluid.

Finally, we\nobtain a critical contractile stress that depends on cell-substrate friction\nand the initial-to-nematic length ratio, characterising an active\nwetting-dewetting transition.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a novel method by which to construct angular distributions of neutrinos\nfrom the zero-th and first angular moments. In our method, the angular\ndistribution is expressed with two quadratic functions of the neutrino angle in\na piecewise fashion. We determine the best parameters in the fitting function\nby comparing to the neutrino data in a spherically symmetric CCSN model with\nfull Boltzmann neutrino transport. We demonstrate the capability of our method\nby using our recent 2D CCSN model.

Based on the results of the demonstration, we assess the reliability\nof ELN-crossing searches with two-moment neutrino transport. This analysis is\ncomplementary to our another paper that scrutinizes the limitation of crossing\nsearches with a few moments.

Specifically, we are interested in whether the\npresence of MNEs in a region results in knowledge spillovers and the creation\nof new domestic industries in related sectors. To quantify how related an\nindustry is to a region's industry basket we propose two cohesion measures,\nweighted closeness and strategic closeness, which capture direct linkages and\nthe complex connectivity structure between industries in a region respectively.\nWe use a dataset of government-supported firms in Ireland (covering 90% of\nmanufacturing and exporting) between 2006-2019.

In contrast, we find a negative impact on domestic entry and\nsurvival from cohesion to 'exclusive MNE' industries, suggesting that domestic\nfirms are unable to 'leap' and thrive in MNE-proximate industries likely due to\na technology or know-how gap. This dynamic was broken, with domestic firms\nentering MNE exclusive sectors, by a large injection of Brexit diversification\nfunds in 2017-18. Finally, the type of cohesion matters.

It is a part of\nthe program concerning the classical relativistic theory of fundamental\ninteractions, represented by minimally coupled gauge vector field densities and\nhalf-densities. The correspondence between the local Darboux coordinates on\nphase space and the local structure of the links of the lattice, embedded in\nthe spatial manifold, is demonstrated. Thus, the canonical coordinates are\nreplaceable by links-related quantities. This idea and the significant part of\nformalism are directly based on the model of canonical loop quantum gravity\n(CLQG).\n  The first stage of this program is formulated regarding the gauge field,\nwhich dynamics is independent of other fundamental fields, but contributes to\ntheir dynamics. This gauge field, which determines systems equivalence in the\nactions defining all fundamental interactions, represents Einsteinian gravity.\nThe related links-defined quantities depend on holonomies of gravitational\nconnections and fluxes of densitized dreibeins. This article demonstrates how\nto determine these quantities, which lead to a nonpertubative formalism that\npreserves the general postulate of relativity. From this perspective, the\nformalism presented in this article is analogous to the Ashtekar-Barbero-Holst\nformulation on which CLQG is based. However, in this project, it is\nadditionally required that the fields' coordinates are quantizable in the\nstandard canonical procedure for a gauge theory and that any approximation in\nthe construction of the model is at least as precisely demonstrated as the\ngauge invariance. These requirements lead to new relations between holonomies\nand connections, and the representation of the densitized deibein determinant\nthat is more precise than the volume representation in CLQG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

As a remedy, we introduce a curved space background geometry with\na Minkowski metric tensor and locally non-zero curvature and torsion. Based on\nthis geometry, we propose a `third'/vacuum quantization model as a consequence\nof Unruh effect. Accordingly, we introduce a `third' quantization scalar field\nas a general coordinate transformation of spacetime for the second quantization\nfields. Then we show that in the classical limit, the `third' quantization\nfields appear as Riemannian manifolds with an emergent metric on which the\nsecond quantization fields are located. This way, the standard model of field\ntheory turns out as an effective theory. Moreover, using the proposed `third'\nquantization fields, we build a $U(1)\\times SU(4)$ Yang-Mills gauge theory for\ngravity. According to this gravitational model, we indicate that an analytical\nsolution of the presented gravitational model, for the `third' quantum field\nparticle trajectory (such as a star), corresponds to the trajectory of a test\nparticle in the Mannheim-Kazanas space.

It is found that the twist-angle\nimaging of WS2 bilayers, using the P-SHG technique is in excellent agreement\nwith that obtained using electron diffraction. The main advantages of the\noptical approach are that the characterization is performed on the same\nsubstrate that the device is created on and that it is three orders of\nmagnitude faster than the 4D-STEM. We envisage that the optical P-SHG imaging\ncould become the gold standard for the quality examination of TMD\nsuperlattice-based devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 19:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

First, we contrast the\nthermal equilibrium of nonrelativistic mechanical oscillators (where point\ncollisions are allowed and frequency is irrelevant) with the equilibrium of\nrelativistic radiation modes (where frequency is crucial). The Rayleigh-Jeans\nlaw appears from applying a dipole-radiation approximation to impose the\nnonrelativistic mechanical equilibrium on the radiation spectrum. In this\ndiscussion, we note the possibility of zero-point energy for relativistic\nradiation, which possibility does not arise for nonrelativistic\nclassical-mechanical systems.

This paper proposes a method to reduce the\nspatial dimension of CEP problems while preserving an accurate representation\nof renewable energy sources. A two-stage approach is proposed to this end. In\nthe first stage, relevant sites are identified via a screening routine that\ndiscards the locations with little impact on system design.

A\ncritical bottleneck of obtaining a reliable learnable evaluation metric is the\nlack of high-quality training data for classifiers to efficiently distinguish\nplausible and implausible machine-generated stories.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to further improve the\nefficiency and accuracy based on Nesterov's smoothing technique. Basically, the\nnon-smooth c-transform of the Kantorovich potential is approximated by the\nsmooth Log-Sum-Exp function, which finally smooths the original non-smooth\nKantorovich dual functional (energy). The smooth Kantorovich functional can be\noptimized by the fast proximal gradient algorithm (FISTA) efficiently.\nTheoretically, the computational complexity of the proposed method is given by\n$O(n^{\\frac{5}{2}} \\sqrt{\\log n} /\\epsilon)$, which is lower than that of the\nSinkhorn algorithm.

In order to rule out genuine experimental\nerror and instead isolate the intrinsic uncertainty of model fitting, we\nconcentrate on an idealized setting where \"synthetic\" measurements in the form\nof voltage curves are manufactured using the full, and most accurate, Newman\nmodel with parameter values considered \"true\", whereas parameterization is\nperformed using simplified versions of the model, namely, the single-particle\nmodel and its recently proposed corrected version. By framing the problem in\nthis way, we are able to eliminate aspects which affect uncertainty, but are\nhard to quantity such as, e.g., experimental errors. The parameterization is\nperformed by formulating an inverse problem which is solved using a\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian approach in which the parameters to be inferred are\nrepresented in terms of suitable probability distributions; this allows us to\nassess the uncertainty of their reconstruction. The key finding is that while\nat slow discharge rates the voltage curves can be reconstructed quite\naccurately, this can be achieved with some parameter varying by 300\\% or more,\nthus providing evidence for very high uncertainty of the parameter inference\nprocess. As the discharge rate increases, the reconstruction uncertainty is\nreduced but at the same time the fits to the voltage curves becomes less\naccurate.

Existing\nadversarial attacks against 3D PC classifiers are all test-time evasion (TTE)\nattacks that aim to induce test-time misclassifications using knowledge of the\nclassifier. But since the victim classifier is usually not accessible to the\nattacker, the threat is largely diminished in practice, as PC TTEs typically\nhave poor transferability. Here, we propose the first backdoor attack (BA)\nagainst PC classifiers. Originally proposed for images, BAs poison the victim\nclassifier's training set so that the classifier learns to decide to the\nattacker's target class whenever the attacker's backdoor pattern is present in\na given input sample. Significantly, BAs do not require knowledge of the victim\nclassifier. Different from image BAs, we propose to insert a cluster of points\ninto a PC as a robust backdoor pattern customized for 3D PCs. Such clusters are\nalso consistent with a physical attack (i.e., with a captured object in a\nscene). We optimize the cluster's location using an independently trained\nsurrogate classifier and choose the cluster's local geometry to evade possible\nPC preprocessing and PC anomaly detectors (ADs). Experimentally, our BA\nachieves a uniformly high success rate (> 87%) and shows evasiveness against\nstate-of-the-art PC ADs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 20:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Disk dispersal is determined by several\nproperties of the central star, the disk itself, and the surrounding\nenvironment. In particular, the metallicity of disks may impact their\nevolution, even if to date controversial results exist: in low-metallicity\nclusters disks seem to rapidly disperse, while in the Magellanic Clouds some\nevidence supports the existence of accreting disks few tens of Myrs old. In\nthis paper we study the dispersal timescale of disks in Dolidze~25, the young\ncluster in proximity of the Sun with lowest metallicity, with the aim of\nunderstanding whether disk evolution is impacted by the low-metallicity of the\ncluster. We have analyzed Chandra/ACIS-I observations of the cluster and\ncombined the resulting source catalog with existing optical and infrared\ncatalogs of the region. We selected the disk-bearing population and the\ndisk-less population of Dolidze 25. We have derived stellar parameters from\nisochrones fitted to color-magnitude diagrams. We derived a disk fraction of\nabout 34% and a median age of 1.2 Myrs. By comparing this estimate with\nexisting estimates of the disk fraction of clusters younger than 10 Myrs, our\nstudy suggests that the disk fraction of Dolidze 25 is lower than what is\nexpected from its age alone. Even if our results are not conclusive given the\nintrinsic uncertainty on stellar ages estimated from isochrones fitting to\ncolor-magnitude diagrams, we suggest that disk evolution in Dolidze 25 may be\nimpacted by the environment. Given the poor O star population and low stellar\ndensity of the cluster, it is more likely that disks dispersal timescale is\ndictated more by the low metallicity of the cluster rather than external\nphotoevaporation or dynamical encounters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The potential is trained with a\nfocus on the near-stoichiometric compositions, in particular on suboxides,\ni.e., Mg$_x$O$_{1-x}$ with $0.50<x<0.60$. Our extensive exploration\ndemonstrates that for bulk stoichiometric compounds, there are several new\nlow-energy rocksalt-like structures in which Mg atoms are octahedrally\nsix--coordinated and form trigonal prismatic motifs with different stacking\nsequences. Furthermore, we find a dense spectrum of novel non-stoichiometric\ncrystal phases of Mg$_x$O$_{1-x}$ for each composition of $x$. These structures\nare mostly similar to the rock salt structure with octahedral coordination and\nfive--coordinated Mg atoms. Due to the removal of one oxygen atom, the energy\nlandscape becomes more glass-like with oxygen-vacancy type structures that all\nlie very close to each other energetically. For the same number of magnesium\nand oxygen atoms our oxygen-deficient structures are lower in energy if the\nvacancies are aligned along lines or planes than rock salt structures with\nrandomly distributed oxygen vacancies. We also found the putative global minima\nconfigurations for each composition of the non-stoichiometric suboxide\nstructures. These structures are predominantly composed of (111) slabs of the\nrock salt structure which are terminated with Mg atoms at the top and bottom,\nand are stacked in different sequences along the $z$-direction. Like other\nMagn\\'eli-type phases, these structures have properties that differ\nconsiderably from their stoichiometric counterparts such as low lattice thermal\nconductivity and high electrical conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

We\nconcentrate our attention on two of these models: The linear sigma model with\nquarks and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We show that a main ingredient to\nunderstand the characteristics of the phase transitions is the inclusion of\nplasma screening effects that capture the physics of collective, long-wave\nmodes, and thus describe a prime property of plasmas near transition lines,\nnamely, long distance correlations. Inclusion of plasma screening makes\npossible to understand the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon even without\nthe need to consider magnetic field-dependent coupling constants. Screening is\nalso responsible for the emergence of a critical end point in the phase diagram\neven for small magnetic field strengths. Although versatile, the NJL model is\nalso a more limited approach since, being a non-renormalizable model, a clear\nseparation between pure vacuum and medium effects is not always possible. The\nmodel cannot describe inverse magnetic catalysis unless a magnetic field\ndependent coupling is included. The location of the critical end point strongly\ndepends on the choice of the type of interaction and on the magnetic field\ndependence of the corresponding coupling. Overall, both models provide sensible\ntools to explore the properties of magnetized, strongly interacting matter.\nHowever, a cross talk among them as well as a consistent physical approach to\ndetermine the model parameters is much needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 19:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

This issue is particularly severe in online\nlearning settings, where new output features, such as items in a recommender\nsystem, are added continually with few or no associated observations. As such,\nmethods for adapting neural networks to novel features which are both time and\ndata-efficient are desired. To address this, we propose the Contextual\nHyperNetwork (CHN), an auxiliary model which generates parameters for extending\nthe base model to a new feature, by utilizing both existing data as well as any\nobservations and/or metadata associated with the new feature. At prediction\ntime, the CHN requires only a single forward pass through a neural network,\nyielding a significant speed-up when compared to re-training and fine-tuning\napproaches.\n  To assess the performance of CHNs, we use a CHN to augment a partial\nvariational autoencoder (P-VAE), a deep generative model which can impute the\nvalues of missing features in sparsely-observed data.

Balboa provides a general framework for tunneling data through\nexisting applications.

The sender uses this model\nto replace outgoing data with a pointer to the associated location in the model\nand embed data in the freed up space. The receiver then extracts the data,\nreplacing the pointer with the original data from the model before passing the\ndata on to the application.

To this end, we find that other\nthan certain adjustments to the network, propagating the covariances must also\nbe accompanied by additional accounting that keeps track of how the\ndistributional moments transform and interact at each stage in the network. We\nshow how satisfying these criteria yields an algorithm for maximizing the\ncertified radius on datasets including Cifar-10, ImageNet, and Places365 while\noffering runtime savings on networks with moderate depth, with a small\ncompromise in overall accuracy. We describe the details of the key\nmodifications that enable practical use. Via various experiments, we evaluate\nwhen our simplifications are sensible, and what the key benefits and\nlimitations are.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 01:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Several 3rd party compilers are evolving to offer\nimproved performance for large quantum circuits. These 3rd parties, or just a\ncertain release of an otherwise trustworthy compiler, may possibly be untrusted\nand this could lead to an adversary to Reverse Engineer (RE) the quantum\ncircuit for extracting sensitive aspects e.g., circuit topology, program, and\nits properties. In this paper, we propose obfuscation of quantum circuits to\nhide the functionality. Quantum circuits have inherent margin between correct\nand incorrect outputs. Therefore, obfuscation (i.e., corruption of\nfunctionality) by inserting dummy gates is nontrivial. We insert dummy SWAP\ngates one at a time for maximum corruption of functionality before sending the\nquantum circuit to an untrusted compiler. If an untrusted party clones the\ndesign, they get incorrect functionality. The designer removes the dummy SWAP\ngate post-compilation to restore the correct functionality. Compared to a\nclassical counterpart, the quantum chip does not reveal the circuit\nfunctionality. Therefore, an adversary cannot guess the SWAP gate and\nlocation/validate using an oracle model. Evaluation of realistic quantum\ncircuit with/without SWAP insertion is impossible in classical computers.\nTherefore, we propose a metric-based SWAP gate insertion process. The objective\nof the metric is to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using\nTotal Variation Distance (TVD). The proposed approach is validated using IBM\ndefault noisy simulation model. Our metric-based approach predicts the SWAP\nposition to achieve TVD of upto 50%, and performs 7.5% better than average TVD,\nand performs within 12.3% of the best obtainable TVD for the benchmarks. We\nobtain an overhead of < 5% for the number of gates and circuit depth after SWAP\naddition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 05:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Existing pooling methods\neither struggle to capture the local substructure or fail to effectively\nutilize high-order dependency, thus diminishing the expression capability. In\nthis paper we propose HAP, a hierarchical graph-level representation learning\nframework, which is adaptively sensitive to graph structures, i.e., HAP\nclusters local substructures incorporating with high-order dependencies. HAP\nutilizes a novel cross-level attention mechanism MOA to naturally focus more on\nclose neighborhood while effectively capture higher-order dependency that may\ncontain crucial information. It also learns a global graph content GCont that\nextracts the graph pattern properties to make the pre- and post-coarsening\ngraph content maintain stable, thus providing global guidance in graph\ncoarsening. This novel innovation also facilitates generalization across graphs\nwith the same form of features. Extensive experiments on fourteen datasets show\nthat HAP significantly outperforms twelve popular graph pooling methods on\ngraph classification task with an maximum accuracy improvement of 22.79%, and\nexceeds the performance of state-of-the-art graph matching and graph similarity\nlearning algorithms by over 3.5% and 16.7%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 06:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The persistent presence of high\nerror rates in speech recognition domains resulting from mispronunciations\nmotivates us to find alternative techniques for handling mispronunciations. In\nthis study, we develop a mispronunciation assessment system that checks the\npronunciation of non-native English speakers, identifies the commonly\nmispronounced phonemes of Italian learners of English, and presents an\nevaluation of the non-native pronunciation observed in phonetically annotated\nspeech corpora. In this work, to detect mispronunciations, we used a\nphone-based ASR implemented using Kaldi. We used two non-native English labeled\ncorpora; (i) a corpus of Italian adults contains 5,867 utterances from 46\nspeakers, and (ii) a corpus of Italian children consists of 5,268 utterances\nfrom 78 children. Our results show that the selected error model can\ndiscriminate correct sounds from incorrect sounds in both native and nonnative\nspeech, and therefore can be used to detect pronunciation errors in non-native\nspeech. The phone error rates show improvement in using the error language\nmodel.

The few known methods of designing selectivity in\nsolid-state reactions have limited scope, such as topotactic reactions or\nstrain stabilization. This contribution describes a general approach for\nsearching large chemical spaces to identify selective reactions. This novel\napproach explains the ability of a nominally \"innocent\" Na$_2$CO$_3$ precursor\nto enable the metathesis synthesis of single-phase Y$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$ -- an\noutcome that was previously only accomplished at extreme pressures and which\ncannot be achieved with closely related precursors of Li$_2$CO$_3$ and\nK$_2$CO$_3$. By calculating the required change in chemical potential across\nall possible reactant-product interfaces in an expanded chemical space\nincluding Y, Mn, O, alkali metals, and halogens, using thermodynamic parameters\nobtained from density functional theory calculations, we identify reactions\nthat minimize the thermodynamic competition from intermediates. In this manner,\nonly the Na-based intermediates minimize the distance in the hyperdimensional\nchemical potential space to Y$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$, thus providing selective access\nto a phase which was previously thought to be metastable. Experimental evidence\nvalidating this mechanism for pathway-dependent selectivity is provided by\nintermediates identified from in situ synchrotron-based crystallographic\nanalysis. This approach of calculating chemical potential distances in\nhyperdimensional compositional spaces provides a general method for designing\nselective solid-state syntheses that will be useful for gaining access to\nmetastable phases and for identifying reaction pathways that can reduce the\nsynthesis temperature, and cost, of technological materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 05:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 18:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

In this\nwork, we utilise the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, plus a sample of post-merger\ngalaxies, to clarify the link between global HI asymmetry and the gas\nproperties of galaxies. Focusing on star-forming galaxies in ALFALFA, we find\nthat elevated global HI asymmetry is not associated with a change in the HI\ncontent of a galaxy, and that only the galaxies with the highest global HI\nasymmetry show a small increase in specific star-formation rate (sSFR).\nHowever, we show that the lack of a trend with HI content is because ALFALFA\nmisses the gas-poor tail of the star-forming main-sequence. Using xGASS to\nobtain a sample of star-forming galaxies that is representative in both sSFR\nand HI content, we find that global HI asymmetric galaxies are typically more\ngas-poor than symmetric ones at fixed stellar mass, with no change in sSFR. Our\nresults highlight the complexity of the connection between galaxy properties\nand global HI asymmetry.

Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to the\nother pipeline' stages, such as the indexing stage (i.e., when a sentence is\nconverted from a textual to a numerical representation) that, if manipulated,\ncan significantly affect the final performance of the application.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel text evasion technique called\n\"\\textit{Zero-Width} attack\" (ZeW) that leverages the injection of human\nnon-readable characters, affecting indexing stage mechanisms. We demonstrate\nthat our simple yet effective attack deceives MLaaS of \"giants\" such as Amazon,\nGoogle, IBM, and Microsoft. Our case study, based on the manipulation of\nhateful tweets, shows that out of 12 analyzed services, only one is resistant\nto our injection strategy. We finally introduce and test a simple \\textit{input\nvalidation} defense that can prevent our proposed attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 08:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

During each time slot, the secondary user performs\nthe two tasks: data transmission and energy harvesting based on the signals\nreceived from the primary users. The goal of the paper is to maximize the\nsecondary user's long-term throughput, by optimizing its transmit power and the\ntime-sharing coefficient for its two tasks. The long-term throughput\nmaximization problem is challenging due to the need for making decisions that\nyield long-term gains but might result in short-term losses. For example, when\nin a given time slot, a primary user with large channel gains transmits,\nintuition suggests that the secondary user should not carry out data\ntransmission due to the strong interference from the primary user but perform\nenergy harvesting only, which results in zero data rate for this time slot but\nyields potential long-term benefits.

Labourie [18] for fundamental\ngroups of closed negatively curved surfaces, and generalized by O. Guichard and\nA.

In this paper, we focus on Anosov representations\ninto the identity component O0(2, n) of O(2, n) for n $\\ge$ 2. Our main result\nis that any Anosov representation with negative limit set as defined in [8] is\nthe holonomy group of a spatially compact, globally hyperbolic maximal (abbrev.\nCGHM) conformally flat spacetime. The proof of the spatial compactness needs a\nparticular care. The key idea is to notice that for any spacetime M , the space\nof lightlike geodesics of M is homeomorphic to the unit tangent bundle of a\nCauchy hypersurface of M. For this purpose, we introduce the space of causal\ngeodesics containing timelike and lightlike geodesics of anti-de Sitter space\nand lightlike geodesics of its conformal boundary: the Einstein spacetime. The\nspatial compactness is a consequence of the following theorem : Any Anosov\nrepresentation acts properly discontinuously by isometries on the set of causal\ngeodesics avoiding the limit set; besides, this action is cocompact. It is\nstated in a general setting by O. Guichard, F. Kassel and A. Wienhard in [11].\nWe can see this last result as a Lorentzian analogue of the action of convex\ncocompact Kleinian group on the complementary of the limit set in H n.

However, high\ncommunication overloads for transmitting high-dimensional networks and extra\nsecurity masks remains a bottleneck of FL. This paper proposes a\ncommunication-efficient FL framework with Adaptive Quantized Gradient (AQG)\nwhich adaptively adjusts the quantization level based on local gradient's\nupdate to fully utilize the heterogeneousness of local data distribution for\nreducing unnecessary transmissions. Besides, the client dropout issues are\ntaken into account and the Augmented AQG is developed, which could limit the\ndropout noise with an appropriate amplification mechanism for transmitted\ngradients. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed\nAQG leads to 25%-50% of additional transmission reduction as compared to\nexisting popular methods including Quantized Gradient Descent (QGD) and Lazily\nAggregated Quantized (LAQ) gradient-based method without deteriorating\nconvergence properties. Particularly, experiments with heterogenous data\ndistributions corroborate a more significant transmission reduction compared\nwith independent identical data distributions. Meanwhile, the proposed AQG is\nrobust to a client dropping rate up to 90% empirically, and the Augmented AQG\nmanages to further improve the FL system's communication efficiency with the\npresence of moderate-scale client dropouts commonly seen in practical FL\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 08:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

To overcome these issues, in this paper we propose a novel\nobject-centric voxel representation tailored for monocular 3D object detection.\nSpecifically, voxels are built on each object proposal, and their sizes are\nadaptively determined by the 3D spatial distribution of the points, allowing\nthe noisy point cloud to be organized effectively within a voxel grid. This\nrepresentation is proved to be able to locate the object in 3D space\naccurately.

Then, the representations can be passed to\nsubsequent layers to deal with individual downstream tasks. Therefore, the\narchitectures of GNNs can be considered as being composed of two core parts:\ngraph-related layers and task-specific layers. Facing real-world molecular\nproblems, the hyperparameter optimization for those layers are vital.\nHyperparameter optimization (HPO) becomes expensive in this situation because\nevaluating candidate solutions requires massive computational resources to\ntrain and validate models. Furthermore, a larger search space often makes the\nHPO problems more challenging. In this research, we focus on the impact of\nselecting two types of GNN hyperparameters, those belonging to graph-related\nlayers and those of task-specific layers, on the performance of GNN for\nmolecular property prediction.

We then aim at\nclarifying the distinction of the role in between the SD and GT transitions.\nMethod: We perform a three-body model calculation for the transition\n${}^{80}\\mathrm{Ni}\\to{}^{80}\\mathrm{Cu}$, where ${}^{78}\\mathrm{Ni}$ is taken\nas a core.

Aims. We aim to\nstudy the orbital evolution of Kepler-444-d and Kepler-444-e and the impact of\natmospheric evaporation on Kepler-444-e. Methods. Rotating stellar models of\nKepler-444-A were computed with the Geneva stellar evolution code and coupled\nto an orbital evolution code, accounting for the effects of dynamical,\nequilibrium tides and atmospheric evaporation. The impacts of multiple stellar\nrotational histories and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) luminosity evolutionary\ntracks are explored. Results. Using detailed rotating stellar models able to\nreproduce the rotation rate of Kepler-444-A, we find that its observed rotation\nrate is perfectly in line with what is expected for this old K0-type star,\nindicating that there is no reason for it to be exceptionally active as would\nbe required to explain the observed HI-Ly-$\\rm \\alpha$ variations from a\nstellar origin. We show that given the low planetary mass ($\\sim$ 0.03 M$_{\\rm\n\\oplus}$) and relatively large orbital distance ($\\sim$ 0.06 AU) of\nKepler-444-d and e, dynamical tides negligibly affect their orbits, regardless\nof the stellar rotational history considered.

On one side large batch-size optimization\nsuch as LAMB algorithm was proposed to reduce the frequency of communication.\nOn the other side, communication compression algorithms such as 1-bit Adam help\nto reduce the volume of each communication. However, we find that simply using\none of the techniques is not sufficient to solve the communication challenge,\nespecially under low network bandwidth. Motivated by this we aim to combine the\npower of large-batch optimization and communication compression, but we find\nthat existing compression strategies cannot be directly applied to LAMB due to\nits unique adaptive layerwise learning rates. To this end, we design a new\ncommunication-efficient algorithm, 1-bit LAMB, which introduces a novel way to\nsupport adaptive layerwise learning rates under compression. In addition, we\nintroduce a new system implementation for compressed communication using the\nNCCL backend of PyTorch distributed, which improves both usability and\nperformance. For BERT-Large pre-training task with batch sizes from 8K to 64K,\nour evaluations on up to 256 GPUs demonstrate that 1-bit LAMB with NCCL-based\nbackend is able to achieve up to 4.6x communication volume reduction, up to\n2.8x end-to-end time-wise speedup, and the same sample-wise convergence speed\n(and same fine-tuning task accuracy) compared to uncompressed LAMB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 10:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 03:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Click\nmodels, which study how users interact with a ranked list of items, provide a\nuseful understanding of user feedback for learning ranking models. Constructing\n\"right\" dependencies is the key of any successful click model. However,\nprobabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have to rely on manually assigned\ndependencies, and oversimplify user behaviors. Existing neural network based\nmethods promote PGMs by enhancing the expressive ability and allowing flexible\ndependencies, but still suffer from exposure bias and inferior estimation. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, Adversarial Imitation Click Model\n(AICM), based on imitation learning. Firstly, we explicitly learn the reward\nfunction that recovers users' intrinsic utility and underlying intentions.\nSecondly, we model user interactions with a ranked list as a dynamic system\ninstead of one-step click prediction, alleviating the exposure bias problem.\nFinally, we minimize the JS divergence through adversarial training and learn a\nstable distribution of click sequences, which makes AICM generalize well across\ndifferent distributions of ranked lists. A theoretical analysis has indicated\nthat AICM reduces the exposure bias from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$.

Approaches have been proposed to reduce the complexity by\nreplacing motion prediction modules with implicit flow networks. Error\npropagation aware training strategy is also proposed to alleviate incremental\nreconstruction errors from previously decoded frames. Although these methods\nhave brought some improvement, little attention has been paid to the framework\nitself. Inspired by the success of learned image compression through\nsimplifying the framework with a single deep neural network, it is natural to\nexpect a better performance in video compression via a simple yet appropriate\nframework. Therefore, we propose a framework to directly compress raw-pixel\nframes (rather than residual images), where no extra motion prediction module\nis required. Instead, an entropy model is used to estimate the spatiotemporal\nredundancy in a latent space rather than pixel level, which significantly\nreduces the complexity of the framework. Specifically, the whole framework is a\ncompression module, consisting of a unified auto-encoder which produces\nidentically distributed latents for all frames, and a spatiotemporal entropy\nestimation model to minimize the entropy of these latents.

Existing methods tackle this problem mainly from the perspective\nof data quantity, i.e., the number of samples in each class. To be specific,\nthey pay more attention to tail classes, like applying larger adjustments to\nthe logit. However, in the training process, the quantity and difficulty of\ndata are two intertwined and equally crucial problems. For some tail classes,\nthe features of their instances are distinct and discriminative, which can also\nbring satisfactory accuracy; for some head classes, although with sufficient\nsamples, the high semantic similarity with other classes and lack of\ndiscriminative features will bring bad accuracy. Based on these observations,\nwe propose Adaptive Logit Adjustment Loss (ALA Loss) to apply an adaptive\nadjusting term to the logit. The adaptive adjusting term is composed of two\ncomplementary factors: 1) quantity factor, which pays more attention to tail\nclasses, and 2) difficulty factor, which adaptively pays more attention to hard\ninstances in the training process. The difficulty factor can alleviate the\nover-optimization on tail yet easy instances and under-optimization on head yet\nhard instances. The synergy of the two factors can not only advance the\nperformance on tail classes even further, but also promote the accuracy on head\nclasses. Unlike previous logit adjusting methods that only concerned about data\nquantity, ALA Loss tackles the long-tailed problem from a more comprehensive,\nfine-grained and adaptive perspective.

While there is a\ngeneral consensus that they host an accreting, magnetized neutron star (NS),\nthe problem of how to produce luminosities $> 100$ times the Eddington limit,\n$L_E$, of a solar mass object is still debated. A promising explanation relies\non the reduction of the opacities in the presence of a strong magnetic field,\nwhich allows for the local flux to be much larger than the Eddington flux.\nHowever, avoiding the onset of the propeller effect may be a serious problem.\nHere, we reconsider the problem of column accretion onto a highly magnetized\nNS, extending previously published calculations by relaxing the assumption of a\npure dipolar field and allowing for more complex magnetic field topologies. We\nfind that the maximum luminosity is determined primarily by the magnetic field\nstrength near the NS surface.

We performed a large-scale quantitative study of OSS projects in\nGitHub.

Whether\ntunnelling takes time and how a microscopic particle transits through a barrier\nhave been debated since the early days of quantum mechanics. The time required\nfor an electron to tunnel through an atomic potential barrier has been measured\nwith attosecond angular streaking (attoclock), and a recent work on the\nhydrogen atom claimed that electron tunnelling is instantaneous. However, the\ntime required for Rb atoms to tunnel through an optical potential barrier has\nbeen measured to be on the order of milliseconds with a recent Larmor clock\nmeasurement. The essence of electron and atom tunnelling is identical, but the\nreason for the contradictory conclusions remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate\nthat the sub-barrier potential interaction is the root of the nonzero\ntunnelling delay time. We reveal that the wave-particle duality of a tunnelling\nelectron must be fully taken into account when decoding the tunnelling delay\ntime from the attoclock measurements. Based on energy-resolved attoclock\nmeasurements, we show that the tunnelling delay time of an electron ranges from\n24 to 58 attoseconds, and the counterintuitive result that an electron with a\nlower energy may spend less time in the barrier is consistent with the\nvelocity-dependent tunnelling time of atoms in Larmor clock measurements. Our\nresults unify the tunnelling time of microscopic particles by highlighting the\nclassically forbidden sub-barrier potential interactions of matter waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 12:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

As such, traditional analytical approaches to\nautonomous navigation often fail to cater for the social expectations of\nindividuals. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to capture the\ncomplexity of social expectations and integrate this complexity into a\n3-layered Contextual Speed Controller. The layers were; the legal road speed\nlimit, the socially acceptable speed given the number of nearby pedestrians,\nand the socially acceptable speed based on proximity to nearby pedestrians. An\nimplementation of this layered approach was tested in areas of both low and\nhigh vehicle-pedestrian interactions. From the experiments conducted, the lower\ntwo layers were seen working in tandem to modulate the vehicle speed to\nappropriate levels that mimicked conservative human driver behaviour. In\nsummary, this work quantified the relationship between pedestrian context and\nsocially acceptable vehicle speeds, allowing for more perceivably safe\nautonomous driving. Furthermore, the need for different driving schemes for\nnavigating different road environments was identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 12:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Most existing 3D\nmask PAD benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of mask\nidentities, types of sensors, and a total number of videos; 2) low-fidelity\nquality of facial masks. Basic deep models and remote photoplethysmography\n(rPPG) methods achieved acceptable performance on these benchmarks but still\nfar from the needs of practical scenarios. To bridge the gap to real-world\napplications, we introduce a largescale High-Fidelity Mask dataset, namely\nCASIA-SURF HiFiMask (briefly HiFiMask).

The underlying dynamics of how the flow of activations induce overfitting\nis however poorly understood. In this study we introduce a perplexity-based\nsparsity definition to derive and visualise layer-wise activation measures.\nThese novel explainable AI strategies reveal a surprising relationship between\nactivation sparsity and overfitting, namely an increase in sparsity in the\nfeature extraction layers shortly before the test loss starts rising. This\ntendency is preserved across network architectures and reguralisation\nstrategies so that our measures can be used as a reliable indicator for\noverfitting while decoupling the network's generalisation capabilities from its\nloss-based definition. Moreover, our differentiable sparsity formulation can be\nused to explicitly penalise the emergence of sparsity during training so that\nthe impact of reduced sparsity on overfitting can be studied in real-time.\nApplying this penalty and analysing activation sparsity for well known\nregularisers and in common network architectures supports the hypothesis that\nreduced activation sparsity can effectively improve the generalisation and\nclassification performance. In line with other recent work on this topic, our\nmethods reveal novel insights into the contradicting concepts of activation\nsparsity and network capacity by demonstrating that dense activations can\nenable discriminative feature learning while efficiently exploiting the\ncapacity of deep models without suffering from overfitting, even when trained\nexcessively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 12:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Unfortunately, this learning type is too slow and\ndifficult to use in practical situations because the state-action space becomes\nhuge in real environments. The essential factor for learning efficiency is\nrewards. Potential-based reward shaping is a basic method for enriching\nrewards. This method is required to define a specific real-value function\ncalled a potential function for every domain. It is often difficult to\nrepresent the potential function directly. SARSA-RS learns the potential\nfunction and acquires it. However, SARSA-RS can only be applied to the simple\nenvironment. The bottleneck of this method is the aggregation of states to make\nabstract states since it is almost impossible for designers to build an\naggregation function for all states. We propose a trajectory aggregation that\nuses subgoal series. This method dynamically aggregates states in an episode\nduring trial and error with only the subgoal series and subgoal identification\nfunction. It makes designer effort minimal and the application to environments\nwith high-dimensional observations possible. We obtained subgoal series from\nparticipants for experiments.

We argue\nthat TDEs around black holes of the lowest masses will expel the vast majority\nof their gravitationally bound debris into a radiatively driven outflow. A\nlarge-mass outflow will obscure the innermost X-ray producing regions, leading\nto a population of low black hole mass TDEs which are only observed at optical\n\\& UV energies.

Recent\ndevelopment in deep learning allows vision-based counter-UAV systems to detect\nand track UAVs with a single camera. However, the coverage of a single camera\nis limited, necessitating the need for multicamera configurations to match UAVs\nacross cameras - a problem known as re-identification (reID). While there has\nbeen extensive research on person and vehicle reID to match objects across time\nand viewpoints, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research in UAV\nreID. UAVs are challenging to re-identify: they are much smaller than\npedestrians and vehicles and they are often detected in the air so appear at a\ngreater range of angles. Because no UAV data sets currently use multiple\ncameras, we propose the first new UAV re-identification data set, UAV-reID,\nthat facilitates the development of machine learning solutions in this emerging\narea. UAV-reID has two settings: Temporally-Near to evaluate performance across\nviews to assist tracking frameworks, and Big-to-Small to evaluate reID\nperformance across scale and to allow early reID when UAVs are detected from a\nlong distance. We conduct a benchmark study by extensively evaluating different\nreID backbones and loss functions. We demonstrate that with the right setup,\ndeep networks are powerful enough to learn good representations for UAVs,\nachieving 81.9% mAP on the Temporally-Near setting and 46.5% on the challenging\nBig-to-Small setting. Furthermore, we find that vision transformers are the\nmost robust to extreme variance of scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 14:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 13:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

In\nthis paper, we present a novel brain tumor segmentation algorithm with missing\nmodalities.

Thanks to the obtained correlation representation, the\nsegmentation becomes more robust in the case of missing modality. First, the\nindividual representation produced by each encoder is used to estimate the\nmodality independent parameter. Then, the correlation model transforms all the\nindividual representations to the latent multi-source correlation\nrepresentations. Finally, the correlation representations across modalities are\nfused via attention mechanism into a shared representation to emphasize the\nmost important features for segmentation.

Specifically, quantum dynamics\nwith a time independent $H$ in a finite dimensional Hilbert space are\nconsidered with repeated strong null measurements of a specified state. We\ndiscuss four generic behaviors that emerge in these monitored systems. The\nfirst arises in systems without symmetry, along with their associated\ndegeneracies in the energy spectrum, and hence in the absence of dark states as\nwell. In this case, a unique final state can be found which is determined by\nthe largest eigenvalue of the survival operator, the non-unitary operator\nencoding both the unitary evolution between measurements and the measurement\nitself. For a three-level system, this is similar to the well known shelving\neffect. Secondly, for systems with built-in symmetry and correspondingly a\ndegenerate energy spectrum, the null measurements dynamically select the\ndegenerate energy levels, while the non-degenerate levels are effectively wiped\nout. Thirdly, in the absence of dark states, and for specific choices of\nparameters, two or more eigenvalues of the survival operator match in\nmagnitude, and this leads to an oscillatory behavior controlled by the\nmeasurement rate and not solely by the energy levels. Finally, when the control\nparameters are tuned, such that the eigenvalues of the survival operator all\ncoalesce to zero, one has exceptional points that corresponds to situations\nthat violate the null measurement condition, making the conditional measurement\nprocess impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 14:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Our main contribution is\na data-driven variational inference approach where we train a normalizing flow\n(NF), a type of invertible neural net, capable of cheaply sampling the\nposterior distribution given previously unseen seismic data from neighboring\nsurveys.

The meta-transfer learning quickly adapts the\nmodel to the code-switching task from a number of monolingual tasks by learning\nto learn in a multi-task learning fashion. Second, we propose a novel\nmultilingual meta-embeddings approach to effectively represent code-switching\ndata by acquiring useful knowledge learned in other languages, learning the\ncommonalities of closely related languages and leveraging lexical composition.\nThe method is far more efficient compared to contextualized pre-trained\nmultilingual models.

This work examines the conditions\nthat cause one of these instabilities to dominate over the other using a novel\nmodel to study localized ionospheric instabilities. The effect of collisions\nwith neutral particles plays an important role in the instability development.\nIt is found that the KHI is dominant in low collisionality regimes, the GDI is\ndominant in high collisionality regimes, and there exists an intermediate\nregion in which both instabilities exist in tandem. For low collisionality\ncases in which the velocity shear is sufficiently far from the density\ngradient, the GDI is found to grow as a secondary instability extending from\nthe KHI vortices. The inclusion of a neutral wind driven electric field in the\ndirection of the velocity shear does not impact the dominance of either\ninstability. Using data from empirical ionospheric models, two altitude limits\nare found. For altitudes above the higher limit, the KHI is dominant. For\naltitudes below the lower limit, the GDI is dominant. In the intermediate\nregion, both instabilities grow together. Increasing the velocity shear causes\nboth limits to be lower in altitude.

Unfortunately, this learning type is too slow and\ndifficult to use in practical situations because the state-action space becomes\nhuge in real environments. Many studies have incorporated human knowledge into\nreinforcement Learning. Though human knowledge on trajectories is often used, a\nhuman could be asked to control an AI agent, which can be difficult. Knowledge\non subgoals may lessen this requirement because humans need only to consider a\nfew representative states on an optimal trajectory in their minds. The\nessential factor for learning efficiency is rewards. Potential-based reward\nshaping is a basic method for enriching rewards. However, it is often difficult\nto incorporate subgoals for accelerating learning over potential-based reward\nshaping. This is because the appropriate potentials are not intuitive for\nhumans. We extend potential-based reward shaping and propose a subgoal-based\nreward shaping. The method makes it easier for human trainers to share their\nknowledge of subgoals. To evaluate our method, we obtained a subgoal series\nfrom participants and conducted experiments in three domains,\nfour-rooms(discrete states and discrete actions), pinball(continuous and\ndiscrete), and picking(both continuous). We compared our method with a baseline\nreinforcement learning algorithm and other subgoal-based methods, including\nrandom subgoal and naive subgoal-based reward shaping. As a result, we found\nout that our reward shaping outperformed all other methods in learning\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 14:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Optimizing low-latency local PPR algorithm with a tight memory budget on\nedge devices remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient,\nlow-latency PPR solution, namely MeLoPPR, with largely reduced memory\nrequirement and a flexible trade-off between latency and precision.

The results show that the\nproposed SPSO outperforms not only other particle swarm optimization (PSO)\nvariants including the classic PSO, phase angle-encoded PSO and quantum-behave\nPSO but also other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms\nincluding the genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and\ndifferential evolution (DE) in most scenarios. In addition, experiments have\nbeen conducted to demonstrate the validity of the generated paths for real UAV\noperations.
