While such\nattacks have been extensively explored for the purpose of evaluating model\nrobustness, their utility for improving robustness has been limited to offline\naugmentation only. Concretely, given a trained model, attacks are used to\ngenerate perturbed (adversarial) examples, and the model is re-trained exactly\nonce. In this work, we address this gap and leverage discrete attacks for\nonline augmentation, where adversarial examples are generated at every training\nstep, adapting to the changing nature of the model.

Deep\npolynomial neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated impressive results in\nunsupervised image generation, where the task is to map an input vector (i.e.,\nnoise) to a synthesized image. However, the success of PNNs has not been\nreplicated in conditional generation tasks, such as super-resolution. Existing\nPNNs focus on single-variable polynomial expansions which do not fare well to\ntwo-variable inputs, i.e., the noise variable and the conditional variable. In\nthis work, we introduce a general framework, called CoPE, that enables a\npolynomial expansion of two input variables and captures their auto- and\ncross-correlations. We exhibit how CoPE can be trivially augmented to accept an\narbitrary number of input variables. CoPE is evaluated in five tasks\n(class-conditional generation, inverse problems, edges-to-image translation,\nimage-to-image translation, attribute-guided generation) involving eight\ndatasets.

Such artifacts significantly\ndegrade the quality and reliability of the obtained visual data and can lead to\naccidents if they are not detected in time. This paper presents ongoing work on\na new dataset for training and assessing vision algorithms' performance for\ndifferent tasks of image artifacts detection on either camera lens or\nwindshield. At the moment, we present a publicly available set of images\ncontaining $8190$ images, of which $3390$ contain raindrops. Images are\nannotated with the binary mask representing areas with raindrops. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the dataset in the problems of raindrops\npresence detection and raindrop region segmentation. To augment the data, we\nalso propose an algorithm for data augmentation which allows the generation of\nsynthetic raindrops on images. Apart from the dataset, we present a novel\ngradient-based algorithm for raindrop presence detection in a video sequence.\nThe experimental evaluation proves that the algorithm reliably detects\nraindrops. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art cross-correlation-based\nalgorithm \\cite{Einecke2014}, the proposed algorithm showed a higher quality of\nraindrop presence detection and image processing speed, making it applicable\nfor the self-check procedure of real autonomous systems.

In light of recent\ndevelopments on learning linear dynamical systems (LDSs), and on censored\nstatistics with independent data, we revisit the decades-old problem of\nlearning an LDS, from censored observations (Lee and Maddala (1985); Zeger and\nBrookmeyer (1986)). Here, the learner observes the state $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$\nif and only if $x_t$ belongs to some set $S_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$. We\ndevelop the first computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for\nlearning the system, assuming only oracle access to the sets $S_t$. Our\nalgorithm, Stochastic Online Newton with Switching Gradients, is a novel\nsecond-order method that builds on the Online Newton Step (ONS) of Hazan et al.\n(2007). Our Switching-Gradient scheme does not always use (stochastic)\ngradients of the function we want to optimize, which we call \"censor-aware\"\nfunction. Instead, in each iteration, it performs a simple test to decide\nwhether to use the censor-aware, or another \"censor-oblivious\" function, for\ngetting a stochastic gradient.\n  In our analysis, we consider a \"generic\" Online Newton method, which uses\narbitrary vectors instead of gradients, and we prove an error-bound for it.\nThis can be used to appropriately design these vectors, leading to our\nSwitching-Gradient scheme. This framework significantly deviates from the\nrecent long line of works on censored statistics (e.g., Daskalakis et al.\n(2018); Kontonis et al. (2019); Daskalakis et al.

By\ndrawing an analogy with the exponential decay, we are able to further\ninvestigate regimes when such changes are negligible according to the\nlogarithmic scale of time, and thus the system is approximately stationary.\nWhile this is always the case within the initial and final regimes of the\ndynamics, with the system respectively approximated by its initial and\nasymptotic states, we show that a distinct regime of approximate stationarity\nmay arise. In turn, we establish a quantitative description of the phenomenon\nof metastability in open quantum systems.

The dawn of programmable\ndata planes in Software-Defined Networks can help mitigate this issue, opening\nthe door to the detection of DDoS attacks directly in the data plane of the\nswitches.

Unfortunately,\nvideo streaming consumes significant system energy due to the high power\nconsumption of the system components (e.g., DRAM, display interfaces, and\ndisplay panel) involved in this process.\n  We propose BurstLink, a novel system-level technique that improves the energy\nefficiency of planar and VR video streaming. BurstLink is based on two key\nideas. First, BurstLink directly transfers a decoded video frame from the host\nsystem to the display panel, bypassing the host DRAM. To this end, we extend\nthe display panel with a double remote frame buffer (DRFB), instead of the\nDRAM's double frame buffer, so that the system can directly update the DRFB\nwith a new frame while updating the panel's pixels with the current frame\nstored in the DRFB. Second, BurstLink transfers a complete decoded frame to the\ndisplay panel in a single burst, using the maximum bandwidth of modern display\ninterfaces. Unlike conventional systems where the frame transfer rate is\nlimited by the pixel-update throughput of the display panel, BurstLink can\nalways take full advantage of the high bandwidth of modern display interfaces\nby decoupling the frame transfer from the pixel update as enabled by the DRFB.\nThis direct and burst frame transfer of BurstLink significantly reduces energy\nconsumption in video display by reducing access to the host DRAM and increasing\nthe system's residency at idle power states.\n  We evaluate BurstLink using an analytical power model that we rigorously\nvalidate on a real modern mobile system. Our evaluation shows that BurstLink\nreduces system energy consumption for 4K planar and VR video streaming by 41%\nand 33%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 22:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 15:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 21:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In spite of the expected abundance of super-partners for all the known\nparticles, not a single supersymmetric pair has been reported to date. Although\na hypothetical SUSY breaking mechanism, operating at high energy inaccessible\nto current experiments cannot be ruled out, this reduces SUSY's predictive\npower and it is unclear whether SUSY, in its standard form, can help reducing\nthe remaining puzzles of the standard model (SM). Here we argue that SUSY can\nbe realized in a different way, connecting spacetime and internal bosonic\nsymmetries, combining bosonic gauge fields and fermionic matter particles in a\nsingle gauge field, a Lie superalgebra-valued connection. In this\nunconventional representation, states do not come in SUSY pairs, avoiding the\ndoubling of particles and fields and SUSY is not a fully off-shell invariance\nof the action. The resulting systems are remarkably simple, closely resembling\na standard quantum field theory and SUSY still emerges as a contingent symmetry\nthat depends on the features of the vacuum/ground state. We illustrate the\ngeneral construction with two examples: i) A 2+1 dimensional system based on\nthe $osp(2,2|2)$ superalgebra, including Lorentz and $u(1)$ generators that\ndescribes graphene; ii) A supersymmetric extension of 3+1 conformal gravity\nwith an $SU(2,2|2)$ connection that describes a gauge theory with an emergent\nchiral symmetry breaking, coupled to gravity.

I present a new probe of\ncosmological modifications of general relativity with GW data only. I focus on\ndeviations of the GW luminosity distance constrained with the astrophysical\npopulation of binary black holes (BBHs). The three key observables are 1) the\nnumber of events as a function of luminosity distance, 2) the stochastic GW\nbackground of unresolved binaries and 3) the location of any feature in the\nsource mass distribution, such as the pair instability supernova (PISN) gap.\nDespite a priori degeneracies between modified gravity and the unknown\nevolution of the merger rate and source masses, a large damping of the GW\namplitude could be falsifiable since as redshift grows it reduces the events\nand lowers the edges of the PISN gap, which is against standard astrophysical\nexpectations. Applying a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to the current\nLIGO--Virgo catalog (GWTC-2), the strongest constraints to date are placed on\ndeviations from the GW luminosity distance, finding $c_{_M}=-3.2^{+3.4}_{-2.0}$\nat $68\\%$ C.L., which is $\\sim10$ times better than multi-messenger GW170817\nbounds. These modifications also affects the determination of the BBH masses,\nwhich is crucial to accommodate the high-mass binary GW190521 away from the\nPISN gap.

Recently, deep learning methods have become\npopular in this domain. As traffic data are physically associated with road\nnetworks, most proposed models treat it as a spatiotemporal graph modeling\nproblem and use Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods. These GCN-based\nmodels highly depend on a predefined and fixed adjacent matrix to reflect the\nspatial dependency. However, the predefined fixed adjacent matrix is limited in\nreflecting the actual dependence of traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel\nmodel, Traffic Transformer, for spatial-temporal graph modeling and long-term\ntraffic forecasting to overcome these limitations. Transformer is the most\npopular framework in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Unsupervised domain adaptation\n(UDA) addresses this problem by training a model with only labeled data in the\nsource domain but making the model generalize well in the target domain.\nExisting studies show that self-supervised learning using both source and\ntarget domain data can help improve the adaptability of trained models, but\nthey all rely on hand-crafted designs of the self-supervised tasks.

In the UDA architecture, an\nencoder is shared between the networks for the self-supervised task and the\nmain task of point cloud classification or segmentation, so that the encoder\ncan be trained to extract features suitable for both the source and the target\ndomain data.

Training with additive uniform noise approximates the quantization\nerror variationally but suffers from the train-test mismatch.

The longest lived outburst ($>6$ yr) persists in NGC6334I-MM1, a\ndeeply-embedded object with no near-IR counterpart. Using FORCAST and HAWC+ on\nSOFIA, we have obtained the first mid-infrared images of this field since the\noutburst began. Despite being undetected in pre-outburst ground-based 18 $\\mu$m\nimages, MM1 is now the brightest region at all three wavelengths (25, 37, and\n53 $\\mu$m), exceeding the ultracompact HII region MM3 (NGC6334F). Combining the\nSOFIA data with ALMA imaging at four wavelengths, we construct a spectral\nenergy distribution of the combination of MM1 and the nearby hot core MM2. The\nbest-fit Robitaille radiative transfer model yields a luminosity of\n$(4.9\\pm0.8)\\times10^4 L_\\odot$. Accounting for an estimated pre-outburst\nluminosity ratio MM1:MM2 = $2.1\\pm0.4$, the luminosity of MM1 has increased by\na factor of $16.3\\pm4.4$. The pre-outburst luminosity implies a protostar of\nmass 6.7 $M_\\odot$, which can produce the ionizing photon rate required to\npower the pre-outburst hypercompact HII region surrounding the likely\noutbursting protostar MM1B.

As outsourcing is now well established the switching\nof vendors and transitioning from one system to another is common. However,\nmost of the research to date on outsourcing has focused on the decision and\noperation phases, leaving a gap between theory and practice concerning the\ntransition phase. Transition in outsourcing entails the changing of systems,\nbusiness processes and/or vendors. If a suitable transition approach is not\napplied pressures for another transition can immediately build. We present\nresults from a case study carried out on the Novopay Project in which the\nMinistry of Education in New Zealand changed their vendor from an onshore to a\nnear-shore provider. This project resulted in a sequence of three transitions,\nwith each following a different approach as a direct result of the experiences\nencountered in the previous transition. In this research we made use of the\nrich 'data dump' of evidence provided by the Ministry of Education. Our\nanalysis describes how a client organization can become trapped in a continuous\ntransition cycle if a suitable approach is not applied. Transition1 involved\nthe client moving from complete outsourcing to selective insourcing. After\nrealizing that they did not have the capabilities to manage insourcing,\nTransition2 was initiated. In Transition2 the sourcing approach reverted back\nto complete outsourcing. When it was realized that the new vendor in\nTransition2 could not in fact deliver a new service model or support end-users\nin following new business processes, Transition3 was initiated. In Transition3,\nthe client established an internal company to insource service operations to\nsupport end-users. Transition can be a sound business strategy, however, if a\nflawed sourcing approach is chosen it can result in 'continuous transition'.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 04:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

The spontaneous\nbreaking of this symmetry leads to the emergence of a novel non-equilibrium\nphase of matter - the Discrete Time Crystal (DTC). In this paper, we propose a\nscheme to extend the lifetime of a DTC in a paradigmatic model - a translation\ninvariant Ising spin chain with nearest-neighbor interaction $J$, subjected to\na periodic kick by a transverse magnetic field with frequency $\\frac{2\n\\pi}{T}$. This system exhibits the hallmark signature of a DTC - persistent\nsubharmonic oscillations with frequency $\\frac{\\pi}{T}$ - for a wide parameter\nregime. Employing both analytical arguments as well as exact diagonalization\ncalculations, we demonstrate that the lifetime of the DTC is maximized, when\nthe interaction strength is tuned to an optimal value, $JT = \\pi$. Our proposal\nessentially relies on an interaction induced quantum interference mechanism\nthat suppresses the creation of excitations, and thereby enhances the DTC\nlifetime. Intriguingly, we find that the period doubling oscillations can last\neternally in even size systems. This anomalously long lifetime can be\nattributed to a time reflection symmetry that emerges at $JT=\\pi$.

Despite the SOTA performance obtained by\nrecent anchor-based detectors using CNNs for this task, they require\npredetermined anchor parameters such as the size, number, and aspect ratio of\nanchors, and have limited robustness when dealing with lung nodules with a\nmassive variety of sizes. To overcome these problems, we propose a 3D sphere\nrepresentation-based center-points matching detection network that is\nanchor-free and automatically predicts the position, radius, and offset of\nnodules without the manual design of nodule/anchor parameters. The SCPM-Net\nconsists of two novel components: sphere representation and center points\nmatching. First, to match the nodule annotation in clinical practice, we\nreplace the commonly used bounding box with our proposed bounding sphere to\nrepresent nodules with the centroid, radius, and local offset in 3D space. A\ncompatible sphere-based intersection over-union loss function is introduced to\ntrain the lung nodule detection network stably and efficiently. Second, we\nempower the network anchor-free by designing a positive center-points selection\nand matching process, which naturally discards pre-determined anchor boxes. An\nonline hard example mining and re-focal loss subsequently enable the CPM\nprocess to be more robust, resulting in more accurate point assignment and\nmitigation of class imbalance.

However, there is no causal\nrelationship between the two, since superconductivity is a many-body effect due\nto electron-electron interaction while topology is a single-particle\nmanifestation of electron band structure. Here, we demonstrate a novel form of\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing, induced by topological Weyl\nnodal lines in Ising Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (IBCS) superconductors.

Moreover, we show that\nthe IBCS pairing alone will enhance the in-plane critical field $B_c$ to ~10-50\ntimes of Pauli paramagnetic limit $B_p$, and additional FFLO pairing can\nfurther triple the $B_c/B_p$ ratio. It therefore affords an effective approach\nto enhance the robustness of superconductivity.

One-stage models are more efficient\ndue to their straightforward architectures, but the two-stage models are still\nadvantageous in accuracy. Existing one-stage models usually begin by detecting\npredefined interaction areas or points, and then attend to these areas only for\ninteraction prediction; therefore, they lack reasoning steps that dynamically\nsearch for discriminative cues. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage\nmethod, namely Glance and Gaze Network (GGNet), which adaptively models a set\nof actionaware points (ActPoints) via glance and gaze steps. The glance step\nquickly determines whether each pixel in the feature maps is an interaction\npoint. The gaze step leverages feature maps produced by the glance step to\nadaptively infer ActPoints around each pixel in a progressive manner. Features\nof the refined ActPoints are aggregated for interaction prediction. Moreover,\nwe design an actionaware approach that effectively matches each detected\ninteraction with its associated human-object pair, along with a novel hard\nnegative attentive loss to improve the optimization of GGNet. All the above\noperations are conducted simultaneously and efficiently for all pixels in the\nfeature maps. Finally, GGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by\nsignificant margins on both V-COCO and HICODET benchmarks.

Moreover, we will see that quasi\n$\\alpha$-firmly nonexpansive operators enjoy the asymptotic regularity\nproperty. Then, based on Browder's demiclosedness principle, we prove for\n$r$-uniformly convex Banach spaces that the weak cluster points of the iterates\n$x_{n+1}:=Tx_{n}$ belong to the fixed point set $\\text{Fix} T$ whenever the\noperator $T$ is nonexpansive and quasi $\\alpha$-firmly.

Further, the\nprojections $P_{\\text{Fix} T}x_n$ converge strongly to this weak limit point.\nFinally, we give three illustrative examples, where our theory can be applied,\nnamely from infinite dimensional neural networks, semigroup theory, and\ncontractive projections in $L_p$, $p \\in (1,\\infty) \\backslash \\{2\\}$ spaces on\nprobability measure spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 11:13:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Although a\nlarge body of research has been formulating platooning manoeuvres, it is still\nchallenging to design, describe, read, and understand them. This difficulty\nlargely arises from missing formalisation. To fill this gap, we analysed\nexisting ways of describing manoeuvres, derived the causes of difficulty, and\ndesigned a framework that simplifies the manoeuvre design process. Alongside, a\nManoeuvre Design Language was developed to structurally describe manoeuvres in\na machine-readable format. Unlike state-of-the-art manoeuvre descriptions that\nrequire one state machine for every participating vehicle, the SEAD framework\nallows describing any manoeuvre from the single perspective of the platoon\nleader. %As a proof of concept, the proposed framework was implemented in the\nmixed traffic simulation environment BEHAVE for an autonomous highway scenario.\nUsing this framework, we implemented several manoeuvres as they were described\nin literature. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, an experiment\nwas performed to evaluate the execution time performance of multiple\nalternatives of the Join-Middle manoeuvre. This proof-of-concept experiment\nrevealed that the manoeuvre execution time can be reduced by 28 \\% through\nparallelising various steps without considerable secondary effects.

But these cache systems\nhave a worse write performance than the read performance because of the\nasymmetric I/O costs and the the internal GC mechanism. In addition to the\nperformance issues, since the NAND flash is a type of EEPROM device, the\nlifespan is also limited by the Program/Erase (P/E) cycles. So how to improve\nthe performance and the lifespan of flash-based caches in write-intensive\nscenarios has always been a hot issue. Benefiting from Open-Channel SSDs\n(OCSSDs), we propose a write-friendly flash-based disk cache system, which is\ncalled WLFC (Write Less in the Flash-based Cache). In WLFC, a strictly\nsequential writing method is used to minimize the write amplification. A new\nreplacement algorithm for the write buffer is designed to minimize the erase\ncount caused by the evicting. And a new data layout strategy is designed to\nminimize the metadata size persisted in SSDs. As a result, the Over-Provisioned\n(OP) space is completely removed, the erase count of the flash is greatly\nreduced, and the metadata size is 1/10 or less than that in BCache. Even with a\nsmall amount of metadata, the data consistency after the crash is still\nguaranteed. Compared with the existing mechanism, WLFC brings a 7%-80%\nreduction in write latency, a 1.07*-4.5* increment in write throughput, and a\n50%-88.9% reduction in erase count, with a moderate overhead in read\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 02:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 14:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

In the present\nwork, the spin current in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) with varying\nmagnetization is theoretically investigated. It has been observed that the spin\ncurrent in FGT presents the nonlinear behavior with respect to magnetization.\nThe in-plane and out-of-plane spin polarization emerges simultaneously, and the\nbilayer FGT can even exhibit arbitrary spin polarization thanks to the reduced\nsymmetry.

The\nsearch for terrestrial analogues of planetary bedforms, as well as\nenvironmental simulation experiments able to reproduce their formation in\nplanetary conditions, are powerful ways to question our understanding of\ngeomorphological processes towards unusual environmental conditions. Here, we\nperform sediment transport laboratory experiments in a closed-circuit wind\ntunnel placed in a vacuum chamber and operated at extremely low pressures to\nshow that Martian conditions belong to a previously unexplored saltation\nregime. The threshold wind speed required to initiate saltation is only\nquantitatively predicted by state-of-the art models up to a density ratio\nbetween grain and air of $4 \\times 10^5$, but unexpectedly falls to much lower\nvalues for higher density ratios. In contrast, impact ripples, whose emergence\nis continuously observed on the granular bed over the whole pressure range\ninvestigated, display a characteristic wavelength and propagation velocity\nessentially independent of pressure. A comparison of these findings with\nexisting models suggests that sediment transport at low Reynolds number but\nhigh grain-to-fluid density ratio may be dominated by collective effects\nassociated with grain inertia in the granular collisional layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

By reformulating the\ncomplex operations using octave convolutions, our model shows a strong ability\nto capture richer representations of MR images, while at the same time greatly\nreducing the spatial redundancy. More specifically, the input feature maps and\nconvolutional kernels are first split into two components (i.e., real and\nimaginary), which are then divided into four groups according to their spatial\nfrequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating\nand inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information\nacross different groups.

To get a\ncomplete picture of the evolution of star-planet systems one needs to consider\nthe impact of tides within both stellar radiative and convective zones. We aim\nto provide a general formalism to assess tidal dissipation in stellar radiative\nzones for all spectral types, allowing for the study of the dynamics of a given\nsystem throughout stellar evolution. We investigate the influence of stellar\nstructure and evolution on tidal dissipation in the radiative core of low-mass\nstars. From the study of adiabatic oscillations throughout the star, we compute\nthe energy flux transported by progressive internal gravity waves and the\ninduced tidal torque. We then study the influence of stellar structure and\nevolution on tidal dissipation of solar-type stars from the pre-main sequence\n(PMS) to the red giant branch (RGB). For a given star-planet system, tidal\ndissipation reaches a maximum value on the pre-main sequence for all stellar\nmasses. On the main sequence (MS), it decreases to become almost constant. The\ndissipation is then several orders of magnitude smaller for F-type stars than\nfor G and K-type stars. During the Sub-Giant phase and the RGB, tidal\ndissipation increases by several orders of magnitude, along with the expansion\nof the stellar envelope. We show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in\nthe convective zone dominates the evolution of the system during most of the\nPMS and the beginning of the main sequence. Tidal dissipation in the radiative\nzone then becomes the strongest contribution during the Sub-Giant phase and the\nRGB. We also find that the dissipation of a metal-poor star is stronger than\nthe dissipation of a metal-rich star during the PMS, the Sub-Giant phase and\nthe RGB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, almost all top-performing knowledge distillation methods need\nto access the original training data, which usually has a huge size and is\noften unavailable. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel data-free\napproach in this paper, named Dual Discriminator Adversarial Distillation\n(DDAD) to distill a neural network without any training data or meta-data. To\nbe specific, we use a generator to create samples through dual discriminator\nadversarial distillation, which mimics the original training data. The\ngenerator not only uses the pre-trained teacher's intrinsic statistics in\nexisting batch normalization layers but also obtains the maximum discrepancy\nfrom the student model. Then the generated samples are used to train the\ncompact student network under the supervision of the teacher. The proposed\nmethod obtains an efficient student network which closely approximates its\nteacher network, despite using no original training data. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech101 datasets for classification tasks. Moreover,\nwe extend our method to semantic segmentation tasks on several public datasets\nsuch as CamVid and NYUv2.

Star formation\nrates (SFRs) and stellar masses are obtained for all galaxies from SED fits.\nFor each jellyfish galaxy we determine the tail orientation with respect to the\ncluster centre and quantify the prominence of the radio tails with the 144 MHz\nshape asymmetry. After carefully accounting for redshift-dependent selection\neffects, we find that the frequency of jellyfish galaxies is relatively\nconstant from cluster to cluster. LoTSS jellyfish galaxies are preferentially\nfound at small clustercentric radius and large velocity offsets within their\nhost clusters and have radio tails that are oriented away from the cluster\ncentre. These galaxies also show enhanced star formation, relative to both\n'normal' cluster galaxies and isolated field galaxies, but generally fall\nwithin the scatter of the L144MHz - SFR relation.

The proposed method mimics the adaptive behaviour of retinal ganglion\ncells and allows input neurons to adapt their response to changes in the\nstatistics of the input. Thus, rather than passively receiving values and\nforwarding them to the hidden and output layers, the input layer acts as a\nself-regulating filter which emphasises deviations from the average while\nallowing the input neurons to become effectively desensitised to the average\nitself. Another merit of the proposed method is that it requires only one input\nneuron per variable, rather than an entire population of neurons as in the case\nof the commonly used conversion method based on Gaussian receptive fields. In\naddition, since the statistics of the input emerge naturally over time, it\nbecomes unnecessary to pre-process the data before feeding it to the network.\nThis enables spiking neural networks to process raw, non-normalised streaming\ndata.

When making a choice, the machine\nlearning practitioner has no understanding on the differences between models,\ntheir limits, where they agree and where they don't.

To do so we calculate ground-state properties of the\n$^{16}$O nucleus in the Hartree--Fock approach in a basis made up of plane\nwaves confined in a cube. We find that regularization cutoff effects manifest\nthemselves in two distinct ways: a strong sensitivity to the the counter-terms\nin attractive singular partial waves (related to the sign of the corresponding\nlow-energy constant) and to the correction for spurious deeply bound states\n(for high enough cutoffs). In fact the latter happens to deprive the\nHartree--Fock approximation of yielding bound solutions in nuclei. We conclude\nthat, when using a leading-order chiral potential in the Nogga--Timmermans--van\nKolck's power counting (with a regularization cutoff higher than the nucleon\nmass), one cannot produce a selfconsistent mean field free of spurious\nbound-state effects that can serve as a reference state for beyond-mean-field\nmethods. For high regularization cutoffs which yield an attractive $^3S_1$\ncontact potential, one can at best incorporate in the mean-field solution a\npartial correction for spurious bound states. Then the remaining correction has\nto be added to the residual interaction in a treatment beyond the Hartree--Fock\napproximation.

The principle\nof these networks consists in projecting graph signals using the\neigen-decomposition of their Laplacians, then achieving filtering in the\nspectral domain prior to back-project the resulting filtered signals onto the\ninput graph domain. However, the success of these operations is highly\ndependent on the relevance of the used Laplacians which are mostly handcrafted\nand this makes GCNs clearly sub-optimal. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nspectral GCN that learns not only the usual convolutional parameters but also\nthe Laplacian operators. The latter are designed \"end-to-end\" as a part of a\nrecursive Chebyshev decomposition with the particularity of conveying both the\ndifferential and the non-differential properties of the learned representations\n-- with increasing order and discrimination power -- without overparametrizing\nthe trained GCNs.

The\nkey ingredient in our study is played by Noether's celebrated theorem which,\ninformally speaking, states that symmetry leads to conserved quantities (e.g.,\nconservation of energy or conservation of momentum). In the realm of neural\nnetworks under gradient descent, model symmetries imply restrictions on the\ngradient path. E.g., we show that symmetry of activation functions leads to\nboundedness of weight matrices, for the specific case of linear activations it\nleads to balance equations of consecutive layers, data augmentation leads to\ngradient paths that have \"momentum\"-type restrictions, and time symmetry leads\nto a version of the Neural Tangent Kernel.\n  Symmetry alone does not specify the optimization path, but the more\nsymmetries are contained in the model the more restrictions are imposed on the\npath.

Weak\nsupervision in the form of domain-specific rules has been shown to be useful in\nsuch settings to automatically generate weakly labeled training data. However,\nlearning with weak rules is challenging due to their inherent heuristic and\nnoisy nature. An additional challenge is rule coverage and overlap, where prior\nwork on weak supervision only considers instances that are covered by weak\nrules, thus leaving valuable unlabeled data behind.\n  In this work, we develop a weak supervision framework (ASTRA) that leverages\nall the available data for a given task.

Finally, we construct a semi-supervised learning objective for\nend-to-end training with unlabeled data, domain-specific rules, and a small\namount of labeled data.

The new paradigm of \"learned index\" has significantly changed\nthe way of designing index structures in DBMS. The key insight is that indexes\ncould be regarded as learned models that predict the position of a lookup key\nin the dataset. While such studies show promising results in both lookup time\nand index size, they cannot efficiently support update operations. Although\nrecent studies have proposed some preliminary approaches to support update,\nthey are at the cost of scarifying the lookup performance as they suffer from\nthe overheads brought by imprecise predictions in the leaf nodes.\n  In this paper, we propose LIPP, a brand new framework of learned index to\naddress such issues. Similar with state-of-the-art learned index structures,\nLIPP is able to support all kinds of index operations, namely lookup query,\nrange query, insert, delete, update and bulkload. Meanwhile, we overcome the\nlimitations of previous studies by properly extending the tree structure when\ndealing with update operations so as to eliminate the deviation of location\npredicted by the models in the leaf nodes. Moreover, we further propose a\ndynamic adjustment strategy to ensure that the height of the tree index is\ntightly bounded and provide comprehensive theoretical analysis to illustrate\nit.

With the heterogeneous functional layers that cannot be\npro-cessed by the accelerators proposed for convolution layers only, modern\nend-to-end CNN acceleration so-lutions either transform the diverse computation\ninto matrix/vector arithmetic, which loses data reuse op-portunities in\nconvolution, or introduce dedicated functional unit to each kind of layer,\nwhich results in underutilization and high update expense. To enhance the\nwhole-life cost efficiency, we need an acceleration solution that is efficient\nin processing CNN layers and has the generality to apply to all kinds of\nexisting and emerging layers. To this end, we pro-pose GCONV Chain, a method to\nconvert the entire CNN computation into a chain of standard general\nconvolutions (GCONV) that can be efficiently pro-cessed by the existing CNN\naccelerators. This paper comprehensively analyzes the GCONV Chain model and\nproposes a full-stack implementation to support GCONV Chain. On one hand, the\nresults on seven var-ious CNNs demonstrate that GCONV Chain improves the\nperformance and energy efficiency of existing CNN accelerators by an average of\n3.4x and 3.2x re-spectively. On the other hand, we show that GCONV Chain\nprovides low whole-life costs for CNN accelera-tion, including both developer\nefforts and total cost of ownership for the users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

A choice of gas-surface interaction models is available to\nrepresent the physics of free-molecular flow under different conditions.

The optimal microstructure for a\nsingle load case is an orthogonal rank-3 laminate. A rank-3 laminate can be\ndescribed in terms of frame fields, which are also an important tool for mesh\ngeneration in both 2D and 3D.\n  We propose a method for generating multi-laminar structures from frame\nfields. Rather than relying on integrative approaches that find a\nparametrization based on the frame field, we find stream surfaces, represented\nas point clouds aligned with frame vectors, and we solve an optimization\nproblem to find well-spaced collections of such stream surfaces. The stream\nsurface tracing is unaffected by the presence of singularities outside the\nregion of interest. Neither stream surface tracing nor selecting well-spaced\nsurface rely on combed frame fields.\n  In addition to stream surface tracing and selection, we provide two methods\nfor generating structures from stream surface collections. One of these methods\nproduces volumetric solids by summing basis functions associated with each\npoint of the stream surface collection. The other method reinterprets point\nsampled stream surfaces as a spatial twist continuum and produces a\nhexahedralization by dualizing a graph representing the structure.\n  We demonstrate our methods on several frame fields produced using the\nhomogenization approach for topology optimization, boundary-aligned, algebraic\nframe fields, and frame fields computed from closed-form expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

In magnetic\nsystems, spin and exchange disorder can provide access to quantum criticality,\nfrustration, and spin dynamics, but broad tunability of these responses and a\ndeeper understanding of strong limit disorder is lacking. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that high entropy oxides present an unexplored route to designing\nquantum materials in which the presence of strong local compositional disorder\nhosted on a positionally ordered lattice can be used to generate highly tunable\nemergent magnetic behavior--from macroscopically ordered states to\nfrustration-driven dynamic spin interactions. Single crystal\nLa(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 films are used as a structurally uniform model\nsystem hosting a magnetic sublattice with massive microstate disorder in the\nform of site-to-site spin and exchange type inhomogeneity. A classical\nHeisenberg model is found to be sufficient to describe how compositionally\ndisordered systems can paradoxically host long-range magnetic uniformity and\ndemonstrates that balancing the populating elements based on their discrete\nquantum parameters can be used to give continuous control over ordering types\nand critical temperatures. Theory-guided experiments show that composite\nexchange values derived from the complex mix of microstate interactions can be\nused to design the required compositional parameters for a desired response.\nThese predicted materials are synthesized and found to possess an incipient\nquantum critical point when magnetic ordering types are designed to be in\ndirect competition; this leads to highly controllable exchange bias sensitivity\nin the monolithic single crystal films previously accessible only in\nintentionally designed bilayer heterojunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

This is a strong limitation as it makes very\ndifficult to reason about properties involving infinite computations, such as\ntype soundness, which cannot even be expressed. We show that this issue is only\napparent: the distinction between stuck and diverging computations is implicit\nin any big-step semantics and it just needs to be uncovered. To achieve this\ngoal, we develop a systematic study of big-step semantics: we introduce an\nabstract definition of what a big-step semantics is, we define a notion of\ncomputation by formalising the evaluation algorithm implicitly associated with\nany big-step semantics, and we show how to canonically extend a big-step\nsemantics to characterise stuck and diverging computations. Building on these\nnotions, we describe a general proof technique to show that a predicate is\nsound, that is, it prevents stuck computation, with respect to a big-step\nsemantics. One needs to check three properties relating the predicate and the\nsemantics and, if they hold, the predicate is sound. The extended semantics are\nessential to establish this meta-logical result, but are of no concerns to the\nuser, who only needs to prove the three properties of the initial big-step\nsemantics. Finally, we illustrate the technique by several examples, showing\nthat it is applicable also in cases where subject reduction does not hold,\nhence the standard technique for small-step semantics cannot be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 21:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 11:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 13:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

One of the biggest challenges in simulating\nsuch an extreme environment is to properly represent the effects of sub-grid\nconvection. Most GCMs use either a simplistic convective-adjustment\nparametrization or sophisticated (e.g., mass flux scheme) Earth-tuned\nparametrizations.

We performed a comparative study, focusing\non each model's ability to detect the onset of each attack while avoiding false\npositives resulting from unknown normal behavior. Our best-performing model\ndetected the true onset of every attack with zero false positives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 23:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

Comparisons between abundance maps\nobtained for CP stars and predictions from numerical simulations of atomic\ndiffusion have always proved unsatisfactory, with the blame routinely put on\ntheory. Expanding a previous study aimed at clarifying the question of the\nuniqueness of ZDM maps, this paper inverts the roles between observational\nmodeling and time-dependent diffusion results, casting a cold eye on essential\nassumptions and algorithms underlying ZDM, in particular the Tikhonov-style\nregularization functionals, from 1D to 3D. We show that these have been\nestablished solely for mathematical convenience, but that they in no way\nreflect the physical reality in the atmospheres of magnetic CP stars.\nRecognizing that the observed strong magnetic fields in most well-mapped stars\nrequire the field geometry to be force-free, we demonstrate that many published\nmaps do not meet this condition. There follows a discussion of the frequent\nchanges in magnetic and abundance maps of well observed stars and a caveat\nconcerning the use of least squares deconvolution in ZDM analyses. It emerges\nthat because of the complexity and non-linearity of the field-dependent\nchemical stratifications, Tikhonov based ZDM inversions cannot recover the true\nabundance and magnetic geometries. As our findings additionally show, there is\nno way to define a physically meaningful 3D regularization functional instead.\nZDM remains dysfunctional and does not provide any observational constraints\nfor the modeling of atomic diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Here, we report experiments with a simple such attention\nsystem that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks,\nwith relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer\nof the network produces a key-query vector pair; all queries are then pooled\ninto a global attention query.

But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand\nwell how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by\ntheir government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they\ntaken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some\nquantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the\nwell-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a\npragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple\nand obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff\nbetween health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming\na given number of phases for the epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health\nand economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of\neach phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical\nanalysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be\napplied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that\nbeing able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in\nFrance would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss of 231\nbillion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion\neuro. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the\neffectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically,\nwhereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health\nimpact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been\nmore severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the\nnatural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating\nmeasures every month over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more\nappropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 12:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

In particular dense WSNs are emerging as an important sensing\nplatforms for the Internet of Things (IoT). WSNs are able to generate huge\nvolumes of raw data, which require network structuring and efficient\ncollaboration between nodes to ensure efficient transmission. In order to\nreduce the amount of data carried in the network, data aggregation is used in\nWSNs to define a policy of data fusion and compression. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a model for data aggregation in a dense {WSN} with a single sink.\nThe model divides a circular coverage region centered at the sink into patches\nwhich are intersections of sectors of concentric rings, and data in each patch\nis aggregated at a single node before transmission. Nodes only communicate with\nother nodes in the same sector. Based on these assumptions, we formulate a\nlinear programming problem to maximize system lifetime by minimizing the\nmaximum proportionate energy consumption over all nodes. Under a wide variety\nof conditions, the optimal solution employs two transmissions mechanisms:\ndirect transmission, in which nodes send information directly to the sink; and\nstepwise transmission, in which nodes transmit information to adjacent nodes.\nAn exact formula is given for the proportionate energy consumption rate of the\nnetwork. Asymptotic forms of this exact solution are also derived, and are\nverified to agree with the linear programming solution. We investigate three\nstrategies for improving system lifetime: nonuniform energy and information\ndensity; iterated compression; and modifications of rings. We conclude that\niterated compression has the biggest effect in increasing system lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

We have performed\nexperiments varying the physical parameters listed above (e.g., gravity was\nvaried in reduced gravity aircraft flights). In all these experiments, a\nsubsonic jet of gas impinges vertically on a bed of sand or lunar soil simulant\nforming a localized scour hole beneath the jet. Videography captures the\nerosion and scour hole formation processes, and analysis of these videos\npost-test identifies the scaling of these processes.

Based on these insights, we\nhave developed an erosion rate model that can be applied to generalized\nsituations, such as the erosion of soil beneath a horizontal gas flow on a\nplanetary surface. This is important to lunar exploration because the rate of\nerosion beneath the rocket exhaust plume of a landing spacecraft will determine\nthe amount of sand-blasting damage that can be inflicted upon surrounding\nhardware. Although the rocket exhaust plume at the exit of the nozzle is\nsupersonic, the boundary layer on the lunar surface where erosion occurs is\nsubsonic. The model has been benchmarked through comparison with the Apollo\nlanding videos, which show the blowing lunar soil, and computational fluid\ndynamics simulations of those landings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 05:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The\nlarge and rapidly growing trend on developing graph processing systems focuses\nmostly on improving the performance by preprocessing the input graph and\nmodifying its layout. These systems usually take several hours to days to\ncomplete processing a single graph on high-end machines, let alone the overhead\nof pre-processing which most of the time can be dominant. Yet for most graph\napplications the exact answer is not always crucial, and providing a rough\nestimate of the final result is adequate. Approximate computing is introduced\nto trade off accuracy of results for computation or energy savings that could\nnot be achieved by conventional techniques alone. In this work, we design,\nimplement and evaluate GraphGuess, inspired from the domain of approximate\ngraph theory and extend it to a general, practical graph processing system.\nGraphGuess is essentially an approximate graph processing technique with\nadaptive correction, which can be implemented on top of any graph processing\nsystem. We build a vertex-centric processing system based on GraphGuess, where\nit allows the user to trade off accuracy for better performance. Our\nexperimental studies show that using GraphGuess can significantly reduce the\nprocessing time for large scale graphs while maintaining high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 19:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 23:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Here, a large number of 40\ncompositions are synthesized to investigate the origin of low thermal\nconductivity. Amongst, 29 possess single (nominally cubic) fluorite phases and\nmost of them are new compositionally complex (medium- or high-entropy)\ncompositions. One new finding is that doping 2 % of light element cations can\nfurther reduce thermal conductivity. This large data set enables the discovery\nof a negative correlation between the thermal conductivity and averaged radius\nratio of the 3+/5+ cations. While this ratio is still below the threshold for\nforming long-range ordered weberite phases, this correlation suggests the\nreduced thermal conductivity is related to short-range weberite order, which is\nindeed revealed by diffuse scattering in X-ray and neutron diffraction.\nSpecifically, neutron diffraction is used characterize five selected specimens.\nA better fit to a weberite structure is found at nanoscale (~1 nm). The\ncharacteristic length (domain size) is smaller but with stronger short-range\nordering in more insulative materials. As it approaches the Ioffe-Regel limit,\nthe phonon limit breaks down and \"diffusons\" give rise to the observed\namorphous-like thermal conductivity. Disordered oxygen sublattices are also\nconfirmed by neutron diffraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 19:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

The difference between the\nproposed algorithm and the previously proposed optimization of bilinear\ninterpolation based on ant colony algorithm (OBACA) is that AACA uses global\nweighting, whereas OBACA uses a local weighting scheme. The strength of the\nproposed global weighting of the AACA algorithm depends on employing solely the\npheromone matrix information present on any group of four adjacent pixels to\ndecide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not. Experimental\nresults are further provided to show the higher performance of the proposed\nAACA algorithm with reference to the algorithms mentioned in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 04:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Since volume HOEs have excellent angle selectivity and\nwavelength selectivity, HOEs of different wavelengths can be designed to\ndisplay images in different planes. Experimental and simulated results verify\nthe feasibility of this method. Experimental results show that the diffraction\nefficiencies of the red, green and blue HOEs are 75.2%, 73.1% and 67.5%.

Finding one's way involves finding possible uses of features of the\nworld that might be beneficial or avoiding those that might be harmful.\n\"Possible uses of X to accomplish Y\" are \"Affordances\". The number of uses of X\nis indefinite (or unknown), the different uses are unordered, are not listable,\nand are not deducible from one another. All biological adaptations are either\naffordances seized by heritable variation and selection or, far faster, by the\norganism acting in its world finding uses of X to accomplish Y. Based on this,\nwe reach rather astonishing conclusions: (1) Artificial general intelligence\nbased on universal Turing machines (UTMs) is not possible, since UTMs cannot\n\"find\" novel affordances. (2) Brain-mind is not purely classical physics for no\nclassical physics system can be an analogue computer whose dynamical behaviour\ncan be isomorphic to \"possible uses\". (3) Brain mind must be partly\nquantum-supported by increasing evidence at 6.0 sigma to 7.3 sigma. (4) Based\non Heisenberg's interpretation of the quantum state as \"potentia\" converted to\n\"actuals\" by measurement, where this interpretation is not a substance dualism,\na natural hypothesis is that mind actualizes potentia. This is supported at 5.2\nsigma. Then mind's actualizations of entangled brain-mind-world states are\nexperienced as qualia and allow \"seeing\" or \"perceiving\" of uses of X to\naccomplish Y. We can and do jury-rig. Computers cannot. (5) Beyond familiar\nquantum computers, we discuss the potentialities of trans-Turing-systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 11:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 18:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 07:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 16:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}
