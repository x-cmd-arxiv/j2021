The method is based on applying the original NAM to\nsolving the explanation problem in the framework of survival analysis. The\nbasic idea behind SurvNAM is to train the network by means of a specific\nexpected loss function which takes into account peculiarities of the survival\nmodel predictions and is based on approximating the black-box model by the\nextension of the Cox proportional hazards model which uses the well-known\nGeneralized Additive Model (GAM) in place of the simple linear relationship of\ncovariates. The proposed method SurvNAM allows performing the local and global\nexplanation. A set of examples around the explained example is randomly\ngenerated for the local explanation. The global explanation uses the whole\ntraining dataset. The proposed modifications of SurvNAM are based on using the\nLasso-based regularization for functions from GAM and for a special\nrepresentation of the GAM functions using their weighted linear and non-linear\nparts, which is implemented as a shortcut connection. A lot of numerical\nexperiments illustrate the SurvNAM efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 16:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

More importantly, our method supports open-world scenarios,\nincluding both image and text, without any re-training, fine-tuning, or\npost-processing. To be specific, we propose a brand new paradigm of text-guided\nimage generation and manipulation based on the superior characteristics of a\npretrained GAN model.

Secondly, since the training pairs are hard to be collected,\ntraining on limited data can easily lead to over-fitting problem. To tackle\nthese two issues, we introduce a novel dehazing network using 2D discrete\nwavelet transform, namely DW-GAN.

In\nthis situation, users only provide feedback on the exposed items and they may\nnot leave feedback on other items since they have not been exposed to them by\nthe deployed system. As a result, the collected feedback dataset that is used\nto evaluate a new model is influenced by the deployed system, as a form of\nclosed loop feedback. In this paper, we show that the typical offline\nevaluation of recommender systems suffers from the so-called Simpson's paradox.\nSimpson's paradox is the name given to a phenomenon observed when a significant\ntrend appears in several different sub-populations of observational data but\ndisappears or is even reversed when these sub-populations are combined\ntogether. Our in-depth experiments based on stratified sampling reveal that a\nvery small minority of items that are frequently exposed by the deployed system\nplays a confounding factor in the offline evaluation of recommendation systems.\nIn addition, we propose a novel evaluation methodology that takes into account\nthe confounder, i.e the deployed system's characteristics.

To leverage this information, words are typically translated into\nword embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words\n-- through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization.\nHowever, learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data\ncan be challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new\ndomain, e.g., the word \"positive\" typically has positive sentiment, but often\nhas negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient is\ntested positive for a disease. Intuitively, we expect that only a small number\nof domain-specific words may have new meanings/usages. We propose an intuitive\ntwo-stage estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to\nefficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining\nlarge-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text\ndata. We bound the generalization error of our estimator, proving that it can\nachieve the same accuracy (compared to not transfer learning) with\nsubstantially less domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings\nare altered between domains.

We find that when a stable soliton is generated, it's\nstate-of-polarization shifts toward a stable state and when the soliton is\ngenerated with excess power levels it experiences relaxation oscillations in\nits intensity and timing. On the other hand, when a soliton is generated in an\nunstable state-of-polarization, it either decays in intensity until it\ndisappears, or its temporal width decreases until it explodes into several\nsolitons and then it disappears. We also found that when two solitons are\nsimultaneously generated close to each other, they attract each other until\nthey collide and merge into a single soliton. Although, these two solitons are\ngenerated with different states-of-polarization, they shift their\nstate-of-polarization closer to each other until the polarization coincides\nwhen they collide. We support our findings by numerical calculations of a\nnon-Lagrangian approach by simulating the Ginzburg-Landau equation governing\nthe dynamics of solitons in a laser cavity.

Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations and\ntransmission probability calculations were conducted on Ni(111)/$n$hBN/Ni(111)\nwith $n$ = 2, 3, 4, and 5 as well as on Ni(111)/hBN-Gr-hBN/Ni(111). Slabs with\nmagnetic alignment in an anti-parallel configuration (APC) and parallel\nconfiguration (PC) were considered. The pd-hybridizations at both the upper and\nlower interfaces between the Ni slabs and hBN were found to stabilize the\nsystem. The Ni/nhBN/Ni magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) was found to exhibit a\nhigh tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio at ~0.28 eV for $n$ = 2 and 0.34\neV for $n$ > 2, which are slightly higher than the Fermi energy. The observed\nshifting of this high TMR ratio originates from the transmission of electrons\nthrough the surface states of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital of Ni atoms at interfaces\nwhich are hybridized with the $p_z$-orbital of N atoms. In the case of $n$ > 2,\nthe proximity effect causes an evanescent wave, contributing to decreasing\ntransmission probability but increasing the TMR ratio. However, TMR ratio, as\nwell as transmission probability, was found to be increased, by replacing the\nunhybridized hBN layer of the Ni/3hBN/Ni MTJ with graphene, thus becoming\nNi/hBN-Gr-hBN/Ni. A TMR ratio as high as ~1200% was observed at an energy of\n0.34 eV, which is higher than the Fermi energy. Furthermore, a design is\nproposed for a device based on a new reading mechanism using the high TMR\nobserved just above the Fermi energy level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 19:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

For example, deep embedded clustering (DEC) has greatly\nimproved the unsupervised clustering performance, by using stacked autoencoders\nfor representation learning. However, one weakness of deep modeling is that the\nlocal neighborhood structure in the original space is not necessarily preserved\nin the latent space. To preserve local geometry, various methods have been\nproposed in the supervised and semi-supervised learning literature (e.g.,\nspectral clustering and label propagation) using graph Laplacian\nregularization. In this paper, we combine the strength of deep representation\nlearning with measure propagation (MP), a KL-divergence based graph\nregularization method originally used in the semi-supervised scenario. The main\nassumption of MP is that if two data points are close in the original space,\nthey are likely to belong to the same class, measured by KL-divergence of class\nmembership distribution. By taking the same assumption in the unsupervised\nlearning scenario, we propose our Deep Embedded Clustering Aided by Measure\nPropagation (DECAMP) model. We evaluate DECAMP on short text clustering tasks.\nOn three public datasets, DECAMP performs competitively with other\nstate-of-the-art baselines, including baselines using additional data to\ngenerate word embeddings used in the clustering process. As an example, on the\nStackoverflow dataset, DECAMP achieved a clustering accuracy of 79%, which is\nabout 5% higher than all existing baselines.

First, we provide an\nevidence-based analytical approach which relates the human mobility patterns,\nsocial distancing attitudes and population density, with entropic measures\nwhich depict for erraticity of human contact behaviors. Second, we investigate\nthe correlations between the aggregated mobility and entropic measures versus\nfive external economic indicators. Finally,we show how entropic measures\nrepresents a useful tool for testing the limitations of typical assumptions in\nepidemiological and mobility models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 23:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

While there are a number of\npossible organizations, document-ordered indexes are the most common, since\nthey are amenable to various query types, support index updates, and allow for\nefficient dynamic pruning operations. One disadvantage with document-ordered\nindexes is that high-scoring documents can be distributed across the document\nidentifier space, meaning that index traversal algorithms that terminate early\nmight put search effectiveness at risk. The alternative is impact-ordered\nindexes, which primarily support top-k disjunctions, but also allow for anytime\nquery processing, where the search can be terminated at any time, with search\nquality improving as processing latency increases. Anytime query processing can\nbe used to effectively reduce high-percentile tail latency which is essential\nfor operational scenarios in which a service level agreement (SLA) imposes\nresponse time requirements. In this work, we show how document-ordered indexes\ncan be organized such that they can be queried in an anytime fashion, enabling\nstrict latency control with effective early termination.

The\nfraction of occulted stellar flux is roughly proportional to the optically\nthick area of the planet, the extent of which depends on the opacity of the\nplanet's gaseous envelope at the observed wavelengths. Chemical species, haze,\nand clouds are now routinely detected in exoplanet atmospheres through rather\nsmall features in transmission spectra, i.e., collections of planet-to-star\narea ratios across multiple spectral bins and/or photometric bands.\nTechnological advances have led to a shrinking of the error bars down to a few\ntens of parts per million (ppm) per spectral point for the brightest targets.\nThe upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is anticipated to deliver\ntransmission spectra with precision down to 10 ppm. The increasing precision of\nmeasurements requires a reassessment of the approximations hitherto adopted in\nastrophysical models, including transit light curve models.

One\ncommon type of method that can mitigate the impact of label noise can be viewed\nas supervised robust methods; one can simply replace the CCE loss with a loss\nthat is robust to label noise, or re-weight training samples and down-weight\nthose with higher loss values. Recently, another type of method using\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed, which augments these\nsupervised robust methods to exploit (possibly) noisy samples more effectively.\nAlthough supervised robust methods perform well across different data types,\nthey have been shown to be inferior to the SSL methods on image classification\ntasks under label noise. Therefore, it remains to be seen that whether these\nsupervised robust methods can also perform well if they can utilize the\nunlabeled samples more effectively. In this paper, we show that by initializing\nsupervised robust methods using representations learned through contrastive\nlearning leads to significantly improved performance under label noise.\nSurprisingly, even the simplest method (training a classifier with the CCE\nloss) can outperform the state-of-the-art SSL method by more than 50\\% under\nhigh label noise when initialized with contrastive learning.

We describe the design, tools and context of the strategies\napplied. SonarQube, a tool commonly used in production environments, is used\nfor measuring the metrics. The penalisation strategy is based on a SonarQube\nquality gate. The reward strategy is based on a contest, where an automatic\njudge tool is devised to provide an online leaderboard with a classification\nbased on the SonarQube metrics. An empirical study is conducted to determine\nwhich of the strategies works better to help the students/trainees keep the\nTechnical Debt low.

This work\nproposes an intuitive methodology to mathematically model electro-intensive\nprocesses in order to assess their flexibility potential. To this end, we\nintroduce the notion of reservoir, a storage of either material or energy, that\nallows models based on this paradigm to have interpretations close to the\nphysics of the processes.

We apply this methodology to two\nindustrial case studies, namely an induction furnace (linear model) and an\nindustrial cooling installation (nonlinear model), where we can achieve\nsignificant cost savings.

Currently, we are facing\nan elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the\ncoronavirus family. One of the modes of transmission of COVID- 19 is airborne\ntransmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets\nreleased by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing,\nor sneezing. Hence, public health officials have mandated the use of face masks\nwhich can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs,\ncommonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents\nan arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human\nfaces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are\nforced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same\nproblem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately\nidentifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a\nResNet-50 based architecture that performs well at recognizing masked faces.\nThe outcome of this study could be seamlessly integrated into existing face\nrecognition programs that are designed to detect faces for security\nverification purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 01:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

The proposed method trains the neural networks such that the expected\ntest likelihood is improved when topic model parameters are estimated by\nmaximizing the posterior probability using the priors based on the EM\nalgorithm. Since each step in the EM algorithm is differentiable, the proposed\nmethod can backpropagate the loss through the EM algorithm to train the neural\nnetworks. The expected test likelihood is maximized by a stochastic gradient\ndescent method using a set of multiple text corpora with an episodic training\nframework. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nbetter perplexity than existing methods using three real-world text document\nsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 01:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

In this context, this study proposes an accurate\nmethodology for the mechanical-probabilistic modelling of RC structures\nsubjected to reinforcements' corrosion.

Systems with higher complexity\noften exhibit topological constraints, which are independent of the Hamiltonian\nand may affect the shape of the distribution function as well. Here, we study a\nfurther source of heterogeneity, the curvature of spacetime arising from the\ngeneral theory of relativity. The present construction relies on three\nassumptions: first, the statistical ensemble is made of particles obeying\ngeodesic equations, which define the phase space of the system. Next, the\nmetric coefficients are time-symmetric, implying that, if thermodynamic\nequilibrium is achieved, all physical observables are independent of coordinate\ntime. Finally, ergodicity is enforced with respect to proper time, so that\nambiguity in the choice of a time variable for the statistical ensemble is\nremoved. Under these hypothesis, we derive the distribution function of\nthermodynamic equilibrium, and verify that it reduces to the Boltzmann\ndistribution in the classical limit. We further show that spacetime curvature\naffects physical observables, even far from the source of the metric. Two\nexamples are analyzed: an ideal gas in Schwarzschild spacetime and a charged\ngas in Kerr-Newman spacetime. In the Schwarzschild case, conservation of\nmacroscopic constraints, such as angular momentum, combined with relativistic\ndistortion of the distribution function can produce configurations with\ndecreasing density and growing azimuthal rotation velocity far from the event\nhorizon of the central mass. In the Kerr-Newman case, it is found that kinetic\nenergy associated with azimuthal rotations is an increasing function of the\nradial coordinate, and it eventually approaches a constant value corresponding\nto classical equipartition, even though spatial particle density decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 02:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

As a common practice, most previous works use\nmanually annotated 3D box labels, where the annotating process is expensive. In\nthis paper, we find that the precisely and carefully annotated labels may be\nunnecessary in monocular 3D detection, which is an interesting and\ncounterintuitive finding. Using rough labels that are randomly disturbed, the\ndetector can achieve very close accuracy compared to the one using the\nground-truth labels. We delve into this underlying mechanism and then\nempirically find that: concerning the label accuracy, the 3D location part in\nthe label is preferred compared to other parts of labels. Motivated by the\nconclusions above and considering the precise LiDAR 3D measurement, we propose\na simple and effective framework, dubbed LiDAR point cloud guided monocular 3D\nobject detection (LPCG). This framework is capable of either reducing the\nannotation costs or considerably boosting the detection accuracy without\nintroducing extra annotation costs. Specifically, It generates pseudo labels\nfrom unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Thanks to accurate LiDAR 3D measurements in\n3D space, such pseudo labels can replace manually annotated labels in the\ntraining of monocular 3D detectors, since their 3D location information is\nprecise. LPCG can be applied into any monocular 3D detector to fully use\nmassive unlabeled data in a self-driving system. As a result, in KITTI\nbenchmark, we take the first place on both monocular 3D and BEV\n(bird's-eye-view) detection with a significant margin.

However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia\nrecommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are\nimplicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering\nthat items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue\nthat the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal\ncontents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and\nfurther boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure\nmining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.\nTo be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware\nstructure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality\nand aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the\nlearned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject\nhigh-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item\nrepresentations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering\nmethods to make more accurate recommendations.

Here we update the latest\ndevelopment of the predictive model for MeV electrons inside the Earth's outer\nradiation belt.

They have shown\nsuperior quality for reconstructing fine textures from badly-distorted images\nand have potential to bring next-generation cameras and displays to our daily\nlife. However, CNNs demand intensive computing power for generating\nhigh-resolution videos and defy conventional sparsity techniques when rendering\ndense details. Therefore, finding new possibilities in regular sparsity is\ncrucial to enable large-scale deployment of CNN-based computational imaging.\n  In this paper, we consider a fundamental but yet well-explored approach --\nalgebraic sparsity -- for energy-efficient CNN acceleration. We propose to\nbuild CNN models based on ring algebra that defines multiplication, addition,\nand non-linearity for n-tuples properly. Then the essential sparsity will\nimmediately follow, e.g. n-times reduction for the number of real-valued\nweights. We define and unify several variants of ring algebras into a modeling\nframework, RingCNN, and make comparisons in terms of image quality and hardware\ncomplexity. On top of that, we further devise a novel ring algebra which\nminimizes complexity with component-wise product and achieves the best quality\nusing directional ReLU. Finally, we implement an accelerator, eRingCNN, in two\nsettings, n=2 and 4 (50% and 75% sparsity), with 40 nm technology to support\nadvanced denoising and super-resolution at up to 4K UHD 30 fps.

In this work,\nwe prove two problems, left open in the aforementioned paper, namely a\ngeneralisation of one of their main theorems to arbitrary alphabets and a\nslight modification of another theorem such that we characterise the circular\nuniversality by the universality. On the way, we present deep insights into the\nbehaviour of the remainder of the so called arch factorisation by Hebrard when\nrepetitions of words are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 05:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

This allows a tabla player to uniquely emphasize parts of the\nrhythmic cycle (theka) in order to mark the salient positions. An analysis of\nthe loudness dynamics and timing deviations at various cycle positions is an\nimportant part of musicological studies on the expressivity in tabla\naccompaniment. To achieve this at a corpus-level, and not restrict it to the\nfew recordings that manual annotation can afford, it is helpful to have access\nto an automatic tabla transcription system. Although a few systems have been\nbuilt by training models on labeled tabla strokes, the achieved accuracy does\nnot necessarily carry over to unseen instruments. In this article, we report\nour work towards building an instrument-independent stroke classification\nsystem for accompaniment tabla based on the more easily available tabla solo\naudio tracks. We present acoustic features that capture the distinctive\ncharacteristics of tabla strokes and build an automatic system to predict the\nlabel as one of a reduced, but musicologically motivated, target set of four\nstroke categories. To address the lack of sufficient labeled training data, we\nturn to common data augmentation methods and find the use of pitch-shifting\nbased augmentation to be most promising. We then analyse the important features\nand highlight the problem of their instrument-dependence while motivating the\nuse of more task-specific data augmentation strategies to improve the diversity\nof training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 05:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

For example in neuroscience, it is of critical importance\nto understand the relationship between the functional neural processes and\nanatomical connectivities. Modern neuroimaging techniques allow us to\nseparately measure functional connectivity through fMRI imaging and the\nunderlying white matter wiring through diffusion imaging. Previous studies have\nshown that structural edges in brain networks improve the inference of\nfunctional edges and vice versa. In this paper, we investigate the idea of\ncoupled networks through an optimization framework by focusing on interactions\nbetween structural edges and functional edges of brain networks. We consider\nboth types of edges as observed instances of random variables that represent\ndifferent underlying network processes. The proposed framework does not depend\non Gaussian assumptions and achieves a more robust performance on general data\ncompared with existing approaches. To incorporate existing domain knowledge\ninto such studies, we propose a novel formulation to place hard network\nconstraints on the noise term while estimating interactions.

We investigated the spectral characteristics\nof different head impact types with kinematics classification. Methods: Data\nwas analyzed from 3,262 head impacts from lab reconstruction, American\nfootball, mixed martial arts, and publicly available car crash data. A random\nforest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angular\nvelocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football, car crash,\nmixed martial arts). To test the classifier robustness, another 271\nlab-reconstructed impacts were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards.\nFinally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models\nwere built for brain strain. Results: The classifier reached a median accuracy\nof 96% over 1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. The most\nimportant features in the classification included both low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocity\nfeatures. Different head impact types had different distributions of spectral\ndensities in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral\ndensities of MMA impacts were higher in high-frequency range than in the\nlow-frequency range). The type-specific regression showed a generally higher\nR^2-value than baseline models without classification. Conclusion: The\nmachine-learning-based classifier enables a better understanding of the impact\nkinematics spectral density in different sports, and it can be applied to\nevaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems and on-field data\naugmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 06:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 16:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 20:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In addition, the existing works assume that all\nroad segments can employ the same sampling frequency of traffic states, which\nis impractical. In this paper, we propose new measurements to model the spatial\ncorrelations among traffic data and show that the resulting correlation\npatterns vary significantly under various traffic situations. We propose a\nHeterogeneous Spatial Correlation (HSC) model to capture the spatial\ncorrelation based on a specific measurement, where the traffic data of varying\nroad segments can be heterogeneous (i.e. obtained with different sampling\nfrequency).

In addition, we show that the observed positioning of the\nnucleoid at midcell is due to the out-of-equilibrium process of messenger RNA\n(mRNA) synthesis and degradation: mRNAs apply a pressure on both sides of the\nnucleoid, localizing it to midcell. We demonstrate that, as the cell grows, the\nproduction of these mRNAs is responsible for the nucleoid splitting into two\nlobes, and for their well-known positioning to 1/4 and 3/4 positions on the\nlong cell axis. Finally, our model quantitatively accounts for the observed\nexpansion of the nucleoid when the pool of cytoplasmic mRNAs is depleted.\nOverall, our study suggests that steric interactions and out-of-equilibrium\neffects of the TTM are key drivers of the internal spatial organization of\nbacterial cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Disks not\ndetected in 13CO line emission are also faint and often unresolved in the\ncontinuum emission at an angular resolution of around 0.2 arcseconds. Focusing\non the Lupus SFR, the aim of this work is to investigate whether the population\nof CO-faint disks comprises radially extended and low mass disks - as commonly\nassumed so far - or if it is of intrinsically radially compact disks, an\ninterpretation that we propose in this paper. The latter scenario was already\nproposed for individual sources or small samples of disks, while this work\ntargets a large population of disks in a single SFR for which statistical\narguments can be made. A new grid of physical-chemical models of compact disks\nhas been run with DALI in order to cover a region of the parameter space that\nhad not been explored before with this code. Such models have been compared\nwith 12CO and 13CO ALMA observations of faint disks in Lupus. Disks that are\nnot detected in 13CO emission and with faint or undetected 12CO emission are\nconsistent with compact disk models. For radially compact disk, the emission of\nCO isotopologues is mostly optically thick and it scales with the surface area:\ni.e., it is fainter for smaller objects. The fraction of compact disks is\npotentially between roughly 50% and 60% of the entire Lupus sample. Deeper\nobservations of 12CO and 13CO at a moderate angular resolution will allow us to\ndistinguish whether faint disks are intrinsically compact, or if they are\nextended but faint, without the need of resolving them. If the fainter end of\nthe disk population observed by ALMA disk surveys is consistent with such\nobjects being very compact, this will either create a tension with viscous\nspreading or require MHD winds or external processes to truncate the disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 10:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

During the testing phase, the point-level annotations are not\nconsidered to evaluate the counting accuracy, which means the point-level\nannotations are redundant. Hence, it is desirable to develop weakly-supervised\ncounting methods that just rely on count-level annotations, a more economical\nway of labeling. Current weakly-supervised counting methods adopt the CNN to\nregress a total count of the crowd by an image-to-count paradigm. However,\nhaving limited receptive fields for context modeling is an intrinsic limitation\nof these weakly-supervised CNN-based methods.

For example, anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect is\nutilized to read out the information stored by various magnetic structures,\nwhich usually originates from atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the\napplication of AMR in antiferromagnet-based spintronics is still hindered by\nrather small AMR value.

In this paper, we present RANSIC (RANdom Sampling with\nInvariant Compatibility), a fast and highly robust method applicable to both\nproblems based on a new paradigm combining random sampling with invariance and\ncompatibility. Generally, RANSIC starts with randomly selecting small subsets\nfrom the correspondence set, then seeks potential inliers as graph vertices\nfrom the random subsets through the compatibility tests of invariants\nestablished in each problem, and eventually returns the eligible inliers when\nthere exists at least one K-degree vertex (K is automatically updated depending\non the problem) and the residual errors satisfy a certain termination condition\nat the same time. In multiple synthetic and real experiments, we demonstrate\nthat RANSIC is fast for use, robust against over 95% outliers, and also able to\nrecall approximately 100% inliers, outperforming other state-of-the-art solvers\nfor both the rotation search and the point cloud registration problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 08:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 08:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Several SSDA\nmethods have been proposed recently, which however fail to fully exploit the\nvalue of the few labeled target samples. In this paper, we propose Enhanced\nCategorical Alignment and Consistency Learning (ECACL), a holistic SSDA\nframework that incorporates multiple mutually complementary domain alignment\ntechniques. ECACL includes two categorical domain alignment techniques that\nachieve class-level alignment, a strong data augmentation based technique that\nenhances the model's generalizability and a consistency learning based\ntechnique that forces the model to be robust with image perturbations. These\ntechniques are applied on one or multiple of the three inputs (labeled source,\nunlabeled target, and labeled target) and align the domains from different\nperspectives.

Nevertheless, creating and\nmaintaining custom ACLs can introduce a high cognitive burden on average OSNs\nusers since it normally requires assessing the trustworthiness of a large\nnumber of contacts. In principle, community detection algorithms can be\nleveraged to support the generation of ACLs by mapping a set of examples (i.e.\ncontacts labelled as untrusted) to the emerging communities inside the user's\nego-network. However, unlike users' access-control preferences, traditional\ncommunity-detection algorithms do not take the homophily characteristics of\nsuch communities into account (i.e. attributes shared among members).\nConsequently, this strategy may lead to inaccurate ACL configurations and\nprivacy breaches under certain homophily scenarios.

For the classification/identification of faces, a\nSpatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) is used. Finally, we\nevaluate our approach on a challenging dynamic 3D facial expression dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 09:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 08:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The proposed method exploits the fact that the air in a cold pool is\ndenser than the air above it. It leads us to define cold pool soundings as\nthose for which the mixed-layer height is smaller than 400 m. We first test\nthis criterion by verifying its consistency with surface temperature and\nprecipitation in a realistic high-resolution simulation over the western\ntropical Atlantic. Applying it to EUREC4A data, we then identify 7% of EUREC4A\ndropsondes and radiosondes as cold pool soundings. In two selected case\nstudies, we find that cold pools soundings coincide with mesoscale cloud arcs\nand temperature drops in the surface time series. Statistics for the entire\ncampaign further characterize the signature of cold pools in temperature,\nhumidity and wind profiles. In the presence of wind shear, we show in\nparticular that the spreading of cold pools is favored downshear, suggesting\ndownward momentum transport by unsaturated downdrafts. These results support\nthe robustness of our simple method in different environmental conditions and\nillustrate the new insights it offers for the characterization of cold pools\nand their environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 09:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

This finding stimulates\nwide interests to study the interplay of these competing electronic orders and\npossible exotic excitations in the superconducting state. Here, in order to\nfurther clarify the nature of density-wave-like transition in these kagome\nsuperconductors, we performed 51V and 133Cs nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nmeasurements on the CsV3Sb5 single crystal. A first-order phase transition\nassociated with orbital ordering is revealed by observing a sudden splitting of\norbital shift in 51V NMR spectrum at the structural transition temperature Ts ~\n94 K. In contrast, the quadrupole splitting from a charge-density-wave (CDW)\norder on 51V NMR spectrum only appears gradually below Ts with a typical\nsecond-order transition behavior, suggesting that the CDW order is a secondary\nelectronic order. Moreover, combined with 133Cs NMR spectrum, the present\nresult also confirms a three-dimensional structural modulation with a 2ax2ax2c\nperiod. Above Ts, the temperature-dependent Knight shift and nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) further indicate the existence of\nremarkable magnetic fluctuations from vanadium 3d orbitals, which are\nsuppressed due to orbital ordering below Ts. The present results strongly\nsupport that, besides CDW order, the previously claimed density-wave-like\ntransition also involves a dominant orbital order, suggesting a rich orbital\nphysics in these kagome superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 09:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Using the edge server as an intermediary can effectively collect\nsensor data, perform local model training, and upload model parameters for\nglobal aggregation. So this paper proposes a new framework for resource\nallocation in a hierarchical network supported by edge computing. In this\nframework, we minimize the weighted sum of system cost and learning cost by\noptimizing bandwidth, computing frequency, power allocation and subcarrier\nassignment. To solve this challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem, we\nfirst decouple the bandwidth optimization problem(P1) from the whole problem\nand obtain a closed-form solution. The remaining computational frequency,\npower, and subcarrier joint optimization problem(P2) can be further decomposed\ninto two sub-problems: latency and computational frequency optimization\nproblem(P3) and transmission power and subcarrier optimization problem(P4). P3\nis a convex optimization problem that is easy to solve. In the joint\noptimization problem(P4), the optimal power under each subcarrier selection can\nbe obtained first through the successive convex approximation(SCA) algorithm.\nSubstituting the optimal power value obtained back to P4, the subproblem can be\nregarded as an assignment problem, so the Hungarian algorithm can be\neffectively used to solve it. The solution of problem P2 is accomplished by\nsolving P3 and P4 iteratively. To verify the performance of the algorithm, we\ncompare the proposed algorithm with five algorithms; namely Equal bandwidth\nallocation, Learning cost guaranteed, Greedy subcarrier allocation, System cost\nguaranteed and Time-biased algorithm.

As a non-polar crystal, intrinsic bilayer graphene possesses little\ninfrared response at its transverse optical (TO) phonon frequency. The reported\noptical detection of local strain is enabled by applying a vertical electrical\nfield that breaks the symmetry of the two graphene layers and introduces finite\nelectrical dipole moment to graphene phonon. The activated phonon further\ninteracts with continuum electronic transitions, and generates a strong Fano\nresonance.

However, most of the existing\nwatermarking methods focus on verifying the copyright of the model, which do\nnot support the authentication and management of users' fingerprints, thus can\nnot satisfy the requirements of commercial copyright protection. In addition,\nthe query modification attack which was proposed recently can invalidate most\nof the existing backdoor-based watermarking methods. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we propose a method to protect the intellectual\nproperties of DNN models by using an additional class and steganographic\nimages. Specifically, we use a set of watermark key samples to embed an\nadditional class into the DNN, so that the watermarked DNN will classify the\nwatermark key sample as the predefined additional class in the copyright\nverification stage. We adopt the least significant bit (LSB) image\nsteganography to embed users' fingerprints into watermark key images. Each user\nwill be assigned with a unique fingerprint image so that the user's identity\ncan be authenticated later. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed\nmethod can protect the copyright of DNN models effectively. On Fashion-MNIST\nand CIFAR-10 datasets, the proposed method can obtain 100% watermark accuracy\nand 100% fingerprint authentication success rate. In addition, the proposed\nmethod is demonstrated to be robust to the model fine-tuning attack, model\npruning attack, and the query modification attack.

We explore joint effects of input gamma-band\noscillations and noise on the dynamics of several firing rate models of WM. The\nconsidered models have a metastable active regime, i.e. they demonstrate\nlong-lasting transient post-stimulus firing rate elevation. We start from a\nsingle excitatory-inhibitory circuit and demonstrate that either gamma-band or\nnoise input could stabilize the active regime, thus supporting WM retention. We\nthen consider a system of two circuits with excitatory intercoupling. We find\nthat fast coupling allows for better stabilization by common noise compared to\nindependent noise and stronger amplification of this effect by in-phase gamma\ninputs compared to anti-phase inputs. Finally, we consider a multi-circuit\nsystem comprised of two clusters, each containing a group of circuits receiving\na common noise input and a group of circuits receiving independent noise. Each\ncluster is associated with its own local gamma generator, so all its circuits\nreceive gamma-band input in the same phase.

We\npropose a heuristic parametrization of this complicated process in the spirit\nof Lynden-Bell's theory of violent relaxation for collisionless stellar\nsystems. We derive a generalized wave equation (that was introduced\nphenomenologically in [P.H. Chavanis, Eur. Phys. J.

The wave equation satisfies an $H$-theorem for the Lynden-Bell entropy\nand relaxes towards a stable equilibrium state which is a maximum of entropy at\nfixed mass and energy. This equilibrium state represents the most probable\nstate of a Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halo. It generically has a\ncore-halo structure. The quantum core prevents gravitational collapse and may\nsolve the core-cusp problem. The isothermal halo leads to flat rotation curves\nin agreement with the observations. These results are consistent with the\nphenomenology of dark matter halos. Furthermore, as shown in a previous paper\n[P.H. Chavanis, Phys. Rev.

To this end, a series of MVC methods focusing on how to\nintegrate the loss from each view have been proposed in the past few years.\nAmong these methods, the mainstream idea is assigning weights to each view and\nthen combining them linearly. In this paper, inspired by the effectiveness of\nnon-linear combination in instance learning and the auto-weighted approaches,\nwe propose Non-Linear Fusion for Self-Paced Multi-View Clustering (NSMVC),\nwhich is totally different from the the conventional linear-weighting\nalgorithms. In NSMVC, we directly assign different exponents to different views\naccording to their qualities. By this way, the negative impact from the corrupt\nviews can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, to address the non-convex issue\nof the MVC model, we further define a novel regularizer-free modality of\nSelf-Paced Learning (SPL), which fits the proposed non-linear model perfectly.\nExperimental results on various real-world data sets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 12:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

SO2 contamination of the ALMA\nPH3-line is minimal. Net abundances for PH3, in the gas column above ~55 km,\nare up to ~20 ppb planet-wide with JCMT, and ~7 ppb with ALMA (but with\nsignal-loss possible on scales approaching planetary size). Derived abundances\nwill differ if PH3 occupies restricted altitudes - molecules in the clouds will\ncontribute significantly less absorption at line-centre than equivalent numbers\nof mesospheric molecules - but in the latter zone, PH3 lifetime is expected to\nbe short. Given we recover phosphine, we suggest possible solutions (requiring\nsubstantial further testing): a small collisional broadening coefficient could\ngive narrow lines from lower altitude, or a high eddy diffusion coefficient\ncould allow molecules to survive longer at higher altitudes. Alternatively, PH3\ncould be actively produced by an unknown mechanism in the mesosphere, but this\nwould need to be in addition to cloud-level PH3 detected retrospectively by\nPioneer-Venus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 13:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

The dependent variables in the equations for the dynamics of\ngravito-inertial waves (GIWs) then become separable into radial and horizontal\nparts as in the non-rotating case. The TAR is built on the assumptions that the\nstar is spherical (i.e. its centrifugal deformation is neglected) and uniformly\nrotating. We study the feasibility of carrying out a generalisation of the TAR\nto account for the centrifugal acceleration in the case of strongly deformed\nuniformly and rapidly rotating stars (and planets), and to identify the\nvalidity domain of this approximation. We built analytically a complete\nformalism that allows the study of the dynamics of GIWs in spheroidal\ncoordinates which take into account the flattening of rapidly rotating stars by\nassuming the hierarchies of frequencies adopted within the TAR in the spherical\ncase and by deriving a generalised Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal\neigenfunctions of the GIWs and their asymptotic wave periods, which can be used\nto probe the structure and dynamics of rotating deformed stars with\nasteroseismology. Using 2D ESTER stellar models, we determine the validity\ndomain of the generalised TAR as a function of the rotation rate of the star\nnormalised by its critical angular velocity and its pseudo-radius. This\ngeneralisation allows us to study the signature of the centrifugal effects on\nGIWs in rapidly rotating deformed stars.

We take into account the fact that not all\nregions of an image have the same importance from the security perspective.\nHence, we propose a transmission scheme, where the source employs a hybrid\nmethod to realize both the error-free data delivery of public regions\ncontaining less-important pixels; and an artificial noise (AN)-aided\ntransmission scheme to provide security for the regions containing large amount\nof information. Moreover, in order to reinforce system's security,\nfountain-based packet delivery is adopted: First, the source node encodes image\npackets into fountain-like packets prior to sending them over the air. The\nsecrecy of our proposed scheme will be achieved if the legitimate destination\ncorrectly receives the entire image source packets, while conforming to the\nlatency limits of the system, before Eves can obtain the important regions.\nAccordingly, the secrecy performance of our scheme is characterized by deriving\nthe closed-form expression for the quality-of-security (QoSec) violation\nprobability. Moreover, our proposed wireless image delivery scheme leverages\nthe deep neural network (DNN) and learns to maintain optimized transmission\nparameters, while achieving a low QoSec violation probability.

This improves\nupon the previous best rate $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa^2)$ known for a variance\nreduced RR method in the strongly-convex case due to Ying, Yuan and Sayed\n(2020). Second, we obtain the first sublinear rate for general convex problems.\nThird, we establish similar fast rates for Cyclic-SVRG and Shuffle-Once-SVRG.\nFinally, we develop and analyze a more general variance reduction scheme for\nRR, which allows for less frequent updates of the control variate. We\ncorroborate our theoretical results with suitably chosen experiments on\nsynthetic and real datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 14:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

As a\ncompromise, machine learning can be used to improve the run time performance of\nexact algorithms in a matheuristics framework. In this paper, we use a pruning\nheuristic leveraging machine learning as a pre-processing step followed by an\nexact Integer Programming approach. We apply this approach to sparsify\ninstances of the classical travelling salesman problem. Our approach learns\nwhich edges in the underlying graph are unlikely to belong to an optimal\nsolution and removes them, thus sparsifying the graph and significantly\nreducing the number of decision variables. We use carefully selected features\nderived from linear programming relaxation, cutting planes exploration,\nminimum-weight spanning tree heuristics and various other local and statistical\nanalysis of the graph. Our learning approach requires very little training data\nand is amenable to mathematical analysis. We demonstrate that our approach can\nreliably prune a large fraction of the variables in TSP instances from\nTSPLIB/MATILDA (>85%$) while preserving most of the optimal tour edges. Our\napproach can successfully prune problem instances even if they lie outside the\ntraining distribution, resulting in small optimality gaps between the pruned\nand original problems in most cases.

In addition, the approach to the stationary state exhibits a dynamical\nphase transition, which can be interpreted as a traveling front separating\nspatial regions for which the probability density has relaxed to the NESS from\nthose where it has not. One can establish the existence of the phase transition\nby carrying out an asymptotic expansion of the exact solution. In this paper we\ndevelop an alternative, direct method for characterizing the approach to the\nNESS of a stochastic process with resetting that is based on the calculation of\nthe so-called accumulation time. The latter is the analog of the mean first\npassage time of a search process, in which the survival probability density is\nreplaced by an accumulation fraction density. In the case of one-dimensional\nBrownian motion with Poissonian resetting, we derive the asymptotic formula\n$|x-x_0|\\approx \\sqrt{4rD}T(x)$ for $|x-x_0|\\gg\\sqrt{D/r}$, where $T(x)$ is the\naccumulation time at $x$, $r$ is the constant resetting rate, $D$ is the\ndiffusivity and $x_0$ is the reset point. This is identical in form to the\ntraveling front condition for the dynamical phase transition. We also derive an\nanalogous result for diffusion in higher spatial dimensions and for\nnon-Poissonian resetting. We then consider the effects of delays such as\nrefractory periods and finite return times. In both cases we establish that the\nasymptotic behavior of $T(x)$ is independent of the delays. Finally, we extend\nthe analysis to a run-and-tumble particle with resetting. We thus establish the\naccumulation time of a stochastic process with resetting as a useful quantity\nfor characterizing the approach to an NESS (if it exists) that is relatively\nstraightforward to calculate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 14:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

With the availability of\nmassive traffic data, neural network-based deep learning methods, especially\nthe graph convolutional networks (GCN) have demonstrated outstanding\nperformance in mining spatio-temporal information and achieving high prediction\naccuracy. Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of GCN under adversarial\nattacks, while there is a lack of studies to understand the vulnerability\nissues of the GCN-based traffic prediction models. Given this, this paper\nproposes a new task -- diffusion attack, to study the robustness of GCN-based\ntraffic prediction models. The diffusion attack aims to select and attack a\nsmall set of nodes to degrade the performance of the entire prediction model.\nTo conduct the diffusion attack, we propose a novel attack algorithm, which\nconsists of two major components: 1) approximating the gradient of the\nblack-box prediction model with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic\nApproximation (SPSA); 2) adapting the knapsack greedy algorithm to select the\nattack nodes. The proposed algorithm is examined with three GCN-based traffic\nprediction models: St-Gcn, T-Gcn, and A3t-Gcn on two cities.

Instead of an\nabsorption event occurring when the search particle reaches the boundary of a\ntarget, the particle can diffuse freely in and out of the target region and is\nabsorbed at a rate $\\kappa$ when inside the target. In the context of cell\nbiology, the target could represent a chemically reactive substrate within a\ncell or a region where a particle can be offloaded onto a nearby compartment.\nWe apply this framework to a partially absorbing interval and to spherically\nsymmetric targets in $\\R^d$. In each case, we determine how the mean first\npassage time (MFPT) for absorption depends on $\\kappa$, the resetting rate $r$,\nand the target geometry. For the given examples, we find that the MFPT is a\nmonotonically decreasing function of $\\kappa$, whereas it is a unimodal\nfunction of $r$ with a unique minimum at an optimal resetting rate $r_{\\rm\nopt}$. The variation of $r_{\\rm opt}$ with $\\kappa$ depends on the spatial\ndimension $d$, decreasing in sensitivity as $d$ increases. For finite $\\kappa$,\n$ r_{\\rm opt}$ is a non-trivial function of the target size and distance\nbetween the target and the reset point.

The spatial correlation in layer patterns is exploited\nwith varying low ranks in factorization derived from singular value\ndecomposition on a Krylov subspace. Further, encoding with HEVC efficiently\nremoves intra-view and inter-view correlation in low-rank approximated layers.\nThe initial subset of approximated decoded views from multiplicative\nrepresentation is used to construct Fourier disparity layer (FDL)\nrepresentation. The FDL model synthesizes second subset of views which is\nidentified by a pre-defined hierarchical prediction order.

For a strong coupling\nbetween the leads and the central layer, high-intensity localized states are\nformed outside the overlapping bands, while for weaker coupling this\nhigh-intensity spectral weight is formed within the leads' continuum band\naround the Fermi energy. A local Coulomb interaction in the central region\nmodifies the high-intensity states, and hence the transmission. For the present\nsetup, the major effect of the local interaction consists in shifts of the band\nstructure, since any sharp features are weakened due to the macroscopic\nextension of the configuration in the directions perpendicular to the transport\ndirection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 14:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Detecting anomalous events based on machine learning approaches in such\ntime series data has been an active research topic in many different areas.\nHowever, most machine learning approaches require labeled datasets, offline\ntraining, and may suffer from high computation complexity, consequently\nhindering their applicability. Providing a lightweight self-adaptive approach\nthat does not need offline training in advance and meanwhile is able to detect\nanomalies in real time could be highly beneficial. Such an approach could be\nimmediately applied and deployed on any commodity machine to provide timely\nanomaly alerts. To facilitate such an approach, this paper introduces SALAD,\nwhich is a Self-Adaptive Lightweight Anomaly Detection approach based on a\nspecial type of recurrent neural networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).\nInstead of using offline training, SALAD converts a target time series into a\nseries of average absolute relative error (AARE) values on the fly and predicts\nan AARE value for every upcoming data point based on short-term historical AARE\nvalues. If the difference between a calculated AARE value and its corresponding\nforecast AARE value is higher than a self-adaptive detection threshold, the\ncorresponding data point is considered anomalous. Otherwise, the data point is\nconsidered normal. Experiments based on two real-world open-source time series\ndatasets demonstrate that SALAD outperforms five other state-of-the-art anomaly\ndetection approaches in terms of detection accuracy.

Since parallel computation has become increasingly\nmainstream, it is necessary to re-examine and modernize these practices.

The proposed framework carefully\ndistinguishes between an implementation's baseline efficiency, the efficacy\nwith which it utilizes a fixed allocation of resources, and its scalability, a\nmeasure of how the efficiency changes as resources (typically additional\ncomputing cores) are added or removed. Efficiency is typically applied to\nsequential implementations, whereas scalability is applied to parallel\nimplementations. Efficiency and scalability are both important contributors in\ndetermining the overall effectiveness of a given parallel implementation, but\nthe goal of improved efficiency is often at odds with the goal of improved\nscalability.

A key element\nin the chain of nuclear weak-decays leading to the production of isotopes may\nbe the change of the parameters controlling the neutrino sector, due to the\nmixing of active and sterile species. In this work we have addressed this\nquestion and calculated $\\beta$-decay rates for the nuclei involved in the\nr-process chains as a function of the neutrino mixing parameters. These rates\nwere then used in the calculation of the abundance of the heavy elements\nproduced in core-collapse supernova and in neutron-star mergers, starting from\ndifferent initial mass-fraction distributions. The analysis shows that the\ncore-collapse supernova environment contributes with approximately $30\\%$ of\nthe total heavy nuclei abundance while the neutron-star merger contributes with\nabout $70\\%$ of it. Using available experimental data we have performed a\nstatistical analysis to set limits on the active-sterile neutrino mixing angle\nand found a best-fit value $\\sin^2 2\\theta_{14}=0.22$, a value comparable with\nthose found in other studies reported in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 23:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

One method that has been\nused in hard and inaccessible environments is randomly scattering each node in\nthe area. In order to reduce the cost of using GPS at each node, some nodes\nshould be equipped with GPS (anchors), Then using the belief propagation\nalgorithm, locate other nodes. The number of anchor nodes must be reduced since\nthey are expensive. Furthermore, the location of these nodes affects the\nalgorithm's performance. Using multi-objective optimization, an algorithm is\nintroduced in this paper that minimizes the estimated location error and the\nnumber of anchor nodes. According to simulation results, This algorithm\nproposes a set of solutions with less energy consumption and less error than\nsimilar algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 10:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The\nexisting on-off reflection modulation (ORM) schemes are based on manipulating\nthe \"on/off\" states of RIS elements, which may lead to the degradation of RIS\nreflection efficiency. This paper proposes a frequency reflection modulation\n(FRM) method for RIS-aided OFDM systems. The FRM-OFDM scheme modulates the\nfrequency of the incident electromagnetic waves, and the RIS information is\nembedded in the frequency-hoping states of RIS elements. Unlike the ORM-OFDM\nscheme, the FRM-OFDM scheme can achieve higher reflection efficiency, since the\nlatter does not turn off any reflection element in reflection modulation. We\npropose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to maximize the user\nachievable rate for the FRM-OFDM system by jointly optimizing the phase shift\nof the RIS and the power allocation at the transmitter. Further, we design a\nbilinear message passing (BMP) algorithm for the bilinear recovery of both the\nuser symbols and the RIS data. Numerical simulations have verified the\nefficiency of the designed BCD algorithm for system optimization and the BMP\nalgorithm for signal detection, as well as the superiority of the proposed\nFRM-OFDM scheme over the ORM-OFDM scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 04:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 05:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}
