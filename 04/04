However,\nlack of labeled data is a significant bottleneck in learning an effective\ncategorization system for a disaster. This motivates us to study the problem as\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between a previous disaster with labeled\ndata (source) and a current disaster (target). However, if the amount of\nlabeled data available is limited, it restricts the learning capabilities of\nthe model. To handle this challenge, we utilize limited labeled data along with\nabundantly available unlabeled data, generated during a source disaster to\npropose a novel two-part graph neural network. The first-part extracts\ndomain-agnostic global information by constructing a token level graph across\ndomains and the second-part preserves local instance-level semantics.

InVaSion translates the\ngiven program and the input specification into a non-deterministic program and\nuses symbolic execution to instantiate the non-determinism.

One\noption to derive a preconditioner is to apply a multigrid method on a shifted\noperator. In such an approach, the wavenumber is shifted by some imaginary\nvalue. This step is motivated by the observation that the shifted problem can\nbe more efficiently handled by iterative solvers when compared to the standard\nHelmholtz equation. However, up to now, it is not obvious what the best\nstrategy for the choice of the shift parameter is. It is well known that a good\nshift parameter depends sensitively on the wavenumber and the discretization\nparameters such as the order and the mesh size. Therefore, we study the choice\nof a near optimal complex shift such that an FGMRES solver converges with fewer\niterations. Our goal is to provide a map which returns the near optimal shift\nfor the preconditioner depending on the wavenumber and the mesh size. In order\nto compute this map, a data driven approach is considered: We first generate\nmany samples, and in a second step, we perform a nonlinear regression on this\ndata. With this representative map, the near optimal shift can be obtained by a\nsimple evaluation. Our preconditioner is based on a twogrid V-cycle applied to\nthe shifted problem, allowing us to implement a semi matrix-free method. The\nperformance of our preconditioned FGMRES solver is illustrated by several\nbenchmark problems with heterogeneous wavenumbers in two and three space\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 16:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

In\nnature, pursuer(s) and evader(s) are intelligent agents that can learn from\nexperience, and dynamics (i.e., Newtonian or Lagrangian) is vital for the\npursuer and the evader in some scenarios. To this end, this paper addresses the\npursuit-evasion game of intelligent agents from the perspective of dynamics. A\nbio-inspired dynamics formulation of a pursuit-evasion game and baseline\npursuit and evasion strategies are introduced at first. Then, reinforcement\nlearning techniques are used to mimic the ability of intelligent agents to\nlearn from experience. Based on the dynamics formulation and reinforcement\nlearning techniques, the effects of improving both pursuit and evasion\nstrategies based on experience on pursuit-evasion games are investigated at two\nlevels 1) individual runs and 2) ranges of the parameters of pursuit-evasion\ngames. Results of the investigation are consistent with nature observations and\nthe natural law - survival of the fittest. More importantly, with respect to\nthe result of a pursuit-evasion game of agents with baseline strategies, this\nstudy achieves a different result. It is shown that, in a pursuit-evasion game\nwith a dynamics formulation, an evader is not able to escape from a slightly\nfaster pursuer with an effective learned pursuit strategy, based on agile\nmaneuvers and an effective learned evasion strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 16:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs) are astrophysical objects whose origin is not well understood;\nthey weigh millions of solar masses and reside in the centers of galaxies. An\nimportant formation scenario for SMBHs is based on collisions and mergers of\nstars in a massive cluster, in which the most massive star moves to the center\nof the cluster due to dynamical friction. This increases the rate of collisions\nand mergers since massive stars have larger collisional cross sections. This\ncan lead to runaway growth of a very massive star which may collapse to become\nan intermediate-mass black hole. Here we investigate the dynamical evolution of\nMiyamoto-Nagai models that allow us to describe dense stellar clusters,\nincluding flattening and different degrees of rotation. We find that the\ncollisions in these clusters depend mostly on the number of stars and the\ninitial stellar radii for a given radial size of the cluster. By comparison,\nrotation seems to affect the collision rate by at most $20\\%$. For flatness, we\ncompared spherical models with systems that have a scale height of about $10\\%$\nof their radial extent, in this case finding a change in the collision rate of\nless than $25\\%$. Overall, we conclude that the parameters only have a minor\neffect on the number of collisions. Our results also suggest that rotation\nhelps to retain more stars in the system, reducing the number of escapers by a\nfactor of $2-3$ depending on the model and the specific realization. After two\nmillion years, a typical lifetime of a very massive star, we find that about\n$630$ collisions occur in typical models with $N=10^4$, $R=100$ $\\rm~R_\\odot$\nand a half-mass radius of $0.1$ $\\rm~pc$, leading to a mass of about\n$6.3\\times10^3$ $\\rm~M_\\odot$ for the most massive object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 17:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Its efficient conversion to stored\nchemical potential occurs in the special pair reaction center, which has to be\nreached by down-hill ultrafast excited state energy transport. The interaction\nbetween the chromophores leads to spatial delocalization and quantum coherence\neffects, the importance of which depends on the coupling between the\nchlorophylls in relation to the intensity of the fluctuations and\nreorganization dynamics of the protein matrix, or bath. The latter induce\nuncorrelated modulations of the site energies, and thus quantum decoherence,\nand localization of the exciton. Current consensus is that under physiological\nconditions quantum decoherence occurs on the 10 fs time scale, and quantum\ncoherence plays little role for the observed picosecond energy transfer\ndynamics. In this work, we reaffirm this from a different point of view by\nfinding that the true onset of electronic quantum coherence only occurs at\nextremely low temperatures of ~20 K.

We first study a smooth\napproximation of a generic DC function, termed difference-of-Moreau-envelopes\n(DME) smoothing, where both components of the DC function are replaced by their\nrespective Moreau envelopes. The resulting smooth approximation is shown to be\nLipschitz differentiable, capture stationary points, local, and global minima\nof the original DC function, and enjoy some growth conditions, such as\nlevel-boundedness and coercivity, for broad classes of DC functions. We then\ndevelop four algorithms for solving DC programs with and without linear\nconstraints based on the DME smoothing. In particular, for a smoothed DC\nprogram without linear constraints, we show that the classic gradient descent\nmethod as well as an inexact variant can obtain a stationary solution in the\nlimit with a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/2})$, where $K$ is the\nnumber of proximal evaluations of both components.

Generally, it consists of a self-attention speech\nenhancement GAN and a self-attention end-to-end ASR model. There are two\nhighlights which are worth noting in this proposed framework. One is that it\nbenefits from the advancement of both self-attention mechanism and GANs; while\nthe other is that the discriminator of GAN plays the role of the global\ndiscriminant network in the stage of the adversarial joint training, which\nguides the enhancement front-end to capture more compatible structures for the\nsubsequent ASR module and thereby offsets the limitation of the separate\ntraining and handcrafted loss functions. With the adversarial joint\noptimization, the proposed framework is expected to learn more robust\nrepresentations suitable for the ASR task. We execute systematic experiments on\nthe corpus AISHELL-1, and the experimental results show that on the artificial\nnoisy test set, the proposed framework achieves the relative improvements of\n66% compared to the ASR model trained by clean data solely, 35.1% compared to\nthe speech enhancement & ASR scheme without joint training, and 5.3% compared\nto multi-condition training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 19:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

A large body of\nexperimental work indicates that such optimization changes the wiring of neural\ncircuits, appropriately mapping environmental input onto behavioral outputs. A\nmajor unsolved scientific question is how optimal wiring adjustments, which\nmust target the connections responsible for rewards, can be accomplished when\nthe relation between sensory inputs, action taken, environmental context with\nrewards is ambiguous. The computational problem of properly targeting cues,\ncontexts and actions that lead to reward is known as structural, contextual and\ntemporal credit assignment respectively. In this review, we survey prior\napproaches to these three types of problems and advance the notion that the\nbrain's specialized neural architectures provide efficient solutions. Within\nthis framework, the thalamus with its cortical and basal ganglia interactions\nserve as a systems-level solution to credit assignment. Specifically, we\npropose that thalamocortical interaction is the locus of meta-learning where\nthe thalamus provides cortical control functions that parametrize the cortical\nactivity association space. By selecting among these control functions, the\nbasal ganglia hierarchically guide thalamocortical plasticity across two\ntimescales to enable meta-learning. The faster timescale establishes contextual\nassociations to enable rapid behavioral flexibility while the slower one\nenables generalization to new contexts. Incorporating different thalamic\ncontrol functions under this framework clarifies how thalamocortical-basal\nganglia interactions may simultaneously solve the three credit assignment\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 20:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

In this\nprescription, the orbital separation of the secondary and giant core at the end\nof the CE phase is taken to be the orbital separation when the envelope becomes\nunbound. However, recent observations of planetary nebulae with binary cores\n(BPNe), believed to be the immediate products of CE evolution, indicate orbital\nperiods that are significantly shorter than predicted by population synthesis\nmodels using the alpha prescription. We argue that unbinding the envelope\nprovides a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to escape a merger during\nCE evolution. The spiral-in of the secondary must also be halted. This requires\nthe additional dynamical constraint that the frictional torque on the secondary\nbe reduced to approximately zero. In this paper, we undertake a preliminary\nexamination of the effect of adding this dynamical constraint in population\nsynthesis calculations of BPNe. We assume that the frictional torque will be\nsufficiently reduced when the secondary enters a region within the giant where\nthe mass-radius profile is flat. We crudely estimate the location of this\nregion as a function of the core mass based upon existing stellar models of AGB\nstars between 1 and 7 solar masses. We calculate a theoretical orbital period\ndistribution of BPNe using a population synthesis code that incorporates this\ndynamical constraint along with the alpha prescription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 22:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

We take it that a central approach to explanation in\nsystems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling, where understanding the\nsystem is taken to require fleshing out the parts, organization, and activities\nof a system, and how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it\nremains somewhat controversial what it means for a model to describe a\nmechanism, and whether neural network models qualify as explanatory.\n  We argue that certain kinds of neural network models are actually good\nexamples of mechanistic models, when the right notion of mechanistic mapping is\ndeployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism mapping (3M), we\ndescribe criteria delineating such a notion, which we call 3M++. These criteria\nrequire us, first, to identify a level of description that is both abstract but\ndetailed enough to be \"runnable\", and then, to construct model-to-brain\nmappings using the same principles as those employed for brain-to-brain mapping\nacross individuals. Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are those\nalready in use in experimental neuroscience, and are of the kind deployed in\nthe construction of more familiar computational models, just as the principles\nof inter-brain mappings are very much in the spirit of those already employed\nin the collection and analysis of data across animals.\n  In a companion paper, we address the relationship between optimization and\nintelligibility, in the context of functional evolutionary explanations.

Denoising and\ndimensionality reduction are two distinct methods that have been independently\ninvestigated to combat such attacks. While denoising offers the ability to\ntailor the defense to the specific nature of the attack, dimensionality\nreduction offers the advantage of potentially removing previously unseen\nperturbations, along with reducing the training time of the network being\ndefended. We propose strategies to combine the advantages of these two defense\nmechanisms. First, we propose the cascaded defense, which involves denoising\nfollowed by dimensionality reduction. To reduce the training time of the\ndefense for a small trade-off in performance, we propose the hidden layer\ndefense, which involves feeding the output of the encoder of a denoising\nautoencoder into the network. Further, we discuss how adaptive attacks against\nthese defenses could become significantly weak when an alternative defense is\nused, or when no defense is used. In this light, we propose a new metric to\nevaluate a defense which measures the sensitivity of the adaptive attack to\nmodifications in the defense.

From the theoretical point of view, both the\ndispersion relation and the polarization of KAW has been mostly studied in\nproton-electron plasmas. However, most astrophysical and space plasmas are\nmulti-species, and therefore in these systems the dispersion properties of the\nKAW may not depend only on the macroscopic parameters of proton and electron\ndistributions, but also on the parameters of heavier ions.

Following the recent development in using deformable\nconvolution (DConv) for video interpolation, we propose a light but effective\nmodel, called Pyramid Deformable Warping Network (PDWN).

Because of the sequential nature and presence of private\ninformation in the game, correlation in extensive-form games possesses\nsignificantly different properties than its counterpart in normal-form games,\nmany of which are still open research directions. Extensive-form correlated\nequilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart\nto the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games.\nCompared to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are\nsignificantly more complex, as the correlation device must keep into account\nthe evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations throughout\nthe game. Due to that significant added complexity, the existence of uncoupled\nlearning dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research\nquestion for a long time. In this article, we settle that question by giving\nthe first uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in\nn-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that\neach iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree,\nand that, when all players play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics,\nthe empirical frequency of play is proven to be a O(T^-0.5)-approximate EFCE\nwith high probability after T game repetitions, and an EFCE almost surely in\nthe limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 02:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 06:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

In the considered model, each IoT device monitors a\nphysical process that follows nonlinear dynamics. As the dynamics of the\nphysical process vary over time, each device must find an optimal sampling\nfrequency to sample the real-time dynamics of the physical system and send\nsampled information to a base station (BS). Due to limited wireless resources,\nthe BS can only select a subset of devices to transmit their sampled\ninformation. Thus, edge devices must cooperatively sample their monitored\ndynamics based on the local observations and the BS must collect the sampled\ninformation from the devices immediately, hence avoiding the additional time\nand energy used for sampling and information transmission. To this end, it is\nnecessary to jointly optimize the sampling policy of each device and the device\nselection scheme of the BS so as to accurately monitor the dynamics of the\nphysical process using minimum energy. This problem is formulated as an\noptimization problem whose goal is to minimize the weighted sum of AoI cost and\nenergy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose a novel distributed\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach for the sampling policy optimization. The\nproposed algorithm enables edge devices to cooperatively find the global\noptimal sampling policy using their own local observations. Given the sampling\npolicy, the device selection scheme can be optimized thus minimizing the\nweighted sum of AoI and energy consumption of all devices. Simulations with\nreal data of PM 2.5 pollution show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the\nsum of AoI by up to 17.8% and 33.9% and the total energy consumption by up to\n13.2% and 35.1%, compared to a conventional deep Q network method and a uniform\nsampling policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 03:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 10:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Quantitative analysis indicates\nthat patches with divergent review scores: (1) account for 15%-37% of patches\nthat receive multiple review scores; (2) are integrated more often than they\nare abandoned; and (3) receive negative scores after positive ones in 70% of\ncases. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis indicates that patches with strongly\ndivergent scores that: (4) are abandoned more often suffer from external issues\n(e.g., integration planning, content duplication) than patches with weakly\ndivergent scores and patches without divergent scores; and (5) are integrated\noften address reviewer concerns indirectly (i.e., without changing patches).\nOur results suggest that review tooling should integrate with release schedules\nand detect concurrent development of similar patches to optimize review\ndiscussions with divergent scores. Moreover, patch authors should note that\neven the most divisive patches are often integrated through discussion,\nintegration timing, and careful revision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 05:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Several recent\nstudies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained\nwhite-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data\nthrough generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and\ninteresting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only\nnetwork predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target\ndomain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation\nframework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the\ntarget data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source\npredictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to\nfurther fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be\nidentical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a\nlow-resource device.

However, the efficiency of learning\ndeep matchers on large-scale data has not yet been adequately studied. Though\nlearning with classification parameters or class memory is a popular way, it\nincurs large memory and computational costs. In contrast, pairwise deep metric\nlearning within mini batches would be a better choice. However, the most\npopular random sampling method, the well-known PK sampler, is not informative\nand efficient for deep metric learning. Though online hard example mining has\nimproved the learning efficiency to some extent, the mining in mini batches\nafter random sampling is still limited. This inspires us to explore the use of\nhard example mining earlier, in the data sampling stage. To do so, in this\npaper, we propose an efficient mini-batch sampling method, called graph\nsampling (GS), for large-scale deep metric learning. The basic idea is to build\na nearest neighbor relationship graph for all classes at the beginning of each\nepoch. Then, each mini batch is composed of a randomly selected class and its\nnearest neighboring classes so as to provide informative and challenging\nexamples for learning.

This motivates us to propose a\nlearning-based framework, which unrolls well-noted decentralized optimization\nalgorithms (e.g., Prox-DGD and PG-EXTRA) into graph neural networks (GNNs). By\nminimizing the recovery error via end-to-end training, this learning-based\nframework resolves the model mismatch issue. Our convergence analysis (with\nPG-EXTRA as the base algorithm) reveals that the learned model parameters may\naccelerate the convergence and reduce the recovery error to a large extent.

Several single-step\nadversarial training methods have been proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned\noverhead cost; however, their performance is not sufficiently reliable\ndepending on the optimization setting. To overcome such limitations, we deviate\nfrom the existing input-space-based adversarial training regime and propose a\nsingle-step latent adversarial training method (SLAT), which leverages the\ngradients of latent representation as the latent adversarial perturbation. We\ndemonstrate that the L1 norm of feature gradients is implicitly regularized\nthrough the adopted latent perturbation, thereby recovering local linearity and\nensuring reliable performance, compared to the existing single-step adversarial\ntraining methods. Because latent perturbation is based on the gradients of the\nlatent representations which can be obtained for free in the process of input\ngradients computation, the proposed method costs roughly the same time as the\nfast gradient sign method.

To alleviate the data imbalance problem between normal\ntissues and the tumor regions, we introduce a local loss to improve the\ncontribution of the tumor regions, which leads to better enhancement results on\ntumors. \\textit{Results:} Extensive quantitative and visual assessments are\nperformed, with our proposed model achieving a PSNR of 28.24dB in the brain and\n21.2dB in tumor regions. \\textit{Conclusion and Significance:} Our results\nsuggest the potential of substituting GBCAs with synthetic contrast images\ngenerated via deep learning.

The role that\nsurface deformation plays in an air cushioned impact of a liquid droplet is\nconsidered here. In a two-dimensional framework, assuming small density and\nviscosity ratios between the air and the liquid, a reduced system of\nintegro-differential equations is derived governing the liquid droplet\nfree-surface shape, the pressure in the thin air film and the deformation of\nthe surface, assuming the effects of surface tension, compressibility and\ngravity to be negligible. The deformation of the surface is first described in\na rather general form, based on previous membrane-type models. The coupled\nsystem is then investigated in two cases: a soft viscoelastic case where the\nsubstrate stiffness and (viscous) damping are considered and a more general\nflexible surface where all relevant parameters are retained.

Its original\nmean field form provides the important intuition that migration and extinction\ninteract to determine the dynamics of a population composed of subpopulations.\nFrom its conception, it has been evident that the very essence of the\nmetapopulation paradigm centers on the process of local extinction. We note\nthat there are two qualitatively distinct types of extinction, gradual and\ncatastrophic, and explore their impact on the dynamics of metapopulation\nformation using discrete iterative maps. First, by modifying the classic\nlogistic map with the addition of the Allee effect, we show that catastrophic\nlocal extinctions in subpopulations are a pre-requisite of metapopulation\nformation. When subpopulations experience gradual extinction, increased\nmigration rates force synchrony and drive the metapopulation below the Allee\npoint resulting in migration induced destabilization of the system across\nparameter space. Second, a sawtooth map (an extension of the Bernoulli bit\nshift map) is employed to simultaneously explore the increasing and decreasing\nmodes of population behavior. We conclude with four generalizations. 1. At low\nmigration rates, a metapopulation may go extinct faster than completely\nunconnected subpopulations. 2. There exists a gradient between stable\nmetapopulation formation and population synchrony, with critical transitions\nfrom no metapopulation to metapopulation to synchronization, the latter\nfrequently inducing metapopulation extinction. 3. Synchronization patterns\nemerge through time, resulting in synchrony groups and chimeric populations\nexisting simultaneously. 4. There are two distinct mechanisms of\nsynchronization: i. extinction and rescue and, ii.) stretch reversals in a\nmodification of the classic chaotic stretching and folding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 13:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 10:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Optimizing the black-box model parameters has become\nincreasingly expensive and time consuming as they have become more complex.\nHence, developing effective and efficient black-box model optimization\nalgorithms has become an important task. One powerful algorithm to solve such\nproblem is Bayesian optimization, which can effectively estimates the model\nparameters that lead to the best performance, and Gaussian Process (GP) has\nbeen one of the most widely used surrogate model in Bayesian optimization.\nHowever, the time complexity of GP scales cubically with respect to the number\nof observed model outputs, and GP does not scale well with large parameter\ndimension either. Consequently, it has been challenging for GP to optimize\nblack-box models that need to query many observations and/or have many\nparameters.

To achieve\nthis goal, we build a comprehensive dataset of the Turing Award laureates and\nanalyze their characteristics, including their personal information, family\nbackground, academic background, and industry experience. The FP-Growth\nalgorithm is used for frequent feature mining. Logistic regression plot, pie\nchart, word cloud and map are generated accordingly for each of the interesting\nfeatures to uncover insights regarding personal factors that drive influential\nwork in the field of computer science. In particular, we show that the Turing\nAward laureates are most commonly white, male, married, United States citizen,\nand received a PhD degree. Our results also show that the age at which the\nlaureate won the award increases over the years; most of the Turing Award\nlaureates did not major in computer science; birth order is strongly related to\nthe winners' success; and the number of citations is not as important as one\nwould expect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 00:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

In this paper, we first reformulate the multi-UAV\ntrajectory optimization problem with collision avoidance and wireless\nconnectivity constraints as a sequential decision making problem in the\ndiscrete time domain. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement\nlearning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is\ndeveloped to encode the expected time to destination given the agent's joint\nstate (including the agent's information, the nearby agents' observable\ninformation, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). A\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-prediction neural network is\nalso designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting\nwith the cellular network, to map the GBSs' locations into the SINR levels in\norder to predict the UAV's SINR. Numerical results show that with the value\nnetwork and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be\nefficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 22:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

The Minkowski limit of the massless\nminimally coupled scalar field and massive spinor field interaction in the\nambient space formalism of de Sitter space time is calculated. The interaction\nLagrangian and massless minimally coupled scalar field in the null curvature\nlimit become zero and the local transformation in the null curvature limit\nbecome a constant phase transformation and the interaction in this limit become\nzero. The covariant derivative reduces to ordinary derivative too.

However, such deep learning techniques have\nalso been recently shown to be vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks\nthat rely on subtle input perturbations, which would be particularly feasible\nin a wireless setting via jamming. One such potent attack is the one known as\nthe Carlini-Wagner attack, which we consider in this work. We further consider\na data-driven subsampling setting, where several recently introduced\ndeep-learning-based algorithms are employed to select a subset of samples that\nlead to reducing the final classifier's training time with minimal loss in\naccuracy. In this setting, the attacker has to make an assumption about the\nemployed subsampling strategy, in order to calculate the loss gradient. Based\non state of the art techniques available to both the attacker and defender, we\nevaluate best strategies under various assumptions on the knowledge of the\nother party's strategy.
