To ensure security to the computer systems in an industrial\nenvironment, it is required to build effective intrusion detection systems to\nmonitor the cyber-physical systems (e.g., computer networks) in the industry\nfor malicious activities. This paper aims to build such intrusion detection\nsystems to protect the computer networks from cyberattacks. More specifically,\nwe propose a novel unsupervised machine learning approach that combines the\nK-Means algorithm with the Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in industrial\nbig data scenarios. Since our objective is to build the intrusion detection\nsystem for the big data scenario in the industrial domain, we utilize the\nApache Spark framework to implement our proposed model which was trained in\nlarge network traffic data (about 123 million instances of network traffic)\nstored in Elasticsearch. Moreover, we evaluate our proposed model on the live\nstreaming data and find that our proposed system can be used for real-time\nanomaly detection in the industrial setup. In addition, we address different\nchallenges that we face while training our model on large datasets and\nexplicitly describe how these issues were resolved. Based on our empirical\nevaluation in different use-cases for anomaly detection in real-world network\ntraffic data, we observe that our proposed system is effective to detect\nanomalies in big data scenarios. Finally, we evaluate our proposed model on\nseveral academic datasets to compare with other models and find that it\nprovides comparable performance with other state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 16:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The turning\npoint in thinking on meaning was Tarski's definition of truth, and the rapid\ndevelopment of logical semantics and model theory was a consequence of this\nachievement. Perhaps less well-known among classical logicians and philosophers\nis that it is category theory that provides adequate mathematical tools to\nstudy the relationship between the syntax of formalized theories and their\nsemantics. The aim of this article is to change this situation and make a\npreliminary philosophical analysis of the results obtained so far. They concern\nformalized algebraic theories with axioms in the form of equational laws,\ntheories based on propositional logic and coherent Boolean logic, as well as\ndecidable logic which is not necessarily Boolean. The syntactic-semantics\nrelation for these theories takes the form of dualisms between the respective\nsyntactic and semantic categories. These dualisms are given by the appropriate\nadjoint functors. In all the considered cases, the syntax--semantics dualism\ncorresponds to the algebra-geometry dualism. We analyze the philosophical\nsignificance of these results. They allow us to look at the problem of meaning\nin a new light and formulate a criterion distinguishing formal theories from\nempirical theories. The disputes that were once fought over Tarski's definition\nof truth are transferred to a new context. The polemics as to whether Tarski\nactually succeeded in reducing the problem of meaning to purely syntactic terms\nhas been superseded: between the syntactic and semantic categories there is not\na relation of reducibility but rather that of interaction, and this relation is\ngiven by adjoint functors.

Such software hides some\nproperties of the real class or adopts some properties of a different class by\napplying small perturbations. A special case of evasive malware hides by\nrepackaging a bonafide benign mobile app to contain malware in addition to the\noriginal functionality of the app, thus retaining most of the benign properties\nof the original app. We present a novel malware detection system based on\nmetamorphic testing principles that can detect such benign-seeming malware\napps. We apply metamorphic testing to the feature representation of the mobile\napp rather than to the app itself. That is, the source input is the original\nfeature vector for the app and the derived input is that vector with selected\nfeatures removed. If the app was originally classified benign and is indeed\nbenign, the output for the source and derived inputs should be the same class,\ni.e., benign, but if they differ, then the app is exposed as likely malware.\nMalware apps originally classified as malware should retain that classification\nsince only features prevalent in benign apps are removed.

Due to the absence of uplink-downlink channel\nreciprocity and the high-dimensionality of channel matrices, it is extremely\nchallenging to design downlink precoders using closed-loop channel probing and\nfeedback with limited spectrum resource. To address these issues, a novel\nmethodology -- active channel sparsification (ACS) -- has been proposed\nrecently in the literature for uniform linear array (ULA) to design sparsifying\nprecoders, which boosts spectral efficiency for multi-user downlink\ntransmission with substantially reduced channel feedback overhead. Pushing\nforward this line of research, we aim to facilitate the potential deployment of\nACS in practical FDD massive MIMO systems, by extending it from ULA to DP-UPA\nwith explicit user selection and making the current ACS implementation\nsimplified. To this end, by leveraging Toeplitz structure of channel covariance\nmatrices, we extend the original ACS using scale-weight bipartite graph\nrepresentation to the matrix-weight counterpart. Building upon this, we propose\na multi-dimensional ACS (MD-ACS) method, which is a generalization of original\nACS formulation and is more suitable for DP-UPA antenna configurations. The\nnonlinear integer program formulation of MD-ACS can be classified as a\ngeneralized multi-assignment problem (GMAP), for which we propose a simple yet\nefficient greedy algorithm to solve it.

The\nalgorithm uses abstractions to divide the search space of programs into\nsubspaces by computing an abstract value that represents outputs for all\nprograms in a subspace. The abstract value allows our algorithm to compute, for\neach subspace, a sound approximate lower bound of the loss over all programs in\nthe subspace.

It presents great challenges to feature engineering due to the high\nnon-linearity and sparsity of the data. The local and global structure of the\nreal-world networks can be reflected by dynamical transfer behaviors among\nnodes. This paper proposes a network embedding framework to capture the\ntransfer behaviors on structured networks via deep prediction models. We first\ndesign a degree-weight biased random walk model to capture the transfer\nbehaviors on the network. Then a deep network embedding method is introduced to\npreserve the transfer possibilities among the nodes. A network structure\nembedding layer is added into conventional deep prediction models, including\nLong Short-Term Memory Network and Recurrent Neural Network, to utilize the\nsequence prediction ability. To keep the local network neighborhood, we further\nperform a Laplacian supervised space optimization on the embedding feature\nrepresentations. Experimental studies are conducted on various datasets\nincluding social networks, citation networks, biomedical network, collaboration\nnetwork and language network. The results show that the learned representations\ncan be effectively used as features in a variety of tasks, such as clustering,\nvisualization, classification, reconstruction and link prediction, and achieve\npromising performance compared with state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 16:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Previous approaches to this task have relied on a\ntwo-step process where an intermediate representation is inferred from the\nvideo, and is then decoded into waveform audio using a vocoder or a waveform\nreconstruction algorithm. In this work, we propose a new end-to-end\nvideo-to-speech model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which\ntranslates spoken video to waveform end-to-end without using any intermediate\nrepresentation or separate waveform synthesis algorithm. Our model consists of\nan encoder-decoder architecture that receives raw video as input and generates\nspeech, which is then fed to a waveform critic and a power critic. The use of\nan adversarial loss based on these two critics enables the direct synthesis of\nraw audio waveform and ensures its realism. In addition, the use of our three\ncomparative losses helps establish direct correspondence between the generated\naudio and the input video. We show that this model is able to reconstruct\nspeech with remarkable realism for constrained datasets such as GRID, and that\nit is the first end-to-end model to produce intelligible speech for LRW (Lip\nReading in the Wild), featuring hundreds of speakers recorded entirely `in the\nwild'. We evaluate the generated samples in two different scenarios -- seen and\nunseen speakers -- using four objective metrics which measure the quality and\nintelligibility of artificial speech. We demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms all previous works in most metrics on GRID and LRW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 17:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 17:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 19:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Contact with the Company\npersonnel, some of whom were conversant with oriental languages and/or\ncontemporary scientific advances, provided him with the opportunity to brush up\nhis mathematical knowledge, and induced him to embark upon -- and, according to\nsome, bring to fruition -- the task of translating a few important mathematical\ntreatises, among them Newton's \\textit{Principia}. According to Campbell, the\nauthor of an obituary notice (published in 1804), \"he translated the Principia\nfrom the original Latin, into Arabic\". The evidence gathered by Campbell is\nexamined, and found insufficient to warrant this astounding and oft-repeated\nclaim. Of the three tracts authored by Tafazzul (all published posthumously in\nabridged versions), none can be described as a translation of Newton's\n\\textit{Principia}. Until the emergence of some tangible evidence, any talk of\nhis translations of the \\textit{Principia} and other western treatises can only\nbe characterised as rumour, a process in which recall is often accompanied by\ndistortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 17:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 17:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 15:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

We report \\chandra\\ observations of a\ncomplete 178~MHz-selected, and so orientation unbiased, sample of 44 $0.5<z<1$\n3CRR sources. The sample is comprised of quasars and narrow-line radio galaxies\n(NLRGs) with similar radio luminosities, and the radio structure serves as both\nan age and an orientation indicator. Consistent with Unification, intrinsic\nobscuration (measured by \\nh, X-ray hardness ratio, and X-ray luminosity)\ngenerally increases with inclination. However, the sample includes a population\nnot seen in high-$z$ 3CRR sources: NLRGs viewed at intermediate inclination\nangles with \\nh~$<10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$. Multiwavelength analysis suggests these\nobjects have lower $L/L_{\\rm Edd}$ than typical NLRGs at similar orientation.\nThus both orientation and $L/L_{\\rm Edd}$ are important, and a\n\"radiation-regulated Unification\" provides a better explanation of the sample's\nobserved properties. In comparison with the 3CRR sample at $1<z<2$, our\nlower-redshift sample shows a higher fraction of Compton-thin NLRGs (45\\% vs.\\\n29\\%) but similar Compton-thick fraction (20\\%), implying a larger covering\nfactor of Compton-thin material at intermediate viewing angles and so a more\n\"puffed-up\" torus atmosphere. We posit that this is due to a range of $L/L_{\\rm\nEdd}$ extending to lower values in this sample. In contrast, at high redshifts\nthe narrower range and high $L/L_{\\rm Edd}$ values allowed orientation (and so\nsimple Unification) to dominate the sample's observed properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 17:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

In recent years, the use of deep\nlearning in audio signal processing has allowed to drastically improve\nperformances for machine hearing. This has motivated the scientific community\nto also develop machine learning strategies for source localization\napplications. In this paper, we present BeamLearning, a multi-resolution deep\nlearning approach that allows to encode relevant information contained in\nunprocessed time domain acoustic signals captured by microphone arrays. The use\nof raw data aims at avoiding simplifying hypothesis that most traditional\nmodel-based localization methods rely on. Benefits of its use are shown for\nrealtime sound source 2D-localization tasks in reverberating and noisy\nenvironments.

A thorough analysis of the network representation and\nextensive performance tests are carried out using the BeamLearning network with\nsynthetic and experimental datasets.

Does it always lead to a gain\nin information? The very existence of the special sciences above and beyond\nphysics seems to hint no. Previous research has shown that dimension reduction\n(macroscales) can increase the dependency between elements of a system (a\nphenomenon called \"causal emergence\"). However, this has been shown only for\nspecific measures like effective information or integrated information. Here,\nwe provide an umbrella mathematical framework for emergence based on\ninformation conversion. Specifically, we show evidence that a macroscale can\nhave more of a certain type of information than its underlying microscale. This\nis because macroscales can convert information from one type to another. In\nsuch cases, reduction to a microscale means the loss of this type of\ninformation. We demonstrate this using the well-understood mutual information\nmeasure applied to Boolean networks. By using the partial information\ndecomposition, the mutual information can be decomposed into redundant, unique,\nand synergistic information atoms. Then by introducing a novel measure of the\nsynergy bias of a given decomposition, we are able to show that the synergy\ncomponent of a Boolean network's mutual information can increase at\nmacroscales. This can occur even when there is no difference in the total\nmutual information between a macroscale and its underlying microscale, proving\ninformation conversion. We relate this broad framework to previous work,\ncompare it to other theories, and argue it complexifies any notion of universal\nreduction in the sciences, since such reduction would likely lead to a loss of\nsynergistic information in scientific models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 17:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Hyperbolic manifolds are well-studied mathematically, with an\nimportant rigidity property at fixed volume.

This excellent numerical replica of Virgo will\npermit studying different galaxy type evolution (jellyfish, backsplash, etc.)\nas well as feedback phenomena in the cluster core via unbiased comparisons\nbetween simulated and observed galaxies and hot gas phase profiles to\nunderstand this great physics laboratory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

The North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field provides a unique set of\npanchromatic data, well suited for active galactic nuclei (AGN) studies.\nSelection of AGN candidates is often based on mid-infrared (MIR) measurements.\nSuch method, despite its effectiveness, strongly reduces a catalog volume due\nto the MIR detection condition. Modern machine learning techniques can solve\nthis problem by finding similar selection criteria using only optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) data. Aims. Aims of this work were to create a reliable AGN\ncandidates catalog from the NEP field using a combination of optical SUBARU/HSC\nand NIR AKARI/IRC data and, consequently, to develop an efficient alternative\nfor the MIR-based AKARI/IRC selection technique. Methods. A set of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms was tested in order to perform an efficient AGN\nselection. Best of the models were formed into a majority voting scheme, which\nused the most popular classification result to produce the final AGN catalog.\nAdditional analysis of catalog properties was performed in form of the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) fitting via the CIGALE software.

Rankings reduce complex systems to ordered lists, reflecting the\nability of their elements to perform relevant functions, and are being used\nfrom socioeconomic policy to knowledge extraction. A century of research has\nfound regularities when temporal rank data is aggregated. Far less is known,\nhowever, about how rankings change in time. Here we explore the dynamics of 30\nrankings in natural, social, economic, and infrastructural systems, comprising\nmillions of elements and timescales from minutes to centuries. We find that the\nflux of new elements determines the stability of a ranking: for high flux only\nthe top of the list is stable, otherwise top and bottom are equally stable. We\nshow that two basic mechanisms - displacement and replacement of elements -\ncapture empirical ranking dynamics. The model uncovers two regimes of behavior;\nfast and large rank changes, or slow diffusion. Our results indicate that the\nbalance between robustness and adaptability in ranked systems might be governed\nby simple random processes irrespective of system details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 19:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Traditional approaches for security assessment are often limited by\ntheir scope and/or speed, resulting in missing of critical contingencies that\ncould lead to cascading failures. This paper proposes a two-component\nmethodology to enhance power system security. The first component combines an\nefficient algorithm to detect cut-set saturation (called the feasibility test\n(FT) algorithm) with real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) to create an\nintegrated corrective action (iCA), whose goal is to secure the system against\ncut-set saturation as well as critical branch overloads. The second component\nonly employs the results of the FT to create a relaxed corrective action (rCA)\nto secure the system against post-contingency cut-set saturation. The first\ncomponent is more comprehensive, but the latter is computationally more\nefficient. The effectiveness of the two components is evaluated based upon the\nnumber of cascade triggering contingencies alleviated, and the computation\ntime. The results obtained by analyzing different case-studies on the IEEE\n118-bus and 2000-bus synthetic Texas systems indicate that the proposed\ntwo-component methodology successfully enhances the scope and speed of power\nsystem security assessment during multiple outages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 19:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 19:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

Evaluating such systems is very challenging\ngiven that any natural language responses could be generated, and users\ncommonly interact for multiple semantically coherent rounds to accomplish a\nsearch task. Although prior studies proposed many evaluation metrics, the\nextent of how those measures effectively capture user preference remains to be\ninvestigated. In this paper, we systematically meta-evaluate a variety of\nconversational search metrics. We specifically study three perspectives on\nthose metrics: (1) reliability: the ability to detect \"actual\" performance\ndifferences as opposed to those observed by chance; (2) fidelity: the ability\nto agree with ultimate user preference; and (3) intuitiveness: the ability to\ncapture any property deemed important: adequacy, informativeness, and fluency\nin the context of conversational search. By conducting experiments on two test\ncollections, we find that the performance of different metrics varies\nsignificantly across different scenarios whereas consistent with prior studies,\nexisting metrics only achieve a weak correlation with ultimate user preference\nand satisfaction. METEOR is, comparatively speaking, the best existing\nsingle-turn metric considering all three perspectives.

A prominent problem is that the estimated poses lie in the local\ncoordinate system of the fisheye camera, rather than in the world coordinate\nsystem, which is restrictive for many applications.

Indeed, many\nhigh-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such\nas computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with\nappropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is\nbuilt from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of\nrepresentation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical,\nfeatures capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and\nsecond, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented\nas backpropagation.\n  While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation\nproblem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential\npre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and\nstructure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these\nregularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied\nthroughout a wide spectrum of applications.\n  Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's\nErlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common\nmathematical framework to study the most successful neural network\narchitectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers.

This inverse\nproblem is reformulated as the optimization problem of finding band-limited\nshape and impedance functions which minimize the $L^2$ distance between the\ncomputed value of the scattered field at the receivers and the data. The\noptimization problem is non-linear, non-convex, and ill-posed. Moreover, the\nobjective function is computationally expensive to evaluate. The recursive\nlinearization approach (RLA) proposed by Chen has been successful in addressing\nthese issues in the context of recovering the sound speed of a domain or the\nshape of a sound-soft obstacle. We present an extension of the RLA for the\nrecovery of both the shape and impedance functions.

We\nfirst develop a microscopic parking simulation model considering both on- and\noff-street parking with limited capacity. In the microscopic model, a parking\nsearch algorithm is proposed to mimic cruising-for-parking based on the\nprinciple of proximity, and a parking-related state tracking algorithm is\nproposed to acquire an event-based simulated data set. Some key aspects of\nparking modeling are discussed based on the sim-ulated evidence and theoretical\nanalysis. Results suggest (i) although the low cruising speed reduces the\nnetwork performance, it does not significantly alter the macroscopic or network\nfundamental diagram (MFD or NFD) unless the cruising vehicles dominate the\ntraffic stream; (ii) distance to park is not uniquely determined by parking\noccupancy because factors such as cruising speed and parking dura-tion also\ncontribute; and (iii) multiscale parking occupancy-driven intelligent parking\nguidance can re-duce distance to park yielding considerable network efficiency\ngains. Using the microscopic model, we then extend, calibrate, and validate a\nmacroscopic parking dynamics model with an NFD representation. The demonstrated\nconsistency between the macro- and micro-models permits integration of the two\nfor online parking pricing optimization via model predictive control. Numerical\nexperiments highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as one\ncaveat. That is, when pricing on-street parking, the road network connected to\nthe alternate off-street parking lots must have sufficient capacity to\nac-commodate the increased parking demand; otherwise, local congestion may\narise that violates the ho-mogeneity assumption underlying the macroscopic\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 23:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

Here, we introduce Reduced-order Nonlinear\nSolutions (RONS): a unified framework for deriving reduced-order models that\ndepend nonlinearly on a set of time-dependent parameters. The set of all\npossible reduced-order solutions are viewed as a manifold immersed in the\nfunction space of the PDE. The parameters are evolved such that the\ninstantaneous discrepancy between reduced dynamics and the full PDE dynamics is\nminimized. This results in a set of explicit ordinary differential equations on\nthe tangent bundle of the manifold. In the special case of linear parameter\ndependence, our reduced equations coincide with the standard Galerkin\nprojection. Furthermore, any number of conserved quantities of the PDE can\nreadily be enforced in our framework. Since RONS does not assume an underlying\nvariational formulation for the PDE, it is applicable to a broad class of\nproblems. We demonstrate the efficacy of RONS on three examples: an\nadvection-diffusion equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and Euler's\nequation for ideal fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 14:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

This suggests that rotation-induced deformation of asteroids through\nrotational spinup produces top shapes. Although some previous simulations using\nthe Discrete Element Method showed that spinup of rubble piles may produce\noblate top shapes, it is still unclear what kinds of conditions such as\nfriction angles of constituent materials and spinup timescales are required for\ntop-shape formation. Here we show, through Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\nsimulations of granular bodies spinning-up at different rates, that the\nrotation-induced deformation of spherical rubble piles before breakup can be\nclassified into three modes according to the friction angle \\phi_{d}:\nquasi-static and internal deformation for \\phi_{d} < 40 degrees, dynamical and\ninternal deformation for 50 degrees < \\phi_{d} < 60 degrees, and surface\nlandslides for \\phi_{d} > 70 degrees. Note that these apparent large values of\nfriction angle can be acceptable if we consider the effect of cohesion among\nblocks of a rubble pile under weak gravity. Bodies with \\phi_{d} < 60 degrees\nevolve into oblate spheroids through internal deformation, but never form\npronounced equators defining a top shape. In contrast, bodies with \\phi_{d} >\n70 degrees deform into axisymmetric top shapes through an axisymmetric surface\nlandslides if spinup timescales are < a few days. In addition, through slow\nspinups with timescales > 1 month, bodies with \\phi_{d} > 70 degrees deform\ninto non-axisymmetric shapes via localized landslides. We suggest that rapid\nspinup mechanisms are preferable for the formation of axisymmetric top shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

This raises the\nquestion of whether indigenous carbon on the Moon is abundant and concentrated\nto the extent where it could be used as a viable resource including as\npropellant. Here, I assess potential sources of lunar carbon based on previous\nwork focused on polar water ice. A simplified model is used to estimate the\ntemperature-dependent Carbon Content of Ices at the lunar poles, and this is\ncombined with remote sensing data to estimate the total amount of carbon and\ngenerate a Carbon Favorability Index that highlights promising deposits for\nfuture ground-based prospecting. Hotspots in the index maps are identified, and\nnearby staging areas are analyzed using quantitative models of trafficability\nand solar irradiance. Overall, the Moon is extremely poor in carbon sources\ncompared to more abundant and readily accessible options at Mars. However, a\nhandful of polar regions may contain appreciable amounts of subsurface\ncarbon-bearing ices that could serve as a rich source in the near term, but\nwould be easily exhausted on longer timescales. Four of those regions were\nfound to have safe nearby staging areas with equatorial-like illumination at a\nmodest height above the surface. Any one of these sites could yield enough C, H\nand O to produce propellant for hundreds of refuelings of a large spacecraft.\nOther potential lunar carbon sources including bulk regolith and pyroclastic\nglasses are less viable due to their low carbon concentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 01:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

Considering that without constraint of pre-defined anchors,\nanchor-free detectors can achieve acceptable accuracy and inference speed\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we start from an anchor-free detector called\nTTFNet, modify the structure of TTFNet and introduce multiple existing tricks\nto realize effective server and mobile solutions respectively. Since all\nexperiments in this paper are conducted based on PaddlePaddle, we call the\nmodel as PAFNet(Paddle Anchor Free Network). For server side, PAFNet can\nachieve a better balance between effectiveness (42.2% mAP) and efficiency\n(67.15 FPS) on a single V100 GPU. For moblie side, PAFNet-lite can achieve a\nbetter accuracy of (23.9% mAP) and 26.00 ms on Kirin 990 ARM CPU, outperforming\nthe existing state-of-the-art anchor-free detectors by significant margins.\nSource code is at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 02:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

For the second scenario, we\nderive an exact analytical singular value decomposition for all relative\ndiffusion and reaction time scales. By writing the stoichiometry matrix using\nKronecker products, we show that the singular vectors and values can also be\nwritten concisely using Kronecker products.\n  Ultimately, we find that the singular value decomposition of the\nreaction-diffusion stoichiometry matrix depends on the singular value\ndecompositions of smaller matrices. These smaller matrices represent modified\nversions of the reaction-only stoichiometry matrices and the analytically known\ndiffusion-only stoichiometry matrix.

In this work we instead consider\nan extension of the type-I seesaw model with the addition of a leptoquark (LQ),\nand employ a non-minimal production mechanism of the RHN via LQ decay, which is\nunsuppressed by neutrino mixing.

For QKD\nresearch, a central issue is to improve the final secure key rate (SKR) and the\nmaximal transmission distance. To address this issue, most works focused on\nreducing the information leakage of QKD. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to further reduce the information leakage by specially considering the\noverlap between the information leakage of quantum part and post-processing\npart. The overlap means that the information leakage of post-processing part\ncaused solely by multi-photon pulses is considered twice in previous studies,\ni.e., both in quantum part and post-processing part. Since the information\ncarried by multi-photon pulses has been considered as completely known by Eve\nthrough the photon-number-splitting attack in quantum part, there is no need to\nconsider it in post-processing part repetitively during the SKR calculation.\nTherefore, our approach can theoretically reduce the information leakage of a\nQKD protocol. Based on this idea, we derive the formulas to calculate the\namount of information leakage for decoy-BB84 and sending-or-not-sending\ntwin-field protocols. Simulation results for these two typical protocols also\ndemonstrate that our approach evidently improves the SKR as well as the maximal\ntransmission distance under practical experimental parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 06:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 08:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

We first point out that due to\nthe presence of this FD adversary, Frequency Hopping (FH) fails. We then\npropose a fast-forward cooperative relaying scheme, wherein the victim node\nhops to the frequency band of a nearby FD helper node that fast-forwards the\nvictim's symbol along with its symbol. At the same time, the victim and the\nhelper cooperatively pour some fraction of their power on the jammed band to\nengage the adversary.

Leveraging the supervision from auxiliary tasks~(such as depth\nestimation) has the potential to heal this shift because many visual tasks are\nclosely related to each other. However, such a supervision is not always\navailable. In this work, we leverage the guidance from self-supervised depth\nestimation, which is available on both domains, to bridge the domain gap.

In this work, we first provide a novel framework to\nmeasure the fairness in the retrieved text contents of ranking models.\nIntroducing a ranker-agnostic measurement, the framework also enables the\ndisentanglement of the effect on fairness of collection from that of rankers.\nTo mitigate these biases, we propose AdvBert, a ranking model achieved by\nadapting adversarial bias mitigation for IR, which jointly learns to predict\nrelevance and remove protected attributes. We conduct experiments on two\npassage retrieval collections (MSMARCO Passage Re-ranking and TREC Deep\nLearning 2019 Passage Re-ranking), which we extend by fairness annotations of a\nselected subset of queries regarding gender attributes. Our results on the\nMSMARCO benchmark show that, (1) all ranking models are less fair in comparison\nwith ranker-agnostic baselines, and (2) the fairness of Bert rankers\nsignificantly improves when using the proposed AdvBert models.

Such systems are used in various\napplications e.g. person re-identification (ReID) or visual product search.\nDespite active development of retrieval models it still remains a challenging\ntask mainly due to large intra-class variance caused by changes in view angle,\nlighting, background clutter or occlusion, while inter-class variance may be\nrelatively low. A large portion of current research focuses on creating more\nrobust features and modifying objective functions, usually based on Triplet\nLoss. Some works experiment with using centroid/proxy representation of a class\nto alleviate problems with computing speed and hard samples mining used with\nTriplet Loss. However, these approaches are used for training alone and\ndiscarded during the retrieval stage. In this paper we propose to use the mean\ncentroid representation both during training and retrieval. Such an aggregated\nrepresentation is more robust to outliers and assures more stable features. As\neach class is represented by a single embedding - the class centroid - both\nretrieval time and storage requirements are reduced significantly. Aggregating\nmultiple embeddings results in a significant reduction of the search space due\nto lowering the number of candidate target vectors, which makes the method\nespecially suitable for production deployments.

Classical economic theory, according\nto which a specific behavior becomes more prevalent when it is rewarded,\nstruggles to explain why incentives sometimes backfire. More recent theories\ntherefore posit a reputational cost offsetting the benefits of receiving an\nincentive -- yet unexplained effects of incentives remain, for instance across\nincentive types and countries. We propose that social norms can offer an\nexplanation for these inconsistencies. Ultimately, social norms determine the\nreputational costs or benefits resulting from a given behavior, and thus\nvariation in the effect of incentives may reflect variation in norms. We\nimplemented a formal model of prosocial behavior integrating social norms,\nwhich we empirically tested on the real-world prosocial behavior of blood\ndonation. Blood donation is essential for many life-saving medical procedures,\nbut also presents an ideal testing ground for our theory: Various incentive\npolicies for blood donors exist across countries, enabling a comparative\napproach. Our preregistered analyses reveal that social norms can indeed\naccount for the varying effects of financial and time incentives on\nindividual-level blood donation behavior across 28 European countries.\nIncentives are associated with higher levels of prosociality when norms\nregarding the incentive are more positive. The results indicate that social\nnorms play an important role in explaining the relationship between incentives\nand prosocial behavior. More generally, our approach highlights the potential\nof integrating theory from across the economic and behavioral sciences to\ngenerate novel insights, with tangible consequences for policy-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 09:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

The tight orbital spacing of these systems has led to\nmuch effort being applied to the understanding of their stability; however, a\nkey limitation of the majority of these studies is the termination of\nsimulations as soon as the orbits of two planets cross. In this work we explore\nthe stability of compact, three-planet systems and continue our simulations all\nthe way to the first collision of planets to yield a better understanding of\nthe lifetime of these systems. We perform over $25,000$ integrations of a\nSun-like star orbited by three Earth-like secondaries for up to a billion\norbits to explore a wide parameter space of initial conditions in both the\nco-planar and inclined cases, with a focus on the initial orbital spacing. We\ncalculate the probability of collision over time and determine the probability\nof collision between specific pairs of planets. We find systems that persist\nfor over $10^8$ orbits after an orbital crossing and show how the\npost-instability survival time of systems depends upon the initial orbital\nseparation, mutual inclination, planetary radius, and the closest encounter\nexperienced. Additionally, we examine the effects of very small changes in the\ninitial positions of the planets upon the time to collision and show the effect\nthat the choice of integrator can have upon simulation results. We generalise\nour results throughout to show both the behaviour of systems with an inner\nplanet initially located at $1$ AU and $0.25$ AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 09:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

At the same time the direct\ncalculations of the high-resolution spectrum and then integrating it over the\ngiven spectral pass-band is computationally demanding due to the vast number of\natomic and molecular lines. This is particularly so when employing\nthree-dimensional (3D) models of stellar atmospheres. To accelerate the\ncalculations, one can employ approximate methods, e.g., the use of Opacity\nDistribution Functions (ODFs). Generally, ODFs provide a good approximation of\ntraditional spectral synthesis i.e., computation of intensities through filters\nwith strictly rectangular transmission function. However, their performance\nstrongly deteriorates when the filter transmission noticeably changes within\nits pass-band, which is the case for almost all filters routinely used in\nstellar physics. In this context, the aims of this paper are a) to generalize\nthe ODFs method for calculating intensities through filters with arbitrary\ntransmission functions; b) to study the performance of the standard and\ngeneralized ODFs methods for calculating intensities emergent from 3D models of\nstellar atmosphere. For this purpose we use the newly-developed MPS-ATLAS\nradiative transfer code to compute intensities emergent 3D cubes simulated with\nthe radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM. The calculations are performed\nin the 1.5D regime, i.e., along many parallel rays passing through the\nsimulated cube. We demonstrate that generalized ODFs method allows accurate and\nfast syntheses of spectral intensities and their centre-to-limb variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 09:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

When decoded with GRAND, short CRC codes\nhave error correction capability that is at least as good as popular codes such\nas BCH codes, but with no restriction on either code length or rate.\n  The state-of-the-art CA-Polar codes are concatenated CRC and Polar codes.

In this case the forward scattering on the escaping particles is the\ndominant process, which amplifies the photometric signal of the parent star\ndetected by the observer. The change in the flux is small, about 10^-3 (1000\nppm) at the best properties of the planetary system, but if the observation is\nenough precise, the detection is possible. The planned Ariel space observatory\nis designed to achieve a stability of < 100 ppm (the goal is 10 ppm) over the\ntemporal bandwidth of the transit, typically less than 10 hours. In this case\nstudy we took the disintegrating exoplanet Kepler-1520b and changed the orbital\nproperties of the system to get a grazing, non-transiting orbit scenario, and\ninvestigated, how different particle sizes, species, Ariel observational\nchannels, and other factors affect the amplitude of the forward-scattering\npeak, and the detectability of the scattering event. Our most important result\nis that the forward-scattering amplitude is not sensitive to the dust\ncomposition, but is very sensitive to the particle size, observational channel,\nand other factors. These factors can reduce mainly the detectability of\n1-micron grains. 0.1-micron grains will be detectable at short wavelengths.\n0.01-micron grains generate long and very small forward scattering amplitude,\nwhich is below the detection limit. Based on our results we can conclude that\nusing Ariel will be possible to detect and investigate not only transiting, but\nalso grazing, non-transiting disintegrating exoplanets based on the forward\nscattering. From the viewpoint of such objects the big advantage of Ariel will\nbe the possibility of multiwavelength observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 10:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

The evolution of an initially localized tumor is analyzed.\nQualitatively different behaviors are observed as the field regulating activity\nfluctuations decreases. For high field values, i.e. efficient thermalization,\ncancer is controlled. For small field values, cancer rapidly and monotonously\nescapes from immunosurveillance. For the critical field value separating these\ntwo domains, the 3E's of immunotherapy are reproduced, with an apparent initial\nelimination of cancer, a long quasi-equilibrium period followed by large\nfluctuations, and the final escape of cancer, even for a favored production of\nimmune system cells. For field values slightly smaller than the critical value,\nmore regular oscillations of the number of immune system cells are\nspontaneously observed in agreement with clinical observations. The\nantagonistic effects that the stimulation of the immune system may have on\noncogenesis are reproduced in the model by activity-weighted rate constants for\nthe autocatalytic productions of immune system cells and cancer cells. Local\nfavorable conditions for the launching of the oscillations are met in the\nfluctuating inhomogeneous system, able to generate a small cluster of immune\nsystem cells with larger activities than those of the surrounding cancer cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 10:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

Therefore, cosmic rays do not affect sensibly the\nquality of Metis VL images. It is also found that the overall efficiency for\ncosmic-ray identification in the Metis VL images is approximately equal to the\ncontribution of Z$>$2 particles.

Most of GNN methods update the node embedding iteratively by aggregating\nits neighbors' information. However, they often suffer from negative\ndisturbance, due to edges connecting nodes with different labels. One approach\nto alleviate this negative disturbance is to use attention to learn the weights\nof aggregation, but current attention-based GNNs only consider feature\nsimilarity and also suffer from the lack of supervision. In this paper, we\nconsider the label dependency of graph nodes and propose a decoupling attention\nmechanism to learn both hard and soft attention. The hard attention is learned\non labels for a refined graph structure with fewer inter-class edges, so that\nthe aggregation's negative disturbance can be reduced. The soft attention aims\nto learn the aggregation weights based on features over the refined graph\nstructure to enhance information gains during message passing. Particularly, we\nformulate our model under the EM framework, and the learned attention is used\nto guide the label propagation in the M-step and the feature propagation in the\nE-step, respectively.

In general,\nthis force is assumed to be pushing or repulsive in nature. In this paper, we\npresent a complete quantum treatment of radiation pressure. We show that the\ninteraction of an atom with light can lead to both repulsive and attractive\nforces due to the absorption and emission of photons, respectively. An atom\nprepared in the excited state initially will experience a pulling force when\ninteracting with light. On the other hand, if the atom is prepared in the\nground state then the force will be repulsive while having the same magnitude\nas in the earlier case. Therefore, for an ensemble of atoms, the direction of\nthe net force will be decided by the excited and ground state populations. In\nthe semi-classical treatment of light-matter interaction, the absorption and\nemission processes have the same probability. Therefore the magnitudes of the\nforce in the two processes turn out to be the same. We obtain the effective\nemission profile for an excited atom interacting with a quantum electromagnetic\nfield, and show that in the quantum treatment, despite these probabilities\nbeing different, the magnitudes of the two statistical forces remain the same.\nThis can be explained by noting that the extra contribution in the emission\nprocess is due to the interaction of the atom with the vacuum modes of the\nelectromagnetic field, which results in a symmetric emission profile,\ncontributing to a net zero force on the atoms in an ensemble. We further\nidentify the set of states of electromagnetic field which give rise to non-zero\nmomentum transfer to the atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 12:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 13:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

It remains however\nan open problem whether the convergence rate can be further improved without\nsacrificing its generalization ability. %on how to exploit strong convexity to\nfurther improve the convergence rate of AdaBelief. To this end, we make a first\nattempt in this work and design a novel optimization algorithm called\nFastAdaBelief that aims to exploit its strong convexity in order to achieve an\neven faster convergence rate. In particular, by adjusting the step size that\nbetter considers strong convexity and prevents fluctuation, our proposed\nFastAdaBelief demonstrates excellent generalization ability as well as superior\nconvergence.

The online nature of this method supports\nscalability by avoiding complete policy representation. The lack of an explicit\nrepresentation however hinders policy interpretability and makes policy\nverification very complex. In this work, we propose two contributions. The\nfirst is a method for identifying unexpected actions selected by POMCP with\nrespect to expert prior knowledge of the task. The second is a shielding\napproach that prevents POMCP from selecting unexpected actions. The first\nmethod is based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). It inspects traces\n(i.e., sequences of belief-action-observation triplets) generated by POMCP to\ncompute the parameters of logical formulas about policy properties defined by\nthe expert. The second contribution is a module that uses online the logical\nformulas to identify anomalous actions selected by POMCP and substitutes those\nactions with actions that satisfy the logical formulas fulfilling expert\nknowledge. We evaluate our approach on Tiger, a standard benchmark for POMDPs,\nand a real-world problem related to velocity regulation in mobile robot\nnavigation. Results show that the shielded POMCP outperforms the standard POMCP\nin a case study in which a wrong parameter of POMCP makes it select wrong\nactions from time to time. Moreover, we show that the approach keeps good\nperformance also if the parameters of the logical formula are optimized using\ntrajectories containing some wrong actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 14:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

For\nsuch purpose, we employ the recently-developed creep tide theory to compute\ntidally-induced TTVs. We implement the creep tide in the recently-developed\nPosidonius N-body code, thus allowing for a high-precision evolution of the\ncoupled spin-orbit dynamics of planetary systems. As a working example for the\nanalyses of tidally-induced TTVs, we apply our version of the code to the\nK2-265 b planet. We analyse the dependence of tidally-induced TTVs with the\nplanetary rotation rate, uniform viscosity coefficient and eccentricity. Our\nresults show that the tidally-induced TTVs are more significant in the case\nwhere the planet is trapped in non-synchronous spin-orbit resonances, in\nparticular the 3/2 and 2/1 spin-orbit resonant states. An analysis of the TTVs\ninduced separately by apsidal precession and tidally-induced orbital decay has\nallowed for the conclusion that the latter effect is much more efficient at\ncausing high-amplitude TTVs than the former effect by 2 - 3 orders of\nmagnitude. We compare our findings for the tidally-induced TTVs obtained with\nPosidonius with analytical formulations for the transit timings used in\nprevious works, and verified that the results for the TTVs coming from\nPosidonius are in excellent agreement with the analytical formulations. These\nresults show that the new version of Posidonius containing the creep tide\ntheory implementation can be used to study more complex cases in the future.\nFor instance, the code can be used to study multiplanetary systems, in which\ncase planet-planet gravitational perturbations must be taken into account\nadditionally to tidal interactions to obtain the TTVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 14:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Interestingly enough, we show that the\ndisformal transformation, generated by this scalar field, and with a constant\ndegree of disformality, leaves invariant (up to diffeomorphisms) the\nMyers-Perry metric with equal momenta. This means that the hair of the scalar\nfield, along with the constant disformality parameter, can be consistently\nabsorbed into further redefinitions of the mass and of the single angular\nparameter of the disformed metric. These results are extended in higher odd\ndimensions with a Myers-Perry metric for which all the momenta are equal.

In the\ncontext of classifying sleep status from actigraphy, Webster's rescoring rules\noffer one popular solution based on the long-term patterns in the output of a\nmoving-window model. Unfortunately, the question of how to optimize rescoring\nrules for any given setting has remained unsolved. To address this problem and\nexpand the possible use cases of rescoring rules, we propose rephrasing these\nrules in terms of epoch-specific features. Our features take two general forms:\n(1) the time lag between now and the most recent [or closest upcoming] bout of\ntime spent in a given state, and (2) the length of the most recent [or closest\nupcoming] bout of time spent in a given state. Given any initial moving window\nmodel, these features can be defined recursively, allowing for straightforward\noptimization of rescoring rules. Joint optimization of the moving window model\nand the subsequent rescoring rules can also be implemented using gradient-based\noptimization software, such as Tensorflow. Beyond binary classification\nproblems (e.g., sleep-wake), the same approach can be applied to summarize\nlong-term patterns for multi-state classification problems (e.g., sitting,\nwalking, or stair climbing). We find that optimized rescoring rules improve the\nperformance of sleep-wake classifiers, achieving accuracy comparable to that of\ncertain neural network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 15:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

In the\nexisting ground support research, there has not yet been a process model that\ndirectly obtains support from the ground support log to study the causal\nrelationship between service nodes and flight delays. Most ground support\nstudies mainly use machine learning methods to predict flight delays, and the\nflight support model they are based on is an ideal model. The study did not\nconduct an in-depth study of the causal mechanism behind the ground support\nlink and did not reveal the true cause of flight delays. Therefore, there is a\ncertain deviation in the prediction of flight delays by machine learning, and\nthere is a certain deviation between the ideal model based on the research and\nthe actual service process. Therefore, it is of practical significance to\nobtain the process model from the guarantee log and analyze its causality.\nHowever, the existing process causal factor discovery methods only do certain\nresearch when the assumption of causal sufficiency is established and does not\nconsider the existence of latent variables. Therefore, this article proposes a\nframework to realize the discovery of process causal factors without assuming\ncausal sufficiency. The optimized fuzzy mining process model is used as the\nservice benchmark model, and the local causal discovery algorithm is used to\ndiscover the causal factors. Under this framework, this paper proposes a new\nMarkov blanket discovery algorithm that does not assume causal sufficiency to\ndiscover causal factors and uses benchmark data sets for testing.

The Kochen-Specker theorem implies that\nquantum mechanics may be interpreted as a contextual hidden variable theory. It\nis shown that such a hidden variable description can be viewed as either\ncontextual in the random variables mapping hidden states to observable outcomes\nor in the probability measure on the hidden state space. The latter view\nsuggests that this apparent contextuality may be interpreted as a simple\nconsequence of measurement disturbance, wherein the initial hidden state is\naltered through interaction with the measuring device, thereby giving rise to a\npossibly different final hidden variable state from which the measurement\noutcome is obtained. In light of this observation, a less restrictive and,\narguably, more reasonable definition of noncontextuality is suggested. To prove\nthat such a description is possible, an explicit and, in this sense,\nnoncontextual hidden variable model is constructed which reproduces all quantum\ntheoretic predictions for the Mermin-Peres square. A critical analysis of some\nrecent and proposed experimental tests of contextuality is also provided.\nAlthough the discussion is restricted to a four-dimensional Hilbert space, the\napproach and conclusions are expected to generalize to any Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 01:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

This\nleads to a repetition of the weights across the processing element (PE) array,\nwhich in turn enables the reuse of the DNN sub-computations (computational\nreuse) and leverage the same data (data reuse) to reduce DNNs computations,\nmemory accesses, and improve energy efficiency albeit at the cost of increased\ntraining time.
