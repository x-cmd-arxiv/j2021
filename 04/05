Similarly, in many distributed RL settings, acting is\ndone on un-accelerated hardware such as CPUs, which likewise restricts model\nsize to prevent intractable experiment run times. These \"actor-latency\"\nconstrained settings present a major obstruction to the scaling up of model\ncomplexity that has recently been extremely successful in supervised learning.\nTo be able to utilize large model capacity while still operating within the\nlimits imposed by the system during acting, we develop an \"Actor-Learner\nDistillation\" (ALD) procedure that leverages a continual form of distillation\nthat transfers learning progress from a large capacity learner model to a small\ncapacity actor model. As a case study, we develop this procedure in the context\nof partially-observable environments, where transformer models have had large\nimprovements over LSTMs recently, at the cost of significantly higher\ncomputational complexity. With transformer models as the learner and LSTMs as\nthe actor, we demonstrate in several challenging memory environments that using\nActor-Learner Distillation recovers the clear sample-efficiency gains of the\ntransformer learner model while maintaining the fast inference and reduced\ntotal training time of the LSTM actor model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 17:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Centaurs go around the Sun between the orbits of Jupiter and\nNeptune. Only a fraction of the known centaurs have been found to display\ncomet-like features. Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is the most remarkable\nactive centaur. It orbits the Sun just beyond Jupiter in a nearly circular\npath. Only a handful of known objects follow similar trajectories.\n  Aims. We present photometric observations of 2020 MK4, a recently found\ncentaur with an orbit not too different from that of 29P, and we perform a\npreliminary exploration of its dynamical evolution.\n  Methods. We analyzed broadband Cousins R and Sloan g', r', and i' images of\n2020 MK4 acquired with the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope and the IAC80 telescope to\nsearch for cometary-like activity, and to derive its surface colors and size.\nIts orbital evolution was studied using direct N-body simulations.\n  Results. Centaur 2020 MK4 is neutral-gray in color and has a faint, compact\ncometary-like coma. The values of its color indexes, (g'-r')=0.42+/-0.04 and\n(r'-i')=0.17+/-0.04, are similar to the solar ones. A lower limit for the\nabsolute magnitude of the nucleus is Hg=11.30+/-0.03 mag which, for an albedo\nin the range of 0.1-0.04, gives an upper limit for its size in the interval\n(23, 37) km. Its orbital evolution is very chaotic and 2020 MK4 may be ejected\nfrom the Solar System during the next 200 kyr. Comet 29P experienced relatively\nclose flybys with 2020 MK4 in the past, sometimes when they were temporary\nJovian satellites.\n  Conclusions. We confirm the presence of a coma of material around a central\nnucleus. Its surface colors place this centaur among the most extreme members\nof the gray group.

At the top-level, TULIP consists of a collection of unique\nprocessing elements (TULIP-PEs) that are organized in a SIMD fashion. Each\nTULIP-PE consists of a small network of binary neurons, and a small amount of\nlocal memory per neuron. The unique aspect of the binary neuron is that it is\nimplemented as a mixed-signal circuit that natively performs the inner-product\nand thresholding operation of an artificial binary neuron. Moreover, the binary\nneuron, which is implemented as a single CMOS standard cell, is reconfigurable,\nand with a change in a single parameter, can implement all standard operations\ninvolved in a BNN. We present novel algorithms for mapping arbitrary nodes of a\nBNN onto the TULIP-PEs. TULIP was implemented as an ASIC in TSMC 40nm-LP\ntechnology.

The relationship\nbetween these waves and larger-scale structures, such as current sheets and\nongoing turbulence remain a topic of investigation. Similarly, the\ninstabilities producing ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind remains an open\nquestion. The goals of this paper are to investigate kinetic electrostatic\nLangmuir and ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind at 0.5 AU and determine\nwhether current sheets and associated streaming instabilities can produce the\nobserved waves. The relationship between these waves and currents is\ninvestigated statistically. Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves instrument\nsuite provides high-resolution snapshots of the fluctuating electric field. The\nLow Frequency Receiver resolves the waveforms of ion-acoustic waves and the\nTime Domain Sampler resolves the waveforms of both ion-acoustic and Langmuir\nwaves. Using these waveform data we determine when these waves are observed in\nrelation to current structures in the solar wind, estimated from the background\nmagnetic field. Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves are frequently observed in the\nsolar wind. Ion-acoustic waves are observed about 1% of the time at 0.5 AU. The\nwaves are more likely to be observed in regions of enhanced currents. However,\nthe waves typically do not occur at current structures themselves. The observed\ncurrents in the solar wind are too small to drive instability by the relative\ndrift between single ion and electron populations. When multi-component ion\nand/or electron distributions are present the observed currents may be\nsufficient for instability. Ion beams are the most plausible source of\nion-acoustic waves. The spacecraft potential is confirmed to be a reliable\nprobe of the background electron density by comparing the peak frequencies of\nLangmuir waves with the plasma frequency calculated from the spacecraft\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 21:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Recently, bearing the message passing paradigm, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the performance of node\nrepresentation learning on graphs. However, a majority class of GNNs are only\ndesigned for homogeneous graphs, leading to inferior adaptivity to the more\ninformative heterogeneous graphs with various types of nodes and edges. Also,\ndespite the necessity of inductively producing representations for completely\nnew nodes (e.g., in streaming scenarios), few heterogeneous GNNs can bypass the\ntransductive learning scheme where all nodes must be known during training.\nFurthermore, the training efficiency of most heterogeneous GNNs has been\nhindered by their sophisticated designs for extracting the semantics associated\nwith each meta path or relation. In this paper, we propose WIde and DEep\nmessage passing Network (WIDEN) to cope with the aforementioned problems about\nheterogeneity, inductiveness, and efficiency that are rarely investigated\ntogether in graph representation learning. In WIDEN, we propose a novel\ninductive, meta path-free message passing scheme that packs up heterogeneous\nnode features with their associated edges from both low- and high-order\nneighbor nodes. To further improve the training efficiency, we innovatively\npresent an active downsampling strategy that drops unimportant neighbor nodes\nto facilitate faster information propagation. Experiments on three real-world\nheterogeneous graphs have further validated the efficacy of WIDEN on both\ntransductive and inductive node representation learning, as well as the\nsuperior training efficiency against state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 23:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 07:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

With the prominent\ndevelopment of deep neural networks (DNNs), there is a recent and ongoing trend\nof enhancing the expressiveness of FM-based models with DNNs. However, though\nbetter results are obtained with DNN-based FM variants, such performance gain\nis paid off by an enormous amount (usually millions) of excessive model\nparameters on top of the plain FM. Consequently, the heavy parameterization\nimpedes the real-life practicality of those deep models, especially efficient\ndeployment on resource-constrained IoT and edge devices.

Firstly, we counted the number of citations, from both reciprocal\nand non-reciprocal authors. We found that reciprocal authors predominantly tend\nto cite other reciprocal authors rather than non-reciprocal ones. For gender\ndiversity, we found that reciprocal pairs that include females tend to emerge\nmore than male-male pairs of reciprocity in various fields, despite the fewer\nnumber of females.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 00:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

In this paper, we examine the performance loss\ncaused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular\nmaximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects\neach data point with probability at least $r\\in[0,1]$.

Learning\nthese models is challenging, however, because end-task supervision only\nprovides a weak indirect signal on what values the latent decisions should\ntake. This often results in the model failing to learn to perform the\nintermediate tasks correctly. In this work, we introduce a way to leverage\npaired examples that provide stronger cues for learning latent decisions. When\ntwo related training examples share internal substructure, we add an additional\ntraining objective to encourage consistency between their latent decisions.\nSuch an objective does not require external supervision for the values of the\nlatent output, or even the end task, yet provides an additional training signal\nto that provided by individual training examples themselves. We apply our\nmethod to improve compositional question answering using neural module networks\non the DROP dataset.

Existing approaches\nfor creating such 3D shapes often suffer from complex measurement by range\ncameras or high-end scanners, which either involve heavy expense cost or result\nin low quality. However, these high-quality equipments limit existing\napproaches in real applications, because the equipments are not easily\naccessible for common users. In this paper, we have designed a 3D human body\nreshaping system by proposing a novel feature-selection-based local mapping\ntechnique, which enables automatic anthropometric parameter modeling for each\nbody facet. Note that the proposed approach can leverage limited anthropometric\nparameters (i.e., 3-5 measurements) as input, which avoids complex measurement,\nand thus better user-friendly experience can be achieved in real scenarios.\nSpecifically, the proposed reshaping model consists of three steps. First, we\ncalculate full-body anthropometric parameters from limited user inputs by\nimputation technique, and thus essential anthropometric parameters for 3D body\nreshaping can be obtained. Second, we select the most relevant anthropometric\nparameters for each facet by adopting relevance masks, which are learned\noffline by the proposed local mapping technique. Third, we generate the 3D body\nmeshes by mapping matrices, which are learned by linear regression from the\nselected parameters to mesh-based body representation. We conduct experiments\nby anthropomorphic evaluation and a user study from 68 volunteers.

Afterward, features of points\nwithin pillars are fed into PointNet to get the corresponding pillars feature\nmap. Then, a depthwise-separable U-Net with the attention module learns the\nclassification from the pillars feature map with an enormously diminished model\nparameter size. Our proposed framework is evaluated on SemanticKITTI against\nboth point-based and discretization-based state-of-the-art learning approaches,\nand achieves an excellent balance between high accuracy and low computing\ncomplexity. Remarkably, our framework achieves the inference runtime of 135.2\nHz on a desktop platform. Moreover, experiments verify that it is deployable on\na low-power edge computing unit powered 10 watts only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 04:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

We found that a neural network tends to first\nunder-fit the minor classes by classifying most of their data into the major\nclasses in early training epochs. To correct these wrong predictions, the\nneural network then must focus on pushing features of minor class data across\nthe decision boundaries between major and minor classes, leading to much larger\ngradients for features of minor classes. We argue that such an under-fitting\nphase over-emphasizes the competition between major and minor classes, hinders\nthe neural network from learning the discriminative knowledge that can be\ngeneralized to test data, and eventually results in over-fitting. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel learning strategy to equalize the training\nprogress across classes. We mix features of the major class data with those of\nother data in a mini-batch, intentionally weakening their features to prevent a\nneural network from fitting them first. We show that this strategy can largely\nbalance the training accuracy and feature gradients across classes, effectively\nmitigating the under-fitting then over-fitting problem for minor class data.

Given this, from urban planners' perspective, it\nis of great necessity to reconsider the planning of parking supply along the\ncity. To this end, this paper is the first to examine the spatial parking\nequilibrium considering the mix of AVs and HVs with parking cruising effect.

To demonstrate the\nmerits of s-LID over the conventional measure of strain, we apply it to data on\nindividual grain motions in a set of deforming granular materials. Several new\ninsights into the evolution of failure are uncovered. First, s-LID reveals a\nhierarchy of concurrent deformation bands that prevails throughout loading\nhistory. These structures vary not only in relative dominance but also spatial\nand kinematic scales. Second, in the nascent stages of the pre-failure regime,\ns-LID uncovers a set of system-spanning, criss-crossing bands: microbands for\nsmall s and embryonic-shearbands at large s, with the former being dominant. At\nthe opposite extreme, in the failure regime, fully formed shearbands at large s\ndominate over the microbands. The novel patterns uncovered from s-LID\ncontradict the common belief of a causal sequence where a subset of microbands\ncoalesce and/or grow to form shearbands. Instead, s-LID suggests that the\ndeformation of the sample in the lead-up to failure is governed by a complex\nsymbiosis among these different coexisting structures, which amplifies and\npromotes the progressive dominance of the embryonic-shearbands over microbands.\nThird, we probed this transition from the microband-dominated regime to the\nshearband-dominated regime by systematically suppressing grain rotations. We\nfound particle rotation to be an essential enabler of the transition to the\nshearband-dominated regime. When grain rotations are completely suppressed,\nthis transition is prevented: microbands and shearbands coexist in relative\nparity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 05:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

The reported experiment\nconsists in sublattice-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy under\nperpendicular electric and magnetic fields that control the TLG bands. The\ntunneling spectra agree very well with the results of theoretical modeling that\nincludes the full details of the TLG tight-binding model and accounts for a\nquantum-dot-like potential profile formed electrostatically under the scanning\ntunneling microscope tip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 05:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 05:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 22:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

We describe an octonionic model for Spin(11,3) in which the\nsemi-spinor representation gets identified with S=OxO', where O,O' are the\nusual and split octonions respectively. It is then well-known that choosing a\nunit imaginary octonion u in Im(O) equips O with a complex structure J.\nSimilarly, choosing a unit imaginary split octonion u' in Im(O') equips O' with\na complex structure J', except that there are now two inequivalent complex\nstructures, one parametrised by a choice of a timelike and the other of a\nspacelike unit u'.

The aggregated contexts are used to predict the contextual\nrelationship between the regions and partition the regions in the following\nhierarchical level.

We modelled a typical coronal loop by a straight and\naxisymmetric cylindrical magnetic flux tube filled with cold plasma. We solved\nthe dispersion relation numerically for different values of the longitudinal\nmass density stratification. We show that, in inclined and asymmetric loops,\nthe frequencies and their corresponding damping rates of the fundamental and\nfirst-overtone modes of kink oscillations are smaller in comparison with\nsemi-circular uninclined loops with the same lengths. The results also indicate\nthat, the period ratio $P_1/P_2$, increases with increasing the inclination of\nthe loop, but it decreases less than $2\\%$ while imposing the asymmetry to each\nloop side, up to $9.66\\%$ of the loop length. The ratio of each mode frequency\nto its corresponding damping rate remain unchanged approximately while the\ninclination or the asymmetry imposed. Hence, we conclude that these ratios are\nreliable for inferring the physical parameters of coronal loops and coronal\nmedium, regardless of the loop shape or the state of its inclination. In\naddition, in contrast with the effect of asymmetry which is not significant on\nthe period ratio $P_1/P_2$, when an observed oscillating loop has a smaller\napex height, the state of its inclination is an important factor that should be\nconsidered, especially when the period ratio $P_1/P_2$, is taken into\nconsideration for coronal seismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 09:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

While the problem is known to be computationally hard, we strengthen\nexisting hardness results by providing a novel strong approximation hardness\nresult: For any positive constant $C$, we prove that, unless $P=NP$, there is\nno polynomial-time algorithm for ODP that achieves an approximation guarantee\nof $\\alpha \\ge (\\ln n)^{-C}$, where $n$ is the number of voters.

Particularly in time series forecasting problems, this\ncombination is often dynamic to cope with potential non-stationary sources of\nvariation present in the data. Despite their superior predictive performance,\nensemble methods entail two main limitations: high computational costs and lack\nof transparency. These issues often preclude the deployment of such approaches,\nin favour of simpler yet more efficient and reliable ones. In this paper, we\nleverage the idea of model compression to address this problem in time series\nforecasting tasks. Model compression approaches have been mostly unexplored for\nforecasting. Their application in time series is challenging due to the\nevolving nature of the data. Further, while the literature focuses on neural\nnetworks, we apply model compression to distinct types of methods. In an\nextensive set of experiments, we show that compressing dynamic forecasting\nensembles into an individual model leads to a comparable predictive performance\nand a drastic reduction in computational costs. Further, the compressed\nindividual model with best average rank is a rule-based regression model. Thus,\nmodel compression also leads to benefits in terms of model interpretability.\nThe experiments carried in this paper are fully reproducible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 09:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Regarding its\ncontrol, model predictive control (MPC) has become very appealing due to its\nnatural consideration of discrete inputs, its optimization capability, and the\npresent-day availability of powerful processing hardware. The main drawback of\nMPC compared to other control techniques in this field is that the control\ninput is held constant during the sampling period, and it is usually difficult\nor even impossible to reduce this sampling period because of hardware\nlimitations. For this reason, a multirate MPC algorithm is proposed, which\nallows to change the control input several times within the sampling period.\nThe optimization problem is simplified and made suboptimal to substantially\ndecrease computational burden. This approach is tested in simulation on a\nthree-phase, five-level diode-clamped converter (DCC) operating in inverted\nmode with a three-phase resistive load.

However, most of these conventional UDA approaches make the strong\nassumption of having access to the source data during training, which may not\nbe very practical due to privacy, security and storage concerns. A recent line\nof work addressed this problem and proposed an algorithm that transfers\nknowledge to the unlabeled target domain from a single source model without\nrequiring access to the source data. However, for adaptation purposes, if there\nare multiple trained source models available to choose from, this method has to\ngo through adapting each and every model individually, to check for the best\nsource. Thus, we ask the question: can we find the optimal combination of\nsource models, with no source data and without target labels, whose performance\nis no worse than the single best source? To answer this, we propose a novel and\nefficient algorithm which automatically combines the source models with\nsuitable weights in such a way that it performs at least as good as the best\nsource model.

On the other hand, aggregated\ninformation and preferences as communicated through media, polls, political\nparties, or interest groups, also play a large role in the individual opinion\nformation process. Further on, actors are also capable of strategic opinion\nformation in the light of a pending referendum, election or other collective\ndecision.

The\nchannel estimation stage typically involves an initial beam training process\nwhere a subset of the possible beam directions at the transmitter and receiver\nis scanned along a predefined codebook. Unfortunately, the high number of\ntransmit and receive antennas deployed in mmWave systems increase the\ncomplexity of the beam selection and channel estimation tasks. In this work, we\ntackle the channel estimation problem in analog systems from a different\nperspective than used by previous works. In particular, we propose to move the\nchannel estimation problem from the angular domain into the transformed spatial\ndomain, in which estimating the angles of arrivals and departures corresponds\nto estimating the angular frequencies of paths constituting the mmWave channel.\nThe proposed approach, referred to as transformed spatial domain channel\nestimation (TSDCE) algorithm, exhibits robustness to additive white Gaussian\nnoise by combining low-rank approximations and sample autocorrelation functions\nfor each path in the transformed spatial domain. Numerical results evaluate the\nmean square error of the channel estimation and the direction of arrival\nestimation capability.

Revenue generation\nmotivates the availability of these resources for managing such deviations.\nHowever, limited research has been conducted on data-driven decisions and\noptimal bidding strategies for trading such capacities in multiple frequency\nreserves markets. We address this limitation by making the following research\ncontributions. Firstly, a generalised model is designed based on an extensive\nstudy of critical characteristics of global frequency reserves markets.\nSecondly, three bidding strategies are proposed, based on this market model, to\ncapitalise on price peaks in multi-stage markets. Two strategies are proposed\nfor non-reschedulable loads, in which case the bidding strategy aims to select\nthe market with the highest anticipated price, and the third bidding strategy\nfocuses on rescheduling loads to hours on which highest reserve market prices\nare anticipated. The third research contribution is an Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) based bidding optimization framework that implements these three\nstrategies, with novel uncertainty metrics that supplement data-driven price\nprediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated empirically using a case study\nof multiple frequency reserves markets in Finland. The results from this\nevaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed bidding strategies and the\nAI-based bidding optimization framework in terms of cumulative revenue\ngeneration, leading to an increased availability of frequency reserves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 12:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In creating novel methods\nto produce redshift estimations, there has been a shift towards using machine\nlearning techniques. However, there has not been as much of a focus on how well\ndifferent machine learning methods scale or perform with the ever-increasing\namounts of data being produced. Here, we introduce a benchmark designed to\nanalyse the performance and scalability of different supervised machine\nlearning methods for photometric redshift estimation. Making use of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS - DR12) dataset, we analysed a variety of the most\nused machine learning algorithms. By scaling the number of galaxies used to\ntrain and test the algorithms up to one million, we obtained several metrics\ndemonstrating the algorithms' performance and scalability for this task.\nFurthermore, by introducing a new optimisation method, time-considered\noptimisation, we were able to demonstrate how a small concession of error can\nallow for a great improvement in efficiency. From the algorithms tested we\nfound that the Random Forest performed best in terms of error with a mean\nsquared error, MSE = 0.0042; however, as other algorithms such as Boosted\nDecision Trees and k-Nearest Neighbours performed incredibly similarly, we used\nour benchmarks to demonstrate how different algorithms could be superior in\ndifferent scenarios.

In this\npaper, we take a completely different perspective -- we work on the assumption\nthat there is always a new style that is drastically different, and that we\nwill only have very limited data during testing to perform adaptation. This\nresults in a commercially viable solution -- the model has the best shot at\nadaptation being exposed to the new style, and the few samples nature makes it\npractical to implement. We achieve this via a novel meta-learning framework\nwhich exploits additional new-writer data through a support set, and outputs a\nwriter-adapted model via single gradient step update, all during inference. We\ndiscover and leverage on the important insight that there exists few key\ncharacters per writer that exhibit relatively larger style discrepancies. For\nthat, we additionally propose to meta-learn instance specific weights for a\ncharacter-wise cross-entropy loss, which is specifically designed to work with\nthe sequential nature of text data.

In this paper, we propose two novel\nmodules, named superpixel-guided clustering (SGC) and guided prototype\nallocation (GPA), for multiple prototype extraction and allocation.\nSpecifically, SGC is a parameter-free and training-free approach, which\nextracts more representative prototypes by aggregating similar feature vectors,\nwhile GPA is able to select matched prototypes to provide more accurate\nguidance. By integrating the SGC and GPA together, we propose the Adaptive\nSuperpixel-guided Network (ASGNet), which is a lightweight model and adapts to\nobject scale and shape variation. In addition, our network can easily\ngeneralize to k-shot segmentation with substantial improvement and no\nadditional computational cost. In particular, our evaluations on COCO\ndemonstrate that ASGNet surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 5% in 5-shot\nsegmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 13:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 12:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

However, if the aggregated computing\npower of the pool forms a substantial portion of the total computing power in\nthe network, the pooled mining undermines the core spirit of blockchain, i.e.,\nthe decentralization, and harms its security. To discourage the pooled mining,\nwe develop a new consensus protocol called Proof-of-Age (PoA) that builds upon\nthe native PoW protocol. The core idea of PoA lies in using Age-of-Work (AoW)\nto measure the effective mining period that the miner has devoted to\nmaintaining the security of blockchain. Unlike in the native PoW protocol, in\nour PoA protocol, miners benefit from its effective mining period even if they\nhave not successfully mined a block. We first employ a continuous time Markov\nchain (CTMC) to model the block generation process of the PoA based blockchain.\nBased on this CTMC model, we then analyze the block generation rates of the\nmining pool and solo miner respectively. Our analytical results verify that\nunder PoA, the block generation rates of miners in the mining pool are reduced\ncompared to that of solo miners, thereby disincentivizing the pooled mining.\nFinally, we simulate the mining process in the PoA blockchain to demonstrate\nthe consistency of the analytical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 14:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

The Rashba effect in this system\nis associated with the local dipole field transverse to and in the plane of the\nnanoribbon. That dipole field is induced by the off-center adsorption of the Gd\nadatom above the hex-carbon ring near the nanoribbon edges. The transverse\nRashba effect at the two Gd adatoms enhances each other in the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state and cancels each other in the\nferromagnetic (FM) meta-stable state, because of the centrosymmetric atomic\nstructure. The transverse Rashba parameter is 1.51 eV A. This system shows a\nstrong perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), which is 1.4 meV per\nGd atom in the AFM state or 2.2 meV per Gd atom in the FM state. The origin of\nthe perpendicular MCA is analyzed in k-space by filtering out the contribution\nof the transverse Rashba effect from the band structures perturbed by the\nspin-orbit coupling interactions. The first-order perturbation of the orbit and\nspin angular momentum coupling is the major source of the MCA, which is\nassociated with the one-dimensionality of the system.

A fundamental challenge in training the\nexisting deep saliency detection models is the requirement of large amounts of\nannotated data. While gathering large quantities of training data becomes cheap\nand easy, annotating the data is an expensive process in terms of time, labor\nand human expertise. To address this problem, this paper proposes to learn the\neffective salient object detection model based on the manual annotation on a\nfew training images only, thus dramatically alleviating human labor in training\nmodels. To this end, we name this task as the few-cost salient object detection\nand propose an adversarial-paced learning (APL)-based framework to facilitate\nthe few-cost learning scenario.

Hybrid classical quantum algorithms such as\nthe variational quantum algorithms have been proposed to effectively use\ncurrent term quantum devices. One promising approach to quantum simulation in\nthe noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the diagonalisation based\napproach, with some of the promising examples being the subspace Variational\nQuantum Simulator (SVQS), Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF), fixed-state\nVariational Fast Forwarding (fs-VFF), and the Variational Hamiltonian\nDiagonalisation (VHD) algorithms.

The CQFF algorithm does not suffer from the barren\nplateau problem and the accuracy can be systematically increased.

However, there are still a lot of limitations in\nvalue function factorization. In VDN, the joint action-value function is the\nsum of per-agent action-value function while the joint action-value function of\nQMIX is the monotonic mixing of per-agent action-value function. To some\nextent, QTRAN reduces the limitation of joint action-value functions that can\nbe represented, but it has unsatisfied performance in complex tasks. In this\npaper, in order to extend the class of joint value functions that can be\nrepresented, we propose a novel actor-critic method called NQMIX. NQMIX\nintroduces an off-policy policy gradient on QMIX and modify its network\narchitecture, which can remove the monotonicity constraint of QMIX and\nimplement a non-monotonic value function factorization for the joint\naction-value function. In addition, NQMIX takes the state-value as the learning\ntarget, which overcomes the problem in QMIX that the learning target is\noverestimated. Furthermore, NQMIX can be extended to continuous action space\nsettings by introducing deterministic policy gradient on itself. Finally, we\nevaluate our actor-critic methods on SMAC domain, and show that it has a\nstronger performance than COMA and QMIX on complex maps with heterogeneous\nagent types.

With the advancement and decreasing\ncost of sequencing technology, the increasingly available whole genome\nsequencing data provide much richer information about the underlying population\nstructure. The traditional method (Patterson, Price, and Reich, 2006)\noriginally developed for array-based genotype data for computing and selecting\ntop principal components that capture population structure may not perform well\non sequencing data for two reasons. First, the number of genetic variants p is\nmuch larger than the sample size n in sequencing data such that the\nsample-to-marker ratio n/p is nearly zero, violating the assumption of the\nTracy-Widom test used in their method. Second, their method might not be able\nto handle the linkage disequilibrium well in sequencing data. To resolve those\ntwo practical issues, we propose a new method called ERStruct to determine the\nnumber of top informative principal components based on sequencing data. More\nspecifically, we propose to use the ratio of consecutive eigenvalues as a more\nrobust test statistic, and then we approximate its null distribution using\nmodern random matrix theory.

For this, a model of\nmeasurement is proposed which lends itself to theoretical analysis using\nHamiltonian mechanics and Bayesian probability. At odds with a widely-held\nintuition, it is found that the ideal measurement capable of extracting finite\ninformation without disturbing the system is ruled out (by the third law of\nthermodynamics). And in its place a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance\nrelation is found, with the role of $\\hbar/2$ played by $k_BT/\\Omega$; where\n$T$ and $\\Omega$ are a certain temperature and frequency characterizing the\nready-state of the apparatus. The proposed model is argued to be maximally\nefficient, in that it saturates this Heisenberg-like inequality, while various\nmodifications of the model fail to saturate it. The process of continuous\nmeasurement is then examined; yielding a novel pair of Liouville-like master\nequations -- according to whether the measurement record is read or discarded\n-- describing the dynamics of (a rational agent's knowledge of) a system under\ncontinuous measurement. The master equation corresponding to discarded record\ndoubles as a description of an open thermodynamic system. The fine-grained\nShannon entropy is found to be a Lyapunov function (i.e. $\\dot S\\geq0$) of the\ndynamics when the record is discarded, providing a novel H-theorem suitable for\nstudying the second law and non-equilibrium statistical physics. These findings\nmay also be of interest to those working on the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, in particular along the lines of attempting to identify and unmix a\npossible epistemic component of quantum theory from its ontic content.

This is mainly due to the distinction between\nmeasuring and seeing, where the former is described by the Lorentz\nTransformation and the latter considers the time light rays (emitted by each\npoint on the object) take to reach the observer. We compute the apparent\nposition of a point given its velocity, initial position, and observation time.\nThe apparent speed of a point is calculated, and we obtain that it exceeds the\nspeed of light when approaching the observer, similar to superluminal motion.\nFor parameterizable surfaces, we analyze properties (such as curvature and\ntorsion) of apparent shapes. The observation that a sphere retains its circular\nsilhouette when transformed to its apparent shape, independent of the initial\nconditions, is proved mathematically. Plots describing the apparent speed and\nlength of objects are made, and the metric tensor for a distorted sphere is\ncalculated. A generalized equation for the Doppler effect and relativistic\naberration is derived to analyze regions of redshift and blueshift.

However, most current models are based on sequential\nmodels which truncate the behavior sequences by a fixed length, thus have\ndifficulties in handling very long behavior sequences. Another big problem is\nthat sequences with the same length can be quite different in terms of time,\ncarrying completely different meanings. In this paper, we propose a\nnon-sequential approach to tackle the above problems. Specifically, we first\nrepresent the behavior data in a sparse key-vector format, where the vector\ncontains rich behavior info such as time, count and category. Next, we enhance\nthe Deep Interest Network to take such rich information into account by a novel\nattention network. The sparse representation makes it practical to handle large\nscale long behavior sequences. Finally, we introduce a multidimensional\npartition framework to mine behavior interactions. The framework can partition\ndata into custom designed time buckets to capture the interactions among\ninformation aggregated in different time buckets. Similarly, it can also\npartition the data into different categories and capture the interactions among\nthem. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets: one is an advertising\ndataset and the other is a production recommender dataset. Our models\noutperform other state-of-the-art models on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 14:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

In this paper, we study this problem under the\n\\emph{co\\mbox{-}operative game theoretic} framework. We model this problem as a\nco\\mbox{-}operative game where the users of the network are the players and for\na group of users, the expected influence by them under the \\emph{Maximum\nInfluence Arborences} diffusion model is its utility. We call this game as\n\\emph{BIM Game} and show this is `non-convex' and `sub-additive'. Based on the\nproposed game\\mbox{-}theoretic model and using the solution concept called\n`Shapley Value', we propose an iterative algorithm for finding seed nodes. The\nproposed methodology is divided into mainly two broad steps: the first one is\ncomputing the approximate marginal gain in \\emph{Shapley Value} for all the\nnodes of the network, and the second one is selecting seed nodes from the\nsorted list until the budget is exhausted. We also show that the proposed\nmethodology can even be more effective when the community structure of the\nnetwork is exploited. The proposed methodologies have been implemented, and an\nextensive set of experiments have been conducted with three publicly available\nsocial network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the seed set\nselected by the proposed methodologies lead to more number of influence nodes\ncompared to many standard and baseline methods from the literature with a\nreasonable computational overhead. In particular, if the community structure of\nthe network is exploited then there is an increase upto $2 \\%$ in number of\ninfluenced nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 09:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

The COVID-19 pandemic is a\ncatastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as\ndepression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of\ndeep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis\nwith data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with\nCOVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where the rise and\nfall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and\nemployment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people\nhave been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep\nunderstanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we\npresent a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis\nduring the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India.

Nevertheless,\nthis homogenized continuum presents non-positive defined elastic potential\nenergy, a deficiency that limits the reliability of the model and implies\ninstability phenomena (destabilizing effects) in the acoustic branches.

However, describing questions using structured\nqueries is not straightforward for non-expert users who need to have sufficient\nknowledge about both the vocabulary and the structure of the queried knowledge\ngraph, as well as the syntax of the structured query language used to describe\nthe user's information needs. The most popular approach introduced to overcome\nthe aforementioned challenges is to use natural language to query these\nknowledge graphs. Although several question answering benchmarks can be used to\nevaluate question-answering systems over a number of popular knowledge graphs,\nchoosing a benchmark to accurately assess the quality of a question answering\nsystem is a challenging task.\n  In this paper, we introduce CBench, an extensible, and more informative\nbenchmarking suite for analyzing benchmarks and evaluating question answering\nsystems.
