Most of the state-of-the-art approaches\nsolve this task with RGB cameras, however struggling when subjects are moving\nfast. On the other hand, event-based 3D pose estimation benefits from the\nadvantages of event-cameras, especially their efficiency and robustness to\nappearance changes. Yet, finding human poses in asynchronous events is in\ngeneral more challenging than standard RGB pose estimation, since little or no\nevents are triggered in static scenes. Here we propose the first learning-based\nmethod for 3D human pose from a single stream of events. Our method consists of\ntwo steps. First, we process the event-camera stream to predict three\northogonal heatmaps per joint; each heatmap is the projection of of the joint\nonto one orthogonal plane. Next, we fuse the sets of heatmaps to estimate 3D\nlocalisation of the body joints. As a further contribution, we make available a\nnew, challenging dataset for event-based human pose estimation by simulating\nevents from the RGB Human3.6m dataset.

We\nalso show that unless the \"Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis\" (SETH) fails,\nthere is no algorithm for CIS with run time O(1.4141^n).\n  We show that without the equality predicate SAT(FO2) is in fact equivalent to\nCIS in succinct representation. This yields two algorithms for SAT(FO2) without\nthe equality predicate with run time O(1.4423^{2^n}) and O(1.6181^{2^n}), where\nn is the number of predicates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the\nfirst exact algorithms for an NEXP-complete decidable logic with run time\nsignificantly lower than O(2^{2^n}). We also identify a few lower complexity\nfragments of FO2 which correspond to the tractable fragments of CIS. Similar to\nCIS, unless SETH fails, there is no algorithm for SAT(FO2) with run time\nO(1.4141^{2^n}).\n  For the fragment with the equality predicate, we present a linear time\nmany-one reduction to the fragment without the equality predicate. The\nreduction yields equi-satisfiable formulas with a small constant blow-up in the\nnumber of predicates. Finally, we also perform some small experiments which\nshow that our approach is indeed more promising than the existing method (based\non the ESM property). The experiments also show that although theoretically it\nhas the worse run time, the second algorithm in general performs better than\nthe first one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 16:29:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 01:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

However, the performance of\nexisting tensor decomposition methods is not as good as desired. First, they\nsuffer from the data-sparsity issue since they can only learn from the N-ary\nrelational data with a specific arity, i.e., parts of common N-ary relational\ndata.

We argue\nthat the age-metallicity-specific orbital energy relation in a galaxy's\nglobular cluster system can be used to identify its origin. Gas-rich mergers\nshould produce tightly bound systems in which metal-rich clusters are younger\nthan metal-poor clusters. Globular clusters formed in massive disks and then\nscattered into a halo should have no relationship between age and specific\norbital energy. Accreted globular clusters should produce weakly bound systems\nin which age and metallicity are correlated with each other but inversely\ncorrelated with specific orbital energy. We use precise relative ages,\nself-consistent metallicities, and space-based proper motion-informed orbits to\nshow that the Milky Way's metal-poor globular cluster system lies in a plane in\nage-metallicity-specific orbital energy space. We find that relatively young or\nmetal-poor globular clusters are weakly bound to the Milky Way, while\nrelatively old or metal-rich globular clusters are tightly bound to the Galaxy.\nWhile metal-rich globular clusters may be formed either in situ or ex situ, our\nresults suggest that metal-poor clusters formed outside of the Milky Way in\nnow-disrupted dwarf galaxies.

A promising model for the rapid\nformation of giant-planet cores is pebble accretion in which gas drag during\nencounters leads to high accretion rates. Most models of pebble accretion\nconsider disks with a monotonic, radial pressure profile. This causes a\ncontinuous inward flux of pebbles and inefficient growth. Here we examine\nplanet formation in a disk with multiple, intrinsic pressure bumps. In the\nouter disk, pebbles become trapped near these bumps allowing rapid growth under\nsuitable conditions. In the inner disk, pebble traps may not exist because the\ninward gas advection velocity is too high. Pebbles here are rapidly removed. In\nthe outer disk, growth is very sensitive to the initial planet mass and the\nstrength of turbulence. This is because turbulent density fluctuations raise\nplanetary eccentricities, increasing the planet-pebble relative velocity.\nPlanetary seeds above a distance-dependent critical mass grow to a Jupiter mass\nin 0.5--3 million years out to at least 60 AU in a 0.03 solar-mass disk.\nSmaller bodies remain near their initial mass, leading to a sharp dichotomy in\ngrowth outcomes. For turbulent alpha = 1e-4, the critical masses are 1e-4 and\n1e-3 Earth masses at 9 and 75 AU, respectively. Pressure bumps in disks may\nexplain the large mass difference between the giant planets and Kuiper belt\nobjects, and also the existence of wide-orbit planets in some systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 18:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

This has\nspurred interest in model stealing, which is made more practical by advances in\nlearning with partial, little, or no supervision. Existing defenses focus on\ninserting unique watermarks in a model's decision surface, but this is\ninsufficient: the watermarks are not sampled from the training distribution and\nthus are not always preserved during model stealing. In this paper, we make the\nkey observation that knowledge contained in the stolen model's training set is\nwhat is common to all stolen copies. The adversary's goal, irrespective of the\nattack employed, is always to extract this knowledge or its by-products. This\ngives the original model's owner a strong advantage over the adversary: model\nowners have access to the original training data. We thus introduce $dataset$\n$inference$, the process of identifying whether a suspected model copy has\nprivate knowledge from the original model's dataset, as a defense against model\nstealing. We develop an approach for dataset inference that combines\nstatistical testing with the ability to estimate the distance of multiple data\npoints to the decision boundary. Our experiments on CIFAR10, SVHN, CIFAR100 and\nImageNet show that model owners can claim with confidence greater than 99% that\ntheir model (or dataset as a matter of fact) was stolen, despite only exposing\n50 of the stolen model's training points.

However, some factors such as\ntemporal dynamics and spike timings prove critical for information processing\nbut are often ignored by existing works, limiting the performance and\napplications of neuromorphic computing. On one hand, due to the lack of\neffective SNN training algorithms, it is difficult to utilize the temporal\nneural dynamics. Many existing algorithms still treat neuron activation\nstatistically. On the other hand, utilizing temporal neural dynamics also poses\nchallenges to hardware design. Synapses exhibit temporal dynamics, serving as\nmemory units that hold historical information, but are often simplified as a\nconnection with weight. Most current models integrate synaptic activations in\nsome storage medium to represent membrane potential and institute a hard reset\nof membrane potential after the neuron emits a spike. This is done for its\nsimplicity in hardware, requiring only a \"clear\" signal to wipe the storage\nmedium, but destroys temporal information stored in the neuron.\n  In this work, we derive an efficient training algorithm for Leaky Integrate\nand Fire neurons, which is capable of training a SNN to learn complex spatial\ntemporal patterns. We achieved competitive accuracy on two complex datasets. We\nalso demonstrate the advantage of our model by a novel temporal pattern\nassociation task. Codesigned with this algorithm, we have developed a CMOS\ncircuit implementation for a memristor-based network of neuron and synapses\nwhich retains critical neural dynamics with reduced complexity.

Each\nnetwork possesses an intrinsic diffusive potential that depends on its\nstructural connectivity. However, the diffusion of a process depends not only\non this topological potential but also on the dynamical process itself.\nQuantifying this potential will allow the design of more efficient systems in\nwhich it is necessary either to weaken or to enhance diffusion. Here we\nintroduce a measure, the {\\em diffusion capacity}, that quantifies, through the\nconcept of dynamical paths, the potential of an element of the system, and\nalso, of the system itself, to propagate information. Among other examples, we\nstudy a heat diffusion model and SIR model to demonstrate the value of the\nproposed measure. We found, in the last case, that diffusion capacity can be\nused as a predictor of the evolution of the spreading process.

Most of the research is\nfocused on achieving higher accuracy and these models are not optimized for\ndeployment on embedded systems from the perspective of latency and power\nefficiency. For high speed driving scenarios, latency is a crucial parameter as\nit provides more time to react to dangerous situations. Typically a voxel or\npoint-cloud based 3D convolution approach is utilized for this module. Firstly,\nthey are inefficient on embedded platforms as they are not suitable for\nefficient parallelization.

It will become\nclear, when we expose our solution, why this solution could not be found in the\nway in which earlier on musicians and scientist have been approaching the\nproblem. We follow indeed a different approach. We first construct a\nmathematical representation of the complete harmony by means of a vector space,\nwhere the different tones are represented in complete harmonic way for all keys\nat once. One of the essential differences with earlier systems is that tones\nwill no longer be ordered within an octave, and we find the octave-like\nordering back as a projection of our system. But it is exactly by this\nprojection procedure that the possibility to create a harmonic system for all\nkeys at once is lost. So we see why the old way of ordering tones within an\noctave could not lead to a solution of the problem. We indicate in which way a\nreal musical instrument could be built that realizes our harmonic scheme.\nBecause tones are no longer ordered within an octave such a musical instrument\nwill be rather unconventional. It is however a physically realizable musical\ninstrument, at least for the Pythagorean harmony. We also indicate how perfect\nharmonies of every dimension could be realized by computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 23:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

It is shown that microwave(MW) current injected into\na layer of silver paint coated on an insulating DPPH sample is able to excite\nthe paramagnetic resonance in DPPH. As the applied dc magnetic field H is\nswept, the high-frequency resistance of the Ag-paint layer, measured at room\ntemperature with a single port impedance analyzer in the MW frequency range 1\nto 2.5 GHz, exhibits a sharp peak at a critical value of the dc field (H =\nHres) while the reactance exhibits a dispersion-like behavior around the same\nfield value for a given frequency.

Currently, most KG embedding models\nare trained based on negative sampling, i.e., the model aims to maximize some\nsimilarity of the connected entities in the KG, while minimizing the similarity\nof the sampled disconnected entities. Negative sampling helps to reduce the\ntime complexity of model learning by only considering a subset of negative\ninstances, which may fail to deliver stable model performance due to the\nuncertainty in the sampling procedure. To avoid such deficiency, we propose a\nnew framework for KG embedding -- Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (NS-KGE). The basic idea is to consider all of the negative instances\nin the KG for model learning, and thus to avoid negative sampling. The\nframework can be applied to square-loss based knowledge graph embedding models\nor models whose loss can be converted to a square loss. A natural side-effect\nof this non-sampling strategy is the increased computational complexity of\nmodel learning. To solve the problem, we leverage mathematical derivations to\nreduce the complexity of non-sampling loss function, which eventually provides\nus both better efficiency and better accuracy in KG embedding compared with\nexisting models. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our NS-KGE\nframework can achieve a better performance on efficiency and accuracy over\ntraditional negative sampling based models, and that the framework is\napplicable to a large class of knowledge graph embedding models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 23:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 19:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 15:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

Synchronous generators (SGs\nand VSGs) and droop-controlled inverters are typical GFM devices in modern\npower systems. SGs/VSGs are able to provide inertia while droop-controlled\ninverters are generally inertialess. The transient stability of power systems\ndominated by homogeneous GFM devices has been extensively studied. Regarding\nthe hybrid system jointly dominated by heterogeneous GFM devices, the transient\nstability is rarely reported. This paper aims to fill this gap. It is found\nthat the synchronization behavior of the hybrid system can be described by a\nsecond-order motion equation, resembling the swing equation of SGs. Moreover,\ntwo significant differences from conventional power systems are discovered. The\nfirst is that the droop control dramatically enhances the damping effect,\ngreatly affecting the transient stability region. The second is that the\nfrequency state variable exhibits a jump at the moment of fault disturbances,\nthus impacting the post-fault initial-state location and stability assessment.\nThe underlying mechanism behind the two new characteristics is clarified and\nthe impact on the transient stability performance is analyzed and verified.

We propose Seshat, a Predictive Mutation Analysis (PMA)\ntechnique that can accurately predict the entire kill matrix, not just the\nmutation score of the given test suite. Seshat exploits the natural language\nchannel in code, and learns the relationship between the syntactic and semantic\nconcepts of each test case and the mutants it can kill, from a given kill\nmatrix. The learnt model can later be used to predict the kill matrices for\nsubsequent versions of the program, even after both the source and test code\nhave changed significantly. Empirical evaluation using the programs in the\nDefects4J shows that Seshat can predict kill matrices with the average F-score\nof 0.83 for versions that are up to years apart. This is an improvement of\nF-score by 0.14 and 0.45 point over the state-of-the-art predictive mutation\ntesting technique, and a simple coverage based heuristic, respectively.

Especially, deep neural network (DNN)\nmethods have significantly reduced estimation errors for crowd counting\nmissions. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, i.e., normal images with human-imperceptible perturbations\ncould mislead DNNs to make false predictions. In this work, we propose a robust\nattack strategy called Adversarial Patch Attack with Momentum (APAM) to\nsystematically evaluate the robustness of crowd counting models, where the\nattacker's goal is to create an adversarial perturbation that severely degrades\ntheir performances, thus leading to public safety accidents (e.g., stampede\naccidents). Especially, the proposed attack leverages the extreme-density\nbackground information of input images to generate robust adversarial patches\nvia a series of transformations (e.g., interpolation, rotation, etc.). We\nobserve that by perturbing less than 6\\% of image pixels, our attacks severely\ndegrade the performance of crowd counting systems, both digitally and\nphysically. To better enhance the adversarial robustness of crowd counting\nmodels, we propose the first regression model-based Randomized Ablation (RA),\nwhich is more sufficient than Adversarial Training (ADT) (Mean Absolute Error\nof RA is 5 lower than ADT on clean samples and 30 lower than ADT on adversarial\nexamples). Extensive experiments on five crowd counting models demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generality of the proposed method.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)\nhas achieved marked successes in managing sequential decision making problems,\nwhich motivates us to apply RL in the ASTC problem. Here we use independent\nreinforcement learning (IRL) to solve a complex traffic cooperative control\nproblem in this study. One of the largest challenges of this problem is that\nthe observation information of intersection is typically partially observable,\nwhich limits the learning performance of IRL algorithms. To this, we model the\ntraffic control problem as a partially observable weak cooperative traffic\nmodel (PO-WCTM) to optimize the overall traffic situation of a group of\nintersections. Different from a traditional IRL task that averages the returns\nof all agents in fully cooperative games, the learning goal of each\nintersection in PO-WCTM is to reduce the cooperative difficulty of learning,\nwhich is also consistent with the traffic environment hypothesis. We also\npropose an IRL algorithm called Cooperative Important Lenient Double DQN\n(CIL-DDQN), which extends Double DQN (DDQN) algorithm using two mechanisms: the\nforgetful experience mechanism and the lenient weight training mechanism. The\nformer mechanism decreases the importance of experiences stored in the\nexperience reply buffer, which deals with the problem of experience failure\ncaused by the strategy change of other agents. The latter mechanism increases\nthe weight experiences with high estimation and `leniently' trains the DDQN\nneural network, which improves the probability of the selection of cooperative\njoint strategies. Experimental results show that CIL-DDQN outperforms other\nmethods in almost all performance indicators of the traffic control problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

They are playing a critical role in native ads\nservice, which facilitates the recommendation of appropriate ads based on\nuser's web browsing history. For the sake of efficient recommendation,\nconventional methods would generate user and advertisement embeddings\nindependently with a siamese transformer encoder, such that approximate nearest\nneighbour search (ANN) can be leveraged. Given that the underlying semantic\nabout user and ad can be complicated, such independently generated embeddings\nare prone to information loss, which leads to inferior recommendation quality.\nAlthough another encoding strategy, the cross encoder, can be much more\naccurate, it will lead to huge running cost and become infeasible for realtime\nservices, like native ads recommendation. In this work, we propose hybrid\nencoder, which makes efficient and precise native ads recommendation through\ntwo consecutive steps: retrieval and ranking. In the retrieval step, user and\nad are encoded with a siamese component, which enables relevant candidates to\nbe retrieved via ANN search. In the ranking step, it further represents each ad\nwith disentangled embeddings and each user with ad-related embeddings, which\ncontributes to the fine-grained selection of high-quality ads from the\ncandidate set. Both steps are light-weighted, thanks to the pre-computed and\ncached intermedia results. To optimize the hybrid encoder's performance in this\ntwo-stage workflow, a progressive training pipeline is developed, which builds\nup the model's capability in the retrieval and ranking task step-by-step. The\nhybrid encoder's effectiveness is experimentally verified: with very little\nadditional cost, it outperforms the siamese encoder significantly and achieves\ncomparable recommendation quality as the cross encoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

For years transformer models base\nexclusively on classification token to construct the final classifier, without\nexplicitly harnessing high-level word tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntransformer model called second-order transformer (SoT), exploiting\nsimultaneously the classification token and word tokens for the classifier.\nSpecifically, we empirically disclose that high-level word tokens contain rich\ninformation, which per se are very competent with the classifier and moreover,\nare complementary to the classification token. To effectively harness such rich\ninformation, we propose multi-headed global cross-covariance pooling with\nsingular value power normalization, which shares similar philosophy and thus is\ncompatible with the transformer block, better than commonly used pooling\nmethods. Then, we study comprehensively how to explicitly combine word tokens\nwith classification token for building the final classification head. For CV\ntasks, our SoT significantly improves state-of-the-art vision transformers on\nchallenging benchmarks including ImageNet and ImageNet-A. For NLP tasks,\nthrough fine-tuning based on pretrained language transformers including GPT and\nBERT, our SoT greatly boosts the performance on widely used tasks such as CoLA\nand RTE.

Recent observations by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board\nSolar Orbiter have characterized prevalent small-scale transient brightenings\nin the corona above the quiet Sun termed campfires. Aims. In this study we\nsearch for comparable brightenings in a numerical model and then investigate\ntheir relation to the magnetic field and the processes that drive these events.\nMethods. We use the MURaM code to solve the 3D radiation MHD equations in a box\nthat stretches from the upper convection zone to the corona. The model\nself-consistently produces a supergranular network of the magnetic field and a\nhot corona above this quiet Sun. For the comparison with the model we\nsynthesize the coronal emission as seen by EUI in its 174 {\\AA} channel,\nisolate the seven strongest transient brightenings, and investigate (the\nchanges of) the magnetic field in and around these in detail. Results. The\ntransients we isolate have a lifetime of about 2 minutes and are elongated\nloop-like features with lengths around 1Mm to 4 Mm. They tend to occur at\nheights of about 2Mm to 5Mm above the photosphere a bit offset from magnetic\nconcentrations that mark the bright chromospheric network and they reach\ntemperatures of above 1 MK. With this they very much resemble the (larger)\ncampfires found in observations. In our model most events are energised by\ncomponent reconnection between (bundles of) field lines that interact at\ncoronal heights. In one case we find that untwisting of a highly twisted flux\nrope initiates the heating. Conclusions. Based on our study we propose that the\nmajority of campfire events found by EUI are driven by component reconnection\nand our model suggests that this process contributes significantly to the\nheating of the corona above the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 02:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Just as GPUs\nplayed a pivotal role in the success of modern deep learning, they are also\nessential for realizing scalable privacy-preserving deep learning. In this\nwork, we start by introducing a new interface to losslessly embed cryptographic\noperations over secret-shared values (in a discrete domain) into floating-point\noperations that can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels for linear\nalgebra. We then identify a sequence of \"GPU-friendly\" cryptographic protocols\nto enable privacy-preserving evaluation of both linear and non-linear\noperations on the GPU. Our microbenchmarks indicate that our private GPU-based\nconvolution protocol is over 150x faster than the analogous CPU-based protocol;\nfor non-linear operations like the ReLU activation function, our GPU-based\nprotocol is around 10x faster than its CPU analog.\n  With CryptGPU, we support private inference and private training on\nconvolutional neural networks with over 60 million parameters as well as handle\nlarge datasets like ImageNet.

Our work not only showcases the viability of performing secure\nmultiparty computation (MPC) entirely on the GPU to enable fast\nprivacy-preserving machine learning, but also highlights the importance of\ndesigning new MPC primitives that can take full advantage of the GPU's\ncomputing capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

The\nsurface functionalization with organic groups did not damage the mesoporous\nnetwork and their structural and textural properties were also preserved\ndespite the high solubility of MBG matrices. The incorporation of Lys confers a\nzwitterionic nature to these MBG materials due to the presence of adjacent\namine and carboxylic groups in the external surface. At physiologic pH, this\ncoexistence of basic amine and carboxilic acid groups from anchored Lys\nprovided zero surface charge named zwitterionic effect. This behaviour could\ngive rise to potential applications of antibacterial adhesion. Therefore, in\norder to assess the influence of zwitterionic nature in in vitro bacterial\nadhesion, studies were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus.

We\nspecifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of\nCOVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii)\nprevalent infection rate.\n  Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals\ntwo, nearly equally sized traveller segments: 'COVID Conscious' and 'Infection\nIndifferent'. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding,\naccepting, on average 8.75 minutes extra waiting time to reduce one person\non-board. Moreover, they demonstrate a strong desire to sit without anybody in\ntheir neighbouring seat and are quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent\ninfection rate. By contrast, Infection Indifferent travellers' value of\ncrowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) is only slightly higher than\npre-pandemic estimates and they are relatively unaffected by infection rates.\nWe find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious\nwhile those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic\ntend to be Infection Indifferent.

It can\nassist doctors in making clinical decisions more efficiently. However, the\ninherent complexity of the EHR data renders it as a challenging task: (1)\nMultilevel structures: the EHR data typically contains multilevel structures\nwhich are closely related with the decision-making pathways, e.g., laboratory\nresults lead to disease diagnoses, and then contribute to the prescribed\nmedications; (2) Multiple sequences interactions: multiple sequences in EHR\ndata are usually closely correlated with each other; (3) Abundant noise: lots\nof task-unrelated features or noise information within EHR data generally\nresult in suboptimal performance.

However, the\nserial concatenation of a linear spatial filter and a postfilter is not\ngenerally optimal in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense for noise\ndistributions other than a Gaussian distribution. Rather, the MMSE optimal\nfilter is a joint spatial and spectral nonlinear function. While estimating the\nparameters of such a filter with traditional methods is challenging, modern\nneural networks may provide an efficient way to learn the nonlinear function\ndirectly from data. To see if further research in this direction is worthwhile,\nin this work we examine the potential performance benefit of replacing the\ncommon two-step procedure with a joint spatial and spectral nonlinear filter.\n  We analyze three different forms of non-Gaussianity: First, we evaluate on\nsuper-Gaussian noise with a high kurtosis.

Since energy efficiency is of utmost concern in such\napplications, in this work we evaluate the power and energy consumption,\ndistance measurements, and localization performance of two types of UWB\nphysical interfaces (PHYs), which use either a low- or high-rate pulse\nrepetition (LRP and HRP, respectively). The evaluation is done through\nmeasurements acquired in identical conditions, which is crucial in order to\nhave a fair comparison between the devices. The LRP devices that we tested have\nthe same ranging and localization performance, but ten times (10x) lower power\nconsumption, 6x lower energy consumption per distance measurement, and at least\n8x higher coverage than the HRP devices.

The proposed algorithm\nis built upon the RRT algorithm with a multi-tree structure. At the beginning,\nthe RRT algorithm is applied to find the initial solution based on partial\nknowledge of the environment. Then, the robot starts to execute this path. At\neach iteration, the new obstacle configurations are collected by the robot's\nsensor and used to replan the path. This new information can come from unknown\nstatic obstacles (e.g., seafloor layout) as well as moving obstacles. Then, to\naccommodate the environmental changes, two procedures are adopted: 1) edge\npruning, and 2) tree regrowing. Specifically, the edge pruning procedure checks\nthe collision status through the tree and only removes the invalid edges while\nmaintaining the tree structure of already-explored regions. Due to removal of\ninvalid edges, the tree could be broken into multiple disjoint trees. As such,\nthe RRT algorithm is applied to regrow the trees. Specifically, a sample is\ncreated randomly and joined to all the disjoint trees in its local neighborhood\nby connecting to the nearest nodes. Finally, a new solution is found for the\nrobot. The advantages of the proposed MRRT algorithm are as follows: i) retains\nthe maximal tree structure by only pruning the edges which collide with the\nobstacles, ii) guarantees probabilistic completeness, and iii) is computational\nefficient for fast replanning since all disjoint trees are maintained for\nfuture connections and expanded simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

Therefore, there is a need to develop general solvers as\nit is not always possible to tailor a specialised approach to each application.\nThe hybrid form of Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm (MLSGA) already\nshows good performance on range of problems due to its diversity-first\napproach, which is rare among Evolutionary Algorithms. To increase the\ngenerality of its performance this paper proposes a distinct set of\nco-evolutionary mechanisms, which defines co-evolution as competition between\ncollectives rather than individuals. This distinctive approach to\nco-evolutionary provides less regular communication between sub-populations and\ndifferent fitness definitions between individuals and collectives. This\nencourages the collectives to act more independently creating a unique\nsub-regional search, leading to the development of co-evolutionary MLSGA\n(cMLSGA). To test this methodology nine genetic algorithms are selected to\ngenerate several variants of cMLSGA, which incorporates these approaches at the\nindividual level. The new mechanisms are tested on over 100 different functions\nand benchmarked against the 9 state-of-the-art competitors in order to find the\nbest general solver. The results show that the diversity of co-evolutionary\napproaches is more important than their individual performances. This allows\nthe selection of two competing algorithms that improve the generality of\ncMLSGA, without large loss of performance on any specific problem type. When\ncompared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed methodology is the most\nuniversal and robust, leading to an algorithm more likely to solve complex\nproblems with limited knowledge about the search space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

An X-ray spectral flattening has been\nreported in FSRQs (at relatively high redshifts), attributable to either\nabsorption from gas along the line of sight or intrinsic jet based radiative\nprocesses. We study a sample of 16 high redshift FSRQs (z of 1.1 -- 4.7; rest\nframe energy upto 50 keV) observed with XMM-Newton and Swift satellites\nspanning 29 epochs. The X-ray spectra are fit with a power law including free\nexcess absorption and one multiplied by an exponential roll off to account for\nthe intrinsic jet based processes. A statistical analysis is used to\ndistinguish between these models to understand the origin of the spectral\nflattening. The model selection is unable to distinguish between them in ten of\nthe sixteen FSRQs. Intrinsic jet based radiative processes are indicated in\nfour FSRQs where we infer energy breaks consistent with their expectation from\nthe external Compton scattering of low energy ambient photons. Two of the FSRQs\nindicate mixed results, supportive of either scenario, illustrating the\ndifficulty in identifying X-ray absorption signatures.

To this extent,\nsemantic segmentation methods that can perform automated real-time delineation\nof a region-of-interest, e.g., boundary identification of cancer or\nprecancerous lesions, can benefit both diagnosis and interventions. However,\naccurate and real-time segmentation of endoscopic images is extremely\nchallenging due to its high operator dependence and high-definition image\nquality. To utilize automated methods in clinical settings, it is crucial to\ndesign lightweight models with low latency such that they can be integrated\nwith low-end endoscope hardware devices.

More concisely, we combine a so-called\nconvolutional neural network for image recognition with graphs that in a\npairwise manner plot the normalized bid values of some reference firm against\nthe normalized bids of any other firms participating in the same tenders as the\nreference firm. Based on Japanese and Swiss procurement data, we construct such\ngraphs for both collusive and competitive episodes (i.e when a bid-rigging\ncartel is or is not active) and use a subset of graphs to train the neural\nnetwork such that it learns distinguishing collusive from competitive bidding\npatterns. We use the remaining graphs to test the neural network's\nout-of-sample performance in correctly classifying collusive and competitive\nbidding interactions. We obtain a very decent average accuracy of around 90% or\nslightly higher when either applying the method within Japanese, Swiss, or\nmixed data (in which Swiss and Japanese graphs are pooled). When using data\nfrom one country for training to test the trained model's performance in the\nother country (i.e. transnationally), predictive performance decreases (likely\ndue to institutional differences in procurement procedures across countries),\nbut often remains satisfactorily high.

One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) are one\nof the state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection (or anomaly detection)\nin machine learning, due to their flexibility in fitting complex nonlinear\nboundaries between {normal} and {novel} data.

Networks relying on such\nshortcuts bear the risk of not generalizing well to unseen inputs.\nExplainability methods help to uncover such network vulnerabilities. However,\nmany of these techniques are not directly applicable if access to the network\nis constrained, in so-called black-box setups.

To address this constraint, we present an\napproach to detect learned shortcuts using an interpretable-by-design network\nas a proxy to the black-box model of interest.

Low-cost air quality monitoring sensors are prone to\nerroneous measurements, frequent downtimes, and uncertain operational\nconditions. Such a situation demands a prudent approach to ensure an effective\nand flexible calibration scheme. We propose MAQ-CaF, a modular air quality\ncalibration, and forecasting methodology, that side-steps the challenges of\nunreliability through its modular machine learning-based design which leverages\nthe potential of IoT framework. It stores the calibrated data both locally and\nremotely with an added feature of future predictions.
