Nevertheless, current models predict cosmic-ray spectra\nthat do not match observations and the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism\nis still undetermined. On the other hand, the contribution of other kinds of\nsources to the Galactic cosmic-ray population is still unclear, and merits\ninvestigation. In this work we explore a novel mechanism through which\nmicroquasars might produce cosmic rays. In this scenario, microquasar jets\ngenerate relativistic neutrons, which escape and decay outside the system;\nprotons and electrons, created when these neutrons decay, escape to the\ninterstellar medium as cosmic rays. The most promising scenarios arise in\nextremely luminous systems ($L_\\mathrm{jet} \\sim 10^{40}\\,\\mathrm{erg \\,\ns}^{-1}$), in which the fraction of jet power deposited in cosmic rays can\nreach $\\sim 0.001$. Slow jets ($\\Gamma \\lesssim 2$, where $\\Gamma$ is the bulk\nLorentz factor) favour neutron production. The resulting cosmic-ray spectrum is\nsimilar for protons and electrons, which share the power in the ratio given by\nneutron decay. The spectrum peaks at roughly half the minimum energy of the\nrelativistic protons in the jet; it is soft (spectral index $\\sim 3$) above\nthis energy, and almost flat below. Values of spectral index steeper than $2$\nare possible for cosmic rays in our model and these indeed agree with those\nrequired to explain the spectral signatures of Galactic cosmic rays, although\nonly the most extreme microquasars provide power comparable to that of a\ntypical supernova remnant. The mechanism explored in this work may provide\nstronger and softer cosmic-ray sources in the early Universe, and therefore\ncontribute to the heating and reionisation of the intergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 16:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

In this study, the aerodynamics of a\nrealistic model of a female runner is calculated by computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD) simulations at four running speeds of 15 km/h, 18 km/h, 21 km/h,\nand 36 km/h. Aerodynamic power fractions of the total energy expenditure are\nfound to be in the range of 2.6-8.5%. Additionally, four exemplary formations\nare analysed with respect to their drafting potential and resulting drag values\nare compared for the main runner and her pacers. The best of the formations\nachieves a total drag reduction on the main runner of 75.6%. Moreover, there\nare large variations in the drag reduction between the considered formations of\nup to 42% with respect to the baseline single-runner case. We conclude that\nmajor drag reduction of more than 70% can already be achieved with fairly\nsimple formations, while certain factors, such as runners on the sides, can\nhave a detrimental effect on drag reduction due to local acceleration of the\npassing flow. Using an empirical model for mechanical power output during\nrunning, gains of metabolic power and performance predictions are evaluated for\nall considered formations. Improvements in running economy are up to 3.5% for\nthe best formation, leading to velocity gains of 2.3%. This translates to 154 s\n(~2.6 min) saved over a marathon distance. Consequently, direct conclusions are\ndrawn from the obtained data for ideal drafting of long-distance running in\nhighly packed formations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 16:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

To begin systematically structuring the rapidly\naccumulating information, in the hopes of clarifying and reconciling the\ndiscrepancies, we consider the contradictory information along three proposed\n'axes': (1) a context-of-disease axis, (2) a degree-of-[therapeutic]-benefit\naxis, and (3) a mechanism-of-action axis.

The proposed metrics originate\nfrom the maximum mean discrepancy, which we generalize by proposing specific\ncriteria for selecting test function spaces to guarantee the property of being\nfree of CoD. Therefore, we call this class of metrics the generalized maximum\nmean discrepancy (GMMD). Examples of the selected test function spaces include\nthe reproducing kernel Hilbert space, Barron space, and flow-induced function\nspaces. Three applications of the proposed metrics are presented: 1. The\nconvergence of empirical measure in the case of random variables; 2. The\nconvergence of $n$-particle system to the solution to McKean-Vlasov stochastic\ndifferential equation; 3. The construction of an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium\nfor a homogeneous $n$-player game by its mean-field limit. As a byproduct, we\nprove that, given a distribution close to the target distribution measured by\nGMMD and a certain representation of the target distribution, we can generate a\ndistribution close to the target one in terms of the Wasserstein distance and\nrelative entropy. Overall, we show that the proposed class of metrics is a\npowerful tool to analyze the convergence of empirical measures in high\ndimensions without CoD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 23:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 16:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 04:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

It mainly relies on human efforts to design\nfuzz targets case by case which is labor-intensive. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes a novel automated fuzz target generation approach for\nfuzzing Rust libraries via API dependency graph traversal. We identify several\nessential requirements for library fuzzing, including validity and\neffectiveness of fuzz targets, high API coverage, and efficiency.

However,\npractical physical computers, such as modern digital computers or biochemical\nsystems, are subject to constraints that make them inefficient -- irreversibly\ndissipating significant energy. Recent results show that the dissipation in\nsuch systems is bounded by the nonreciprocity of the embedded computation. We\ninvestigate the consequences of this bound for different types of memory,\nshowing that different memory devices are better suited for different\ncomputations. This correspondence comes from the time-reversal symmetries of\nthe memory, which depend on whether information is stored positionally or\nmagnetically. This establishes that the time symmetries of the memory device\nplay an essential roll in determining energetics. The energetic consequences of\ntime symmetries are particularly pronounced in nearly deterministic\ncomputations, where the cost of computing diverges as minus log of the error\nrate. We identify the coefficient of that divergence as the dissipation\ndivergence. We find that the dissipation divergence may be zero for a\ncomputation when implemented in one type of memory while it's maximal when\nimplemented with another. Given flexibility in the type of memory, the\ndissipation divergence is bounded below by the average state compression of the\ncomputation. Moreover, we show how to explicitly construct the memory to\nachieve this minimal dissipation. As a result, we find that logically\nreversible computations are indeed thermodynamically efficient, but logical\nirreversibility comes at a much higher cost than previously anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 06:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

The critical regime where both the\nvelocity ensemble and the nonlinearity of the Hwa-Kardar equation are relevant\nsimultaneously is also characterized by \"atypical\" scaling.

Based on this observation, this paper proposes an adaptive\nspatial pattern capsule network (ASPCNet) architecture by developing an\nadaptive spatial pattern (ASP) unit, that can rotate the sampling location of\nconvolutional kernels on the basis of an enlarged receptive field. Note that\nthis unit can learn more discriminative representations of HSIs with fewer\nparameters. Specifically, two cascaded ASP-based convolution operations\n(ASPConvs) are applied to input images to learn relatively high-level semantic\nfeatures, transmitting hierarchical structures among capsules more accurately\nthan the use of the most fundamental features. Furthermore, the semantic\nfeatures are fed into ASP-based conv-capsule operations (ASPCaps) to explore\nthe shapes of objects among the capsules in an adaptive manner, further\nexploring the potential of capsule networks.

As a result, they are limited in handling\nirregular holes and tend to produce color-discrepant and blurry inpainting\nresult. Partial convolution (PConv) copes with this issue by conducting masked\nconvolution and feature re-normalization conditioned only on valid pixels, but\nthe mask-updating is handcrafted and independent with image structural\ninformation. In this paper, we present an edge-guided learnable bidirectional\nattention map (Edge-LBAM) for improving image inpainting of irregular holes\nwith several distinct merits. Instead of using a hard 0-1 mask, a learnable\nattention map module is introduced for learning feature re-normalization and\nmask-updating in an end-to-end manner. Learnable reverse attention maps are\nfurther proposed in the decoder for emphasizing on filling in unknown pixels\ninstead of reconstructing all pixels. Motivated by that the filling-in order is\ncrucial to inpainting results and largely depends on image structures in\nexemplar-based methods, we further suggest a multi-scale edge completion\nnetwork to predict coherent edges. Our Edge-LBAM method contains dual\nprocedures,including structure-aware mask-updating guided by predict edges and\nattention maps generated by masks for feature re-normalization.Extensive\nexperiments show that our Edge-LBAM is effective in generating coherent image\nstructures and preventing color discrepancy and blurriness, and performs\nfavorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative metrics\nand visual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 07:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

In the first stage, we aim to generate a set of\nsemantically coherent clusters where the utterances within each cluster convey\nthe same intent. We obtain the utterance representation from various\npre-trained sentence embeddings and present a metric of balanced score to\ndetermine the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering for balanced\ndatasets. In the second stage, the objective is to generate an intent label\nautomatically for each cluster. We extract the ACTION-OBJECT pair from each\nutterance using a dependency parser and take the most frequent pair within each\ncluster, e.g., book-restaurant, as the generated intent label. We empirically\nshow that the proposed unsupervised approach can generate meaningful intent\nlabels automatically and achieve high precision and recall in utterance\nclustering and intent discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 09:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 01:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Using these quantum field\ntheories limits as theoretical laboratories we arrive at an interesting\ncomparison between the Conventional Scale Setting - (CSS) and the Principle of\nMaximum Conformality (PMC$_\\infty$) methods. We show that within the\nperturbative regime of the conformal window and also out of the conformal\nwindow the PMC$_\\infty$ leads to a higher precision, and that reducing the\nnumber of flavors, from the upper boundary to the lower boundary, through the\nphase transition the curves given by the PMC$_\\infty$ method preserve with\ncontinuity the position of the peak, showing perfect agreement with the\nexperimental data already at NNLO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 11:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 09:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The key\ndifficulty is a suitable representation, rich enough to capture the object\nshape, dynamics for manipulation and yet simple enough to be estimated reliably\nfrom visual observations. This work aims to learn latent Graph dynamics for\nDefOrmable Object Manipulation (G-DOOM). G-DOOM approximates a deformable\nobject as a sparse set of interacting keypoints, which are extracted\nautomatically from images via unsupervised learning. It learns a graph neural\nnetwork that captures abstractly the geometry and the interaction dynamics of\nthe keypoints. To handle object self-occlusion, G-DOOM uses a recurrent neural\nnetwork to track the keypoints over time and condition their interactions on\nthe history. We then train the resulting recurrent graph dynamics model through\ncontrastive learning in a high-fidelity simulator.

Therefore,\ninteractive segmentation is a practical alternative to these methods.

To solve these\nproblems, we propose a novel deep learning-based interactive segmentation\nmethod that not only has high efficiency due to only requiring clicks as user\ninputs but also generalizes well to a range of previously unseen objects.\nSpecifically, we first encode user-provided interior margin points via our\nproposed exponentialized geodesic distance that enables a CNN to achieve a good\ninitial segmentation result of both previously seen and unseen objects, then we\nuse a novel information fusion method that combines the initial segmentation\nwith only few additional user clicks to efficiently obtain a refined\nsegmentation.

These gestures were\ninspired by previous studies of gesture-based locomotion interfaces and are\ntypical gestures that people are familiar with in their daily lives.\nImplementing these hand gesture interfaces in the present study enabled us to\nsystematically compare the differences between these gestures. In addition, to\ncompare the usability of these gestures to locomotion interfaces using\ngamepads, we also designed and implemented a gamepad interface based on the\nXbox One controller. We conducted empirical studies to compare these four\ninterfaces through two virtual locomotion tasks. A desktop setup was used\ninstead of sharing a head-mounted display among participants due to the concern\nof the Covid-19 situation. Through these tasks, we assessed the performance and\nuser preference of these interfaces on speed control and waypoints navigation.\nResults showed that user preference and performance of the Finger Distance\ngesture were close to that of the gamepad interface. The Finger Number gesture\nalso had close performance and user preference to that of the Finger Distance\ngesture. Our study demonstrates that the Finger Distance gesture and the Finger\nNumber gesture are very promising interfaces for virtual locomotion. We also\ndiscuss that the Finger Tapping gesture needs further improvements before it\ncan be used for virtual walking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 15:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 09:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 03:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

In this first of the two parts paper, we present the\napplication of WFL in the sixth generation of wireless networks (6G), which is\nenvisioned to be an integrated communication and computing platform. After\nanalyzing the key concepts of WFL, we discuss the core challenges of WFL\nimposed by the wireless (or mobile communication) environment. Finally, we shed\nlight to the future directions of WFL, aiming to compose a constructive\nintegration of FL into the future wireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 18:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

The pervasive\nadoption of cloud computing in smart cities services and applications requires\ntimely execution of tasks adhering to Quality of Services (QoS).\n  However, the increasing use of computing servers exacerbates the issues of\nhigh energy consumption, operating costs, and environmental pollution.\nMaximizing the performance and minimizing the energy in a cloud data center is\nchallenging. In this paper, we propose a performance and energy optimization\nbi-objective algorithm to tradeoff the contradicting performance and energy\nobjectives. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is for\nthe first time proposed using system performance counters. The performance of\nthe proposed model is evaluated using a realistic cloud dataset in a cloud\ncomputing environment. Our experimental results achieve higher performance and\nlower energy consumption compared to a state of the art algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 08:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Drivers\nmay also get matched with more riders without making additional stops. There\nare economic benefits of using ride-pooling with meeting points (RPMP) compared\nto the traditional RP services. Many RPMP models have been proposed to better\nunderstand their benefits. However, most prior works study RPMP either with a\nrestricted set of parameters or at a small scale due to the expensive\ncomputation involved. In this paper, we propose STaRS+, a scalable RPMP\nframework that is based on a comprehensive integer linear programming model.\nThe high scalability of STaRS+ is achieved by utilizing a heuristic\noptimization strategy along with a novel shortest-path caching scheme. We\napplied our model to the NYC metro area to evaluate the scalability of the\nframework and demonstrate the importance of city-scale simulations. Our results\nshow that city-scale simulations can reveal valuable insights for city planners\nthat are not always visible at smaller scales. To the best of our knowledge,\nSTaRS+ is the first study on the RPMP that can solve large-scale instances on\nthe order of the entire NYC metro area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 04:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

In context of Australia, Wollongong City\nCouncil (WCC) blockage conduit policy is the only formal guideline to consider\nblockage in design process. However, many argue that this policy is based on\nthe post floods visual inspections and hence can not be considered accurate\nrepresentation of hydraulic blockage. As a result of this on-going debate,\nvisual blockage and hydraulic blockage are considered two distinct terms with\nno established quantifiable relation among both. This paper attempts to relate\nboth terms by proposing the use of deep visual features for prediction of\nhydraulic blockage at a given culvert. An end-to-end machine learning pipeline\nis propounded which takes an image of culvert as input, extract visual features\nusing deep learning models, pre-process the visual features and feed into\nregression model to predict the corresponding hydraulic blockage. Dataset\n(i.e., Hydrology-Lab Dataset (HD), Visual Hydrology-Lab Dataset (VHD)) used in\nthis research was collected from in-lab experiments carried out using scaled\nphysical models of culverts where multiple blockage scenarios were replicated\nat scale. Performance of regression models was assessed using standard\nevaluation metrics. Furthermore, performance of overall machine learning\npipeline was assessed in terms of processing times for relative comparison of\nmodels and hardware requirement analysis. From the results ANN used with\nMobileNet extracted visual features achieved the best regression performance\nwith $R^{2}$ score of 0.7855. Positive value of $R^{2}$ score indicated the\npresence of correlation between visual features and hydraulic blockage and\nsuggested that both can be interrelated with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 14:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

The challenges with NLP systems\nwith regards to tasks such as Machine Translation (MT), word sense\ndisambiguation (WSD) and information retrieval make it imperative to have a\nlabelled idioms dataset with classes such as it is in this work. To the best of\nthe authors' knowledge, this is the first idioms corpus with classes of idioms\nbeyond the literal and the general idioms classification. In particular, the\nfollowing classes are labelled in the dataset: metaphor, simile, euphemism,\nparallelism, personification, oxymoron, paradox, hyperbole, irony and literal.\nWe obtain an overall inter-annotator agreement (IAA) score, between two\nindependent annotators, of 88.89%. Many past efforts have been limited in the\ncorpus size and classes of samples but this dataset contains over 20,100\nsamples with almost 1,200 cases of idioms (with their meanings) from 10 classes\n(or senses). The corpus may also be extended by researchers to meet specific\nneeds. The corpus has part of speech (PoS) tagging from the NLTK library.\nClassification experiments performed on the corpus to obtain a baseline and\ncomparison among three common models, including the BERT model, give good\nresults.
