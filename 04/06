DLRMs are large in size due to their use\nof large embedding tables, and are trained by distributing the model across the\nmemory of tens or hundreds of servers. Server failures are common in such large\ndistributed systems and must be mitigated to enable training to progress.\nCheckpointing is the primary approach used for fault tolerance in these\nsystems, but incurs significant training-time overhead both during normal\noperation and when recovering from failures. As these overheads increase with\nDLRM size, checkpointing is slated to become an even larger overhead for future\nDLRMs, which are expected to grow in size. This calls for rethinking fault\ntolerance in DLRM training.\n  We present ECRM, a DLRM training system that achieves efficient fault\ntolerance using erasure coding. ECRM chooses which DLRM parameters to encode,\ncorrectly and efficiently updates parities, and enables training to proceed\nwithout any pauses, while maintaining consistency of the recovered parameters.\nWe implement ECRM atop XDL, an open-source, industrial-scale DLRM training\nsystem. Compared to checkpointing, ECRM reduces training-time overhead for\nlarge DLRMs by up to 88%, recovers from failures up to 10.3$\\times$ faster, and\nallows training to proceed during recovery. These results show the promise of\nerasure coding in imparting efficient fault tolerance to training current and\nfuture DLRMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 16:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

While\ngeneralist models must broadly address many speakers, specialist models can\nadapt their enhancement function towards a particular speaker's voice,\nexpecting to solve a narrower problem. Hence, specialists are capable of\nachieving more optimal performance in addition to reducing computational\ncomplexity. However, naive personalization methods can require clean speech\nfrom the target user, which is inconvenient to acquire, e.g., due to subpar\nrecording conditions. To this end, we pose personalization as either a\nzero-shot task, in which no additional clean speech of the target speaker is\nused for training, or a few-shot learning task, in which the goal is to\nminimize the duration of the clean speech used for transfer learning. With this\npaper, we propose self-supervised learning methods as a solution to both zero-\nand few-shot personalization tasks. The proposed methods are designed to learn\nthe personalized speech features from unlabeled data (i.e., in-the-wild noisy\nrecordings from the target user) without knowing the corresponding clean\nsources.

If there is an abundance of unlabeled noisy speech\nfrom the test-time user, a personalized speech enhancement model can be trained\nusing self-supervised learning. One straightforward approach to model\npersonalization is to use the target speaker's noisy recordings as\npseudo-sources. Then, a pseudo denoising model learns to remove injected\ntraining noises and recover the pseudo-sources. However, this approach is\nvolatile as it depends on the quality of the pseudo-sources, which may be too\nnoisy. As a remedy, we propose an improvement to the self-supervised approach\nthrough data purification. We first train an SNR predictor model to estimate\nthe frame-by-frame SNR of the pseudo-sources. Then, the predictor's estimates\nare converted into weights which adjust the frame-by-frame contribution of the\npseudo-sources towards training the personalized model.

The increase in and effectiveness of\nusing contraception are still considered to be the effective method to reduce\nabortion rate. Data pertaining to abortion incidence and effective efforts to\nreduce abortion rate in Indonesia is limited and difficult to access. Meanwhile\nsuch supporting information is necessary to enable the planning and evaluation\nof abortion control programs. This paper exemplifies the use of a mathematical\nmodel to explain an abortion decline scenario. The model employs determinants\nproposed by Bongaarts, which include average reproductive period, contraceptive\nprevalence and effectiveness, total fertility rate (TFR), and intended total\nfertility rate (ITFR), as well as birth and abortion intervals. The data used\nis from the 1991-2007 Indonesian Demography and Health Survey (Survei Demografi\ndan Kesehatan Indonesia/SDKI), and the unit of analysis is women who had been\nmarried and aged 15-49 years old. Based on the current contraceptive prevalence\nlevel in Indonesia at 59-61%, the estimated total abortion rate is 1.9-2.2.\nBased on the plot of this total abortion rate, an abortion decline scenario can\nbe estimated. At the current TFR level of 2.6, the required contraceptive\nprevalence is 69% (9% increase) for a decrease of one abortion case per woman.\nWith a delay of one year in the age of the first marriage and a birth interval\nof three years, it is estimated that the abortion rate will decline from 3.05\nto 0.69 case per woman throughout her reproductive period.

Building an emulator, i.e. a statistical surrogate\nmodel of the simulator constructed using a design of experiments made of a\ncomparatively small number of evaluations of the forward solver, greatly\nalleviates the computational burden to carry out such investigations.\nNevertheless, this can still be above the computational budget for many\nstudies. Two major approaches have been used to reduce the budget needed to\nbuild the emulator: efficient design of experiments, such as sequential\ndesigns, and combining training data of different degrees of sophistication in\na so-called multi-fidelity method, or multilevel in case these fidelities are\nordered typically for increasing resolutions. We present here a novel method\nthat combines both approaches, the multilevel adaptive sequential design of\ncomputer experiments (MLASCE) in the framework of Gaussian process (GP)\nemulators. We make use of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces as a tool for our\nGP approximations of the differences between two consecutive levels. This dual\nstrategy allows us to allocate efficiently limited computational resources over\nsimulations of different levels of fidelity and build the GP emulator. The\nallocation of computational resources is shown to be the solution of a simple\noptimization problem in a special case where we theoretically prove the\nvalidity of our approach. Our proposed method is compared with other existing\nmodels of multi-fidelity Gaussian process emulation. Gains in orders of\nmagnitudes in accuracy or computing budgets are demonstrated in some of\nnumerical examples for some settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 17:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 14:56:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 13:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

For a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities ($e$), I find\nthat the disc surface density near the outer edge can be parametrised as\n$\\tanh[(r_{\\max}-r)/l_{\\rm out}]$, where $r_{\\max}$ approximates the maximum\nsemi-major axis and $l_{\\rm out}$ defines the edge smoothness.

To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the\nTeacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the\nfeatures are from Teacher's own object detector.

I introduce a method, which\naccurately and efficiently treats magnetic ordering in the course of standard\nfirst-principles calculations. The method is suitable for all temperatures and\nis based on Monte Carlo (MC) technique. At high temperatures MC is coupled to\nab initio molecular dynamics, therefore treating atomic vibrations and magnetic\nordering simultaneously. The method takes care of the convergence to the true\nground-state magnetic structure at 0 K, coupling between spins and atomic\nvibrations at high temperatures, and spin-spin interactions in non-Heisenberg\nsystems, i.e. it naturally goes beyond the usual pair-like effective exchange\ninteractions at all temperatures. I show that the method nicely reproduces the\nmagnetic structures at low and high temperatures even on relatively small\nsupercells and provides a ground for truly ab initio calculations of magnetic\nsystems in high-throughput studies. In its general formulation the MDMC method\ndeals with non-collinear magnetism, but its collinear version may be more\nsuitable for fast high-throughput calculations. The examples of the application\nof the MDMC method addressed in this paper are $\\alpha$-Mn; body-centered cubic\nFe, which is ferromagnetic at low and paramagnetic at high temperatures; and\nMnB$_2$W$_2$, a new magnetic compound with non-trivial magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 18:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

However, in the past, there has been a lack of\nscalable methods to collect commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose to\ndevelop principles for collecting commonsense knowledge based on selectional\npreference. We generalize the definition of selectional preference from one-hop\nlinguistic syntactic relations to higher-order relations over linguistic\ngraphs. Unlike previous commonsense knowledge definition (e.g., ConceptNet),\nselectional preference (SP) knowledge only relies on statistical distribution\nover linguistic graphs, which can be efficiently and accurately acquired from\nthe unlabeled corpus with modern tools. Following this principle, we develop a\nlarge-scale eventuality (a linguistic term covering activity, state, and\nevent)-based knowledge graph ASER, where each eventuality is represented as a\ndependency graph, and the relation between them is a discourse relation defined\nin shallow discourse parsing. The higher-order selectional preference over\ncollected linguistic graphs reflects various kinds of commonsense knowledge.\nMoreover, motivated by the observation that humans understand events by\nabstracting the observed events to a higher level and can thus transfer their\nknowledge to new events, we propose a conceptualization module to significantly\nboost the coverage of ASER. In total, ASER contains 648 million edges between\n438 million eventualities. After conceptualization with Probase, a selectional\npreference based concept-instance relational knowledge base, our concept graph\ncontains 15 million conceptualized eventualities and 224 million edges between\nthem.

A key component of CDMs is a binary $Q$-matrix\ncharacterizing the dependence structure between the items and the latent\nattributes. Additionally, researchers also assume in many applications certain\nhierarchical structures among the latent attributes to characterize their\ndependence. In most CDM applications, the attribute-attribute hierarchical\nstructures, the item-attribute $Q$-matrix, the item-level diagnostic model, as\nwell as the number of latent attributes, need to be fully or partially\npre-specified, which however may be subjective and misspecified as noted by\nmany recent studies.

DSP blocks are one of the efficient solutions to implement MACs\nin FPGA's. However, since the DSP blocks have wide multiplier and adder blocks,\nMAC operations using low bit-length parameters lead to an underutilization\nproblem. Hence, an efficient approximation technique is introduced. The\ntechnique includes manipulation and approximation of the low bit-length\nfixed-point parameters based upon a Single DSP - Multiple Multiplication (SDMM)\nexecution. The SDMM changes the traditional MAC implementation in the DSP block\nby separating multiplication and accumulation operations. While the accumulator\nhardware available in the DSP block is used for multiple parameter\nmultiplication, parallel LUTs are employed for the accumulation part of the MAC\noperation. The accuracy of the developed optimization technique was evaluated\nfor different CNN weight bit precisions using the Alexnet and VGG-16 networks\nand the Tiny ImageNet dataset. The optimization can be implemented without loss\nof accuracy in almost all cases, while it causes slight accuracy losses in a\nfew cases. Through these optimizations, the SDMM is performed at the cost of a\nsmall hardware overhead. For example, a single DSP block executes 3 8-bit\nfixed-point parameter multiplications. As a result of our optimizations, the\nparameters are represented in a different format on off-chip memory, providing\nup to 33% compression without any hardware cost. The compression rate can be\nfurther increased by up to 97% when used in conjunction with other compression\nmethods for the VGG-16. Reaching this compression rate requires extra hardware\ncost.

Synchronization in the gamma frequency band (30Hz-100Hz) is involved\nin a variety of cognitive phenomena; abnormalities of the gamma synchronization\nare found in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Frequently, the\nstrength of synchronization is not very high and is intermittent even on short\ntime scales (a few cycles of oscillations). That is, the network exhibits\nintervals of synchronization followed by intervals of desynchronization. Neural\ncircuits dynamics may show different distributions of desynchronization\ndurations even if the synchronization strength is fixed. In this study, we use\na conductance-based neural network exhibiting pyramidal-interneuron (PING)\ngamma rhythm to study the temporal patterning of synchronized neural\noscillations. We found that changes in the synaptic strength (as well as\nchanges in the membrane kinetics) can alter the temporal patterning of\nsynchrony. Moreover, we found that the changes in the temporal pattern of\nsynchrony may be independent of the changes in the average synchrony strength.\nEven though the temporal patterning may vary, there is a tendency for dynamics\nwith short (although potentially numerous) desynchronizations, similar to what\nwas observed in experimental studies of neural activity synchronization in the\nbrain. Recent studies suggested that the short desynchronizations dynamics may\nfacilitate the formation and the break-up of transient neural assemblies. Thus,\nthe results of this study suggest that changes of synaptic strength may alter\nthe temporal patterning of the gamma synchronization as to make the neural\nnetworks more efficient in the formation of neural assemblies and the\nfacilitation of cognitive phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 21:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Reformulating curved Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theory, also\nincluding a thorough introduction and a coordinate-free formulation. Especially\nthe infinitesimal gauge transformation will be generalized to a derivation on\nvector bundle $V$-valued functionals, induced by a Lie algebroid connection. 2.\nWe will discuss what type of connection for the definition of the infinitesimal\ngauge transformation should be used, and this is argued by studying the\ncommutator of two infinitesimal gauge transformations, viewed as derivations on\n$V$-valued functionals. We take the connection on $W$ then in such a way that\nthe commutator is again an infinitesimal gauge transformation. 3. Defining an\nequivalence of CYMH GTs given by a field redefinition. In order to preserve the\nphysics, this equivalence is constructed in such a way that the Lagrangian of\nthe studied theory is invariant under this field redefinition.

Data-driven\nmethods that leverage motion tracking are a prominent class of techniques for\nproducing high fidelity motions for a wide range of behaviors. However, the\neffectiveness of these tracking-based methods often hinges on carefully\ndesigned objective functions, and when applied to large and diverse motion\ndatasets, these methods require significant additional machinery to select the\nappropriate motion for the character to track in a given scenario. In this\nwork, we propose to obviate the need to manually design imitation objectives\nand mechanisms for motion selection by utilizing a fully automated approach\nbased on adversarial imitation learning. High-level task objectives that the\ncharacter should perform can be specified by relatively simple reward\nfunctions, while the low-level style of the character's behaviors can be\nspecified by a dataset of unstructured motion clips, without any explicit clip\nselection or sequencing. These motion clips are used to train an adversarial\nmotion prior, which specifies style-rewards for training the character through\nreinforcement learning (RL). The adversarial RL procedure automatically selects\nwhich motion to perform, dynamically interpolating and generalizing from the\ndataset. Our system produces high-quality motions that are comparable to those\nachieved by state-of-the-art tracking-based techniques, while also being able\nto easily accommodate large datasets of unstructured motion clips. Composition\nof disparate skills emerges automatically from the motion prior, without\nrequiring a high-level motion planner or other task-specific annotations of the\nmotion clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a diverse\ncast of complex simulated characters and a challenging suite of motor control\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 22:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 04:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

To this end, we develop a\nnovel classification algorithm called FilTrun that has two main modules:\nFiltration and Truncation. The key idea of our method is to first filter out\nthe non-robust coordinates of the input and then apply a carefully-designed\ntruncated inner product for classification. By analyzing the performance of\nFilTrun, we derive an upper bound on the optimal robust classification error.\nWe also find a lower bound by designing a specific adversarial strategy that\nenables us to derive the corresponding robust classifier and its achieved\nerror.

In nearby\nclusters, we see examples of cold gas being removed from the star-forming disks\nof galaxies moving through the intracluster medium, but whether active\nstripping is widespread and/or necessary to halt star formation in satellites,\nor quenching is just a consequence of the inability of these galaxies to\nreplenish their cold gas reservoirs, remains unclear. In this work, we review\nthe current status of environmental studies of cold gas in star-forming\nsatellites in the local Universe from an observational perspective, focusing on\nthe evidence for a physical link between cold gas stripping and quenching of\nthe star formation. We find that stripping of cold gas is ubiquitous in\nsatellite galaxies in both group and cluster environments.

By contrast, little is\nknown about positional coherence -- i.e., how a hidden dynamic skeleton\norganizes the underlying chaotic motion -- despite this being one of their most\nprominent and experimentally accessible features. Using a combination of\ndynamical systems theory, experiments on two-dimensional mixtures of\nmicrotubules and kinesin and hydrodynamic simulations, we characterize\npositional coherence in active nematics. These coherent structures can be\nidentified in the framework of Lagrangian dynamics as moving attractors and\nrepellers, which orchestrate complex motion. To understand the interaction of\npositional and orientational coherence on the dynamics of defects, we then\nanalysed observations and simulations and see that +1/2 defects move and deform\nthe attractors, thus functioning as control centers for collective motion.\nAdditionally, we find that regions around isolated +1/2 defects undergo high\nbending and low stretching/shearing deformations, consistent with the local\nstress distribution. The stress is minimum at the defect, while high\ndifferential stress along the defect orientation induces folding. Our work\noffers a new perspective to describe self-organization in active fluids, with\npotential applications to multicellular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 00:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Augmenting the action with a nonlocal term (a double integration\nover the duration of the interaction) results in a theory capable of describing\nboth the measurement process (agreement between system state and pointer state)\nand the collapse of both systems into a single eigenstate (or superposition of\ndegenerate eigenstates) of the relevant operator. In the absence of the\ninteraction, a superposition of states is stable, and the theory agrees with\nthe predictions of standard quantum theory. Because the theory is nonlocal, the\nresulting wave equation is an integrodifferential equation (IDE). We\ndemonstrate these ideas using a simple Lagrangian for both systems, as proof of\nprinciple. The variational principle is time-symmetric and retrocausal, so the\nsolution for the measurement process is determined by boundary conditions at\nboth initial and final times; the initial condition is determined by the\nexperimental preparation and the final condition is the natural boundary\ncondition of variational calculus. We hypothesize that one or more hidden\nvariables (not ruled out by Bell's Theorem, due both to the retrocausality and\nthe nonlocality of the theory) influence the outcome of the measurement, and\nthat distributions of the hidden variables that arise plausibly in a typical\nensemble of experimental realizations give rise to outcome frequencies\nconsistent with Born's rule.

Due to the limitation of the number of domains in the dataset,\ndeep detectors easily memorize a few seen domains, which leads to low\ngeneralization ability. There are two common ideas to improve the domain\ngeneralization performance. First, it can be inferred that the detector trained\non as many domains as possible is domain-invariant. Second, for the images with\nthe same semantic content in different domains, their hidden features should be\nequivalent. This paper further excavates these two ideas and proposes a domain\ngeneralization framework (named DMC) that learns how to generalize across\ndomains from Domain Mixup and Contrastive Learning. First, based on the\nformation of underwater images, an image in an underwater environment is the\nlinear transformation of another underwater environment. Thus, a style transfer\nmodel, which outputs a linear transformation matrix instead of the whole image,\nis proposed to transform images from one source domain to another, enriching\nthe domain diversity of the training data. Second, mixup operation interpolates\ndifferent domains on the feature level, sampling new domains on the domain\nmanifold. Third, contrastive loss is selectively applied to features from\ndifferent domains to force the model to learn domain invariant features but\nretain the discriminative capacity. With our method, detectors will be robust\nto domain shift. Also, a domain generalization benchmark S-UODAC2020 for\ndetection is set up to measure the performance of our method. Comprehensive\nexperiments on S-UODAC2020 and two object recognition benchmarks (PACS and\nVLCS) demonstrate that the proposed method is able to learn domain-invariant\nrepresentations, and outperforms other domain generalization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 01:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 13:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 02:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 05:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 03:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 09:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

The latest research proves that\nsuch an enormous character set can be decomposed into a collection of about 500\nfundamental Chinese radicals, and based on which this problem can be solved\neffectively. While with the constant advent of novel Chinese characters, the\nnumber of basic radicals is also expanding. The current methods that entirely\nrely on existing radicals are not flexible for identifying these novel\ncharacters and fail to recognize these Chinese characters without learning all\nof their radicals in the training stage. To this end, this paper proposes a\nnovel Hippocampus-heuristic Character Recognition Network (HCRN), which\nreferences the way of hippocampus thinking, and can recognize unseen Chinese\ncharacters (namely zero-shot learning) only by training part of radicals. More\nspecifically, the network architecture of HCRN is a new pseudo-siamese network\ndesigned by us, which can learn features from pairs of input training character\nsamples and use them to predict unseen Chinese characters. The experimental\nresults show that HCRN is robust and effective. It can accurately predict about\n16,330 unseen testing Chinese characters relied on only 500 trained Chinese\ncharacters.

Directly\napplying generic compression approaches yields poor results on GANs, which\nmotivates a number of recent GAN compression works. While prior works mainly\naccelerate conditional GANs, e.g., pix2pix and CycleGAN, compressing\nstate-of-the-art unconditional GANs has rarely been explored and is more\nchallenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN\ncompression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge\ndistillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a\nnovel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and\ndistillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that\nare unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our\ndistillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation\nquality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2\nby 11x with visually negligible image quality loss compared to the full-size\nmodel. More interestingly, when applied to various image manipulation tasks,\nour compressed model forms a smoother and better disentangled latent manifold,\nmaking it more effective for image editing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 02:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

There are many challenges, including varying head scales, the\ndiversity of crowd distribution across images and cluttered backgrounds. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-scale context aggregation network (MSCANet)\nbased on single-column encoder-decoder architecture for crowd counting, which\nconsists of an encoder based on a dense context-aware module (DCAM) and a\nhierarchical attention-guided decoder. To handle the issue of scale variation,\nwe construct the DCAM to aggregate multi-scale contextual information by\ndensely connecting the dilated convolution with varying receptive fields. The\nproposed DCAM can capture rich contextual information of crowd areas due to its\nlong-range receptive fields and dense scale sampling. Moreover, to suppress the\nbackground noise and generate a high-quality density map, we adopt a\nhierarchical attention-guided mechanism in the decoder. This helps to integrate\nmore useful spatial information from shallow feature maps of the encoder by\nintroducing multiple supervision based on semantic attention module (SAM).\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better\nperformance than other similar state-of-the-art methods on three challenging\nbenchmark datasets for crowd counting.

Such services require the client to send input data to the\nservice provider, who processes it using a DNN and returns the output\npredictions to the client. Due to the rich nature of the inputs such as images\nand speech, the input often contains more information than what is necessary to\nperform the primary inference task. Consequently, in addition to the primary\ninference task, a malicious service provider could infer secondary (sensitive)\nattributes from the input, compromising the client's privacy. The goal of our\nwork is to improve inference privacy by injecting noise to the input to hide\nthe irrelevant features that are not conducive to the primary classification\ntask. To this end, we propose Adaptive Noise Injection (ANI), which uses a\nlight-weight DNN on the client-side to inject noise to each input, before\ntransmitting it to the service provider to perform inference. Our key insight\nis that by customizing the noise to each input, we can achieve state-of-the-art\ntrade-off between utility and privacy (up to 48.5% degradation in\nsensitive-task accuracy with <1% degradation in primary accuracy),\nsignificantly outperforming existing noise injection schemes.

To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient\nand privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of\ndepending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health\nauthorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using\nBlockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of\nfailure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all\ntransactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is\nimportant, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike\nmost of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system\nconsists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public\nplaces access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control\nsubsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent\nspreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based\non the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones.\nOur analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy\nof the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking\nattacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our\nextensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system\n(which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation,\nand storage overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 03:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

To advance the understanding of this problem, we\nprovide three results that characterize the limits and possibilities of batch\npolicy optimization in the finite-armed stochastic bandit setting.

In this paper, we\npropose pyramid U-Net for accurate retinal vessel segmentation. In pyramid\nU-Net, the proposed pyramid-scale aggregation blocks (PSABs) are employed in\nboth the encoder and decoder to aggregate features at higher, current and lower\nlevels. In this way, coarse-to-fine context information is shared and\naggregated in each block thus to improve the location of capillaries. To\nfurther improve performance, two optimizations including pyramid inputs\nenhancement and deep pyramid supervision are applied to PSABs in the encoder\nand decoder, respectively. For PSABs in the encoder, scaled input images are\nadded as extra inputs. While for PSABs in the decoder, scaled intermediate\noutputs are supervised by the scaled segmentation labels. Extensive evaluations\nshow that our pyramid U-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on\nthe public DRIVE and CHASE-DB1 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 07:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Methods: Surgeons performing LCs at an academic centre were\ninvited to perform a 5-second long time out to verify CVS before dividing the\ncystic duct (5-second rule). The primary endpoint was to compare the rate of\nCVS achievement between LCs performed in the year before and the year after the\n5-second rule.

After the implementation of the\n5-second rule, the rate of CVS achievement increased significantly (15.9 vs\n44.1 %; P<0.001) as well as the rate of bailout procedures (8.2 vs 15.7 %;\nP=0.045), the median time to clip the cystic duct or artery (17:26\n[interquartile range: 16:46] vs 23:12 [17:16] minutes; P=0.007), and the rate\nof postoperative CVS reporting (1.3 vs 28.8 %; P<0.001).

The adaptive sampler dynamically updates the\ninput of the supplementary branch with a sampling weight sequence negatively\ncorrelated with the CAS from the base branch, thereby prompting the\nsupplementary branch to localize the action regions underestimated by the base\nbranch.

Outside the\nholes, a sound field can be expressed in terms of its normal derivatives on the\napertures of holes. Inside each hole, since the vertical variable can be\nseparated, the field can be expressed in terms of a countable set of Fourier\nbasis functions. Matching the field on each aperture yields a linear system of\ncountable equations in terms of a countable set of unknown Fourier\ncoefficients. The linear system can be reduced to a finite-dimensional linear\nsystem based on the invertibility of its principal submatrix, which is proved\nby the well-posedness of a closely related boundary value problem for each hole\nin the limiting case $h\\to 0$, so that only the leading Fourier coefficient of\neach hole is preserved in the finite-dimensional system.

From the spectra estimated at\nseveral vertical positions, the TKE dissipation rate was found to decrease\nexponentially with depth.

Our theory\nincludes both non-specific interactions between enzyme and substrate, as well\nas complex formation through specific binding between the enzyme and the\nsubstrate. We find that two distinct mechanisms contribute to enzyme\nchemotaxis: a diffusiophoretic mechanism due to the non-specific interactions,\nand a new type of mechanism due to binding-induced changes in the diffusion\ncoefficient of the enzyme. The latter chemotactic mechanism points towards\nlower substrate concentration if the substrate enhances enzyme diffusion, and\ntowards higher substrate concentration if the substrate inhibits enzyme\ndiffusion.

Our results\nresolve an apparent contradiction regarding the direction of urease chemotaxis\nobserved in experiments, and in general clarify the relation between enhanced\ndiffusion and chemotaxis of enzymes.

In\nparticular, MT is sensitive to macromolecules and ihMT appears to be specific\nto myelinated tissue. This study proposes a technique to characterize MT and\nihMT properties from a single acquisition, producing both semiquantitative\ncontrast ratios, and quantitative parameter maps.\n  Theory and Methods: Building upon previous work that uses multiband\nradiofrequency (RF) pulses to efficiently generate ihMT contrast, we propose a\ncyclic-steady-state approach that cycles between multiband and single-band\npulses to boost the achieved contrast. Resultant time-variable signals are\nreminiscent of a magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) acquisition, except\nthat the signal fluctuations are entirely mediated by magnetization transfer\neffects. A dictionary-based low-rank inversion method is used to reconstruct\nthe resulting images and to produce both semiquantitative MT ratio (MTR) and\nihMT ratio (ihMTR) maps, as well as quantitative parameter estimates\ncorresponding to an ihMT tissue model.\n  Results: Phantom and in vivo brain data acquired at 1.5T demonstrate the\nexpected contrast trends, with ihMTR maps showing contrast more specific to\nwhite matter (WM), as has been reported by others.

We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in\nthe first frame but not in the next, a slight overloading of the standard\ndefinition since it also includes points that move out-of-frame. Estimating the\nmotion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame\nsetting. Previous work relies on CNNs to learn occlusions, without much\nsuccess, or requires multiple frames to reason about occlusions using temporal\nsmoothness. In this paper, we argue that the occlusion problem can be better\nsolved in the two-frame case by modelling image self-similarities.

However, such requirements are challenging to elicit, a problem\nexacerbated by increasingly dynamic environments in which software systems\noperate, as well as stakeholders' changing needs. Therefore, capturing all\nfairness requirements during the production of software is challenging, and is\ninsufficient for addressing software changes post deployment. In this paper, we\npropose adaptive fairness as a means for maintaining the satisfaction of\nchanging fairness requirements.

However, traditional network\nembedding algorithms are sub-optimal in capturing rich while potentially\nincompatible semantics provided by HINs. To address this issue, a novel\nmeta-path-based HIN representation learning framework named mSHINE is designed\nto simultaneously learn multiple node representations for different meta-paths.\nMore specifically, one representation learning module inspired by the RNN\nstructure is developed and multiple node representations can be learned\nsimultaneously, where each representation is associated with one respective\nmeta-path.

We do not require any class labels, interval bounds, or\nbounding boxes. To address this challenging task, we introduce a novel few-shot\ntransformer architecture with a dedicated encoder-decoder structure optimized\nfor joint commonality learning and localization prediction, without the need\nfor proposals. Experiments on our reorganizations of the AVA and UCF101-24\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our approach for few-shot common action\nlocalization, even when the support videos are noisy. Although we are not\nspecifically designed for common localization in time only, we also compare\nfavorably against the few-shot and one-shot state-of-the-art in this setting.\nLastly, we demonstrate that the few-shot transformer is easily extended to\ncommon action localization per pixel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 11:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

In this paper we used recent deep surveys in infrared and\noptical bands to search for the presence of a galaxy with the expected\nproperties of a gravitational lens. The search revealed a $5 \\sigma$ detection\nof a faint galaxy between the two quasar images on a deep $J$-band frame from\nthe VISTA Science Archive, with apparent magnitude $J = 20.68$. Non-detection\nin the $I$-band implied a redshift $z > 0.6$, and mass modelling of the quasar\nsystem gave a mass of $1.31 \\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$ for the lensing galaxy,\nwith mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot} = 9.0$.

Although MRI turbulence can act as a heat source for convection, it is\nnot clear how the instabilities will interact dynamically.

Most\ncurrent approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs), which can be generated\nfrom image-level annotations.

We present a novel learning strategy that leverages\nself-supervision in a multi-modal image scenario to significantly enhance\noriginal CAMs. In particular, the proposed method is based on two observations.\nFirst, the learning of fully-supervised segmentation networks implicitly\nimposes equivariance by means of data augmentation, whereas this implicit\nconstraint disappears on CAMs generated with image tags. And second, the\ncommonalities between image modalities can be employed as an efficient\nself-supervisory signal, correcting the inconsistency shown by CAMs obtained\nacross multiple modalities. To effectively train our model, we integrate a\nnovel loss function that includes a within-modality and a cross-modality\nequivariant term to explicitly impose these constraints during training.

Therefore,\nit is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically\ninterpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video\ninterpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data.\nCompared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics\nthat make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth\ncolor pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate\naccurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via\nexaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this\nwork, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem\nfor the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an\neffective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the\n\"lack of textures\" challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces\nthat are piece-wise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the\n\"non-linear and extremely large motion\" challenge by recurrent predictions\nusing a transformer-like architecture.

We focus on\nthe consequences of hybridization of the nanographene zero-modes with a\nconducting substrate on the $dI/dV$ lineshapes associated with spin\nexcitations. The partially filled nanographene zero-modes coupled to the\nconduction electrons in the substrate constitute multi-orbital Anderson\nimpurity models that we solve in the one-crossing approximation which treats\nthe coupling to the substrate to infinite order. We find that the coupling to\nthe substrate leads to (i) renormalization of the spin flip excitation energies\nof the bare molecule, (ii) broadening of the spectral features and (iii) the\nemergence of zero bias Kondo peaks for the $S=1$ ground states. The calculated\nsubstrate induced shift of the spin excitation energies is found to be\nsignificantly larger than their broadening, which implies that this effect has\nto be considered when comparing experimental results and theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 13:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 08:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

The scheme is based upon the distance between points, which as a 1D\nquantity can be regressed more accurately than the 2D and 3D vector and offset\nquantities regressed in previous work, yielding more accurate keypoint\nlocalization. The scheme forms the basis of the proposed RCVPose method for 6\nDoF pose estimation of 3D objects in RGB-D data, which is particularly\neffective at handling occlusions. A CNN is trained to estimate the distance\nbetween the 3D point corresponding to the depth mode of each RGB pixel, and a\nset of 3 disperse keypoints defined in the object frame. At inference, a sphere\ncentered at each 3D point is generated, of radius equal to this estimated\ndistance.

Increasing Reynolds number $Re$ leads to pitchfork and Hopf\nbifurcations, and the latter leads to a limit cycle with amplitude modulation\nof vortices, as in the DNS by Nogueira \\& Cavalieri. Further increase of $Re$\nleads to the appearance of a chaotic saddle, followed by the emergence of\nquasi-periodic and chaotic attractors. The chaotic attractors suffer a merging\ncrisis for higher $Re$, leading to chaotic dynamics with amplitude modulation\nand phase jumps of vortices.

Besides, an\nadaptive variable step size is also integrated in this algorithm to enhance the\nconvergence capacity. The performance of TSA is assessed in three classes of\ntests: classical tests, CEC benchmarks, and engineering optimization problems.\nMoreover, several studies and metrics have been used to observe the behavior of\nthe proposed TSA. The experimental results show that TSA algorithm is capable\nto provide very promising and competitive results on most benchmark functions\nthanks to better balance between exploration and exploitation of the search\nspace.

An excellent energy resolution and a large fiducial\nvolume offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important topics in\nneutrino and astro-particle physics. With 6 years of data, the neutrino mass\nordering can be determined at 3-4 sigma and three oscillation parameters can be\nmeasured to a precision of 0.6% or better by detecting reactor antineutrinos.\nWith 10 years of data, DSNB could be observed at 3-sigma; a lower limit of the\nproton lifetime of 8.34e33 years (90% C.L.) can be set by searching for\np->nu_bar K^+; detection of solar neutrinos would shed new light on the solar\nmetallicity problem and examine the vacuum-matter transition region. A\ncore-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000 IBD and ~2000 (300)\nall-flavor neutrino-proton (electron) scattering events. Geo-neutrinos can be\ndetected with a rate of ~400 events/year. We also summarize the final design of\nthe JUNO detector and the key R&D achievements. All 20-inch PMTs have been\ntested. The average photon detection efficiency is 28.9% for the 15,000 MCP\nPMTs and 28.1% for the 5,000 dynode PMTs, higher than the JUNO requirement of\n27%.

The underwater electronics is designed to have a loss rate\n<0.5% in 6 years.

Their ratio of mass to magnetic critical mass is 0.5-3,\nindicating nearly critical field strengths. The field strength B_pos is\ncorrelated with column density N as B_pos~N^p, where p=1.05+-0.08, and with\ndensity n as B_pos~n^q, where q=0.66+-0.05. These magnetic properties are\nconsistent with those derived from Zeeman studies (Crutcher et al. 2010), with\nless scatter. Relations between virial mass M_V, magnetic critical mass M_B,\nand Alfven amplitude sigma_B/B match the observed range of M/M_B for cores\nobserved to be nearly virial, with M/M_V=0.5-2, with moderate Alfven\namplitudes, and with sigma_B/B=0.1-0.4.

In this paper, we propose MirrorNeRF - a one-shot neural portrait\nfree-viewpoint rendering approach using a catadioptric imaging system with\nmultiple sphere mirrors and a single high-resolution digital camera, which is\nthe first to combine neural radiance field with catadioptric imaging so as to\nenable one-shot photo-realistic human portrait reconstruction and rendering, in\na low-cost and casual capture setting.

We introduce a novel neural warping radiance field\nrepresentation to learn a continuous displacement field that implicitly\ncompensates for the misalignment due to our flexible system setting. We further\npropose a density regularization scheme to leverage the inherent geometry\ninformation from the catadioptric data in a self-supervision manner, which not\nonly improves the training efficiency but also provides more effective density\nsupervision for higher rendering quality.

One difficulty in the\ninterpretation of EVPA rotations is the inherent 180{\\deg} ambiguity in the\nmeasurements. It is therefore essential, when studying EVPA rotations, to\nensure that the typical time-interval between successive observations -- i.e.\nthe cadence -- is short enough to ensure that the correct modulo 180{\\deg}\nvalue is selected. This optimal cadence depends on the maximum intrinsic EVPA\nrotation speed in blazars, which is currently not known. In this paper we\naddress the following questions for the RoboPol sample: What range of rotation\nspeeds for rotations greater than 90{\\deg} can we expect? What observation\ncadence is required to detect such rotations? Have rapid rotations been missed\nin EVPA rotation studies thus far? What fraction of data is affected by the\nambiguity? And how likely are detected rotations affected by the ambiguity?

We propose an\nextremely low footprint E2E ASR system for smart devices, to achieve the goal\nof satisfying resource constraints without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We\ndesign cross-layer weight sharing to improve parameter efficiency and further\nexploit model compression methods including sparsification and quantization, to\nreduce memory storage and boost decoding efficiency. We evaluate our approaches\non the public AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 benchmarks. On the AISHELL-2 task, the\nproposed method achieves more than 10x compression (model size reduces from 248\nto 24MB), at the cost of only minor performance loss (CER reduces from 6.49% to\n6.92%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 12:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 02:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 02:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 08:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 03:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Here, a general method for\none-step time integrations has been created, considering a direction free\napproach for integrations leading to a numerical method with parameter-based\nstability preservation. Adaptive procedures depending on the problem types for\nthe current method are explained with the help of local error estimates to\nminimize the computational cost. Priority error analysis of the current method\nis made, and order conditions are presented in terms of direction parameters.\nStability analysis of the method is performed for both scalar equations and\nsystems of differential equations. The currently produced parameter-based\nmethod has been proven to provide A-stability, for 0.5<\\theta<1, in various\norders. The present method has been shown to be a very good option for\naddressing a wide range of initial value problems through numerical\nexperiments. It can be seen as a significant contribution that the\nSusceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered equation system parameterized for the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has been integrated with the present method and stability\nproperties of the method have been tested on this stiff model and significant\nresults are produced. Some challenging stiff behaviours represented by the\nnonlinear Duffing equation, Robertson chemical system, and van der Pol equation\nhave also been integrated, and the results revealed that the current algorithm\nproduces much more reliable results than numerical techniques in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 14:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

For instance, many synchronization patterns\nresult from the underlying network symmetries, and high symmetries are known to\nincrease the stability of synchronization.

We demonstrate this effect in an\necological multilayer network where the topological asymmetries occur\nnaturally. These asymmetries rescue the system from chaotic oscillations by\nestablishing stable periodic orbits and equilibria. We call this phenomenon\nasymmetry-induced order and uncover its mechanism by analyzing both\nanalytically and numerically the suppression of dynamics on the system's\nsynchronization manifold. Moreover, the bifurcation scenario describing the\nroute from chaos to order is also disclosed.
