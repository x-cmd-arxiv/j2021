Radiosensitizing properties of NPs may depend on many different\nparameters (such as size, composition and density) of the metal core, organic\ncoatings and the molecular environment. A systematic exploration of each of\nthese parameters on the atomistic level remains a costly experimental task but\nit can be addressed by means of advanced computational modeling. This paper\noutlines a detailed computational procedure for the construction and\natomistic-level characterization of radiosensitizing metal NPs in explicit\nmolecular media. The procedure is general and extensible to many different\ncombinations of the core, coating and environment. As an illustrative and\nexperimentally relevant case study, we consider nanometre-sized gold NPs coated\nwith thiol-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine molecules of different length and\nsurface density and solvated in water at ambient conditions. Radial\ndistribution of different atoms in the coatings as well as distribution and\nstructural properties of water around the coated NPs are analyzed and linked to\nradiosensitizing properties of the NPs. It is revealed that the structure of\nthe coating layer on the solvated NPs depends strongly on the surface density\nof ligands. At surface densities below $\\sim$3 molecules/nm$^{2}$ the coating\nrepresents a mixture of different conformation states, whereas elongated\n\"brush\"-like structures are formed at higher densities of ligands. The water\ncontent in denser coatings is significantly lower at distances from 1 to 3 nm\nfrom the gold surface depending on the length of ligands. Such dense and thick\ncoatings may suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals by low-energy\nelectrons emitted from the metal NPs and thus diminish their radiosensitizing\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 16:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 21:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

A traditional foam core or honeycomb structure is lightweight and\nstiff, but susceptible to permanent deformation when subjected to excessive\nloading. Here we propose the use of an architected structure composed of arrays\nof hollow truncated cone unit cells that dissipate energy and exhibit\nstructural recovery. These structures printed with a viscoelastic material rely\non buckling of their sidewalls to dissipate energy and snap-back to prevent\npermanent deformation. We explore the mechanical response of these conical unit\ncells in terms of their buckling strength and post-buckling stability\ncondition, and develop design maps for the same, by relating them to\nnon-dimensional geometric parameters $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, where\n$\\alpha$ represents the slenderness of the curved sidewalls, $\\beta$ is the\nangle of the sidewall to the base, and $\\gamma$ represents the curvature of the\nsidewall. A validated finite element model is developed and used to investigate\nthe effect of these parameters. We see that the peak buckling load is directly\nproportional to both $\\alpha$ & $\\beta$ and is not dependent on $\\gamma$ when\nthe load is normalized by the volume of material in the curved sidewall.\nInterestingly, the post-buckling stability is influenced by $\\gamma$, or the\ninitial curvature of the sidewall, where a larger radius of curvature makes the\nstructure less susceptible to exhibit structural bistability. The structures\npresented here are printed using a viscoelastic material, that causes them to\nexhibit pseudo-bistability, or a time-delayed recovery. This allows the\nstructures to buckle and dissipate energy, and then recover to their original\nconfigurations without the need for external stimuli or energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 16:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 02:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

A typical approach is to\nrandomize individuals into the treatment group, which receives the\nintervention, and the control group, which does not. The platform then compares\nthe performance in the two groups to estimate the effect if the intervention\nwere launched to everyone. We focus on two common experiment types, where the\nplatform randomizes individuals either on the supply side or on the demand\nside. The resulting estimates of the treatment effect in these experiments are\ntypically biased: because individuals in the market compete with each other,\nindividuals in the treatment group affect those in the control group and vice\nversa, creating interference. We develop a simple tractable market model to\nstudy bias and variance in these experiments with interference. We focus on two\nchoices available to the platform: (1) Which side of the platform should it\nrandomize on (supply or demand)? (2) What proportion of individuals should be\nallocated to treatment? We find that both choices affect the bias and variance\nof the resulting estimators but in different ways. The bias-optimal choice of\nexperiment type depends on the relative amounts of supply and demand in the\nmarket, and we discuss how a platform can use market data to select the\nexperiment type. Importantly, we find in many circumstances, choosing the\nbias-optimal experiment type has little effect on variance. On the other hand,\nthe choice of treatment proportion can induce a bias-variance tradeoff, where\nthe bias-minimizing proportion increases variance. We discuss how a platform\ncan navigate this tradeoff and best choose the treatment proportion, using a\ncombination of modeling as well as contextual knowledge about the market, the\nrisk of the intervention, and reasonable effect sizes of the intervention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 18:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DC3 in both synthetic optimization tasks and\nthe real-world setting of AC optimal power flow, where hard constraints encode\nthe physics of the electrical grid. In both cases, DC3 achieves near-optimal\nobjective values while preserving feasibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 18:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

An important first step in assessing the practical utility of a model\nis to evaluate its average performance over an entire population of interest.\nIn many settings, it is also critical that the model makes good predictions\nwithin predefined subpopulations. For instance, showing that a model is fair or\nequitable requires evaluating the model's performance in different demographic\nsubgroups.

We devise a procedure to measure subpopulation performance that\ncan be more sample-efficient than the typical subsample estimates.

First, a structure detection method is developed\nthat identifies switch times in the control and analyzes the corresponding\nswitching function for segments where the solution is either bang-bang or\nsingular. Second, after the structure has been detected, the domain is\ndecomposed into multiple domains such that the multiple-domain formulation\nincludes additional decision variables that represent the switch times in the\noptimal control.

To\nthis end, the paper first formalizes the COCO construction paradigm for\naugmented continuation problems compatible with simultaneous analysis of\nimplicitly defined manifolds of solutions to nonlinear equations and the\ncorresponding adjoint variables associated with optimization of scalar\nobjective functions along such manifolds. The paper uses applications to data\nassimilation from finite time histories and phase response analysis of periodic\norbits to identify a universal paradigm of construction that permits\nabstraction and generalization. It then details the theoretical framework for a\nCOCO-compatible toolbox able to support the analysis of a large family of\ndelay-coupled multi-segment boundary-value problems, including periodic orbits,\nquasiperiodic orbits, connecting orbits, initial-value problems, and optimal\ncontrol problems, as illustrated in a suite of numerical examples. The paper\naims to present a pedagogical treatment that is accessible to the novice and\ninspiring to the expert by appealing to the many senses of the applied\nnonlinear dynamicist. Sprinkled among a systematic discussion of problem\nconstruction, graph representations of delay-coupled problems, and vectorized\nformulas for problem discretization, the paper includes an original derivation\nusing Lagrangian sensitivity analysis of phase-response functionals for\nperiodic-orbit problems in abstract Banach spaces, as well as a demonstration\nof the regularizing benefits of multi-dimensional manifold continuation for\nnear-singular problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 21:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 04:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 18:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

The phenomenon is also invoked\nto explain resonant and near-resonant exoplanetary system structures. The early\ninward migration may also have affected our Solar System and sculpted its\ndifferent minor planet reservoirs. In this study we explore how the early\ninward migration of the giant planets shapes the Kuiper Belt. We test different\nscenarios with only Neptune and Uranus and with all the four giant planets,\nincluding also some models with the subsequent outward planetesimal-driven\nmigration of Neptune after the gas dispersal. We find objects populating mean\nmotion resonances even when Neptune and Uranus do not migrate at all or only\nmigrate inwards. When the planets are fixed, planetesimals stick only\ntemporarily to the mean motion resonances, while inwards migration yields a new\nchannel to populate the resonances without invoking convergent migration. In\nthese cases, however, it is hard to populate mean motion resonances that do not\ncross the planetesimal disc (such as 2:1 and 5:2) and there is a lack of\nresonant KBOs that cross Neptune's orbit. These Neptune crossers are an\nunambiguous signature of the outward migration of Neptune. The starting\nposition and the growth rate of Neptune matters for the contamination of the\nclassical Kuiper belt region from neighbouring regions. The eccentricity and\ninclination space of the hot classicals and the scattered disc region become\nmuch more populated when all the giant planets are included. The 5:2 resonance\nwith Neptune becomes increasingly populated with deeper inward migrations of\nNeptune. The overall inclination distribution, however, is still narrower than\nfrom observations, as is generally the case for Kuiper belt population models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 21:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Computationally, simulating persistence\ndynamically can be reduced to maintaining a valid decomposition under adjacent\ntranspositions in the filtration order.\n  In practice, the quadratic scaling in the number of such transpositions often\nmakes this maintenance procedure slower than simply computing the decomposition\nfrom scratch, limiting the application of dynamic persistence to relatively\nsmall data sets. In this work, we propose a coarser strategy for maintaining\nthe decomposition over a 1-parameter family of filtrations.

The training of\nPINNs is simulation-free, and does not require any training dataset to be\nobtained from numerical PDE solvers. Instead, it only requires the physical\nproblem description, including the governing laws of physics, domain geometry,\ninitial/boundary conditions, and the material properties. This training usually\ninvolves solving a non-convex optimization problem using variants of the\nstochastic gradient descent method, with the gradient of the loss function\napproximated on a batch of collocation points, selected randomly in each\niteration according to a uniform distribution. Despite the success of PINNs in\naccurately solving a wide variety of PDEs, the method still requires\nimprovements in terms of computational efficiency. To this end, in this paper,\nwe study the performance of an importance sampling approach for efficient\ntraining of PINNs. Using numerical examples together with theoretical\nevidences, we show that in each training iteration, sampling the collocation\npoints according to a distribution proportional to the loss function will\nimprove the convergence behavior of the PINNs training. Additionally, we show\nthat providing a piecewise constant approximation to the loss function for\nfaster importance sampling can further improve the training efficiency.

We empirically test\nthe generation ability of PanGu-$\\alpha$ in various scenarios including text\nsummarization, question answering, dialogue generation, etc. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the effect of model scales on the few-shot performances across a\nbroad range of Chinese NLP tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior capabilities of PanGu-$\\alpha$ in performing various tasks under\nfew-shot or zero-shot settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 06:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

As a result, the dynamics of reactive\nsuspensions is fundamentally governed by hydro-chemical interactions. A full\nsolution of the detailed hydro-chemical problem with many particles is\nchallenging and computationally expensive. Most current methods rely on the\nGreen's functions of the Laplace and Stokes operators to approximate the\nparticle signatures in the far-field, which is only valid in the very dilute\nlimit in simple geometries. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nregularized mutipole framework, directly inspired by the Force Coupling Method\n(FCM), to model phoretic suspensions. Our approach, called Diffusio-phoretic\nFCM (DFCM), relies on grid-based volume averages of the concentration field to\ncompute the particle surface concentration moments. These moments define the\nchemical multipoles of the diffusion (Laplace) problem and provide the swimming\nforcing of the Stokes equations. Unlike far-field models based on singularity\nsuperposition, DFCM accounts for mutually-induced dipoles. The accuracy of the\nmethod is evaluated against exact and accurate numerical solutions for a few\ncanonical cases. We also quantify its improvements over far-field\napproximations for a wide range of inter-particle distances.

From the NBDC data two weeks prior to each PHQ-8\nscore, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and\nnonlinear features for measuring periodicity and regularity of individuals'\nlife rhythms.

Compared to 2D imagery, these types of applications require much larger\namounts of storage space, which we seek to reduce. Existing approaches for\ncompressing 3D scenes are based on a separation of compression and rendering:\neach of the original views is compressed using traditional 2D image formats;\nthe receiver decompresses the views and then performs the rendering. We unify\nthese steps by directly compressing an implicit representation of the scene, a\nfunction that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field, which can\nthen be queried to render arbitrary viewpoints.

To obtain reliable\npredictions, one needs to maintain the proper balance between the black-box\nnature of ML frameworks and the physics of the target properties. One of the\nmost appealing quantum-chemical properties for regression models is the\nelectron density, and some of us recently proposed a transferable and scalable\nmodel based on the decomposition of the density onto an atom-centered basis\nset. The decomposition, as well as the training of the model, is at its core a\nminimization of some loss function, which can be arbitrarily chosen and may\nlead to results of different quality. Well-studied in the context of density\nfitting (DF), the impact of the metric on the performance of ML models has not\nbeen analyzed yet. In this work, we compare predictions obtained using the\noverlap and the Coulomb-repulsion metrics for both decomposition and training.\nAs expected, the Coulomb metric used as both the DF and ML loss functions leads\nto the best results for the electrostatic potential and dipole moments. The\norigin of this difference lies in the fact that the model is not constrained to\npredict densities that integrate to the exact number of electrons $N$. Since an\n\\textit{a posteriori} correction for the number of electrons decreases the\nerrors, we proposed a modification of the model where $N$ is included directly\ninto the kernel function, which allowed to lower the errors on the test and\nout-of-sample sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 10:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

When\ncommunication is sparse with information being sent once in a long while,\nchannel sensing becomes a significant source of energy consumption. How to\nreliably detect messages while minimizing the receiver energy consumption? This\npaper addresses this problem through a reconfigurable scheme, referred to as\nAdaSense, which exploits the dependency between the receiver noise figure\n(i.e., the receiver added noise) and the receiver power consumption; a higher\npower typically translates into less noisy channel observations. AdaSense\nbegins in a low power low reliability mode and makes a first tentative decision\nbased on a few channel observations. If a message is declared, it switches to a\nhigh power high reliability mode to confirm the decision, else it sleeps for\nthe entire duration of the second phase. Compared to prominent detection\nschemes such as the BMAC protocol, AdaSense provides relative energy gains that\ngrow unbounded in the small probability of false-alarm regime, as communication\ngets sparser. In the non-asymptotic regime energy gains are 30% to 75% for\ncommunication scenarios typically found in the context of wake-up receivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 10:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

However,\ndespite their effectiveness, such models still overlook a problem that\nperformance of ICF methods heavily depends on the quality of item\nrepresentation especially the target item representation. In fact, due to the\nlong-tail distribution in the recommendation, most item embeddings can not\nrepresent the semantics of items accurately and thus degrade the performance of\ncurrent ICF methods.

The\nfirst layer is in charge of optimizing the leader's long-term motion profile\nusing the traffic light and road slope information. The long-term planning\nmodel is defined based on the reachability analysis of the platoon to the green\nlight windows. An event-triggered mechanism is proposed to operate the\nlong-term planning model. The second layer is the short-term adaptation, in\nwhich the leader attempts to follow the planning motion profile in real time,\nwhile the follower keeps track of the nearest preceding vehicle and the leader,\nto preserve the desired inter-vehicular distances. A Newton's method-based\nalgorithm is implemented to effectively solve both the long-term planning and\nshort-term adaptation problems. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation\nand algorithm is illustrated by the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 12:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 13:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Given the diverse network\nconnections (e.g., WiFi, cellular and wired link) from time to time, this paper\nthus proposes to learn the ANT (a.k.a., Accurate Network Throughput) model to\ncharacterize the full spectrum of network throughput dynamics in the past for\nderiving the proper network condition associated with a specific cluster of\nnetwork throughput segments (NTS).

However, we argue that it is\nless effective to extract the complex spatio-temporal relationship with such\nfactorized modules. Besides, most existing works predict the traffic intensity\nof a particular time interval only based on the traffic data of the previous\none hour of that day. And thereby ignores the repetitive daily/weekly pattern\nthat may exist in the last hour of data. Therefore, we propose a Unified\nSpatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (USTGCN) for traffic forecasting that\nperforms both spatial and temporal aggregation through direct information\npropagation across different timestamp nodes with the help of spectral graph\nconvolution on a spatio-temporal graph. Furthermore, it captures historical\ndaily patterns in previous days and current-day patterns in current-day traffic\ndata. Finally, we validate our work's effectiveness through experimental\nanalysis, which shows that our model USTGCN can outperform state-of-the-art\nperformances in three popular benchmark datasets from the Performance\nMeasurement System (PeMS). Moreover, the training time is reduced significantly\nwith our proposed USTGCN model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 12:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

It is used in various\nfields such as networking, security, and bioinformatics for the classification\nof complex networks, the design of routing schemes, and the analysis of graph\nalgorithms. Despite recent progress, computing the hyperbolicity of a graph\nremains challenging. Indeed, the best known algorithm has time complexity\n$O(n^{3.69})$, which is prohibitive for large graphs, and the most efficient\nalgorithms in practice have space complexity $O(n^2)$. Thus, time as well as\nspace are bottlenecks for computing hyperbolicity.\n  In this paper, we design a tool for enumerating all far-apart pairs of a\ngraph by decreasing distances. A node pair $(u, v)$ of a graph is far-apart if\nboth $v$ is a leaf of all shortest-path trees rooted at $u$ and $u$ is a leaf\nof all shortest-path trees rooted at $v$. This notion was previously used to\ndrastically reduce the computation time for hyperbolicity in practice. However,\nit required the computation of the distance matrix to sort all pairs of nodes\nby decreasing distance, which requires an infeasible amount of memory already\nfor medium-sized graphs. We present a new data structure that avoids this\nmemory bottleneck in practice and for the first time enables computing the\nhyperbolicity of several large graphs that were far out-of-reach using previous\nalgorithms. For some instances, we reduce the memory consumption by at least\ntwo orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that for many graphs, only a very\nsmall fraction of far-apart pairs have to be considered for the hyperbolicity\ncomputation, explaining this drastic reduction of memory.\n  As iterating over far-apart pairs in decreasing order without storing them\nexplicitly is a very general tool, we believe that our approach might also be\nrelevant to other problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 12:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

The efficiency of\nSNNs could be enhanced using compression methods such as pruning and\nquantization. Notably, SNNs, unlike their non-spiking counterparts, consist of\na temporal dimension, the compression of which can lead to latency reduction.\nIn this paper, we propose spatial and temporal pruning of SNNs. First,\nstructured spatial pruning is performed by determining the layer-wise\nsignificant dimensions using principal component analysis of the average\naccumulated membrane potential of the neurons. This step leads to 10-14X model\ncompression. Additionally, it enables inference with lower latency and\ndecreases the spike count per inference. To further reduce latency, temporal\npruning is performed by gradually reducing the timesteps while training. The\nnetworks are trained using surrogate gradient descent based backpropagation and\nwe validate the results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, using VGG architectures. The\nspatiotemporally pruned SNNs achieve 89.04% and 66.4% accuracy on CIFAR10 and\nCIFAR100, respectively, while performing inference with 3-30X reduced latency\ncompared to state-of-the-art SNNs. Moreover, they require 8-14X lesser compute\nenergy compared to their unpruned standard deep learning counterparts. The\nenergy numbers are obtained by multiplying the number of operations with energy\nper operation. These SNNs also provide 1-4% higher robustness against Gaussian\nnoise corrupted inputs.

The results we obtain\nduring the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual\nrecognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named\nVisformer, which is abbreviated from the `Vision-friendly Transformer'. With\nthe same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the\nTransformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet\nclassification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the\nmodel complexity is lower or the training set is smaller. The code is available\nat https://github.com/danczs/Visformer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 05:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 14:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 08:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

To enable efficient massive WET, channel state information\n(CSI)-limited/free multi-antenna transmit schemes have been recently proposed\nin the literature. The idea is to reduce/null the energy costs to be paid by\nenergy harvesting (EH) IoT nodes from participating in large-scale\ntime/power-consuming CSI training, but still enable some transmit spatial\ngains. In this paper, we take another step forward by proposing a novel\nCSI-free rotary antenna beamforming (RAB) WET scheme that outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art CSI-free schemes in a scenario where a power beacon (PB)\nequipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) powers a large set of surrounding EH\nIoT devices. RAB uses a properly designed CSI-free beamformer combined with a\ncontinuous or periodic rotation of the ULA at the PB to provide average EH\ngains that scale as $0.85\\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of PB's antenna\nelements. Moreover, a rotation-specific power control mechanism was proposed to\ni) fairly optimize the WET process if devices' positioning information is\navailable, and/or ii) to avoid hazards to human health in terms of specific\nabsorption rate (SAR). We show that RAB performance even approaches quickly (or\nsurpasses, for scenarios with sufficiently large number of EH devices, or when\nusing the proposed power control) the performance of a traditional full-CSI\nbased transmit scheme, and it is also less sensitive to SAR constraints.\nFinally, we discuss important practicalities related to RAB such as its\nrobustness against non line-of-sight conditions compared to other CSI-free WET\nschemes, and its generalizability to scenarios where the PB uses other than a\nULA topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 09:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Airborne virus transmission by\nasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major\ncontributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of\nface masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many\ncountries. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne\ntransmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the\nfiltration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In\nparticular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is\nneglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face\nmasks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we\nconsider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic person\nto a healthy person, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor\nenvironment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular\nCommunications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number\nof IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations\nof the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and\ninhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic\nfiltering of IAs by the face masks. Furthermore, we show that the fit of the\nface mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability.\nWe conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment\ntool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it encompasses the randomness of the\ntransmission process and enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical\naverages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 14:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 13:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Weighted timed games are\nnotoriously difficult and quickly undecidable, even when restricted to\nnon-negative weights. For non-negative weights, the largest class that can be\nanalysed has been introduced by Bouyer, Jaziri and Markey in 2015. Though the\nvalue problem is undecidable, the authors show how to approximate the value by\nconsidering regions with a refined granularity.

However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data\nprivacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can\nbe used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method\nwill leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason that is the\nlimitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the\nmodel through data sharing, which will also cause the privacy leakage. To solve\nthis problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) frame-work which is a new\ntechnique being used to protect the data privacy. Under the FL framework and\nDifferentially Private thinking, we propose a FederatedDifferentially Private\nGenerative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detectCOVID-19 pneumonia for\nsustainable smart cities.

They are appealing for the experimental\nease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and elegant\nmathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies\nrequire us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian\nelements. In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of\nnon-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a\nframework to describe the different properties of quantum states in\ncontinuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to\nexplore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states\ncan be characterised not only through the negative values of their Wigner\nfunction, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the\nrelated stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with\nthe question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum\ncorrelations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states\ncan be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian\nstate. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via\nspecific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum\nnon-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian\noperations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations.\nFinally, we will demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate\nBell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end\nof the Tutorial, we also provide an overview of several experimental\nrealisations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 19:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Recent approaches employing machine\nlearning (ML) showed improved performance than earlier ones, but these ML-\nbased approaches still have significant limitations. For example, most ML\napproaches can not incorporate sequential pattern analysis techniques key to\ndetect some classes of botnets. Another common shortcoming of ML-based\napproaches is the need to retrain neural networks in order to detect the\nevolving botnets; however, the training process is time-consuming and requires\nsignificant efforts to label the training data.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks using\nthree different instances of two popular categories of image translation: (1)\nSelfie-to-Anime and (2) Monet-to-Photo (image style transfer), and (3)\nSuper-Resolution (super resolution). Using standard performance metrics for\nGANs, we show that our attacks are effective. Furthermore, we conducted a large\nscale (125 participants) user study on Selfie-to-Anime and Monet-to-Photo to\nshow that human perception of the images produced by $F_V$ and $F_A$ can be\nconsidered equivalent, within an equivalence bound of Cohen's d = 0.3. Finally,\nwe show that existing defenses against model extraction attacks (watermarking,\nadversarial examples, poisoning) do not extend to image translation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 14:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 09:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Here the contribution of the\npresent work is twofold. First, the most popular methods to represent obstacles\nare summarized, namely the simple ellipsoidal representation, the constructive\nsolid geometry (CSG) method as well as a direct and an indirect implementation\nof a signed distance based approach. The formulations are characterized with\nrespect to the impact on the complexity of the optimization problem, as well as\nthe ability to meet different problem requirements.

In order to describe properties and evolution of slow MA and entropy\nwaves in various regimes of the misbalance, we obtained an exact analytical\nsolution of the linear evolutionary equation. Using the characteristic\ntimescales and the obtained exact solution, we identified regimes with\nqualitatively different behaviour of slow MA and entropy modes. For some of\nthose regimes, the spatio-temporal evolution of the initial Gaussian pulse is\nshown. In particular, it is shown that slow MA modes may have a range of\nnon-propagating harmonics. In this regime, perturbations caused by slow MA and\nentropy modes in a low-$\\beta$ plasma would look identically in observations,\nas non-propagating disturbances of the plasma density (and temperature) either\ngrowing or decaying with time. We also showed that the partition of the initial\nenergy between slow MA and entropy modes depends on the properties of the\nheating and cooling processes involved. The obtained exact analytical solution\ncould be further applied to the interpretation of observations and results of\nnumerical modelling of slow MA waves in the corona and the formation and\nevolution of coronal rain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 15:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

This addition allows us to consider long travel distances\nin a city for potential rioting population. This is achieved by introducing\npublic transport networks, which modifies the perceived travel distance between\nthe population and likely targets. Using this more general formulation, we\napplied the model to the typical Griffin and Ford pattern for population\ndistribution to describe the general features of most large Latin American\ncities. The possibility of long-range traveling by part of the general\npopulation has, for an immediate consequence, the existence of isolated spots\nmore prone to suffer from rioting activity, as they are easier to reach than\nthe rest of the city. These areas finally made it easier to control the\neventual disorder by part of police forces. The reason for this outcome is that\ntransport networks turn riots into highly localized and intense events. They\nare attracting a large police contingent, which will later extinguish the\nremaining disorder activity on the rest of the city. Therefore, working\ntransport networks in a city effectively reduces the number of police force\ncontingent required to control public disorder. This result, we must remark, is\nvalid only if the model requisites for order forces are satisfied: extra police\ncontingent can be added swiftly as required, and these forces can move around\nthe city with total freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 15:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The simulations are performed by coupling IDDES with the FW-H\nacoustic analogy, and the experiments are conducted in a rig consisting of a\nplenum chamber and a reverberation room. In contrast to typical tonal noise\nsources induced by the fan blades, we find out that another predominant source\nis the turbulence stemming from the gap between the fan shroud and the inlet\nduct. The turbulence evolves along with the shroud and is swept downstream to\ninteract with the top side of the blade leading edge. The interaction accounts\nfor uneven surface pressure distribution on the blades. Moreover, the pressure\nis significantly unsteady near the shroud. The power spectral density (PSD) of\nthe noise shows obvious tones at 273Hz that is approximately equal to the\ndifference of the blade passing frequency (BPF0) and the fan rotation\nfrequency. By coarsening the mesh resolution near the inlet gap and shroud, we\nartificially deactivate the gap turbulence in the numerical simulations and,\nconsequently, detect that the tone at 273Hz disappears completely. At this\nfrequency, the PSD contours of surface pressure fluctuations are found potent\nat the inlet gap and the blade top side only if the gap turbulence is resolved.\nThese findings indicate that the tonal noise source at 273Hz is the interaction\nbetween the gap turbulence and blades. As the gap turbulence exists near the\nshroud wall upstream of the blades, the rotating wall introduces rotational\nmomentum into the turbulence due to the wall friction. Hence the tonal\nfrequency of the interaction is smaller than BPF0 with a decrement of the fan\nrotation frequency. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that\nvoluteless centrifugal fans are studied for the noise generation from the gap\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 11:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

We augment boxes with a notion of resolution and\ndefine their clustering coverage, which is intuitively a quantitative metric\nthat indicates the abstraction quality. This allows studying the effect of\ndifferent clustering parameters on the constructed boxes and estimating an\ninterval of sub-optimal parameters.

Deep\nlearning helps to learn the behaviour of an entity through methods of\nrecognising and interpreting patterns. Despite its limitless potential, the\nmystery is how deep learning algorithms make a decision in the first place.\nExplainable AI (XAI) is the key to unlocking AI and the black-box for deep\nlearning. XAI is an AI model that is programmed to explain its goals, logic,\nand decision making so that the end users can understand. The end users can be\ndomain experts, regulatory agencies, managers and executive board members, data\nscientists, users that use AI, with or without awareness, or someone who is\naffected by the decisions of an AI model. Chest CT has emerged as a valuable\ntool for the clinical diagnostic and treatment management of the lung diseases\nassociated with COVID-19. AI can support rapid evaluation of CT scans to\ndifferentiate COVID-19 findings from other lung diseases. However, how these AI\ntools or deep learning algorithms reach such a decision and which are the most\ninfluential features derived from these neural networks with typically deep\nlayers are not clear. The aim of this study is to propose and develop XAI\nstrategies for COVID-19 classification models with an investigation of\ncomparison. The results demonstrate promising quantification and qualitative\nvisualisations that can further enhance the clinician's understanding and\ndecision making with more granular information from the results given by the\nlearned XAI models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 23:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

Therefore, a more precise but still simple modeling of their\ninfluence is pursued here. Simulations show good agreement with numerical\nimplementations.

The method consists in finding the equilibrated stress\nfield closest (in $L^2$-norm sense) to the measured non-equilibrated stress\nfield, via the solution of an optimization problem. The extraction of the\ndivergence-free (equilibrated) part of a general (non-equilibrated) field is\nperformed using the Hodge decomposition of a symmetric matrix field, which is\nthe generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition of a vector field into the\nsum of an irrotational field and a solenoidal field. The combination of: a) the\nEuler-Lagrange equations that solve the optimization problem, and b) the Hodge\ndecomposition, gives a differential expression that contains the bi-harmonic\noperator and two times the curl operator acting on the measured stress field.\nThese high-order derivatives can be efficiently performed in Fourier space. The\nmethod is applied to filter the non-equilibrated parts of a synthetic piecewise\nconstant stress fields with a known ground truth, and stress fields in Gum\nMetal, a beta-Ti-based alloy measured in-situ using Diffraction Contrast\nTomography (DCT). In both cases, the largest corrections were obtained near\ngrain boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 04:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}
