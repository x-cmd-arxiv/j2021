In this work, we\npropose several novel ideas for learned video compression which allow for\nimproved performance for the low-latency mode (I- and P-frames only) along with\na considerable increase in computational efficiency. In this setting, for\nnatural videos our approach compares favorably across the entire R-D curve\nunder metrics PSNR, MS-SSIM and VMAF against all mainstream video standards\n(H.264, H.265, AV1) and all ML codecs. At the same time, our approach runs at\nleast 5x faster and has fewer parameters than all ML codecs which report these\nfigures.\n  Our contributions include a flexible-rate framework allowing a single model\nto cover a large and dense range of bitrates, at a negligible increase in\ncomputation and parameter count; an efficient backbone optimized for ML-based\ncodecs; and a novel in-loop flow prediction scheme which leverages prior\ninformation towards more efficient compression.\n  We benchmark our method, which we call ELF-VC (Efficient, Learned and\nFlexible Video Coding) on popular video test sets UVG and MCL-JCV under metrics\nPSNR, MS-SSIM and VMAF. For example, on UVG under PSNR, it reduces the BD-rate\nby 44% against H.264, 26% against H.265, 15% against AV1, and 35% against the\ncurrent best ML codec.

Using a\nnormal mode streamwise and temporal expansion for flows in ducts with various\naspect ratios $B$ and non-trivial transverse velocity profiles, we calculate\ntwo-dimensional (2D) dispersion relations with associated eigenfunctions\nvarying in the 'crosswise' direction, in which the density varies, and the\nspanwise direction, both normal to the duct walls and to the flow direction. We\nalso compare these 2D dispersion relations to the so-called one-dimensional\n(1D) dispersion relation obtained for spanwise invariant perturbations, for\ndifferent aspect ratios $B$ and bulk Richardson numbers $Ri_b$. In this limited\nparameter space, the presence of lateral walls has a stabilizing effect.\nFurthermore, accounting for spanwise-varying perturbations results in a\nplethora of unstable modes, the number of which increases as the aspect ratio\nis increased. These modes present an odd-even regularity in their spatial\nstructures, which is rationalized by comparison to the so-called\none-dimensional oblique (1D-O) dispersion relation obtained for oblique waves.\nFinally, we show that in most cases, the most unstable 2D mode is the one that\noscillates the least in the spanwise direction, as a consequence of viscous\ndamping.

In a first part,\nwe review the paradigmatic model of a Rashba nanowire with strong spin-orbit\ninteraction (SOI) placed in a magnetic field and proximitized by a conventional\n$s$-wave superconductor. We identify the topological phase transition\nseparating the trivial phase from the topological phase and demonstrate how the\nexplicit Majorana wave functions can be obtained in the limit of strong SOI. In\na second part, we discuss MBSs engineered from proximitized edge states of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) topological insulators. We introduce the Jackiw-Rebbi\nmechanism leading to the emergence of bound states at mass domain walls and\nshow how this mechanism can be exploited to construct MBSs. Due to their recent\ninterest, we also include a discussion of Majorana corner states in 2D\nsecond-order topological superconductors. This Tutorial is mainly aimed at\ngraduate students -- both theorists and experimentalists -- seeking to\nfamiliarize themselves with some of the basic concepts in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 16:24:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Applications\nsuch as linear colliders and free-electron lasers (FELs) require high energy\nand energy efficiency, but also high stability and beam quality. The latter\nincludes low energy spread, which can be achieved by precise beam loading of\nthe plasma wakefield using longitudinally shaped bunches, resulting in\nefficient and uniform acceleration. However, the plasma wavelength, which sets\nthe scale for the region of very large accelerating fields to be 100 {\\mu}m or\nsmaller, requires bunches to be synchronized and shaped with extreme temporal\nprecision, typically on the femtosecond scale. Here, a self-correction\nmechanism is introduced, greatly reducing the susceptibility to jitter. Using\nmultiple accelerating stages, each with a small bunch compression between them,\nalmost any initial bunch, regardless of current profile or injection phase,\nwill self-correct into the current profile that flattens the wakefield, damping\nthe relative energy spread and any energy offsets. As a consequence, staging\ncan be used not only to reach high energies, but also to produce the exquisite\nbeam quality and stability required for a variety of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 16:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

In\ntransformation elasticity, a general curvilinear change of coordinates\ntransforms conventional Hooke's law into a different constitutive law in which\nthe transformed material is not only anisotropic but also polar and chiral and\nno known elastic solid satisfies. However, this state-of-the-art description\nprovides no insight as to what the underlying microstructure of this\ntransformed material could be, the design of which is a major challenge in this\nfield. The study aims to theoretically justify the fundamental need for the\npolar material by critically revisiting the discrete transformation method. The\nkey idea is to let transformation gradient operate not only on the elastic\nproperties but on the underlying architectures of the mechanical lattice. As an\noutstanding application, we leverage the proposed design paradigm to physically\nconstruct a polar lattice metamaterial for the observation of elastic carpet\ncloaking. Numerical simulations are then implemented to show excellent cloaking\nperformance under different static and dynamic mechanical loads.

Such analyses are crucial to model complex patient\ntrajectories and are increasingly being used in epidemiological and health\neconomic settings. Multi-state models often make the Markov assumption, whereby\nan individual's future trajectory is dependent only upon their present state,\nnot their past. In reality, there may be transitional dependence upon either\nprevious events and/or more than one timescale, for example time since entry to\nthe current or previous state(s). The aim of this study was to develop an\nillness-death Weibull model allowing for multiple timescales to impact the\nfuture risk of death. Following this, we evaluated the performance of the\nmultiple timescale model against a Markov illness-death model in a set of\nplausible simulation scenarios when the Markov assumption was violated. Guided\nby a study in breast cancer, data were simulated from Weibull baseline\ndistributions, with hazard functions dependent on single and multiple\ntimescales. Markov and non-Markov models were fitted to account for/ignore the\nunderlying data structure. Ignoring the presence of multiple timescales led to\nbias in underlying transition rates between states and associated covariate\neffects, while transition probabilities and lengths of stay were fairly\nrobustly estimated. Further work may be needed to evaluate different estimands\nor more complex multi-state models. Software implementations in Stata are also\ndescribed for simulating and estimating multiple timescale multi-state models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 16:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

Surprisingly, the axioms\nof cardinal welfare (malfare) dictate that this is not equivalent to simply\ndefining utility as negative loss. Building upon these concepts, we define\nfair-PAC (FPAC) learning, where an FPAC learner is an algorithm that learns an\n$\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ malfare-optimal model with bounded sample complexity,\nfor any data distribution, and for any (axiomatically justified) malfare\nconcept. Finally, we show broad conditions under which, with appropriate\nmodifications, standard PAC-learners may be converted to FPAC learners. This\nplaces FPAC learning on firm theoretical ground, as it yields statistical and\ncomputational efficiency guarantees for many well-studied machine-learning\nmodels, and is also practically relevant, as it democratizes fair ML by\nproviding concrete training algorithms and rigorous generalization guarantees\nfor these models\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 17:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

Event-based sensing can present\nsignificant improvements in power efficiency when compared to traditional\nsampling, because (1) the output is a stream of events where the important\ninformation lies in the timing of the events, and (2) the sensor can easily be\ncontrolled to output information only when interesting activity occurs at the\ninput.\n  Moreover, event-based sampling can often provide better resolution than\nstandard uniform sampling. Not only does this occur because individual\nevent-based sensors have higher temporal resolution, it also occurs because the\nasynchrony of events allows for less redundant and more informative encoding.\nWe would like to explain how such curious results come about.\n  To do so, we use ideal time encoding machines as a proxy for event-based\nsensors. We explore time encoding of signals with low rank structure, and apply\nthe resulting theory to video.

Most of them require that\nsensitive attributes are available during training to learn fair models.\nHowever, in many real-world applications, it is usually infeasible to obtain\nthe sensitive attributes due to privacy or legal issues, which challenges\nexisting fair-ensuring strategies. Though the sensitive attribute of each data\nsample is unknown, we observe that there are usually some non-sensitive\nfeatures in the training data that are highly correlated with sensitive\nattributes, which can be used to alleviate the bias.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a circuit-based\napproach for training a reinforcement learning agent on quantum control tasks\nin a model-free way. Given a continuously parameterized control circuit, the\nagent learns its parameters through trial-and-error interaction with the\nquantum system, using measurement outcomes as the only source of information\nabout the quantum state.

The derived SBs demonstrate an unexpected\nset of properties, including decomposition into two disjoint zones in the IC\nplane for a certain range of parameters. The latter peculiarity stems from two\nqualitatively different escape mechanisms on the RM.

The most significant results of our\ninvestigation are: 1. The primary X-ray emission from the corona is constant in\nthese observations, both in terms of the power law slope ($\\Gamma=1.80$) and\nluminosity ($L_{2-10 \\rm keV}= 2.55\\times 10^{44} $ erg/s). 2.

The vanishing of the\nCompton hump in 2016 can probably be explained by a dynamic clumpy torus which\nis infalling/outflowing, or by a polar torus wind. B. The torus in this AGN\npossibly has two structures: an equatorial toroidal disk (producing the narrow\nFeK$\\alpha$ emission) and a polar component (producing the variable Compton\nhump), C.

Demand is a function of many complex and nonlinear\nfeatures such as neighborhood composition, real-time events, and seasonality.\nRecent advances in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have had promising\nresults as they build a graphical representation of a system and harness the\npotential of deep learning architectures. However, there has been limited work\nusing GCNs in a temporal setting to model dynamic dependencies of the network.\nFurther, within the context of urban environments, there has been no prior work\nusing dynamic GCNs to support venue demand analysis and prediction. In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning framework which aims to better model\nthe popularity and growth of urban venues. Using a longitudinal dataset from\nlocation technology platform Foursquare, we model individual venues and venue\ntypes across London and Paris. First, representing cities as connected networks\nof venues, we quantify their structure and note a strong community structure in\nthese retail networks, an observation that highlights the interplay of\ncooperative and competitive forces that emerge in local ecosystems of retail\nbusinesses. Next, we present our deep learning architecture which integrates\nboth spatial and topological features into a temporal model which predicts the\ndemand of a venue at the subsequent time-step. Our experiments demonstrate that\nour model can learn spatio-temporal trends of venue demand and consistently\noutperform baseline models. Relative to state-of-the-art deep learning models,\nour model reduces the RSME by ~ 28% in London and ~ 13% in Paris. Our approach\nhighlights the power of complex network measures and GCNs in building\nprediction models for urban environments. The model could have numerous\napplications within the retail sector to better model venue demand and growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 20:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

The stochastic and intermittent\nfeatures of variable DERs such as roof top photovoltaic (PV) bring substantial\nuncertainties to the grid on the consumer end and weaken the grid reliability.\nIn addition, the fact that numerous DERs are widespread in the grid makes it\nhard to monitor and manage DERs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes\na novel real-time grid-supporting energy management (GSEM) strategy for\ngrid-supporting microgrid (MG). This strategy can not only properly manage DERs\nin a MG but also enable DERs to provide grid services, which enables a MG to be\ngrid-supporting via flexible trading power. The proposed GSEM strategy is based\non a 2-step optimization which includes a routine economic dispatch (ED) step\nand an acceptable trading power range determination step. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed GSEM strategy which enables the\ngrid operator to have a dispatch choice of trading power with MG and enhance\nthe reliability and resilience of the main grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 20:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

We consider finite\ntype, state, and action spaces. On the individual agent level, the state\nevolves in discrete-time as the agent participates in interactions, in which\nthe state transitions are affected by the agent's individual action and the\ndistribution of other agents' states and actions. On the societal level, we\nconsider that the agents form a continuum of mass and that interactions occur\neither synchronously or asynchronously, and derive models for the evolution of\nthe agents' state distribution.

Large\nsamples of student errors and fixes are now available, offering the possibility\nof data-driven machine-learning approaches to help students fix syntax errors.\nCurrent machine-learning approaches do a reasonable job fixing syntax errors in\nshorter programs, but don't work as well even for moderately longer programs.\nWe introduce SYNFIX, a machine-learning based tool that substantially improves\non the state-of-the-art, by learning to use compiler diagnostics, employing a\nvery large neural model that leverages unsupervised pre-training, and relying\non multi-label classification rather than autoregressive synthesis to generate\nthe (repaired) output. We describe SYNFIX's architecture in detail, and provide\na detailed evaluation. We have built SYNFIX into a free, open-source version of\nVisual Studio Code; we make all our source code and models freely available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 21:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 19:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

In this work, we propose a transition-based\nsystem that combines hard-attention over sentences with a target-side action\npointer mechanism to decouple source tokens from node representations and\naddress alignments. We model the transitions as well as the pointer mechanism\nthrough straightforward modifications within a single Transformer architecture.\nParser state and graph structure information are efficiently encoded using\nattention heads.

To do\nthe latter case, we introduce an ultracollinear-soft mode, allowing us to resum\nlarge logarithms of $E_JR/m$. Finally, as an application we calculate the rate\nfor $e^+e^-$ collisions to produce a heavy quark jet in the endpoint region,\nwhere we show that grooming effects have a sizable contribution near the\nendpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 02:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

To achieve accurate localization, a high photoacoustic signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is required. However, this is not guaranteed for deep targets, as\noptical scattering causes an exponential decay in optical fluence with respect\nto tissue depth. To address this, we develop a novel deep learning method\ndesigned to explicitly exhibit robustness to noise present in photoacoustic\nradio-frequency (RF) data. More precisely, we describe and evaluate a deep\nneural network architecture consisting of a shared encoder and two parallel\ndecoders. One decoder extracts the target coordinates from the input RF data\nwhile the other boosts the SNR and estimates clean RF data. The joint\noptimization of the shared encoder and dual decoders lends significant noise\nrobustness to the features extracted by the encoder, which in turn enables the\nnetwork to contain detailed information about deep targets that may be obscured\nby noise. Additional custom layers and newly proposed regularizers in the\ntraining loss function (designed based on observed RF data signal and noise\nbehavior) serve to increase the SNR in the cleaned RF output and improve model\nperformance. To account for depth-dependent strong optical scattering, our\nnetwork was trained with simulated photoacoustic datasets of targets embedded\nat different depths inside tissue media of different scattering levels. The\nnetwork trained on this novel dataset accurately locates targets in\nexperimental PA data that is clinically relevant with respect to the\nlocalization of vessels, needles, or brachytherapy seeds. We verify the merits\nof the proposed architecture by outperforming the state of the art on both\nsimulated and experimental datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 01:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

The material\nproperties of FG sandwich beam change continuously from one surface to another\naccording to a power-law function. Three common configurations of FG beams are\nused for the study, namely: (a) single layer FG beam; (b) sandwich beam with FG\nface sheets and homogeneous core and (c) sandwich beams with homogeneous face\nsheets and FG core. The governing equations derived herein are solved by\nemploying the finite element method using a two-noded beam element, developed\nfor this purpose.

Hate speech is a\nmultidimensional issue, strongly dependant on language and cultural factors.\nDespite its relevance, research on this topic has been almost exclusively\ndevoted to English. Most supervised learning resources, such as labeled\ndatasets and NLP tools, have been created for this same language. Considering\nthat a large portion of users worldwide speak in languages other than English,\nthere is an important need for creating efficient approaches for multilingual\nhate speech detection. In this work we propose to address the problem of\nmultilingual hate speech detection from the perspective of transfer learning.\nOur goal is to determine if knowledge from one particular language can be used\nto classify other language, and to determine effective ways to achieve this. We\npropose a hate specific data representation and evaluate its effectiveness\nagainst general-purpose universal representations most of which, unlike our\nproposed model, have been trained on massive amounts of data.

Specifically, we add soft\nconstraints on aligned entity pairs and neighbours to the existing knowledge\nrepresentation learning methods. To handle the problem of possible distribution\ndifferences between teacher and target knowledge graphs, we introduce an\nadversarial adaption module. The discriminator of this module evaluates the\ndegree of consistency between the embeddings of an aligned entity pair. The\nconsistency score is then used as the weights of soft constraints. It is not\nnecessary to acquire the relations and triplets in teacher knowledge graphs\nbecause we only utilize the entity representations. Knowledge graph completion\nresults show that ATransN achieves better performance against baselines without\ntransfer on three datasets, CN3l, WK3l, and DWY100k.

Objectives: We sought to draw on practitioner\ninsights and experiences in order to classify the effects of agile method use\non technical debt management. We explore the breadth of practitioners'\nknowledge about technical debt; how technical debt is manifested across the\nsoftware process; and the perceived effects of common agile software\ndevelopment practices and processes on technical debt. In doing so, we address\na research gap in technical debt knowledge and provide novel and actionable\nmanagerial recommendations. Method: We designed, tested and executed a\nmulti-national survey questionnaire to address our objectives, receiving 184\nresponses from practitioners in Brazil, Finland, and New Zealand. Results: Our\nfindings indicate that: 1) Practitioners are aware of technical debt, although,\nthere was under utilization of the concept, 2) Technical debt commonly resides\nin legacy systems, however, concrete instances of technical debt are hard to\nconceptualize which makes it problematic to manage, 3) Queried agile practices\nand processes help to reduce technical debt; particularly, techniques that\nverify and maintain the structure and clarity of implemented artifacts.\nConclusions: The fact that technical debt instances tend to have\ncharacteristics in common means that a systematic approach to its management is\nfeasible.

We propose a novel\nLocally Invertible Embedding for point cloud adaptive sampling and recovery\n(PointLIE). Instead of learning to predict the underlying geometry details in a\nseemingly plausible manner, PointLIE unifies point cloud sampling and\nupsampling to one single framework through bi-directional learning.\nSpecifically, PointLIE recursively samples and adjusts neighboring points on\neach scale. Then it encodes the neighboring offsets of sampled points to a\nlatent space and thus decouples the sampled points and the corresponding local\ngeometric relationship. Once the latent space is determined and that the deep\nmodel is optimized, the recovery process could be conducted by passing the\nrecover-pleasing sampled points and a randomly-drawn embedding to the same\nnetwork through an invertible operation. Such a scheme could guarantee the\nfidelity of dense point recovery from sampled points.

The\ncore of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic\nentity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time\ncoherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered\nrepresentation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the\ndynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide\nrange.

The effectiveness of the logic is demonstrated\nby its applications in the verification of quantum teleportation and local\nimplementation of non-local CNOT gates, two important algorithms widely used in\ndistributed quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

It is often assumed that regular pilots (RP), where\na fraction of the time-frequency resources is reserved for pilots, suffices to\nprovide high SE. However, the SE is limited by the pilot overhead and pilot\ncontamination. An alternative is superimposed pilots (SP) where all resources\nare used for pilots and data. This removes the pilot overhead and reduces pilot\ncontamination by using longer pilots. However, SP suffers from data\ninterference that reduces the SE gains. This paper proposes the Massive-MIMO\nIterative Channel Estimation and Decoding (MICED) algorithm where partially\ndecoded data is used as side-information to improve the channel estimation and\nincrease SE. We show that users with precise data estimates can help users with\npoor data estimates to decode. Numerical results with QPSK modulation and LDPC\ncodes show that the MICED algorithm increases the SE and reduces the\nblock-error-rate with RP and SP compared to conventional methods. The MICED\nalgorithm with SP delivers the highest SE and it is especially effective in\nscenarios with short coherence blocks like high mobility or high frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

We show that with $D_{2d}$\nlittle co-group at a non-time-reversal-invariant-momentum point, the phononic\nnodal chain is guaranteed to exist owing to the vector basis symmetry of\nphonons, which is a unique character distinct from electronic and other\nsystems. Combined with the spinless character, this makes the proposed\nnodal-chain phonons enforced by symmorphic crystal symmetries. We further\nscreen all 230 space groups, and find five candidate groups. Interestingly, the\nnodal chains in these five groups exhibit two different patterns: for\ntetragonal systems, they are one-dimensional along the fourfold axis; for cubic\nsystems, they form a three-dimensional network structure. Based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we identify K$_{2}$O as a realistic material\nhosting almost ideal nodal-chain phonons. We show that the effect of LO-TO\nsplitting, another unique feature for phonons, helps to expose the nodal-chain\nphonons in K$_{2}$O in a large energy window. In addition, all the five\ncandidate groups have spacetime inversion symmetry, so the nodal chains also\nfeature a quantized $\\pi$ Berry phase. This leads to drumhead surface phonon\nmodes that must exist on multiple surfaces of a sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 08:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

The\nprevious works adopt either individual point-based features or\nlocal-neighboring voxel-based features to process 3D model, which limits the\nperformance of models due to the inefficient computation. Moreover, most of the\nexisting 3D deep learning frameworks aim at solving one specific task, and only\na few of them can handle a variety of tasks. Integrating both the advantages of\nthe voxel and point-based methods, the proposed MVPConv can effectively\nincrease the neighboring collection between point-based features and also\npromote the independence among voxel-based features. Simply replacing the\ncorresponding convolution module with MVPConv, we show that MVPConv can fit in\ndifferent backbones to solve a wide range of 3D tasks. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets such as ShapeNet Part, S3DIS and KITTI for various tasks\nshow that MVPConv improves the accuracy of the backbone (PointNet) by up to\n36%, and achieves higher accuracy than the voxel-based model with up to 34\ntimes speedup. In addition, MVPConv also outperforms the state-of-the-art\npoint-based models with up to 8 times speedup.

RDO serves well for optimization of codec\nperformance for evaluation of the results in terms of PSNR. However, it is well\nknown that the PSNR does not correlate well with perceptual evaluation of\nimages; hence, RDO is not well suited for perceptual optimization of codecs.\nRecently, rate-distortion-perception trade-off has been formalized by taking\nthe Kullback-Leibner (KL) divergence between the distributions of the original\nand reconstructed images as a perception measure. Learned image compression\nmethods that simultaneously optimize rate, mean-square loss, VGG loss, and an\nadversarial loss were proposed.

To fill\nthis gap, in this paper, we propose RobustFusion, a robust volumetric\nperformance reconstruction system for human-object interaction scenarios using\nonly a single RGBD sensor, which combines various data-driven visual and\ninteraction cues to handle the complex interaction patterns and severe\nocclusions. We propose a semantic-aware scene decoupling scheme to model the\nocclusions explicitly, with a segmentation refinement and robust object\ntracking to prevent disentanglement uncertainty and maintain temporal\nconsistency. We further introduce a robust performance capture scheme with the\naid of various data-driven cues, which not only enables re-initialization\nability, but also models the complex human-object interaction patterns in a\ndata-driven manner. To this end, we introduce a spatial relation prior to\nprevent implausible intersections, as well as data-driven interaction cues to\nmaintain natural motions, especially for those regions under severe\nhuman-object occlusions. We also adopt an adaptive fusion scheme for temporally\ncoherent human-object reconstruction with occlusion analysis and human parsing\ncue.

Our\nanalysis exhibits that an increasing or large enough \"momentum\" parameter for\nthe first-order moment used in practice is sufficient to ensure Adam and its\nmany variants converge under a mild boundness condition on the adaptive scaling\nfactor of the step size. In contrast, the original problematic analysis of Adam\nuses a momentum parameter that decreases to zero, which is the key reason that\nmakes it diverge on some problems.

In a multi-function model (Parno,\nRaykova, Vaikuntanathan; TCC'12) of verifiable computation, the process of\nencoding function and the process of preparing input are decoupled such that\nany client can freely submit a computation request on its input, without having\nto generate an encoding of the function in advance. In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-matrix verifiable computation scheme that allows the secure outsourcing\nof the matrix functions over a finite field. Our scheme is outsourceable. When\nit is used to outsource $m$ linear functions, the scheme is roughly $m$ times\nfaster and has less communication cost than the previously best known scheme by\nFiore and Gennaro (CCS'12), both in the client-side computation and in the\nserver-side computation.

One important difference in the presence of a\nfield is the Lorentz force acting on the nuclei, which can be decomposed as the\nsum of the bare nuclear Lorentz force and a screening force due to the\nelectrons. This screening force is calculated from the Berry curvature and can\nchange the dynamics qualitatively. It is therefore important to include the\ncontributions from the Berry curvature in molecular dynamics simulations in a\nmagnetic field. In this work, we present a scheme for calculating the Berry\ncurvature numerically, by a finite-difference technique, addressing challenges\nrelated to the arbitrary global phase of the wave function.

Each system level development is designed\nto solve different aspects of the action recognition problem including online\nreal-time processing, action segmentation and the involvement of objects. The\nanalysis of the experimental results are illustrated and described in six\narticles. The proposed action recognition architecture of this thesis is\ncomposed of several processing layers including a preprocessing layer, an\nordered vector representation layer and three layers of neural networks. It\nutilizes self-organizing neural networks such as Kohonen feature maps and\ngrowing grids as the main neural network layers. Thus the architecture presents\na biological plausible approach with certain features such as topographic\norganization of the neurons, lateral interactions, semi-supervised learning and\nthe ability to represent high dimensional input space in lower dimensional\nmaps. For each level of development the system is trained with the input data\nconsisting of consecutive 3D body postures and tested with generalized input\ndata that the system has never met before. The experimental results of\ndifferent system level developments show that the system performs well with\nquite high accuracy for recognizing human actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 09:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

Straightforward\npairwise registration of neighbouring sections yields smooth reconstructions\nbut has well-known problems such as ``banana effect'' (straightening of curved\nstructures) and ``z-shift'' (drift). While these problems can be alleviated\nwith an external, linearly aligned reference (e.g., Magnetic Resonance (MR)\nimages), registration is often inaccurate due to contrast differences and the\nstrong nonlinear distortion of the tissue, including artefacts such as folds\nand tears. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model of spatial\ndeformation that yields reconstructions for multiple histological stains that\nthat are jointly smooth, robust to outliers, and follow the reference shape.\nThe model relies on a spanning tree of latent transforms connecting all the\nsections and slices of the reference volume, and assumes that the registration\nbetween any pair of images can be see as a noisy version of the composition of\n(possibly inverted) latent transforms connecting the two images. Bayesian\ninference is used to compute the most likely latent transforms given a set of\npairwise registrations between image pairs within and across modalities. The\nframework is used for accurate 3D reconstruction of two stains (Nissl and\nparvalbumin) from the Allen human brain atlas, showing its benefits on real\ndata with severe distortions.

We show the\nsimplified free-axis selection method has better expressibility against other\nstructural optimization methods when measured with Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence. We also demonstrate PQCs with free-axis selection are more\neffective to search the ground states of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and\ncombinatorial optimization.

This reduction of the bound polarization by\nthe MT pulse is less efficient than predicted by the differential B1-square law\nof absorption. Thus, B1 inhomogeneities lead to a residual bias in the MT\nsaturation maps. We derive a heuristic correction to reduce this bias for a\nwidely used multi-parameter mapping protocol at 3T. Methods: The amplitude of\nthe MT pulse was varied via the nominal flip angle to mimic variations in B1.\nThe MT saturation's dependence on the actual flip angle features a linear\ncorrection term, which was determined separately for gray and white matter.\nResults: The deviation of MT saturation from differential B1-square law is well\ndescribed by a linear decrease with the actual flip angle of the MT pulse. This\ndecrease showed no significant differences between gray and white matter. Thus,\nthe post hoc correction does not need to take different tissue types into\naccount. Bias-corrected MT saturation maps appeared more symmetric and\nhighlighted highly myelinated tracts. Discussion: Our correction involves a\ncalibration that is specific for the MT pulse.

We visualize the spatial\ndistribution of the weights after training to discuss the number and positions\nof the output electrodes by arranging them at grid points, equiangularly\ncircular points or at random. We evaluate the classification accuracy by\nchanging the number of the output electrodes, and find that a high accuracy\n($>$ 90\\%) is achieved with only several tens of output electrodes regardless\nof grid, circular or random arrangement. These results suggest that the spin\nwaves possess sufficiently complex and rich dynamics for this type of tasks.\nThen we investigate in which area useful information is distributed more by\narranging the electrodes locally on the chip. Finally, we show that this device\nhas generalization ability for input wave-signal frequency in a certain\nfrequency range. These results will lead to practical design of spin-wave\nreservoir devices for low-power intelligent computing in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 11:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for the applications of smart\ncities, i.e., intelligent traffic management and urban planning.

To address the\nabove challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel traffic prediction\nframework, named Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN). In\nDGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic\ncharacteristics from node attributes, while the parameters of dynamic filters\nare generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use\nthem to generate a dynamic graph, which is integrated with a pre-defined static\ngraph. As far as we know, we are the first to employ a generation method to\nmodel fine topology of dynamic graph at each time step. Further, to enhance\nefficiency and performance, we employ a training strategy for DGCRN by\nrestricting the iteration number of decoder during forward and backward\npropagation.

These materials do not behave as\nconventional brittle, linear elastic materials and the transition between these\ntwo regimes cannot usually be described using poro-elastic models. Furthermore,\nconventional geotechnical sampling techniques often result in the destruction\nof the cementation and recovery of sufficient intact core is, therefore,\ndifficult. This paper studies a numerical model that allows us to introduce\nweak consolidation in granular packs. The model, based on the LIGGGHTS open\nsource project, simply adds an attractive contribution to particles in contact.\nThis simple model allow us to reproduce key elements of the behaviour of the\nstress observed in compacted sands and clay, as well as in poorly consolidated\nsandstones. The paper finishes by inspecting the effect of different\nconsolidation levels in fluid-driven fracture behaviour. Numerical results are\ncompared against experimental results on bio-cemented sandstones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 11:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Missing data imputation has been a long-standing research\ntopic and critical application for real-world intelligent transportation\nsystems. A widely applied imputation method is low-rank matrix/tensor\ncompletion; however, the low-rank assumption only preserves the global\nstructure while ignores the strong local consistency in spatiotemporal data. In\nthis paper, we propose a low-rank autoregressive tensor completion (LATC)\nframework by introducing \\textit{temporal variation} as a new regularization\nterm into the completion of a third-order (sensor $\\times$ time of day $\\times$\nday) tensor. The third-order tensor structure allows us to better capture the\nglobal consistency of traffic data, such as the inherent seasonality and\nday-to-day similarity. To achieve local consistency, we design the temporal\nvariation by imposing an AR($p$) model for each time series with coefficients\nas learnable parameters. Different from previous spatial and temporal\nregularization schemes, the minimization of temporal variation can better\ncharacterize temporal generative mechanisms beyond local smoothness, allowing\nus to deal with more challenging scenarios such \"blackout\" missing. To solve\nthe optimization problem in LATC, we introduce an alternating minimization\nscheme that estimates the low-rank tensor and autoregressive coefficients\niteratively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on several real-world\ntraffic data sets, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LATC in\ndiverse missing scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 12:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Their form is constantly evolving, reflecting\nchanging human needs and local contingencies, manifested in space by many urban\npatterns. Urban Morphology laid the foundation for understanding many such\npatterns, largely relying on qualitative research methods to extract distinct\nspatial identities of urban areas. However, the manual, labour-intensive and\nsubjective nature of such approaches represents an impediment to the\ndevelopment of a scalable, replicable and data-driven urban form\ncharacterisation. Recently, advances in Geographic Data Science and the\navailability of digital mapping products, open the opportunity to overcome such\nlimitations. And yet, our current capacity to systematically capture the\nheterogeneity of spatial patterns remains limited in terms of spatial\nparameters included in the analysis and hardly scalable due to the highly\nlabour-intensive nature of the task. In this paper, we present a method for\nnumerical taxonomy of urban form derived from biological systematics, which\nallows the rigorous detection and classification of urban types. Initially, we\nproduce a rich numerical characterisation of urban space from minimal data\ninput, minimizing limitations due to inconsistent data quality and\navailability. These are street network, building footprint, and morphological\ntessellation, a spatial unit derivative of Voronoi tessellation, obtained from\nbuilding footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous urban tissue types and, by\ndetermining overall morphological similarity between them, generate a\nhierarchical classification of urban form.

The Sun's complex corona is the source of the solar wind and\ninterplanetary magnetic field. While the large scale morphology is well\nunderstood, the impact of variations in coronal properties on the scale of a\nfew degrees on properties of the interplanetary medium is not known. Solar\nOrbiter, carrying both remote sensing and in situ instruments into the inner\nsolar system, is intended to make these connections better than ever before.\nAims. We combine remote sensing and in situ measurements from Solar Orbiter's\nfirst perihelion at 0.5 AU to study the fine scale structure of the solar wind\nfrom the equatorward edge of a polar coronal hole with the aim of identifying\ncharacteristics of the corona which can explain the in situ variations.\nMethods. We use in situ measurements of the magnetic field, density and solar\nwind speed to identify structures on scales of hours at the spacecraft. Using\nPotential Field Source Surface mapping we estimate the source locations of the\nmeasured solar wind as a function of time and use EUI images to characterise\nthese solar sources. Results. We identify small scale stream interactions in\nthe solar wind with compressed magnetic field and density along with speed\nvariations which are associated with corrugations in the edge of the coronal\nhole on scales of several degrees, demonstrating that fine scale coronal\nstructure can directly influence solar wind properties and drive variations\nwithin individual streams. Conclusions. This early analysis already\ndemonstrates the power of Solar Orbiter's combined remote sensing and in situ\npayload and shows that with future, closer perihelia it will be possible\ndramatically to improve our knowledge of the coronal sources of fine scale\nsolar wind structure, which is important both for understanding the phenomena\ndriving the solar wind and predicting its impacts at the Earth and elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 12:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

The first aim of this work was to compile all stars and\nbrown dwarfs within 10 pc observable by Gaia, and compare it with the Gaia\nCatalogue of Nearby Stars as a quality assurance test. We complement the list\nto get a full 10 pc census, including bright stars, brown dwarfs, and\nexoplanets. We started our compilation from a query on all objects with a\nparallax larger than 100 mas using SIMBAD. We completed the census by adding\ncompanions, brown dwarfs with recent parallax measurements not in SIMBAD yet,\nand vetted exoplanets. The compilation combines astrometry and photometry from\nthe recent Gaia Early Data Release 3 with literature magnitudes, spectral types\nand line-of-sight velocities. We give a description of the astrophysical\ncontent of the 10 pc sample.

Control-flow hijacks can\nbe performed using classical software vulnerabilities, physical fault attacks,\nor software-induced fault attacks. To cope with this threat and to protect the\ncontrol-flow, dedicated countermeasures are needed. To counteract control-flow\nhijacks, control-flow integrity~(CFI) aims to be a generic solution. However,\nsoftware-based CFI typically either protects against software or fault attacks,\nbut not against both.

Although the impact may not be uniform over a region of\ninterest owing to the heterogeneity of travel demand distribution and network\nconfiguration, few studies have debated such impact at a local scale, such as\nin transportation analysis zones (TAZs). To understand the impact in relation\nto geographical situations, this study aims to estimate the impacts of SAVs at\nthe local scale by simulating their operation on a developed simulator. Using\nthe mainland of Okinawa, Japan as a case study, it was found that parking\ndemand was reduced the most in residence-dominant zones in terms of quantity\nand in office-dominant zones in terms of proportion. As a side effect of\nreplacing private vehicles with SAVs, empty fleets increase congestion,\nparticularly at the periphery of the city.

Among several possibilities,\nAC-line-emulation control has been highlighted as an simple-but-useful\nalternative for these type of systems. With this strategy, the power flow\nthrough the link is controlled proportionally to the angle difference between\nits two AC terminals and this provides self-adaptation of the power flow in\ncase of contingencies in the parallel AC lines, naturally.

The proposed solution includes a two-layer\npredictor to compensate for the time-delay in the servo-system and angle\ncontrol loops.

Also, the proposed method accommodates multiple obstacles and\ndecouples the control structure from the obstacles' shape, count, and\ndistribution.

We show by mathematical modeling that cell\npolarization requires detailed balance to be broken, and we quantify the\nfree-energy cost of maintaining a polarized state of the cell. Our study\nreveals that detailed balance cannot only be broken via the active transport of\nproteins along filaments, but also via a chemical modification cycle, allowing\ndetailed balance to be broken by the shuttling of proteins between the\nfilament, membrane, and cytosol. Our model thus shows that cell polarization\ncan be established via two distinct driving mechanisms, one based on active\ntransport and one based on non-equilibrium binding.

Our work not only contributes to the\nunderstanding of the equilibrium properties of long-range interacting quantum\nIsing models, but can also be important for addressing fundamental dynamical\naspects, such as issues concerning the open question of thermalization in such\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 15:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 20:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We develop a\nframework to measure rounding error in a climate model which provides a\nstress-test for a low-precision version of the model, and we apply our method\nto a variety of models including the Lorenz system; a shallow water\napproximation for flow over a ridge; and a coarse resolution global atmospheric\nmodel with simplified parameterisations (SPEEDY). Although double precision (52\nsignificant bits) is standard across operational climate models, in our\nexperiments we find that single precision (23 sbits) is more than enough and\nthat as low as half precision (10 sbits) is often sufficient. For example,\nSPEEDY can be run with 12 sbits across the entire code with negligible rounding\nerror and this can be lowered to 10 sbits if very minor errors are accepted,\namounting to less than 0.1 mm/6hr for the average grid-point precipitation, for\nexample. Our test is based on the Wasserstein metric and this provides\nstringent non-parametric bounds on rounding error accounting for annual means\nas well as extreme weather events. In addition, by testing models using both\nround-to-nearest (RN) and stochastic rounding (SR) we find that SR can mitigate\nrounding error across a range of applications. Thus our results also provide\nevidence that SR could be relevant to next-generation climate models. While\nmany studies have shown that low-precision arithmetic can be suitable on\nshort-term weather forecasting timescales, our results give the first evidence\nthat a similar low precision level can be suitable for climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 15:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

These simulators usually require\ndedicated software development and maintenance, and suffer low efficiency from\na runtime and memory standpoint.

In this paper, we describe a\ngradient-based deep neural network (GDNN) constrained by the physics related to\nmultiphase flow in porous media. We tackle the nonlinearity of flow in porous\nmedia induced by rock heterogeneity, fluid properties and fluid-rock\ninteractions by decomposing the nonlinear PDEs into a dictionary of elementary\ndifferential operators. We use a combination of operators to handle rock\nspatial heterogeneity and fluid flow by advection.

However, one limitation of\nthe most of graph-based methods is that they assume the graph structure to\noperate is fixed and reliable. And there are inevitably some edges in the graph\nthat are not conducive to graph clustering, which we call spurious edges. This\npaper is the first attempt to employ graph pooling technique for node\nclustering and we propose a novel dual graph embedding network (DGEN), which is\ndesigned as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer to\nlearn the graph embedding. In our model, it is assumed that if a node and its\nnearest neighboring node are close to the same clustering center, this node is\nan informative node and this edge can be considered as a cluster-friendly edge.\nBased on this assumption, the neighbor cluster pooling (NCPool) is devised to\nselect the most informative subset of nodes and the corresponding edges based\non the distance of nodes and their nearest neighbors to the cluster centers.\nThis can effectively alleviate the impact of the spurious edges on the\nclustering. Finally, to obtain the clustering assignment of all nodes, a\nclassifier is trained using the clustering results of the selected nodes.\nExperiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 06:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 02:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

The\nmodel fully leverages the spatial topology predictive capability of\nconvolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient\ncontinuity-based smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial\ncontinuity. Furthermore, the transient regions are penalized to steer the\ntraining process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these\nregions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid\nproperties and well controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of\nthe state variables (pressure and saturation). While maintaining the continuity\nof fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing\ntraining cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training\ndata samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is\nseparately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on\nthe predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the\nexample of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the\nphysics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based\nsimulation data and emulates the physics process. The model performs prediction\nwith a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the\naverage temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%\nand 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently\npredicted by a surrogate model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than\n5%. Therefore, with its unique scheme to cope with the fidelity in fluid flow\nin porous media, the physics-constrained deep learning model can become an\nefficient predictive model for computationally demanding inverse problems or\nother coupled processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 02:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

It is well understood that CDF characterizes the arrival\nrate of a stochastic point process modeling core damage events. However,\nconsequences of the assumptions imposed on this stochastic process as a\ncomputational necessity are often overlooked. Herein, we revisit CDF in the\ncontext of modern point process theory.

To\nobtain these fields for a moving charge which are consistent with special\nrelativity, transformations should be applied to the propagating field in the\ncharge's rest frame to acquire the propagating field in the charge's primed\ninertial frame. These transformations are of its coordinates, and also the\nvelocity vectors of the field's propagation, which consequently lead to a\nchange in the field's direction and as a result its strength. Yet, the electric\nfield propagation velocities are neglected and not currently transformed. This\nomission has consequences when it comes to transforming the field from the\nsource's rest frame to the source's primed frame, as this primed frame's field\nwould then be inconsistent with the calculated retarded field's directions and\nconsequently its strengths in this primed frame. Here the retarded field of a\nmoving point charge will be derived and from this the requirement of the\nvelocity transforms and the aberrational effects will be shown. Hence, the full\nconsistent inertial frame transform will be given.

Current prophylactic\nvaccines are highly effective to prevent disease but lose their ability to\nreduce viral transmission as viral evolution leads to increasing immune escape.\nLong term proactive public health policies must therefore complement\nvaccination with available nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) aiming to\nreduce the viral transmission risk in public spaces. Here, we revisit the\nquantitative assessment of airborne transmission risk, considering asymptotic\nlimits that considerably simplify its expression. We show that the aerosol\ntransmission risk is the product of three factors: a biological factor that\ndepends on the viral strain, a hydrodynamical factor defined as the ratio of\nconcentration in viral particles between inhaled and exhaled air, and a face\nmask filtering factor. The short range contribution to the risk, both present\nindoors and outdoors, is related to the turbulent dispersion of exhaled\naerosols by air drafts and by convection (indoor), or by the wind (outdoors).\nWe show experimentally that airborne droplets and CO$_2$ molecules present the\nsame dispersion. As a consequence, the dilution factor, and therefore the risk,\ncan be measured quantitatively using the CO$_2$ concentration, regardless of\nthe room volume, the flow rate of fresh air and the occupancy. We show that the\ndispersion cone leads to a concentration in viral particles, and therefore a\nshort range transmission risk, inversely proportional to the squared distance\nto an infected person and to the flow velocity. The aerosolization criterion\nderived as an intermediate result, which compares the Stokes relaxation time to\nthe Lagrangian time scale, may find application for a broad class of\naerosol-borne pathogens and pollutants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 23:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 15:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}
