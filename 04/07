We then\ninvestigate whether two minimal extensions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, together\nor separately, can successfully realize such a scenario: (i) the spatial\ncurvature, which, in the case of spatially closed universe, mimics a negative\ndensity source and (ii) simple-graduated dark energy (gDE), which promotes the\nnull inertial mass density of the usual vacuum energy to an arbitrary\nconstant--if negative, the corresponding energy density decreases with redshift\nsimilar to the phantom models, but unlike them crosses below zero at a certain\nredshift. We find that, when the Planck data are not included in the\nobservational analysis, the models with simple-gDE predict interesting and some\nsignificant deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, a spatially\nclosed universe along with a simple-gDE of positive inertial mass density,\nwhich work in contrast to each other, results in minor improvement to the $H_0$\ntension. The joint dataset, including the Planck data, presents no evidence for\na deviation from spatial flatness but almost the same evidence for a\ncosmological constant and the simple-gDE with an inertial mass density of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})\\,\\rm eV^4$. The latter case predicts almost no deviation\nfrom the $\\Lambda$CDM model up until today--so that it results in no\nimprovement regarding the BAO Ly-$\\alpha$ data--except that it slightly\naggravates the $H_0$ tension. We also study via dynamical analysis the history\nof the Universe in the models, as the simple-gDE results in futures different\nthan the de Sitter future of the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 16:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 10:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

The energy\nloss imprinted in the transverse momenta ($p_T$) distributions of those mesons,\nleads to the celebrated phenomenon of $jet-quenching$. An alternate measure of\nin-medium energy loss, recently discussed by PHENIX Collaboration, comes\nthrough the effective shift in transverse momentum spectra of hadrons recorded\nin nucleus-nucleus collisions when it was compared to the same in proton-proton\ncollisions. We have advocated a similar formalism and estimated the fractional\nenergy loss of heavy mesons for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and Au+Au\ncollisions at RHIC experiment. We have parameterised the invariant momentum\nyield of heavy mesons by Hagedorn function. The fit parameters and the\nexperimental data of jet-quenching are utilised to estimate the fractional\nenergy loss ($\\Delta m_T$) of heavy mesons at RHIC and LHC experiment.

As\nthe RF images should be similar in terms of content, colors, contrast, etc. to\nthe test image, this hinders the applicability in a real scenario. Other\napproaches to increase the perceptual quality of images, including perceptual\nloss and adversarial losses, tend to dramatically decrease fidelity to the\nground-truth through significant decreases in PSNR/SSIM. Addressing both\nissues, we propose a simple yet universal approach to improve the perceptual\nquality of the HR prediction from a pre-trained SR network on a given LR input\nby further fine-tuning the SR network on a subset of images from the training\ndataset with similar patterns of activation as the initial HR prediction, with\nrespect to the filters of a feature extractor.

Our model includes the effects of pebble\naccretion, gas-driven migration, and gas tidal damping and drag.\nSatellitesimals in our simulations first grow via pebble accretion and start to\nmigrate inwards. When they reach the trap at the disk inner edge, scattering\nevents and collisions take place promoting additional growth. Growing\nsatellites eventually reach a multi-resonant configuration anchored at the disk\ninner edge. Our best match to the masses of the Galilean satellites is produced\nin simulations where the integrated pebble flux is 1e-3 MJ. These simulations\ntypically produce between 3 and 5 satellites. In our best analogues, adjacent\nsatellite pairs are all locked in 2:1 mean motion resonances. However, they\nhave also moderately eccentric orbits (0.1), unlike the current real\nsatellites.

Callisto was probably in resonance with Ganymede in the past but left\nthis configuration - without breaking the Laplacian resonance - via divergent\nmigration due to tidal planet-satellite interactions.

It\naccounts for between-subject correlations induced by the sampling processes for\nboth cases and controls through perturbing their sampling indicator variables,\nand thus, captures all the variations. Furthermore, we demonstrate,\nanalytically and numerically, that when cases consist of only a subset of\nevents, our new weight produces more efficient IPW estimators than the weight\nproposed in Samuelsen (1997) for a standard NCC design. We illustrate the\nestimating procedure with a study that aims to evaluate a biomarker-based risk\nprediction model using the Framingham cohort study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 16:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

PageRank is a\npopular and effective algorithm for estimating node influence. However,\nconventional PageRank method considers neither the heterogeneity of network\nstructures nor additional network information, causing a major impedance to\nperformance improvement and an underestimation of non-hub nodes' importance. As\nthese problems are only partially studied, existing solutions are still not\nsatisfying. This paper addresses the problems by presenting a general\nPageRank-based model framework, dubbed Hetero-NodeRank, that accounts for\nheterogeneous network topology and incorporates node attribute information to\ncapture both link- and node-based effects in measuring node influence.\nMoreover, the framework enables the calibration of the proposed model against\nempirical data, which transforms the original deductive approach into an\ninductive one that could be useful for hypothesis testing and causal-effect\nanalysis. As the original unsupervised task becomes a supervised one,\noptimization methods can be leveraged for model calibrations.

If true, this opaque component necessitates a ~35% correction factor\nrelative to the mass from assuming optically-thin HI emission. These mass\ncorrections are based on fitting HI spectra with a single opaque component\nmodel that produces a distinct \"top-hat\" shaped line profile. Here, we\ninvestigate this issue using deep, high spectral resolution HI VLA observations\nof M31 and M33 to test if these top-hat profiles are instead superpositions of\nmultiple HI components along the line-of-sight. We fit both models and find\nthat >80% of the spectra strongly prefer a multi-component Gaussian model while\n<2% prefer the single opacity-corrected component model. This strong preference\nfor multiple components argues against previous findings of lines-of-sight\ndominated by only cold HI. Our findings are enabled by the improved spectral\nresolution (0.42 km/s), whereas coarser spectral resolution blends multiple\ncomponents together.

The RRM\ntreats wormlike micelle solutions as dilute suspensions of rigid Brownian rods\nundergoing reversible scission and growth in flow. Evolution equations for\nmicelle orientation and stress contribution are coupled to a kinetic reaction\nequation for a collective micelle length, producing dynamic variations in the\nlength and rotational diffusivity of the rods.

The present\nwork improves on this framework, which showed difficulty in capturing transient\ndynamics and high-shear behavior, by reformulating the kinetic equation for\nmicelle growth on a more microstructural (though still highly idealized) basis.\nIn particular, we allow for micelle growth associated with strong alignment of\nrods and breakage due to tensile stresses along the micelles.

However,\nexisting works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets,\nwhile real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push\nadversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we\ninvestigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed\ndistributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by\nimbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness,\nuncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a\nsystematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction\nwith the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are\nobtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of\nrobust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error\nlimits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose\na clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated\nmodules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin\nengineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other\nstate-of-the-art defense methods.

We\ninvestigate iron meteorites as an archive of volatile loss during planetesimal\nprocessing. The carbon contents of the parent bodies of magmatic iron\nmeteorites are reconstructed by thermodynamic modelling. Calculated\nsolid/molten alloy partitioning of C increases greatly with liquid S\nconcentration and inferred parent body C concentrations range from 0.0004 to\n0.11 wt.%. Parent bodies fall into 2 compositional clusters characterized by\ncores with medium, and low C/S. Both of these require significant planetesimal\ndegassing, as metamorphic devolatilization on chondrite-like precursors is\ninsufficient to account for their C depletions. Planetesimal core formation\nmodels, ranging from closed system extraction to degassing of a wholly molten\nbody, show that significant open system silicate melting and volatile loss is\nrequired to match medium and low C/S parent body core compositions. Greater\ndepletion in C relative to S is the hallmark of silicate degassing, indicating\nthat parent body core compositions record processes that affect composite\nsilicate/iron planetesimals. Degassing of bare cores stripped of their silicate\nmantles would deplete S with negligible C loss, and could not account for\ninferred parent body core compositions.

Malanushenko et al. (2009) proposed a method, using\nloop images and line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms, to infer the\nthree-dimensional shape and field strength along each loop. McCarthy et al.\n(2019) used this novel method to compute the total magnetic flux\ninterconnecting a pair of active regions observed by SDO/AIA. They adopted the\ncommon assumption that each loop had a circular cross section. The accuracy of\ninferred shape and circularity of cross sections can both be tested using\nobservations of the same loops from additional vantage points as provided by\nSTEREO/EUVI. Here, we use multiple viewing angles to confirm the\nthree-dimensional structure of loops. Of 151 viable cases, 105 (69.5%) matched\nsome form of visible coronal structure when viewed approximately in quadrature.\nA loop with a circular cross-section should appear of a similar width in\ndifferent perspectives. In contradiction to this, we find a puzzling lack of\ncorrelation between loop diameters seen from different perspectives, even an\nanti-correlation in some cases. Features identified as monolithic loops in AIA\nmay, in fact, be more complex density enhancements. The 30.5% of\nreconstructions from AIA which did not match any feature in EUVI might be such\nenhancements. Others may be genuine loop structures, but with elliptical cross\nsections. We observe an anti-correlation between diameter and brightness,\nlending support to the latter hypothesis. Of 13 suitable for width analysis,\nfour loops are consistent with non-circular cross sections, where we find\nanti-correlation in both comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

In addition, machine learning-based\napproaches suffer the problem of overfitting if there is a small number of\nwells on which the model is trained.

In such cases, the quality of\nthe final 3D mesh, which is contingent on the accuracy of those estimates, is\nreduced. One way to overcome this problem is to combine data from a monocular\ncamera with that of a LIDAR. This allows fine details and texture to be\ncaptured while still accurately representing featureless subjects. However,\nfusing these two sensor modalities is challenging due to their fundamentally\ndifferent characteristics. Rather than directly fusing image features and LIDAR\npoints, we propose to leverage common geometric features that are detected in\nboth the LIDAR scans and image data, allowing data from the two sensors to be\nprocessed in a higher-level space.

We focus on the misbehavior opportunities due\nto the heterogeneity in channel access mechanism and the lack of a common\ncontrol plane. We define selfish misbehavior strategies for the LTE that yield\nan unfair share of the spectrum resources. Such strategies are based on\nmanipulating the operational parameters of the LTE-LAA standard, namely the\nbackoff mechanism, the traffic class parameters, the clear channel access (CCA)\nthreshold, and others. Prior methods for detecting misbehavior in homogeneous\nsettings are not applicable in a spectrum sharing scenario because the devices\nof one system cannot decode the transmissions of another. We develop implicit\nsensing techniques that can accurately estimate the operational parameters of\nLTE transmissions under various topological scenarios and {\\em without\ndecoding.} These techniques apply correlation-based signal detection to infer\nthe required information. Our techniques are validated through experiments on a\nUSRP testbed. We further apply a statistical inference framework for\ndetermining deviations of the LTE behavior from the coexistence etiquette. By\ncharacterizing the detection and false alarm probabilities, we show that our\nframework yields high detection accuracy at a very low false alarm rate.\nAlthough our methods focus on detecting misbehavior of the LTE system, they can\nbe generalized to other coexistence scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 20:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

Past computational work on low-viscosity discs has hinted that\nthese two developments might not be self-consistent because even low-mass\nplanets can be accompanied by vortices instead of conventional double rings. We\ninvestigate this potential discrepancy by conducting hydrodynamic simulations\nof growing planetary cores in discs with various aspect ratios ($H/r=0.04$,\n0.06, 0.08) and viscosities ($1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\lesssim \\alpha \\lesssim 3\n\\times 10^{-4}$), having these cores accrete their gas mass directly from the\ndisc.

We also find that vortices with $H/r = 0.08$ survive\n$>6000$ planet orbits regardless of the planet mass or disc mass because they\nare less affected by the planet's spiral waves. We connect our results to\nobservations and find that the outward migration of vortices with $H/r \\ge\n0.08$ may be able to explain the cavity in Oph IRS 48 or the two clumps in MWC\n758.

This paper aims at solving this problem by building an end-to-end\nprocess that employs methods from the deep learning field to automatically\nsegment, detect and classify cell compartments of fluorescence microscopy\nimages of yeast cells. With this intention we used Mask R-CNN to automatically\nsegment and label a large amount of yeast cell data, and YOLOv4 to\nautomatically detect and classify individual yeast cell compartments from these\nimages. This fully automated end-to-end process is intended to be integrated\ninto an interactive e-Science server in the PerICo1 project, which can be used\nby biologists with minimized human effort in training and operation to complete\ntheir various classification tasks. In addition, we evaluated the detection and\nclassification performance of state-of-the-art YOLOv4 on data from the\nNOP1pr-GFP-SWAT yeast-cell data library. Experimental results show that by\ndividing original images into 4 quadrants YOLOv4 outputs good detection and\nclassification results with an F1-score of 98% in terms of accuracy and speed,\nwhich is optimally suited for the native resolution of the microscope and\ncurrent GPU memory sizes.

Intuitively, our approach consists of solving for the\nparameters that generate the most accurate state estimator (Extended Kalman\nFilter).

However, significant spectral\nvariability is often observed between collection of images due to variations in\nacquisition or seasonal conditions. This characteristic has to be considered in\nthe design of SU algorithms. Because of its good performance, the multiple\nendmember spectral mixture analysis algorithm (MESMA) has been recently used to\nperform SU in multitemporal scenarios arising in several practical\napplications. However, MESMA does not consider the relationship between the\ndifferent HIs, and its computational complexity is extremely high for large\nspectral libraries. In this work, we propose an efficient multitemporal SU\nmethod that exploits the high temporal correlation between the abundances to\nprovide more accurate results at a lower computational complexity.

Most\nexisting destriping methods are designed by combining a particular image\nregularization with a stripe noise characterization that cooperates with the\nregularization, which precludes us to examine and activate different\nregularizations to adapt to various target images. To resolve this, two\nrequirements need to be considered: a general framework that can handle a\nvariety of image regularizations in destriping, and a strong stripe noise\ncharacterization that can consistently capture the nature of stripe noise,\nregardless of the choice of image regularization. To this end, this paper\nproposes a general destriping framework using a newly-introduced stripe noise\ncharacterization, named flatness constraint, where we can handle various\nregularization functions in a unified manner. Specifically, we formulate the\ndestriping problem as a nonsmooth convex optimization problem involving a\ngeneral form of image regularization and the flatness constraint. The\nconstraint mathematically models that the intensity of each stripe is constant\nalong one direction, resulting in a strong characterization of stripe noise.\nFor solving the optimization problem, we also develop an efficient algorithm\nbased on a diagonally preconditioned primal-dual splitting algorithm (DP-PDS),\nwhich can automatically adjust the stepsizes. The effectiveness of our\nframework is demonstrated through destriping experiments, where we\ncomprehensively compare combinations of a variety of image regularizations and\nstripe noise characterizations using hyperspectral images (HSI) and infrared\n(IR) videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 01:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 10:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 05:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 05:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Over the past few years, most studies focus on\nclassifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it\nis more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this\npaper, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task -- multi-scene\nrecognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset,\ncalled MultiScene, composed of 100,000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial\nimages. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we\nresort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g.,\nOpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and\nincorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue,\nwe visually inspect 14,000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a\nsubset of cleanly-annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can\ndevelop and evaluate deep networks for multi-scene recognition using clean\ndata. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the\npurpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments\nwith extensive baseline models on both MultiScene-Clean and MultiScene to offer\nbenchmarks for multi-scene recognition in single images and learning from noisy\nlabels for this task, respectively.

Although it has been successfully applied to a\nwide range of challenging tasks in robotics, it is fundamentally limited by the\nprediction horizon, which, if too short, will result in myopic decisions.\nRecently, several papers have suggested using a learned value function as the\nterminal cost for MPC. If the value function is accurate, it effectively allows\nMPC to reason over an infinite horizon. Unfortunately, Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) solutions to value function approximation can be difficult to realize for\nrobotics tasks. In this paper, we suggest a more efficient method for value\nfunction approximation that applies to goal-directed problems, like reaching\nand navigation. In these problems, MPC is often formulated to track a path or\ntrajectory returned by a planner. However, this strategy is brittle in that\nunexpected perturbations to the robot will require replanning, which can be\ncostly at runtime. Instead, we show how the intermediate data structures used\nby modern planners can be interpreted as an approximate value function.

To solve this, a self-supervised\nlearning method is developed in this study. The effectiveness of the proposed\nself-supervised learning method in gastritis detection is verified using a few\nannotated gastric X-ray images. Methods: In this study, we develop a novel\nmethod that can perform explicit self-supervised learning and learn\ndiscriminative representations from gastric X-ray images. Models trained based\non the proposed method were fine-tuned on datasets comprising a few annotated\ngastric X-ray images. Five self-supervised learning methods, i.e., SimSiam,\nBYOL, PIRL-jigsaw, PIRL-rotation, and SimCLR, were compared with the proposed\nmethod. Furthermore, three previous methods, one pretrained on ImageNet, one\ntrained from scratch, and one semi-supervised learning method, were compared\nwith the proposed method. Results: The proposed method's harmonic mean score of\nsensitivity and specificity after fine-tuning with the annotated data of 10,\n20, 30, and 40 patients were 0.875, 0.911, 0.915, and 0.931, respectively.

The development of intelligent long video\nanalysis algorithms for regional positioning and analysis of capsule endoscopic\nvideo is therefore essential to reduce the workload of clinicians and assist in\nimproving the accuracy of disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep\nmodel to ground shooting range of small intestine from a capsule endoscope\nvideo which has duration of tens of hours.

The conventional approaches are\ninsufficient for dealing with the extended-term simulation of multi-timescale\nprocesses. This paper proposes an extended-term simulation approach based on\nthe holomorphic embedding (HE) methodology. Its accuracy and computational\nefficiency are backed by HE's high accuracy in event-driven simulation, larger\nand adaptive time steps, and flexible switching between full-dynamic and\nquasi-steady-state (QSS) models.

Two\nparticular tasks that test this type of reasoning are (1) mathematical equation\nverification, which requires determining whether trigonometric and linear\nalgebraic statements are valid identities or not, and (2) equation completion,\nwhich entails filling in a blank within an expression to make it true. Solving\nthese tasks with deep learning requires that the neural model learn how to\nmanipulate and compose various algebraic symbols, carrying this ability over to\npreviously unseen expressions. Artificial neural networks, including recurrent\nnetworks and transformers, struggle to generalize on these kinds of difficult\ncompositional problems, often exhibiting poor extrapolation performance. In\ncontrast, recursive neural networks (recursive-NNs) are, theoretically, capable\nof achieving better extrapolation due to their tree-like design but are\ndifficult to optimize as the depth of their underlying tree structure\nincreases. To overcome this issue, we extend recursive-NNs to utilize\nmultiplicative, higher-order synaptic connections and, furthermore, to learn to\ndynamically control and manipulate an external memory.

The 54 PMS stars\nhave N_R < 10^{-1.0} and show R' \\sim 10^{-4.2} as large as the maximum R' of\nthe zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars. However, because all R' was saturated\nagainst N_R, it was not possible to estimate the appropriate tau_c model for\nthe PMS stars. We noticed that Mg I emission lines at 8808 A is an optically\nthin chromospheric line, appropriate for determination of the adequate tau_c\nfor PMS stars. Using the archive data of the Anglo-Australian Telescope\n(AAT)/the University College London Echelle Spectrograph (UCLES), we\ninvestigated the Mg I line of 52 ZAMS stars. After subtracting photospheric\nabsorption component, the Mg I line is detected as an emission line in 45 ZAMS\nstars, whose R' is between 10^{-5.9} and 10^{-4.1}. The Mg I line is not\nsaturated yet in \"the saturated regime for the Ca II emission lines\", i.e.\n10^{-1.6} < N_R < 10^{-0.8}. Therefore, the adequate tau_c for PMS stars can be\ndetermined by measuring of their R' values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 04:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In this work, we consider problems of\nquantum state estimation where some of the measurement records are not\navailable, but where the available records come from both before (past) and\nafter (future) the estimation time, enabling better estimates than is possible\nusing the past information alone. Past-future information for quantum systems\nhas been used in various ways in the literature, in particular, the quantum\nstate smoothing, the most-likely path, and the two-state vector and related\nformalisms. To unify these seemingly unrelated approaches, we propose a\nframework for partially-observed quantum system with continuous monitoring,\nwherein the first two existing formalisms can be accommodated, with some\ngeneralization. The unifying framework is based on state estimation with\nexpected cost minimization, where the cost can be defined either in the space\nof the unknown record or in the space of the unknown true state. Moreover, we\nconnect all three existing approaches conceptually by defining five new cost\nfunctions, and thus new types of estimators, which bridge the gaps between\nthem. We illustrate the applicability of our method by calculating all seven\nestimators we consider for the example of a driven two-level system\ndissipatively coupled to bosonic baths. Our theory also allows connections to\nclassical state estimation, which create further conceptual links between our\nquantum state estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 04:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 08:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using\nclassical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class\nimbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To\naddress some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting\ncontrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized\nclinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially\naugment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the\nsimilar/dissimilar patterns (by its \"push-and-pull\" form), meanwhile mitigating\nthe highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces\n(as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the\ncontrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive\nsamples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data.\nTo this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies\nspecifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that\nexploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature\nlearning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates\npre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both\nsampling approaches are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class\nvariance in EHR data. Our overall framework yields highly competitive\nexperimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world COVID-19\nEHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health\nsystem. Specifically, our method reaches a high AUROC prediction score of\n0.959, which outperforms other baselines and alternatives: cross-entropy(0.873)\nand focal loss(0.931).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 06:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

With payment channels\nand the network they construct, two users can move some transactions off-chain\nin a predetermined duration to avoid expensive and time-consuming on-chain\nsettlements. Existing work is devoted to designing high-throughput payment\nchannel networks (PCNs) or efficient PCN routing policies to reduce the fee. In\nthis paper, we investigate the PCN routing from a different perspective by\nanswering whether the routing fee of transactions can be saved by being a bit\nmore patient. The key idea is to reorder the processing sequence of atomic\ntransactions, other than to handle each of them separately and immediately. We\npresent two mechanisms, one is periodic transaction processing assisted by a\nPCN broker and the other is purely strategic waiting. In the former, all the\nincoming transactions in a short time interval are processed collectively. We\nformulate an optimization model to minimize their total routing fee and derive\nthe optimal permutation of processing transactions as well as the routing\npolicy for each of them. A Shapley value based scheme is presented to\nredistribute the benefit of reordering among the transactions efficiently and\nfairly. In the latter, we model the waiting time of a strategic transaction on\na single payment channel as the first passage time problem in queueing theory\nwhen the transaction value is higher than the edge capacity upon its arrival.\nBy capturing the capacity dynamics, we are able to calculate the recursive\nexpression of waiting for time distribution that is useful to gauge a user's\ncost of patience. Experimental results manifest that our cost redistribution\nmechanism can effectively save routing fees for all the transactions, and the\nwaiting time distribution coincides with the model well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 06:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

In K-way classification, this is crisply formulated as\nopen-set recognition, core to which is the ability to discriminate open-set\ndata outside the K closed-set classes. Two conceptually elegant ideas for\nopen-set discrimination are: 1) discriminatively learning an open-vs-closed\nbinary discriminator by exploiting some outlier data as the open-set, and 2)\nunsupervised learning the closed-set data distribution with a GAN, using its\ndiscriminator as the open-set likelihood function. However, the former\ngeneralizes poorly to diverse open test data due to overfitting to the training\noutliers, which are unlikely to exhaustively span the open-world. The latter\ndoes not work well, presumably due to the instable training of GANs. Motivated\nby the above, we propose OpenGAN, which addresses the limitation of each\napproach by combining them with several technical insights. First, we show that\na carefully selected GAN-discriminator on some real outlier data already\nachieves the state-of-the-art. Second, we augment the available set of real\nopen training examples with adversarially synthesized \"fake\" data. Third and\nmost importantly, we build the discriminator over the features computed by the\nclosed-world K-way networks. This allows OpenGAN to be implemented via a\nlightweight discriminator head built on top of an existing K-way network.\nExtensive experiments show that OpenGAN significantly outperforms prior\nopen-set methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 06:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 02:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 05:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

The mass transfer rate from the secondary\nhas to increase by several orders of magnitudes during the initial\nsuperoutburst for a reason that remains elusive, slowly returning to its\nsecular average, causing the observed succession of outbursts with increasing\nquiescence durations, until the disc can be steady, cold, and neutral; its\ninner parts being truncated either by the white dwarf magnetic field or by\nevaporation. The very short, quiescence phases between reflares are reproduced\nwhen the mass-transfer stream overflows the disc. Using similar additions to\nthe DIM, we have also produced light curves close to those observed in two WZ\nSge stars, the prototype and EG Cnc. Our model successfully explains the\nreflares observed in WZ Sge systems. It requires, however, the inner disc\ntruncation in dwarf novae to be due not (only) to the white dwarf magnetic\nfield but, as in X-ray binaries, rather to evaporation of the inner disc.

It does not make sense to group those context frames to\nthe same background class since they are semantically related to a specific\naction category. Consequently, it is challenging to suppress action context\nframes with only a single class activation sequence.

All these problems remain largely\nunexplored in the existing literature and make the application of RL\nchallenging. We develop a model-based reinforcement learning framework, called\nGoalRec. Inspired by the ideas of world model (model-based), value function\nestimation (model-free), and goal-based RL, a novel disentangled universal\nvalue function designed for item recommendation is proposed. It can generalize\nto various goals that the recommender may have, and disentangle the stochastic\nenvironmental dynamics and high-variance reward signals accordingly. As a part\nof the value function, free from the sparse and high-variance reward signals, a\nhigh-capacity reward-independent world model is trained to simulate complex\nenvironmental dynamics under a certain goal. Based on the predicted\nenvironmental dynamics, the disentangled universal value function is related to\nthe user's future trajectory instead of a monolithic state and a scalar reward.\nWe demonstrate the superiority of GoalRec over previous approaches in terms of\nthe above three practical challenges in a series of simulations and a real\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 08:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 13:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

In the paper\nI of this series, we showed that the eccentricity of the stars emerged from a\nhypothetical disk around the SMBH can be rapidly excited by the secular\nperturbation of its intermediate-mass companion (IMC), and we suggested IRS 13E\nas a potential candidate for the IMC. Here, we show that this process leads to\nan influx of stars on parabolic orbits to the proximity of $\\rm Sgr~A^{\\star}$\non a secular timescale of a few Myr. This timescale is much shorter than the\ndiffusion timescale into the lost cone through either the classical or the\nresonant relaxation. Precession of the highly-eccentric stars' longitude of\nperiastron, relative to that of the IMC, brings them to its proximity within a\nfew Myr. The IMC's gravitational perturbation scatters a fraction of the stars\nfrom nearly parabolic to hyperbolic orbits, with respect to the SMBH. Their\nfollow-up close encounters with the SMBH induce them to escape with\nhyper-velocity.

Most existing privacy-preserving string comparison functions\nare either based on comparing sets of encoded character q-grams, allow only\nexact matching of encrypted strings, or they are aimed at long genomic\nsequences that have a small alphabet. The set-based privacy-preserving\nsimilarity functions commonly used to compare name and address strings in the\ncontext of privacy-preserving record linkage do not take the positions of\nsub-strings into account. As a result, two very different strings can\npotentially be considered as an exact match leading to wrongly linked records.\nExisting set-based techniques also cannot identify the length of the longest\ncommon sub-string across two strings.

We incorporate a hashing based\nencoding technique upon the encoded suffixes to improve privacy against\nfrequency attacks such as those exploiting Benford's law.

Although\nin recent years a large number of binaries have been proven to host exoplanets,\nhow planet formation proceeds in multiple stellar systems has not been studied\nmuch yet from the theoretical standpoint. In this paper we focus on the\nevolution of the dust grains in planet-forming discs in binaries. We take into\naccount the dynamics of gas and dust in discs around each component of a binary\nsystem under the hypothesis that the evolution of the circumprimary and the\ncircumsecondary discs is independent. It is known from previous studies that\nthe secular evolution of the gas in binary discs is hastened due to the tidal\ninteractions with their hosting stars. Here we prove that binarity affects dust\ndynamics too, possibly in a more dramatic way than the gas. In particular, the\npresence of a stellar companion significantly reduces the amount of solids\nretained in binary discs because of a faster, more efficient radial drift,\nultimately shortening their lifetime. We prove that how rapidly discs disperse\ndepends both on the binary separation, with discs in wider binaries living\nlonger, and on the disc viscosity. Although the less-viscous discs lose high\namounts of solids in the earliest stages of their evolution, they are\ndissipated slowly, while those with higher viscosities show an opposite\nbehaviour. The faster radial migration of dust in binary discs has a striking\nimpact on planet formation, which seems to be inhibited in this hostile\nenvironment, unless other disc substructures halt radial drift further in. We\nconclude that if planetesimal formation were viable in binary discs, this\nprocess would take place on very short time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 09:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Moreover,\nas training data come in sequence in FSCIL, the learned classifier can only\nprovide discriminative information in individual sessions, while FSCIL requires\nall classes to be involved for evaluation. In this paper, we address the FSCIL\nproblem from two aspects. First, we adopt a simple but effective decoupled\nlearning strategy of representations and classifiers that only the classifiers\nare updated in each incremental session, which avoids knowledge forgetting in\nthe representations. By doing so, we demonstrate that a pre-trained backbone\nplus a non-parametric class mean classifier can beat state-of-the-art methods.\nSecond, to make the classifiers learned on individual sessions applicable to\nall classes, we propose a Continually Evolved Classifier (CEC) that employs a\ngraph model to propagate context information between classifiers for\nadaptation.

Far less\nattention has been given to the latent representations learned with unbalanced\ndata. We show that the feature extractor part of deep networks suffers greatly\nfrom this bias. We propose a new loss based on robustness theory, which\nencourages the model to learn high-quality representations for both head and\ntail classes. While the general form of the robustness loss may be hard to\ncompute, we further derive an easy-to-compute upper bound that can be minimized\nefficiently. This procedure reduces representation bias towards head classes in\nthe feature space and achieves new SOTA results on CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT,\nand iNaturalist long-tail benchmarks.

Nevertheless,\nantiferromagnets have attracted enormous interest recently in spintronics due\nto the absence of stray fields and their terahertz resonant frequency. Despite\nthe great advantages of antiferromagnetic spintronics, controlling and\ndetecting N\\'eel vectors have been limited in bulk materials. In this work, we\ndeveloped a sensitive second harmonic generation (SHG) microscope and detected\nlong-range N\\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and N\\'eel vector switching\ndown to the monolayer in MnPSe$_3$. Temperature-dependent SHG measurement in\nrepetitive thermal cooling surprisingly collapses into two curves, which\ncorrespond to the switching of an Ising type N\\'eel vector reversed by the\ntime-reversal operation, instead of a six-state clock ground state expected\nfrom the threefold rotation symmetry in the structure. We imaged the spatial\ndistribution of the N\\'eel vectors across samples and rotated them by an\narbitrary angle irrespective of the lattice in the sample plane by applying\nstrain. By studying both a Landau theory and a microscopic model that couples\nstrain to nearest-neighbor exchange, we conclude that the phase transition of\nthe XY model in the presence of strain falls into the Ising universality class\ninstead of the XY one, which could explain the extreme strain tunability.\nFinally, we found that the 180{\\deg} AFM domain walls are highly mobile down to\nthe monolayer after thermal cycles, paving the way for future control of the\nantiferromagnetic domains by strain or external fields on demand for\nultra-compact 2D AFM terahertz spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 11:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Due to the spatial inversion symmetry broken caused by special 3R\nstacking, spontaneous OOP ferroelectric polarization will appear in the 3R\nbilayer BX, which can be swichable through a specific interlayer sliding. The\nOOP ferroelectricity leads to charge transfer between layers, realizes\nefficient spatial separation between holes and electrons, and forms the\ncharacteristics of type-II band alignment. Moreover, due to perfect lattice\nmatch on account of two identical layers, the 3R bilayer BX is more stable and\neasy to realize in experiments than most of traditional 2D heterostructures\nmade up of different materials. The 3R bilayer BX shows moderate band gap,\nultra-high carrier mobility and efficient optical absorption, and its\nnano-devices present large photocurrent, high photon responsivity and excellent\nexternal quantum efficiency.

This poses high constraints on\nthe optical hash or low cost applications. Although one can utilize algorithmic\nreconstruction to remove the artifacts of low-end lenses, the degeneration from\noptical aberrations is spatially varying and the computation has to trade off\nefficiency for performance. For example, we need to conduct patch-wise\noptimization or train a large set of local deep neural networks to achieve high\nreconstruction performance across the whole image. In this paper, we propose a\nPSF aware plug-and-play deep network, which takes the aberrant image and PSF\nmap as input and produces the latent high quality version via incorporating\nlens-specific deep priors, thus leading to a universal and flexible optical\naberration correction method.

In the context of\neliminating toxic substances from electronic devices, Croconic Acid has a great\npotential as a sublimable lead-free ferroelectric. However, studies on\nferroelectric properties of its thin films are only in their early stages and\nits capability to be incorporated in nanoscale devices is unknown. In this\nwork, we demonstrate, upon ferroelectric switching at the nanoscale, stable and\nenduring room temperature polarization with no leakage current in Croconic Acid\nthin films. We thus show that it is a promising lead-free organic ferroelectric\ntoward integration in nanoscale devices. The challenging switching current and\npolarization reversal characterization at the nanoscale was done using a unique\ncombination of piezoresponse force microscopy, polarization switching current\nspectroscopy and the concurrent electromechanical strain response.

The low-dimensionality of the latent space\nand the high expressivity of the EBM make it easy for the model to capture the\nmultimodality of pedestrian trajectory distributions.

Yet it suffers from quantization errors caused by neglecting\nsubpixel coordinates in image resizing and network downsampling. In this paper,\nwe first quantitatively analyze the quantization error on benchmarks, which\naccounts for more than 1/3 of the whole prediction errors for state-of-the-art\nmethods. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Heatmap In Heatmap(HIH)\nrepresentation and a coordinate soft-classification (CSC) method, which are\nseamlessly integrated into the classic hourglass network. The HIH\nrepresentation utilizes nested heatmaps to jointly represent the coordinate\nlabel: one heatmap called integer heatmap stands for the integer coordinate,\nand the other heatmap named decimal heatmap represents the subpixel coordinate.\nThe range of a decimal heatmap makes up one pixel in the corresponding integer\nheatmap. Besides, we transfer the offset regression problem to an interval\nclassification task, and CSC regards the confidence of the pixel as the\nprobability of the interval.

As\nregion-based visual features usually represent parts of an image, it is\nchallenging for existing vision-language models to fully understand the\nsemantics from paired natural languages. In this paper, we propose SOHO to \"See\nOut of tHe bOx\" that takes a whole image as input, and learns vision-language\nrepresentation in an end-to-end manner. SOHO does not require bounding box\nannotations which enables inference 10 times faster than region-based\napproaches. In particular, SOHO learns to extract comprehensive yet compact\nimage features through a visual dictionary (VD) that facilitates cross-modal\nunderstanding. VD is designed to represent consistent visual abstractions of\nsimilar semantics. It is updated on-the-fly and utilized in our proposed\npre-training task Masked Visual Modeling (MVM). We conduct experiments on four\nwell-established vision-language tasks by following standard VLPT settings.

Achieving more information of proteins of\ninfected creeping bentgrass is helpful to understand the ISR mechanism.\nResults: With BDO treatment, creeping bentgrass seedlings were grown, and the\nISR response was induced by infecting Rhizoctonia solani. High-quality protein\nsequences of creeping bentgrass seedlings were obtained. Some of protein\nsequences were functionally annotated according to the database alignment while\na large part of the obtained protein sequences was left non-annotated.

This method is fast, but practically\ncouldn't be optimized due to the strongly non-equilibrium conditions of crystal\ngrowth. Another quality limitation is the typical incorporation of organic\nsolvent molecules into crystals when perovskite crystallization is performed\nfrom solution with organic solvent. Here we report an alternative method of\nperovskite single crystal growth based on the counterdiffusion of reagents in\nthe gel medium. This counterdiffusion-in-gel crystallization (CGC) method is\nbased on the difference of solubility between perovskites and lead halide in\nthe corresponding halide acid, HX. The difference of solubility between\nperovskites and lead halide leads to the formation of perovskite single\ncrystals of sufficiently large size with an excellent optical quality at\nconstant room temperature.

Their photoluminescence spectra recorded at 4 K demonstrate the\nexcitonic resonances with the full width < 2.5 meV, which proves their\nexcellent optical quality.

To address this, we develop new\ndatasets and methods that significantly improve human pose estimation with\nself-contact. First, we create a dataset of 3D Contact Poses (3DCP) containing\nSMPL-X bodies fit to 3D scans as well as poses from AMASS, which we refine to\nensure good contact. Second, we leverage this to create the Mimic-The-Pose\n(MTP) dataset of images, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing\npeople mimicking the 3DCP poses with selfcontact. Third, we develop a novel HPS\noptimization method, SMPLify-XMC, that includes contact constraints and uses\nthe known 3DCP body pose during fitting to create near ground-truth poses for\nMTP images.

Unfortunately, the\nmeasured wind speed from such a single measurement point does not give a good\nrepresentation of the effective wind speed over the blades, as it does not take\nthe varying wind condition within the entire rotor area into account. As such,\nBlade Effective Wind Speed (BEWS) estimation can be seen as a more accurate\nalternative.

Then, the SPRE scheme, which is inspired by Subspace\nPredictive Repetitive Control (SPRC), is proposed to estimate the BEWS. Case\nstudies exhibit the proposed method's effectiveness at predicting BEWS and\nidentifying wind shear in varying wind speed conditions.

This study improves parts of the theory\nunderlying the use of contingency tables. Specifically, the linkage\ndisequilibrium parameter as a measure of two-way interactions applied to\nthree-way tables makes it possible to quantify Simpsons paradox by a simple\nformula. With tests on three-way interactions, there is only one that\ndetermines whether the partial interactions of all variables agree or whether\nthere is at least one variable whose partial interactions disagree. To date,\nthere has been no test available that determines whether the partial\ninteractions of a certain variable agree or disagree, and the presented work\ncloses this gap. This work reveals the relation of the multiplicative and the\nadditive measure of a three-way interaction. Another contribution addresses the\nquestion of which cells in a contingency table are fixed when the first- and\nsecond-order marginal totals are given. The proposed procedure not only detects\nfixed zero counts but also fixed positive counts. This impacts the\ndetermination of the degrees of freedom.

While from the effective field theory (EFT) point of\nview no direct correlations exist, this changes in specific new physics models.\nIn particular, in the case of explanations involving heavy new particles above\nthe electroweak (EW) scale with chiral enhancement, which are preferred to\nevade exclusion limits from direct searches, correlations with other\nobservables sensitive to EW symmetry breaking are expected. Such scenarios can\nbe classified according to the $SU(2)_L$ representations and the hypercharges\nof the new particles. We match the resulting class of models with heavy new\nscalars and fermions onto SMEFT and study the resulting correlations with\n$h\\to\\mu\\mu$ and $Z\\to\\mu\\mu$ decays, where, via $SU(2)_L$ symmetry, the latter\nprocess is related to $Z\\to\\nu\\nu$ and modified $W$-$\\mu$-$\\nu$ couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 15:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 17:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 07:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 13:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Video Captioning involves the combination of\ndifferent deep learning models to perform object detection, action detection,\nand localization by processing a sequence of image frames. It is crucial to\nconsider the sequence of actions in a video in order to generate a meaningful\ndescription of the overall action event. A reliable, accurate, and real-time\nvideo captioning method can be used in many applications. However, this paper\nfocuses on one application: video captioning for fostering and facilitating\nphysical activities. In broad terms, the work can be considered to be assistive\ntechnology. Lack of physical activity appears to be increasingly widespread in\nmany nations due to many factors, the most important being the convenience that\ntechnology has provided in workplaces. The adopted sedentary lifestyle is\nbecoming a significant public health issue. Therefore, it is essential to\nincorporate more physical movements into our daily lives. Tracking one's daily\nphysical activities would offer a base for comparison with activities performed\nin subsequent days. With the above in mind, this paper proposes a video\ncaptioning framework that aims to describe the activities in a video and\nestimate a person's daily physical activity level. This framework could\npotentially help people trace their daily movements to reduce an inactive\nlifestyle's health risks. The work presented in this paper is still in its\ninfancy.

However, unlike the independence assumption,\ninterpretability has rarely been exploited to encourage disentanglement in the\nunsupervised setting. In this paper, we examine the interpretability of\ndisentangled representations by investigating two questions: where to be\ninterpreted and what to be interpreted? A latent code is easily to be\ninterpreted if it would consistently impact a certain subarea of the resulting\ngenerated image. We thus propose to learn a spatial mask to localize the effect\nof each individual latent dimension. On the other hand, interpretability\nusually comes from latent dimensions that capture simple and basic variations\nin data. We thus impose a perturbation on a certain dimension of the latent\ncode, and expect to identify the perturbation along this dimension from the\ngenerated images so that the encoding of simple variations can be enforced.\nAdditionally, we develop an unsupervised model selection method, which\naccumulates perceptual distance scores along axes in the latent space. On\nvarious datasets, our models can learn high-quality disentangled\nrepresentations without supervision, showing the proposed modeling of\ninterpretability is an effective proxy for achieving unsupervised\ndisentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 11:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

ZEUS trains a\nreinforcement learning agent that learns to adaptively modify the input video\nsegments that are subsequently sent to an action classification network.

To meet the user-specified accuracy target, ZEUS's\nquery optimizer trains the agent based on an accuracy-aware, aggregate reward\nfunction. Evaluation on three diverse video datasets shows that ZEUS\noutperforms state-of-the-art frame- and window-based filtering techniques by up\nto 22.1x and 4.7x, respectively.

A minimal swimming system\nconsists of one deformable Dd amoeboid cell and a dilute suspension of\nbacteria, and the bacteria produce chemoattractant signals that attract the Dd\ncell. We use the mathematical amoeba model to generate Dd cell deformation and\nsolve the resulting low Reynolds number flows, and use a moving mesh based\nfinite volume method to solve the reaction-diffusion-convection equation. Using\nthe computational model, we show that chemotaxis guides a swimming Dd cell to\nfollow and catch bacteria, while on the other hand, bacterial rheotaxis may\nhelp the bacteria to escape from the predator Dd cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 00:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}
