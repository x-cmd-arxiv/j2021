This domain decomposition endows cPINNs and XPINNs\nwith several advantages over the vanilla PINNs, such as parallelization\ncapacity, large representation capacity, efficient hyperparameter tuning, and\nis particularly effective for multi-scale and multi-physics problems. Here, we\npresent a parallel algorithm for cPINNs and XPINNs constructed with a hybrid\nprogramming model described by MPI $+$ X, where X $\\in\n\\{\\text{CPUs},~\\text{GPUs}\\}$. The main advantage of cPINN and XPINN over the\nmore classical data and model parallel approaches is the flexibility of\noptimizing all hyperparameters of each neural network separately in each\nsubdomain. We compare the performance of distributed cPINNs and XPINNs for\nvarious forward problems, using both weak and strong scalings. Our results\nindicate that for space domain decomposition, cPINNs are more efficient in\nterms of communication cost but XPINNs provide greater flexibility as they can\nalso handle time-domain decomposition for any differential equations, and can\ndeal with any arbitrarily shaped complex subdomains. To this end, we also\npresent an application of the parallel XPINN method for solving an inverse\ndiffusion problem with variable conductivity on the United States map, using\nten regions as subdomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 17:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Predictive scores providing personalised risk of developing\nCVD are increasingly used in clinical practice.

A\nsecondary goal was to identify new patient-centric variables that could be\nincorporated into CVD risk assessments.\n  Methods: Across 466,052 participants, Cox proportional hazards (CPH) and\nDeepSurv models were trained using 608 variables derived from the UK Biobank to\ninvestigate the 10-year risk of developing a CVD. Data-driven feature selection\nreduced the number of features to 47, after which reduced models were trained.\nBoth models were compared to the Framingham score.\n  Results: The reduced CPH model achieved a c-index of 0.7443, whereas DeepSurv\nachieved a c-index of 0.7446. Both CPH and DeepSurv were superior in\ndetermining the CVD risk compared to Framingham score. Minimal difference was\nobserved when cholesterol and blood pressure were excluded from the models\n(CPH: 0.741, DeepSurv: 0.739).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classic technique for extracting\nthe linear structure of a dataset, which is useful for feature extraction and\ndata compression. In this work, we propose the deployment of distributed PCA\nover a multi-access channel based on the algorithm of stochastic gradient\ndescent to learn the dominant feature space of a distributed dataset at\nmultiple devices. Over-the-air aggregation is adopted to reduce the\nmulti-access latency, giving the name over-the-air PCA.

The structure and properties of this lattice depend upon a real\nparameter $a>0$, whose value was only known approximately. Here, we give a full\ndescription of this one-parameter family of lattices and their Voronoi cells,\nand calculate their (scalar and tensor) second moments analytically as a\nfunction of $a$. The value of $a$ which minimizes $G$ is an algebraic number,\ndefined by the root of a $9$th order polynomial, with $a \\approx 0.573223794$.\nFor this value of $a$, the covariance matrix (second moment tensor) is\nproportional to the identity, consistent with a theorem of Zamir and Feder for\noptimal quantizers.

The origin of synchronisation is a\ncombination of long-range hydrodynamic interactions with physical mechanisms\nallowing the phases of these biological oscillators to evolve. Two of such\nmechanisms have been identified by previous work, the elastic compliance of the\nperiodic orbit or oscillations driven by phase-dependent biological forcing. To\nhelp uncover the physical mechanism for hydrodynamic synchronisation most\nessential overall in biology, we theoretically investigate the effect of strong\nconfinement on the effectiveness of hydrodynamic synchronisation. We use\nminimal models where appendages are modelled as rigid spheres forced to move\nalong circular trajectories near a rigid surface. Strong confinement is\nmodelled by adding a second nearby surface, parallel to the first one, where\nthe distance between the surfaces is much smaller than the typical distance\nbetween the cilia. We calculate separately the impact of confinement on the\nsynchronisation dynamics of the elastic compliance and the force modulation\nmechanisms and compare our results to the case with no confinement. Applying\nour results to the biologically-relevant situation of nodal cilia, we show that\nforce modulation is a mechanism that leads to phase-locked states under strong\nconfinement that are very similar to those without confinement as a difference\nwith the elastic compliance mechanism. Our results point therefore to the\nrobustness of force modulation for synchronisation, an important feature for\nbiological dynamics that suggests it could be the most essential physical\nmechanism overall in arrays of nodal cilia. We further examine the distinct\nsituation of primary cilia and show in that case that the difference in\nrobustness of the mechanisms is not as pronounced but still favours the force\nmodulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

We\nsupplement a previous mathematical model of the dynamics of bendotaxis with a\nsimple model of contact angle hysteresis, and show that this model predicts\ndroplet trapping when hysteresis is sufficiently strong. By identifying the\nequilibrium configurations adopted by these trapped droplets and assessing\ntheir linear stability, we uncover a sensitive dependence of bendotaxis on\ncontact angle hysteresis and develop criteria to describe when droplets will be\ntrapped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 17:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

Using the linear density\non different scales, we find two types of correlations. The internal\ncorrelation, which reflects the correlation of halo properties with the mean\nlinear over-density $\\delta_{\\rm L}$ within the halo Lagrangian radius $R_{\\rm\nL}$, is positive for both $z_{\\rm f}$ and $v_{\\rm max}/v_{\\rm 200}$, and\nnegative for $\\lambda$.

Both\nof the external and internal correlations depend only weakly on halo mass,\nindicating a similar origin for halos of different masses.

One of the competing\ntheories of their origin is the interchange reconnection in the solar corona.\nIn this scenario, switchbacks are generated at the reconnection site between\nopen and closed magnetic fields, and are either advected by an upflow or\npropagate as waves into the solar wind. In this paper we test the wave\nhypothesis, numerically modelling the propagation of a switchback, modelled as\nan embedded Alfv\\'en wave packet of constant magnetic field magnitude, through\nthe gravitationally stratified solar corona with different degrees of\nbackground magnetic field expansion. While switchbacks propagating in a uniform\nmedium with no gravity are relatively stable, as reported previously, we find\nthat gravitational stratification together with the expansion of the magnetic\nfield act in multiple ways to deform the switchbacks. These include WKB\neffects, which depend on the degree of magnetic field expansion, and also\nfinite-amplitude effects, such as the symmetry breaking between nonlinear\nadvection and the Lorentz force. In a straight or radially expanding magnetic\nfield the propagating switchbacks unfold into waves that cause minimal magnetic\nfield deflections, while a super-radially expanding magnetic field aids in\nmaintaining strong deflections. Other important effects are the mass uplift the\npropagating switchbacks induce and the reconnection and drainage of plasmoids\ncontained within the switchbacks. In the Appendix, we examine a series of\nsetups with different switchback configurations and parameters, which broaden\nthe scope of our study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 17:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

There has been a\ncritical need for high-quality motion data that is rich in both interactions\nand annotation to develop motion planning models. In this work, we introduce\nthe most diverse interactive motion dataset to our knowledge, and provide\nspecific labels for interacting objects suitable for developing joint\nprediction models.

This task requires an AI to comprehend given steps of multimodal\ninstructions and then answer questions. Compared to vanilla machine\ncomprehension tasks where an AI is required only to understand a textual input,\nprocedural M3C is more challenging as the AI needs to comprehend both the\ntemporal and causal factors along with multimodal inputs. Recently Yagcioglu et\nal. [35] introduced RecipeQA dataset to evaluate M3C. Our first contribution is\nthe introduction of two new M3C datasets- WoodworkQA and DecorationQA with 16K\nand 10K instructional procedures, respectively. We then evaluate M3C using a\ntextual cloze style question-answering task and highlight an inherent bias in\nthe question answer generation method from [35] that enables a naive baseline\nto cheat by learning from only answer choices. This naive baseline performs\nsimilar to a popular method used in question answering- Impatient Reader [6]\nthat uses attention over both the context and the query. We hypothesized that\nthis naturally occurring bias present in the dataset affects even the best\nperforming model. We verify our proposed hypothesis and propose an algorithm\ncapable of modifying the given dataset to remove the bias elements. Finally, we\nreport our performance on the debiased dataset with several strong baselines.\nWe observe that the performance of all methods falls by a margin of 8% - 16%\nafter correcting for the bias.

However, classical subset selection is often\navoided due to selection instability, lack of regularization, and difficulties\nwith post-selection inference. We address these challenges from a Bayesian\nperspective. Given any Bayesian predictive model $\\mathcal{M}$, we extract a\nfamily of near-optimal subsets of variables for linear prediction or\nclassification. This strategy deemphasizes the role of a single \"best\" subset\nand instead advances the broader perspective that often many subsets are highly\ncompetitive. The acceptable family of subsets offers a new pathway for model\ninterpretation and is neatly summarized by key members such as the smallest\nacceptable subset, along with new (co-) variable importance metrics based on\nwhether variables (co-) appear in all, some, or no acceptable subsets. More\nbroadly, we apply Bayesian decision analysis to derive the optimal linear\ncoefficients for any subset of variables. These coefficients inherit both\nregularization and predictive uncertainty quantification via $\\mathcal{M}$.

In\nparticular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled\nprobabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes\ncomplete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other\npath generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded\ndistribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path\nduring training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design\npoint self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit\nrelational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the\ncoarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud\ndataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders\npartial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD\nmodel.

Interestingly, Berga and Moreno\n(2020), have recently derived preference reversal from group strategy-proofness\nof social choice functions on strict preferences domains if the range has no\nmore than three elements. We extend this result and at the same time simplify\nit. Our analysis points out the role of individual strategy-proofness in\nderiving the preference reversal property, giving back to the latter its\noriginal individual nature (cfr. Eliaz, 2004).\n  Moreover, we show that the difficulties Berga and Moreno highlighted relaxing\nthe assumption on the cardinality of the range, disappear under a proper\nassumption on the domain. We introduce the concept of complete sets of\npreferences and show that individual strategy-proofness is sufficient to obtain\nthe preference reversal property when the agents' feasible set of orderings is\ncomplete.

The total derivative formula represents the evolution of the\nconditional expectation process as a sum of the expected dynamics of hysteresis\nwith respect to time, a form of a time derivative, and the expected dynamics of\nhysteresis with the shocks to the trajectory of the stochastic process, a form\nof a stochastic derivative. We then generalize the results. First, we propose a\ngeneral class of hysteresis functionals that permits significant tractability.\nSecond, we characterize in closed form the dynamics of the stochastic\nhysteresis elasticity that represents the change in the whole optimal policy\nprocess with an introduction of small hysteresis effects. Third, we determine\nthe optimal policy process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 19:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

We used ALMA to\nobtain new images of the emission of molecular gas and dust using the CO(3-2)\nand HCO+(4-3) lines as well as their underlying continuum emission at 870\nmicrons with high spatial resolutions (0.1'' ~ 7 - 13 pc) in the CND of 10\nnearby (D < 28 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies. Our new ALMA observations detect 870\nmicron continuum and CO line emission from spatially resolved disks located\naround the AGN in all the sources. The bulk of the continuum flux can be\naccounted for by thermal emission from dust in the majority of the targets. For\nmost of the sources the disks show a preponderant orientation perpendicular to\nthe AGN wind axes, as expected for dusty molecular tori. The median diameters\nand molecular gas masses of the tori are ~ 42 pc, and ~ 6 x 10**5 Msun,\nrespectively. We find a positive correlation between the line-of-sight gas\ncolumn densities responsible for the absorption of X-rays and the molecular gas\ncolumn densities derived from CO towards the AGN in our sources.

One of the biggest challenges in this domain\nlies in creating algorithms that can continuously adapt to arriving data.\nHowever, previously learned knowledge may become outdated, as streams evolve\nover time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and must be detected to\nfacilitate efficient adaptation of the learning model. While there exists a\nplethora of drift detectors, all of them assume that we are dealing with\nroughly balanced classes. In the case of imbalanced data streams, those\ndetectors will be biased towards the majority classes, ignoring changes\nhappening in the minority ones. Furthermore, class imbalance may evolve over\ntime and classes may change their roles (majority becoming minority and vice\nversa). This is especially challenging in the multi-class setting, where\nrelationships among classes become complex. In this paper, we propose a\ndetailed taxonomy of challenges posed by concept drift in multi-class\nimbalanced data streams, as well as a novel trainable concept drift detector\nbased on Restricted Boltzmann Machine. It is capable of monitoring multiple\nclasses at once and using reconstruction error to detect changes in each of\nthem independently.

Extensive experimental study on multi-class drifting data streams,\nenriched with a detailed analysis of the impact of local drifts and changing\nimbalance ratios, confirms the high efficacy of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 20:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

Metamaterial-based\ninvisibility cloaking, which was considered a promising solution, did not yet\nsucceed in delivering reliable performance against real radar systems, mainly\ndue to its narrow operational bandwidth. Here we propose an approach, which\naddresses the issue from a signal-processing standpoint and, as a result, is\ncapable of coping with the vast majority of unclassified radar systems by\nexploiting vulnerabilities in their design. In particular, we demonstrate\ncomplete concealment of a 0.25 square meter moving metal plate from an\ninvestigating radar system, operating in a broad frequency range approaching\n20% bandwidth around the carrier of 1.5GHz. The key element of the radar\ncountermeasure is a temporally modulated coating. This auxiliary structure is\ndesigned to dynamically and controllably adjust the reflected phase of the\nimpinging radar signal, which acquires a user-defined Doppler shift. A special\ncase of interest is imposing a frequency shift that compensates for the real\nDoppler signatures originating from the motion of the target. In this case the\nradar will consider the target static, even though it is moving. As a result,\nthe reflected echo will be discarded by the clutter removal filter, which is an\ninherent part of any modern radar system that is designed to operate in real\nconditions. This signal-processing loophole allows rendering the target\ninvisible to the radar even though it scatters electromagnetic radiation.

So, it\nis feasible to help decision-makers apply appropriate aid actions and,\npossibly, reduce student dropout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Since bugs in smart contracts may lead to\nsubstantial financial losses, there is considerable interest in formally\nproving their correctness. However, the specification and verification of smart\ncontracts faces challenges that do not arise in other application domains.\nSmart contracts frequently interact with unverified, potentially adversarial\noutside code, which substantially weakens the assumptions that formal analyses\ncan (soundly) make. Moreover, the core functionality of smart contracts is to\nmanipulate and transfer resources; describing this functionality concisely\nrequires dedicated specification support. Current reasoning techniques do not\nfully address these challenges, being restricted in their scope or\nexpressiveness (in particular, in the presence of re-entrant calls), and\noffering limited means of expressing the resource transfers a contract\nperforms.\n  In this paper, we present a novel specification methodology tailored to the\ndomain of smart contracts.

In particular, consumers usually make choices based more\non the average than the marginal prices, which can result in a suboptimal\nbehavior. Taking the misspecification in the marginal price as exogenous, this\ndocument analyzes how is the optimal quadratic price scheme for a monopolist\nand the optimal quadratic price scheme that maximizes welfare when there is a\ncontinuum of representative consumers with an arbitrary perception of the\nmarginal price. Under simple preferences and costs functional forms and very\nstraightforward hypotheses, the results suggest that the bias in the marginal\nprice doesn't affect the maximum welfare attainable with quadratic price\nschemes, and it has a negligible effect over the efficiency cost caused by the\nmonopolist, so the misspecification in the marginal price is not relevant for\nwelfare increasing policies. However, almost always the misspecification in the\nmarginal price is beneficial for the monopolist. An interesting result is that\nunder these functional forms, more misspecification in the marginal price is\nbeneficial for both the consumers and the monopolist if the level of bias is\nlow, so not always is socially optima to have educated consumers about the real\nmarginal price. Finally, the document shows that the bias in the marginal price\nhas a negative effect on reduction of aggregate consumption using two-tier\nincreasing tariffs, which are commonly used for reduction of aggregate\nconsumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 23:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

A beam size of 5--10 $\\mu$m can be achieved within a short\ndistance using a focusing gradient on the order of 100 T/m. The active plasma\nlens is therefore an attractive element for plasma wakefield acceleration,\nbecause an ultra-small size of the witness electron beam is required for\ninjection into the plasma wakefield to minimize emittance growth and to enhance\nthe capturing efficiency. When the drive beam and witness electron beam\nco-propagate through the active plasma lens, interactions between the drive and\nwitness beams, and the plasma must be considered.

Furthermore, the\nmaterials currently used to assemble these structures are predominantly\nmagnetic metals that do not allow to study the magnetic response of the system\nseparately from the electronic one. In the field of spintronics, the\nprototypical material used for such experiments is the ferrimagnetic insulator\nyttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG). YIG is one of the best\nmaterials especially for magnonic studies due to its low Gilbert damping. Here,\nwe report the first successful fabrication of YIG thin films via atomic layer\ndeposition.

This learning framework has led to\nstate-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,\nclassical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating\noptimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or\nconvergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding\nwith a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the\ndevelopment of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex\napproaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an\natom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works\nseek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially\nreduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is\ndegraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed\nscheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage\noptimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary\nrecovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom\ncalculation.

These techniques generally involve the use of a calibration target\nthat is assumed to be at the exact centre of the laser sheet within the field\nof view (FOV), which in practice is very difficult to achieve. In 3C-2D SPIV,\nseveral methods offer different correction schemes based on the computation of\na disparity map, which are aimed at correcting errors produced due to this\nmisalignment.

It is also confirmed that a\nTransformer-based hybrid CTC/Attention ASR model using the aligned speech and\ntext pairs as an additional training data reduces character error rates\nrelatively up to 59.0%, which is significantly better than 39.0% reduction by a\nconventional alignment method based on connectionist temporal classification\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 03:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

Note that these\nRoI-wise representations in step 2) are considered individually as uncorrelated\nentries when fed to following detection headers.

Such data units are best described as taking\nvalues in a space of functions. Subject units carrying the observations may\nhave intrinsic relations among themselves, and are best described by the nodes\nof a large graph. It is often sensible to think that the underlying signals in\nthese functional observations vary smoothly over the graph, in that neighboring\nnodes have similar underlying signals. This qualitative information allows\nborrowing of strength over neighboring nodes and consequently leads to more\naccurate inference. In this paper, we consider a model with Gaussian functional\nobservations and adopt a Bayesian approach to smoothing over the nodes of the\ngraph. We characterize the minimax rate of estimation in terms of the\nregularity of the signals and their variation across nodes quantified in terms\nof the graph Laplacian.

Here we show\nthat essentially the same algorithm used for the SBM and for its extension\ncalled Degree-Corrected SBM, works on a wider class of Block-Models, which we\ncall Preference Frame Models, with essentially the same guarantees. Moreover,\nthe parametrization we introduce clearly exhibits the free parameters needed to\nspecify this class of models, and results in bounds that expose with more\nclarity the parameters that control the recovery error in this model class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 04:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

However, reasoning over Temporal KG (TKG) that\npredicts facts in the future is still far from resolved. The key to predict\nfuture facts is to thoroughly understand the historical facts. A TKG is\nactually a sequence of KGs corresponding to different timestamps, where all\nconcurrent facts in each KG exhibit structural dependencies and temporally\nadjacent facts carry informative sequential patterns. To capture these\nproperties effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel Recurrent Evolution\nnetwork based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN), called RE-GCN, which learns\nthe evolutional representations of entities and relations at each timestamp by\nmodeling the KG sequence recurrently. Specifically, for the evolution unit, a\nrelation-aware GCN is leveraged to capture the structural dependencies within\nthe KG at each timestamp. In order to capture the sequential patterns of all\nfacts in parallel, the historical KG sequence is modeled auto-regressively by\nthe gate recurrent components. Moreover, the static properties of entities such\nas entity types, are also incorporated via a static graph constraint component\nto obtain better entity representations. Fact prediction at future timestamps\ncan then be realized based on the evolutional entity and relation\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RE-GCN model\nobtains substantial performance and efficiency improvement for the temporal\nreasoning tasks on six benchmark datasets.

That\nrobustness arises from the fact that in the topological band gap, transport can\noccur only along the edges modes, which are immune to scattering. However, for\nsufficiently strong disorder, the band gap closes and the system becomes\ntopologically trivial as all states become localized, such that all transport\nvanishes -- in accordance with Anderson localization. It therefore came as a\nsurprise when it was suggested that, for a two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall\ntopological system, the opposite could occur. In so-called topological Anderson\ninsulators, the emergence of protected edge states and quantized transport is\ncaused by the introduction of disorder. However, to date, the observation of\nthe topological Anderson insulator phase has been elusive. In this article, we\nreport the first experimental demonstration of a topological Anderson\ninsulator. We do that in a photonic implementation: an array of helical,\nevanescently-coupled waveguides in a detuned honeycomb geometry.

By introducing the neural\nnetworks to classic methods based on problem-specific knowledge, the\nadaptability of the normal estimation algorithm to noise and scale has been\ngreatly improved. However, the compatibility between neural networks and the\ntraditional methods has not been considered. Similar to the principle of\nOccam's razor, that is, the simpler is better. We observe that a more\nsimplified process of surface fitting can significantly improve the accuracy of\nthe normal estimation. In this paper, two simple-yet-effective strategies are\nproposed to address the compatibility between the neural networks and surface\nfitting process to improve normal estimation. Firstly, a dynamic top-k\nselection strategy is introduced to better focus on the most critical points of\na given patch, and the points selected by our learning method tend to fit a\nsurface by way of a simple tangent plane, which can dramatically improve the\nnormal estimation results of patches with sharp corners or complex patterns.\nThen, we propose a point update strategy before local surface fitting, which\nsmooths the sharp boundary of the patch to simplify the surface fitting\nprocess, significantly reducing the fitting distortion and improving the\naccuracy of the predicted point normal. The experiments analyze the\neffectiveness of our proposed strategies and demonstrate that our method\nachieves SOTA results with the advantage of higher estimation accuracy over\nmost existed approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 06:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The challenge is to design an algorithm which is efficient in three\ndifferent aspects: time to find $f$ (construction time), time to evaluate $f$\non a key of $S$ (lookup time), and space of representation for $f$. Several\nalgorithms have been proposed to trade-off between these aspects. In 1992, Fox,\nChen, and Heath (FCH) presented an algorithm at SIGIR providing very fast\nlookup evaluation.

For this\nissue, an effective solution is knowledge distillation, which transfers\nknowledge from a large pre-trained network (teacher) to a small network\n(student). However, there are some defects in the existing approaches: (I) Only\na single teacher is adopted, neglecting the potential that a student can learn\nfrom multiple teachers. (II) The human segmentation mask can be regarded as\nadditional prior information to restrict the location of keypoints, which is\nnever utilized. (III) A student with a small number of parameters cannot fully\nimitate heatmaps provided by datasets and teachers. (IV) There exists noise in\nheatmaps generated by teachers, which causes model degradation. To overcome\nthese defects, we propose an orderly dual-teacher knowledge distillation (ODKD)\nframework, which consists of two teachers with different capabilities.\nSpecifically, the weaker one (primary teacher, PT) is used to teach keypoints\ninformation, the stronger one (senior teacher, ST) is utilized to transfer\nsegmentation and keypoints information by adding the human segmentation mask.\nTaking dual-teacher together, an orderly learning strategy is proposed to\npromote knowledge absorbability.

If the\njob completes before the timeout, it leaves the network, otherwise the job is\nterminated and relaunched or resumed at another server where it will complete.\nWe provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of\nspeculative queueing networks with heterogeneous servers, general job sizes and\nscheduling disciplines. We find that speculation can increase the stability\nregion of the network when compared with standard load balancing models and\nreplication schemes. We provide general conditions under which timeouts\nincrease the size of the stability region and derive a formula for the optimal\nspeculation time, i.e., the timeout that minimizes the load induced through\nspeculation. We compare speculation with redundant-$d$ and\nredundant-to-idle-queue-$d$ rules under an $S\\& X$ model. For light loaded\nsystems, redundancy schemes provide better response times. However, for\nmoderate to heavy loadings, redundancy schemes can lose capacity and have\nmarkedly worse response times when compared with a speculative scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 09:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 15:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

We aim to understand better how the past traits of their ancestors\nare shaped by the adaptation to the varying environment. The individuals are\ncharacterized by a one-dimensional trait. The dynamics -- births and deaths --\ndepend on a time-changing mortality rate that shifts the optimal trait to the\nright at constant speed. The population size is regulated by a nonlinear\nnon-local logistic competition term. The macroscopic behaviour can be described\nby a PDE that admits a unique positive stationary solution. In the stationary\nregime, the population can persist, but with a lag in the trait distribution\ndue to the environmental change. For the microscopic (individual-based)\nstochastic process, the evolution of the lineages can be traced back using the\nhistorical process, that is, a measure-valued process on the set of continuous\nreal functions of time. Assuming stationarity of the trait distribution, we\ndescribe the limiting distribution, in large populations, of the path of an\nindividual drawn at random at a given time $T$. Freezing the non-linearity due\nto competition allows the use of a many-to-one identity together with\nFeynman-Kac's formula. This path, in reversed time, remains close to a simple\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. It shows how the lagged bulk of the present\npopulation stems from ancestors once optimal in trait but still in the tail of\nthe trait distribution in which they lived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 09:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

Ferroelectric domain walls have been a prominent\nrecent example because they serve as a hub for topological defects that enable\nunusual symmetries and are relevant for low-energy switching technologies.\nHowever, owing to the light weight of oxygen atoms and localized effects of\ntheir vacancies, the atomic-scale electrical and mechanical influence of oxygen\nvacancies has remained elusive. Here, stable individual oxygen vacancies were\nfound and engineered in situ at domain walls of seminal titanate perovskite\nferroics. The atomic-scale strain, electric-field, charge and dipole-moment\ndistribution around these vacancies were characterized by combining advanced\ntransmission electron microscopy and first-principle methodologies. 3-5 %\ntensile strain was observed at the immediate surrounding unit cells of the\nvacancies. The dipole-moment distribution around the vacancy was found to be an\nalternating head-to-head $-$ tail-to-tail $-$ head-to-head structure, giving\nrise to a quasi-linear quadrupole topology. Reduction of the nearby Ti ion as\nwell as enhanced charging and electric-field concentration near the vacancy\nconfirmed the quadrupole structure and illustrated its local effects on the\nelectrical and structural properties.

Hot subdwarfs experienced strong mass loss on the Red Giant Branch\n(RGB) and are now hot and small He-burning objects. Aims. In this project we\naim to perform a transit survey in all available light curves of hot subdwarfs\nfrom space-based telescopes (Kepler, K2, TESS, and CHEOPS), with our\ncustom-made pipeline SHERLOCK, in order to determine the occurrence rate of\nplanets around these stars, as a function of orbital period and planetary\nradius. Methods. In this first paper, we perform injection-and-recovery tests\nof synthetic transits for a selection of representative Kepler, K2 and TESS\nlight curves, to determine which transiting bodies, in terms of object radius\nand orbital period, we will be able to detect with our tools. We also provide\nsuch estimates for CHEOPS data, which we analyze with the pycheops package.\nResults. Transiting objects with a radius $\\lesssim$ 1.0 $R_{\\Earth}$ can be\ndetected in most of Kepler, K2 and CHEOPS targets for the shortest orbital\nperiods (1 d and below), reaching values as small as $\\sim$0.3 $R_{\\Earth}$ in\nthe best cases.

The nitrogen reservoir in planetary systems is a long standing\nproblem. Part of the N-bearing molecules is probably incorporated into the ice\nbulk during the cold phases of the stellar evolution, and may be gradually\nreleased into the gas phase when the ice is heated, such as in active comets.\nThe chemical nature of the N-reservoir should greatly influence how, when and\nin what form N returns to the gas phase, or is incorporated into the refractory\nmaterial forming planetary bodies.\n  Aims. We present the study the thermal desorption of two ammonium salts:\nammonium formate and ammonium acetate from a gold surface and from a water ice\nsubstrate.\n  Methods. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments and Fourier transform\ninfrared reflection spectroscopy were conducted to investigate the desorption\nbehavior of ammonium salts.\n  Results. Ammonium salts are semi-volatile species releasing neutral species\nas major components upon desorption, that is ammonia and the corresponding\norganic acid (HCOOH and CH3COOH), at temperatures higher than the temperature\nof thermal desorption of water ice.

Fuzz testing is one of the effective techniques to detect\nvulnerabilities in general. Greybox fuzzers such as AFL automatically generate\na sequence of test inputs for a given program using a fitness-guided search\nprocess. A recently proposed approach in the literature introduced a\nbuffer-overrun specific fitness metric called \"headroom\", which tracks how\nclose each generated test input comes to exposing the vulnerabilities.

Inspired by the\napproach above, in this paper we propose a new ground-up approach for detecting\nbuffer-overrun vulnerabilities. This approach uses an extended version of ASAN\n(Address Sanitizer) that runs in parallel with the fuzzer, and reports back to\nthe fuzzer test inputs that happen to come closer to exposing buffer-overrun\nvulnerabilities.

Furthermore,\nthe spacetime dimensions and other parameters of black hole, such as the\nelectric charge, have important impact on the NHC inside the horizon.

Untrimmed videos have\nredundant and diverse clips containing contextual information, so sampling\ndense clips is essential. Recently, some works attempt to train a generic model\nto select the N most representative clips. However, it is difficult to model\nthe complex relations from intra-class clips and inter-class videos within a\nsingle model and fixed selected number, and the entanglement of multiple\nrelations is also hard to explain. Thus, instead of \"only look once\", we argue\n\"divide and conquer\" strategy will be more suitable in untrimmed VAR. Inspired\nby the speed reading mechanism, we propose a simple yet effective clip-level\nsolution based on skim-scan techniques. Specifically, the proposed Skim-Scan\nframework first skims the entire video and drops those uninformative and\nmisleading clips. For the remaining clips, it scans clips with diverse features\ngradually to drop redundant clips but cover essential content. The above\nstrategies can adaptively select the necessary clips according to the\ndifficulty of the different videos.

We impose line-tied boundary\nconditions and tilt the background magnetic field to be oblique to the\ntransition region. Halberstadt & Goedbloed (1993, 1995); Goedbloed& Halberstadt\n(1994); Arregui et al. (2003) show that line-tied boundary conditions cause\ntheir resonant absorption models to produce steep boundary layers/evanescent\nfast waves. We aim to study the importance of the boundary layers and assess\ntheir significance in a solar context. We calculate the solutions in a model\nwhere we impose line-tied boundary conditions and compare this with a model\nwhere we include the chromosphere instead. Results are calculated analytically\nand then verified numerically. We show that line-tied boundary conditions can\ncause the model to overestimate the boundary layers' amplitude significantly.\nIf the fast waves can propagate in the chromosphere, then the line-tied model\naccurately predicts the boundary layers' amplitude. However, if the fast waves\nare evanescent, then the boundary layers' size is reduced significantly, and\nthe line-tied model overestimates their amplitude. This leads to the\ncounter-intuitive result that the length scales tangential to the transition\nregion can play an essential role in determining line-tied boundary conditions'\nvalidity. The results suggest that line-tied boundary conditions can cause the\nmodel to generate unphysically large boundary layers. However, researchers may\nwish to continue to use them in their models for their simplicity and ability\nto significantly reduce computation time if they understand and are aware of\ntheir flaws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 12:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The\nground state of this model is a canonical quantum spin liquid with spin\nfractionalization into two types of quasiparticles, itinerant Majorana fermions\nand localized fluxes. Using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we\ncalculate the temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor, the\nmagnetic susceptibility, and the NMR relaxation rate. In the dynamical spin\nstructure factor, we find that the two types of disorder affect seriously the\nlow-energy peak dominantly originating from the flux excitations, rather than\nthe high-energy continuum from the Majorana excitations, in a different way:\nThe bond randomness softens the peak to the lower energy with broadening,\nwhereas the site dilution smears the peak and in addition develops the other\nsharp peaks inside the spin gap including the zero energy. We show that the\nzero-energy spin excitations, which originate from the Majorana zero modes\ninduced around the site vacancies, survive up to the temperature comparable to\nthe energy scale of the Kitaev interaction. For the bond randomness, the\nlow-temperature susceptibility does not show any qualitative change against the\nweak disorder, but it changes to divergent behavior while increasing the\nstrength of disorder. Similar distinct behaviors for the weak and strong\ndisorder are observed also in the NMR relaxation rate; an exponential decay\nchanges into a power-law decay. In contrast, for the site dilution, we find no\nsuch crossover; divergent behavior in the susceptibility and a power-law decay\nin the NMR relaxation rate appear immediately with the introduction of the site\ndilution.

In this work, we report on an advanced mycotoxin biosensor based on an\narray of graphene field-effect transistors integrated on a single silicon chip.\nA specifically designed aptamer against Ochratoxin A (OTA) was used as a\nrecognition element, where it was covalently attached to graphene surface via\npyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (PBASE) chemistry. Namely, an electric\nfield stimulation was used to promote more efficient {\\pi}-{\\pi} stacking of\nPBASE to graphene. The specific G-rich aptamer strand suggest its {\\pi}-{\\pi}\nstacking on graphene in free-standing regime and reconfiguration in\nG-quadruplex during binding an OTA molecule. This realistic behavior of the\naptamer is sensitive to the ionic strength of the analyte solution,\ndemonstrating a 10-fold increase in sensitivity at low ionic strengths. The\ngraphene-aptamer sensors reported here demonstrate fast assay with the lowest\ndetection limit of 1.4 pM for OTA within a response time as low as 10 s, which\nis more than 30 times faster compared to any other reported aptamer-based\nmethods for mycotoxin detection. The sensors hold comparable performance when\noperated in real-time within a complex matrix of wine without additional\ntime-consuming pre-treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 03:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

Photothermal\nimaging is a well-known technique in active thermography for nondestructive\ninspection of defects in materials such as metals or composites. A grand\nchallenge of active thermography is to overcome the spatial resolution\nlimitation imposed by heat diffusion in order to accurately resolve each\ndefect. The photothermal SR approach enables to extract high-frequency spatial\ncomponents based on the deconvolution with the thermal point spread function.\nHowever, stable deconvolution can only be achieved by using the sparse\nstructure of defect patterns, which often requires tedious, hand-crafted tuning\nof hyperparameters and results in computationally intensive algorithms. On this\naccount, Photothermal-SR-Net is proposed in this paper, which performs\ndeconvolution by deep unfolding considering the underlying physics. This\nenables to super resolve 2D thermal images for nondestructive testing with a\nsubstantially improved convergence rate. Since defects appear sparsely in\nmaterials, Photothermal-SR-Net applies trained block-sparsity thresholding to\nthe acquired thermal images in each convolutional layer.

However, it is still challenging to propose a robust makeup transfer\nmethod in the real-world environment.

To alleviate it, we propose a\nnovel makeup transfer method, called 3D-Aware Shadow and Occlusion Robust GAN\n(SOGAN). Given the source and the reference faces, we first fit a 3D face model\nand then disentangle the faces into shape and texture. In the texture branch,\nwe map the texture to the UV space and design a UV texture generator to\ntransfer the makeup. Since human faces are symmetrical in the UV space, we can\nconveniently remove the undesired shadow and occlusion from the reference image\nby carefully designing a Flip Attention Module (FAM). After obtaining cleaner\nmakeup features from the reference image, a Makeup Transfer Module (MTM) is\nintroduced to perform accurate makeup transfer. The qualitative and\nquantitative experiments demonstrate that our SOGAN not only achieves superior\nresults in shadow and occlusion situations but also performs well in large pose\nand expression variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

The band structure of the\ninfinitely periodic systems and scattering off a finite thickness slab of such\nmedia are determined using the transfer matrix method. A consistent dynamic\nfield homogenization approach is applied, in which the micro-scale field\nequations are integrated and the overall macro-scale quantities are defined to\nbe compatible with these integral forms. A reduced set of constitutive tensors\nis presented for general asymmetric repeating unit cells (RUC), utilizing the\nproposed homogenized macro-scale quantities combined with Onsager's principle\nand presumed material form of elastodynamic reciprocity. This set can be\nfurther restricted by studying the form of the dispersion equation leading to a\nunique constitutive tensor. It is shown that for an asymmetric RUC, the full\nconstitutive tensor are required to match the scattering and band structure of\nthe micro-structured media, but all the off-diagonal parameters vanish for a\nsymmetric RUC. Therefore, it is possible to create an equivalent homogenized\nrepresentation with a uniquely determined diagonal constitutive tensor for a\nsymmetric RUC, though, as is the case also with asymmetric RUCs, all non-zero\ncomponents will be wave-vector dependent.

We find that the mode property of the drag\ninstability generally depends on the ratio of the transverse (normal to the\nshock flow) to longitudinal (along the shock flow) wavenumber. For the\ntransversely large-scale mode, the growth rate and wave frequency of the drag\ninstability in a 2D shock resemble those in a 1D shock. For the transversely\nsmall-scale mode, the drag instability is characterized by an unstable mode\ncoupled with an acoustic mode primarily along the transverse direction. When\nthe shock is perpendicular or less oblique, there exists a slowly propagating\nmode, which can potentially grow into a nonlinear regime and contribute to the\nmaximum growth of the instability. In contrast, when the shock is more oblique,\nthis slowly propagating unstable mode disappears, and the maximum growth of the\ndrag instability is likely contributed from the transversely large-scale mode\n(i.e., almost 1D mode). In all cases that we consider, the magnitude of the\ndensity perturbations is significantly larger than that of the velocity and\nmagnetic field perturbations, implying that the density enhancement governs the\ndynamics in the linear regime of the instability. A few issues in the linear\nanalysis, as well as the possible astrophysical implications, are also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 15:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 15:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

Saving a subset of training samples of\npreviously seen classes in the memory and replaying them during new training\nphases is proven to be an efficient and effective way to fulfil this aim. It is\nevident that the larger number of exemplars the model inherits the better\nperformance it can achieve. However, finding a trade-off between the model\nperformance and the number of samples to save for each class is still an open\nproblem for replay-based incremental learning and is increasingly desirable for\nreal-life applications. In this paper, we approach this open problem by tapping\ninto a two-step compression approach. The first step is a lossy compression, we\npropose to encode input images and save their discrete latent representations\nin the form of codes that are learned using a hierarchical Vector Quantised\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). In the second step, we further compress codes\nlosslessly by learning a hierarchical latent variable model with bits-back\nasymmetric numeral systems (BB-ANS).

Within this framework, effects of (turbulent) friction\nnear the ground are usually represented by Ekman Layer theory. The troposphere\ncovers roughly the lowest ten kilometers of the atmosphere while Ekman layer\nheights are typically just a few hundred meters. However, this two-layer\nasymptotic theory does not explicitly account for substantial changes of the\npotential temperature stratification due to diabatic heating associated with\ncloud formation or with radiative and turbulent heat fluxes, which, in the\nmiddle latitudes, can be particularly important in about the lowest three\nkilometers. To address this deficiency, this paper extends the classical\nQG-Ekman layer model by introducing an intermediate, dynamically and\nthermodynamically active layer, called the \"diabatic layer\" (DL) from here on.\nThe flow in this layer is also in acoustic, hydrostatic, and geostrophic\nbalance but, in contrast to QG flow, variations of potential temperature are\nnot restricted to small deviations from a stable and time independent\nbackground stratification. Instead, within the diabatic layer, diabatic\nprocesses are allowed to affect the leading-order stratification. As a\nconsequence, the diabatic layer modifies the pressure field at the top of the\nEkman layer, and with it the intensity of Ekman pumping seen by the\nquasi-geostrophic bulk flow. The result is the proposed extended\nquasi-geostrophic three-layer QG-DL-Ekman model for mid-latitude (dry and\nmoist) dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 15:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

To\nenforce similar outputs from the two branches and depict the adapted knowledge,\nwe propose a source-free image translation method that generates source-style\nimages using only target images and the two models. We visualize the adapted\nknowledge on several datasets with different UDA methods and find that\ngenerated images successfully capture the style difference between the two\ndomains. For application, we show that generated images enable further tuning\nof the target model without accessing source data.

However, the major disadvantage of\nneural networks remains: their numerous parameters are challenging to interpret\nand explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled as black boxes, and their\nresults often elude human interpretation. In mechanics, the new and active\nfield of physics-informed neural networks attempts to mitigate this\ndisadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the basis of mechanical\nknowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and more complex neural\nnetworks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions could be explained.\nHowever, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural network parameters\nremain mysterious.\n  Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step\ntowards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on\nmechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence\napproach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their\nhigh-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis\ndecorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows\nthe comparison to known and fundamental functions.

Recent advances in experimental techniques have enabled sequencing of\nTCRs and their antigenic targets (epitopes), allowing to research the missing\nlink between TCR sequence and epitope binding specificity. Scarcity of data and\na large sequence space make this task challenging, and to date only models\nlimited to a small set of epitopes have achieved good performance. Here, we\nestablish a k-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) classifier as a strong baseline and then\npropose TITAN (Tcr epITope bimodal Attention Networks), a bimodal neural\nnetwork that explicitly encodes both TCR sequences and epitopes to enable the\nindependent study of generalization capabilities to unseen TCRs and/or\nepitopes. Results: By encoding epitopes at the atomic level with SMILES\nsequences, we leverage transfer learning and data augmentation to enrich the\ninput data space and boost performance. TITAN achieves high performance in the\nprediction of specificity of unseen TCRs (ROC-AUC 0.87 in 10-fold CV) and\nsurpasses the results of the current state-of-the-art (ImRex) by a large\nmargin. Notably, our Levenshtein-distance-based K-NN classifier also exhibits\ncompetitive performance on unseen TCRs. While the generalization to unseen\nepitopes remains challenging, we report two major breakthroughs. First, by\ndissecting the attention heatmaps, we demonstrate that the sparsity of\navailable epitope data favors an implicit treatment of epitopes as classes.\nThis may be a general problem that limits unseen epitope performance for\nsufficiently complex models. Second, we show that TITAN nevertheless exhibits\nsignificantly improved performance on unseen epitopes and is capable of\nfocusing attention on chemically meaningful molecular structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 09:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

Among all the proposed KT\nmethods, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and its variants are by far the most\neffective ones due to the high flexibility of the neural network. However, DKT\noften ignores the inherent differences between students (e.g. memory skills,\nreasoning skills, ...), averaging the performances of all students, leading to\nthe lack of personalization, and therefore was considered insufficient for\nadaptive learning. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we proposed\nLeveled Attentive KNowledge TrAcing (LANA), which firstly uses a novel\nstudent-related features extractor (SRFE) to distill students' unique inherent\nproperties from their respective interactive sequences. Secondly, the pivot\nmodule was utilized to dynamically reconstruct the decoder of the neural\nnetwork on attention of the extracted features, successfully distinguishing the\nperformance between students over time. Moreover, inspired by Item Response\nTheory (IRT), the interpretable Rasch model was used to cluster students by\ntheir ability levels, and thereby utilizing leveled learning to assign\ndifferent encoders to different groups of students. With pivot module\nreconstructed the decoder for individual students and leveled learning\nspecialized encoders for groups, personalized DKT was achieved. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrated that\nour proposed LANA improves the AUC score by at least 1.00% (i.e. EdNet 1.46%\nand RAIEd2020 1.00%), substantially surpassing the other State-Of-The-Art KT\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 02:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}
