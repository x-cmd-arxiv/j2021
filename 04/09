From solutions of the coupled heat-conduction and\nwater-diffusion equations within the droplet and in the ambient vapor phase, we\nfind that the solute-induced water vapor-pressure reduction considerably slows\ndown the evaporation process and dominates the solute-concentration dependence\nof the droplet evaporation time. The evaporation-induced solute-concentration\ngradient near the droplet surface, which is accounted for using a two-stage\nevaporation model, is found to further intensify the slowing down of the drying\nprocess. On the other hand, the presence of solutes is found to reduce\nevaporation cooling of the droplet, which causes a slight decrease in the\nevaporation time. Overall, the first two effects are dominant, meaning that the\ndroplet evaporation time increases in the presence of solutes. The\nsolute-concentration dependence of the water diffusivity inside the droplet\ndoes not significantly change the evaporation time.

Using our numerical method, we\nshow that while using the common Erlang approximation can produce solutions\nthat are qualitatively different from the underlying gamma distributed DDE, our\nhypoexponential approximations do not have this limitation. Finally, we\nimplement our hypoexponential approximations to perform statistical inference\non synthetic epidemiological data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 16:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

This\npaper considers the DADD problem for both uncoded and coded media modulation\nbased mMTC with a slotted access frame structure, where the device activity\nremains unchanged within one frame. Specifically, due to the slotted access\nframe structure and the adopted media modulated symbols, the access signals\nexhibit a doubly structured sparsity in both the time domain and the modulation\ndomain. Inspired by this, a doubly structured approximate message passing\n(DS-AMP) algorithm is proposed for reliable DADD in the uncoded case. Also, we\nderive the state evolution of the DS-AMP algorithm to theoretically\ncharacterize its performance. As for the coded case, we develop a\nbit-interleaved coded media modulation scheme and propose an iterative DS-AMP\n(IDS-AMP) algorithm based on successive inference cancellation (SIC), where the\nsignal components associated with the detected active devices are successively\nsubtracted to improve the data decoding performance. In addition, the channel\nestimation problem for media modulation based mMTC is discussed and an\nefficient data-aided channel state information (CSI) update strategy is\ndeveloped to reduce the training overhead in block fading channels. Finally,\nsimulation results and computational complexity analysis verify the superiority\nof the proposed algorithms in both uncoded and coded cases. Also, our results\nverify the validity of the proposed data-aided CSI update strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 16:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 03:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Due to wake effects, the available\npower is reduced and turbulence is increased at downstream wind turbines. Such\neffects lead to a design challenge for wind farm control, where the delicate\nbalance between supply and demand should be maintained, while considering the\nload balancing in the wind turbine structures. We propose a control\narchitecture based on simple feedback controllers that adjusts the demanded\npower set points of individual wind turbines to compensate for turbine\nsaturations and to balance thrust forces. For compensation purposes, the\ndynamics of power tracking in the wind turbines is approximated as a pure\ntime-delay process, and the thrust force balance design is based on an\nidentified linear model of the turbines. In this paper, we show that the\nproposed control architecture allows the generated power to track its reference\neven when turbines saturate, while the thrust forces are balanced. In addition,\nthe result shows that the proposed power dispatch strategy, which considers\nthrust force balance, also avoids turbine saturation, being thus beneficial for\nenergy production. The effectiveness of the proposed feedback controller is\ndemonstrated using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of a\nsmall wind farm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 17:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

Recently, some blind and non-blind models\nfor multiple degradations have been explored.

Towards this end, we propose a conditional meta-network framework (named\nCMDSR) for the first time, which helps SR framework learn how to adapt to\nchanges in input distribution. We extract degradation prior at task-level with\nthe proposed ConditionNet, which will be used to adapt the parameters of the\nbasic SR network (BaseNet). Specifically, the ConditionNet of our framework\nfirst learns the degradation prior from a support set, which is composed of a\nseries of degraded image patches from the same task. Then the adaptive BaseNet\nrapidly shifts its parameters according to the conditional features. Moreover,\nin order to better extract degradation prior, we propose a task contrastive\nloss to decrease the inner-task distance and increase the cross-task distance\nbetween task-level features. Without predefining degradation maps, our blind\nframework can conduct one single parameter update to yield considerable SR\nresults. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CMDSR over\nvarious blind, even non-blind methods.

Modelling the complete inverse function of an ANN\ninvolves generating the values of all features that corresponds to a desired\noutput. On the other hand, partially modelling the inverse function means\ngenerating the values of a subset of features and fixing the remaining feature\nvalues. The feature set generation is a critical step for artificial neural\nnetworks, useful in several practical applications in engineering and science.\nThe proposed Oracle Guided Generative Neural Network, dubbed as OGGN, is\nflexible to handle a variety of feature generation problems. In general, an ANN\nis able to predict the target values based on given feature vectors. The OGGN\narchitecture enables to generate feature vectors given the predetermined target\nvalues of an ANN.

Therefore, the OGGN architecture is able to map, inverse function of\nthe function represented by forward ANN. Besides, there is another important\ncontribution of this work.

Novelty Search traditionally\nrelies on k-nearest neighbours search and an archive of previously visited\nbehavior descriptors which are assumed to live in a Euclidean space. This is\nproblematic because of a number of issues. On one hand, Euclidean distance and\nNearest-neighbour search are known to behave differently and become less\nmeaningful in high dimensional spaces. On the other hand, the archive has to be\nbounded since, memory considerations aside, the computational complexity of\nfinding nearest neighbours in that archive grows linearithmically with its\nsize. A sub-optimal bound can result in \"cycling\" in the behavior space, which\ninhibits the progress of the exploration. Furthermore, the performance of NS\ndepends on a number of algorithmic choices and hyperparameters, such as the\nstrategies to add or remove elements to the archive and the number of\nneighbours to use in k-nn search. In this paper, we discuss an alternative\napproach to novelty estimation, dubbed Behavior Recognition based Novelty\nSearch (BR-NS), which does not require an archive, makes no assumption on the\nmetrics that can be defined in the behavior space and does not rely on nearest\nneighbours search. We conduct experiments to gain insight into its feasibility\nand dynamics as well as potential advantages over archive-based NS in terms of\ntime complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 17:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

Existing\napproaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points.\nHowever, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent\nand thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce\nSNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for\npolygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward\ndeformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined\nin canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen\nposes. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging\nsince the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not\nbe unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that\nfinds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root\nfinding.

As the only signals driving the optimization are differences in\nrendered images, the approach is highly general and versatile: it easily\nsupports many different forward rendering models such as normal mapping,\nspatially-varying BRDFs, displacement mapping, etc. Supervision through images\nonly is also key to the ability to easily convert between rendering systems and\nscene representations.\n  We output triangle meshes with textured materials to ensure that the models\nrender efficiently on modern graphics hardware and benefit from, e.g.,\nhardware-accelerated rasterization, ray tracing, and filtered texture lookups.\nOur system is integrated in a small Python code base, and can be applied at\nhigh resolutions and on large models.

Many of the ICM clumps can originate from infalling galaxies,\nas stripped interstellar medium (ISM) mixing into the hot ICM. However, a\ndirect connection between ICM clumping and stripped ISM has not been\nunambiguously established before. Here we present the discovery of the first\nand still the only known isolated cloud (or orphan cloud, OC) detected in both\nX-rays and H$\\alpha$ in the nearby cluster Abell 1367.

This example shows that the stripped ISM, even long time after\nthe initial removal from the galaxy, can still induce the ICM inhomogeneities.\nWe suggest that magnetic field can stabilize the OC by suppressing hydrodynamic\ninstabilities and thermal conduction. This example also suggests that at least\nsome ICM clumps are multi-phase in nature and implies that the ICM clumps can\nalso be traced in H$\\alpha$.

The major concern in many applications is\nthe formation of a biological fouling layer leading to increased hydraulic\nresistance and flux decline during membrane operations. The growth of bacteria\nconstituting such a biological layer implicates the formation of a multispecies\nbiofilm and the consequent increase of operational costs for reactor management\nand cleaning procedures. To predict the biofilm growth and evolution during the\nfiltration process, a one-dimensional continuous model has been developed by\nconsidering a free boundary value problem describing biofilm dynamics and EPS\nproduction in different operational phases of microfiltration systems. The\ngrowth of microbial species and EPS is governed by a system of hyperbolic PDEs.\nSubstrates dynamics are modeled thorough parabolic equations accounting for\ndiffusive and advective fluxes generated during the filtration process. The\nfree boundary evolution depends on both microbial growth and detachment\nprocesses. The proposed model has been solved numerically to simulate biofilm\nevolution during biologically relevant conditions, and to investigate the\nhydraulic behavior of the membrane.

In\nthis regard, the objective of this work is to develop a new deep transfer\nlearning pipeline to diagnose patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, and\ntuberculosis, based on chest x-ray images. We observed in some instances\nDenseNet and Resnet have orthogonal performances. In our proposed model, we\nhave created an extra layer with convolutional neural network blocks to combine\nthese two models to establish superior performance over either model. The same\nstrategy can be useful in other applications where two competing networks with\ncomplementary performance are observed. We have tested the performance of our\nproposed network on two-class (pneumonia vs healthy), three-class (including\nCOVID-19), and four-class (including tuberculosis) classification problems. The\nproposed network has been able to successfully classify these lung diseases in\nall four datasets and has provided significant improvement over the benchmark\nnetworks of DenseNet, ResNet, and Inception-V3.

Our findings show that\noptical absorption is red-shifted for a chemisorbed molecular layer relative to\nthe molecule in solution, indicating electronic coupling between the molecule\nand the surface.

However, the one certainty\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic is that these parameters change over time, as well\nas vary across counties and states. In fact, the rate of spread over region,\nhospitalization rate, hospital length of stay and mortality rate, the\nproportion of the population that is susceptible, test positivity rate, and\nsocial behaviors can all change significantly over time. Thus, the\nquantification of uncertainty becomes critical in making meaningful and\naccurate forecasts of the future.

The explicit\nintegration time varying parameters and uncertainty quantification into a\nhierarchical Bayesian forecast model differentiates the Mayo COVID-19 model\nfrom other forecasting models. By accounting for all sources of uncertainty in\nboth parameter estimation as well as future trends with a Bayesian approach,\nthe Mayo COVID-19 model accurately forecasts future cases and hospitalizations,\nas well as the degree of uncertainty.

In this work, an\nanalytic mixed-material erosion model is developed by calculating the physical\n(via SDTrimSP) and chemical (via empirical scalings) sputtering yield from SiC,\nSi, and C. The Si content in the near-surface SiC layer is predicted to\nincrease during D plasma bombardment due to more efficient physical and\nchemical sputtering of C relative to Si. Silicon erosion from SiC thereby\noccurs primarily from sputtering of the enriched Si layer, rather than directly\nfrom the SiC itself. SiC coatings on ATJ graphite, manufactured via chemical\nvapor deposition, were exposed to repeated H-mode plasma discharges in the\nDIII-D tokamak to test this model. The qualitative trends from analytic\nmodeling are reproduced by the experimental measurements, obtained via\nspectroscopic inference using the S/XB method. Quantitatively the model\nslightly under-predicts measured erosion rates, which is attributed to\nuncertainties in the ion impact angle distribution, as well as the effect of\nedge-localized modes.

The attachment of planktonic cells\nplays a prominent role in the initial phase of biofilm lifecycle as it\ninitiates the colony formation. During the maturation stage, biofilms harbor\nnumerous microenvironments which lead to metabolic heterogeneity. Such\nmicroniches provide conditions suitable for the growth of new species, which\nare present in the bulk liquid as planktonic cells and can penetrate the porous\nbiofilm matrix. We present a 1D continuum model on the interaction of sessile\nand planktonic phenotypes in biofilm lifestyle which considers both the initial\nattachment and colonization phenomena. The model is formulated as a\nhyperbolic-elliptic free boundary value problem with vanishing initial value.\nHyperbolic equations reproduce the transport and growth of sessile species,\nwhile elliptic equations model the diffusion and conversion of planktonic cells\nand dissolved substrates. The attachment is modelled as a continuous,\ndeterministic process which depends on the concentrations of the attaching\nspecies. The growth of new species is modelled through a reaction term in the\nhyperbolic equations which depends on the concentration of planktonic species\nwithin the biofilm. Existence and uniqueness of solutions are discussed and\nproved for the attachment regime. Finally, some numerical examples show that\nthe proposed model correctly reproduces the growth of new species within the\nbiofilm and overcomes the ecological restrictions characterizing the\nWanner-Gujer type models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 21:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Businesses algorithmically target offers, incentives, and\nrecommendations to affect consumer behavior. Recently, we have seen an\nacceleration of research related to CDM and causal effect estimation (CEE)\nusing machine-learned models. This article highlights an important perspective:\nCDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively, accurate CEE is not\nnecessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood\nby practitioners or most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is\ndifferent, and this has important implications both for modeling and for the\nuse of statistical models for CDM. We draw on prior research to highlight three\nimplications. (1) We should consider carefully the objective function of the\ncausal machine learning, and if possible, optimize for accurate treatment\nassignment rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding\ndoes not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE. The upshot is that for\nsupporting CDM it may be just as good or even better to learn with confounded\ndata as with unconfounded data. Finally, (3) causal statistical modeling may\nnot be necessary to support CDM because a proxy target for statistical modeling\nmight do as well or better. This third observation helps to explain at least\none broad common CDM practice that seems wrong at first blush: the widespread\nuse of non-causal models for targeting interventions. The last two implications\nare particularly important in practice, as acquiring (unconfounded) data on all\ncounterfactuals can be costly and often impracticable. These observations open\nsubstantial research ground. We hope to facilitate research in this area by\npointing to related articles from multiple contributing fields, including two\ndozen articles published the last three to four years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 22:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 05:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 16:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

However, recent advances that utilize\nsampling-based methods have shown progress in generating feasible solutions. An\naspect of this problem that has yet to be explored concerns how to ensure that\nthe robots can recover from catastrophic failures which leave one or more\nrobots unexpectedly incapable of continuing to contribute to the pursuit of the\nevader. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that can rapidly recover\nfrom catastrophic failures.

Autonomous navigation of an agricultural\nvehicle involves the control of different dynamic subsystems, such as the yaw\nangle dynamics and the longitudinal speed dynamics. In this study, a\nproportional-integral-derivative controller is used to control the longitudinal\nvelocity of the tractor. For the control of the yaw angle dynamics, a\nproportional-derivative controller works in parallel with a type-2 fuzzy neural\nnetwork. In such an arrangement, the former ensures the stability of the\nrelated subsystem, while the latter learns the system dynamics and becomes the\nleading controller. In this way, instead of modeling the interactions between\nthe subsystems prior to the design of model-based control, we develop a control\nalgorithm which learns the interactions online from the measured feedback\nerror. In addition to the control of the stated subsystems, a kinematic\ncontroller is needed to correct the errors in both the x- and the y- axis for\nthe trajectory tracking problem of the tractor. To demonstrate the real-time\nabilities of the proposed control scheme, an autonomous tractor is equipped\nwith the use of reasonably priced sensors and actuators.

Here, using a three-dimensional\nacoustic topological insulator with precisely controllable dislocations, we\nreport an unambiguous experimental evidence for the long-desired\nbulk-dislocation correspondence, through directly measuring the gapless\ndispersion of the one-dimensional topological dislocation modes. Remarkably, as\nrevealed in our further experiments, the pseudospin-locked dislocation modes\ncan be unidirectionally guided in an arbitrarily-shaped dislocation path. The\npeculiar topological dislocation transport, expected in a variety of classical\nwave systems, can provide unprecedented controllability over wave propagations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 03:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

A widely used method to derive the conservation laws is\nbased on Noether's theorem. However, for classical relativistic particle-field\nsystems, this process is still impeded. Different from the quantum situation,\nthe obstruction emerged when we regard the particle's field as a classical\nworld line. The difficulties come from two aspects. One is the mass-shell\nconstraint and the other comes from the heterogeneous-manifolds that particles\nand fields reside on. This study develops a general geometric (manifestly\ncovariant) field theory for classical relativistic particle-field systems. In\nconsidering the mass-shell constraint, the Euler-Lagrange-Barut (ELB) equation\nas a geometric version of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation is applied to\ndetermine the world lines of the relativistic particles. As a differential\nequation in the standard field theory, the infinitesimal criterion of the\nsymmetry condition is converted into an integro-differential equation. To\novercome the second difficulty, we develop a weak ELB equation on the 4D\nspace-time. The weak version of the ELB equation will play an essential role in\nestablishing the connections between symmetries and local conservation laws.\nUsing field theory together with the weak ELB equation developed here, the\nconservation laws can be systematically derived from the symmetries that the\nsystems admit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 05:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 13:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

The increased service accessibility attributed to the\ninclusion of ride-hailing is greater in our US cities than in their European\ncounterparts. Demand split is directly related to the relative competitiveness\nof travel times i.e. when public transport travel times are competitive\nride-hailing demand share is low and vice-versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 06:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

In\nthis study we explore the shareability of various demand patterns. We devise a\nset of experiments tailored to identify the most promising demand patterns for\nintroducing ride-pooling services by varying the number of centers, the\ndispersion of destinations around each of these centers and the trip length\ndistribution. When matching trips into rides, we do not only ensure their\nmutual compatibility in time and space but also that shared rides are only\ncomposed by travellers who find the ride-pooling offer to be more attractive\nthan the private ride-hailing alternative given the trade-offs between travel\ntime, fare and discomfort. We measure the shareability potential using a series\nof metrics related to the extent to which passenger demand can be assigned to\nshared rides. Our findings indicate that introducing a ride-pooling service can\nreduce vehicle-hours by 18-59% under a fixed demand level and depending on the\nconcentration of travel destinations around the center and the trip length\ndistribution. System efficiency correlates positively with the former and\nnegatively with the latter. A shift from a monocentric to a polycentric demand\npattern is found to have a limited impact on the prospects of shared rides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 06:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

The mass function and Eddington ratio\ndistributions of SMBHs have been taken as starting point for this analysis. Our\napproach is based on physical and phenomenological relations that allow to\nstatistically calculate the radio luminosity of AGN cores, corrected for\nbeaming effects, by linking it with the SMBH at their center, through the\nFundamental Plane of black hole activity. Moreover, radio luminosity from\nextended jets and lobes is also computed through a power-law relationship that\nreflects the expected correlation between the inner radio core and the extended\njets/lobes. Radio-loud AGN are further divided in two classes, characterized by\ndifferent accretion modes onto the central BH.

While there have been indications that precaution fatigue could be a key\nfactor, no scientific evidence has been provided so far. We used a stochastic\nmetapopulation model with a hierarchical structure and fitted the model to the\npositive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020. We\nincorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by\nassuming that the precaution strength grows with positive cases and studied two\ntypes of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most states and in the whole\nUS respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while\nonly three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction\n(k=1). Case fatigue (decline in people's vigilance to positive cases) is\nresponsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of maximal\nfraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic\nfatigue (no case fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would\nhave reduced by 68% on average. Our study shows that pandemic fatigue is the\nmajor cause of the worsening situation of COVID-19 in United States. Reduced\nvigilance is responsible for most positive cases, and higher mortality rate\ntends to push local people to react to the outbreak faster and maintain\nvigilant for longer time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 08:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

The reason following the singlemode\ncondition is that higher-order modes might be excited and thus introduce some\nundesired mode-mismatching loss as well as inter-mode crosstalk when light\npropagates along an optical waveguide beyond the singlemode regime. As a\nresult, multimode photonic waveguides are usually not allowed. In this paper,\nwe propose the concept of silicon photonics beyond the singlemode regime,\ndeveloped with low-loss and low-crosstalk light propagation in multimode\nphotonic waveguides with broadened silicon cores. In particular, silicon\nphotonic waveguides with a broadened core region have shown an ultra-low-loss\nof ~0.1 dB/cm for the fundamental mode even without any special fabrication\nprocess. A micro-racetrack resonator fabricated with standard 220-nm-SOI\nMPW-foundry processes shows a record intrinsic Q-factor as high as 1.02*107 for\nthe first time, corresponding to ultra-low waveguide propagation loss of only\n0.065 dB/cm. A high-performance microwave photonic filter on silicon is then\nrealized with an ultra-narrow 3-dB bandwidth of 20.6 MHz as well as a tuning\nrange of ~20 GHz for the first time. An on-chip 100-cm-long delayline is also\ndemonstrated by using the present broadened SOI photonic waveguides with\ncompact Euler-curve bends, the measured propagation loss is ~0.14 dB/cm. The\nproposed concept of silicon photonics beyond the singlemode regime helps solve\nthe issue of high propagation loss and also significantly reduces the random\nphase errors of light due to the random variations of waveguide dimensions. In\nparticularity it enables silicon photonic devices with enhanced performances,\nwhich paves the way for new-generation silicon photonics realizing the\nlarge-scale photonic integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 08:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

A large\nanomaly can be considered normal if seen in a small scale, but it is not easy\nto determine a single scale (patch size) that works well for all images. Then,\nwe propose to incorporate multi-scale features to sparse coding and improve the\nperformance of anomaly detection.

In addition, we show some effects of the EUP parameter on the\ninnermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius of time-like particles, photon\nsphere, shadow radius, and weak deflection angle. It is found that time-like\norbits are affected by deviation of low values of mass $M$. A greater dark\nmatter density is needed to have remarkable effects on the null orbits. Using\nthe analytic expression for the shadow radius and the approximation $\\Delta\nr_s>>r_s$, it is revealed that $L_*$ should not be lower than $2m$.

Numerical\nsimulations of the surface flux transport (SFT) model are widely used to\neffectively predict the dipole moment at cycle minimum. Recently an algebraic\nmethod has been proposed to quickly predict the contribution of an active\nregion (AR) to the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum instead of SFT\nsimulations. However, the method assumes a bipolar magnetic region (BMR)\nconfiguration of ARs. Actually most ARs are asymmetric in configuration of\nopposite polarities, or have more complex configurations. Such ARs evolve\nsignificantly differently from that of BMR approximations. We propose a\ngeneralized algebraic method to describe the axial dipole contribution of an AR\nwith an arbitrary configuration, and evaluate its effectiveness compared to the\nBMR-based method. We employ mathematical deductions to obtain the generalized\nmethod. We compare the results of the generalized method with SFT simulations\nof observed ARs, artificially created BMRs, and ARs with more complex\nconfigurations. We also compare the results with that from the BMR-based\nmethod. The generalized method is equivalent to the SFT model, and precisely\npredicts the ARs' contributions to the dipole moment. The method has a much\nhigher computational efficiency than SFT simulations. Although the BMR-based\nmethod has similar computational efficiency as the generalized method, it is\nonly accurate for symmetric bipolar ARs. The BMR-based method systematically\noverestimates the dipole contributions of asymmetric bipolar ARs, and randomly\nmiscalculate the contributions of more complex ARs. The generalized method\nprovides a quick and precise quantification of an AR's contribution to the\nsolar cycle evolution, which paves the way for the application into the\nphysics-based solar cycle prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 11:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 02:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

In the\nevent, a collimated jet with obvious westward lateral motion firstly launched\nfrom CBP1, during which a small bright point appeared around CBP1's east end,\nand magnetic flux cancellation was observed within the eruption source region.\nBased on these characteristics, we interpret the observed jet as a standard jet\nassociated with photosperic magnetic flux cancellation.

However, most of these successes\nare limited to a specific dataset and cannot generalize well to other datasets.\nThe main difficulties lie in the large domain differences and unbalanced\ndisparity distribution across a variety of datasets, which greatly limit the\nreal-world applicability of current deep stereo matching models. In this paper,\nwe propose CFNet, a Cascade and Fused cost volume based network to improve the\nrobustness of the stereo matching network. First, we propose a fused cost\nvolume representation to deal with the large domain difference. By fusing\nmultiple low-resolution dense cost volumes to enlarge the receptive field, we\ncan extract robust structural representations for initial disparity estimation.\nSecond, we propose a cascade cost volume representation to alleviate the\nunbalanced disparity distribution. Specifically, we employ a variance-based\nuncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity search\nspace, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of\nunlikely correspondences. By iteratively narrowing down the disparity search\nspace and improving the cost volume resolution, the disparity estimation is\ngradually refined in a coarse-to-fine manner. When trained on the same training\nimages and evaluated on KITTI, ETH3D, and Middlebury datasets with the fixed\nmodel parameters and hyperparameters, our proposed method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art overall performance and obtains the 1st place on the stereo\ntask of Robust Vision Challenge 2020.

The scalar potential of the model is considered in the context of\nno-scale supergravity consisting of the F-part constructed from the K\\\"ahler\nfunction, the D-terms and soft SUSY contributions.

However correlation structures\nin quantum channels are less studied than those in quantum states. Motivated by\nrecent techniques in randomized benchmarking, we develop a range of results for\nefficient estimation of correlations within a bipartite quantum channel. We\nintroduce sub-unitarity measures that are invariant under local changes of\nbasis, generalize the unitarity of a channel, and allow for the analysis of\ncoherent information exchange within channels. Using these, we show that\nunitarity is monogamous, and provide a novel information-disturbance relation.\nWe then define a notion of correlated unitarity that quantifies the\ncorrelations within a given channel. Crucially, we show that this measure is\nstrictly bounded on the set of separable channels and therefore provides a\nwitness of non-separability.

Its usefulness has mostly been considered in simple multimodal\nlandscapes with few local optima that could be crossed one after another. In\nmultimodal landscapes with a more complex location of optima of similar gap\nsize, stagnation detection suffers from the fact that the neighborhood size is\nfrequently reset to $1$ without using gap sizes that were promising in the\npast.\n  In this paper, we investigate a new mechanism called radius memory which can\nbe added to stagnation detection to control the search radius more carefully by\ngiving preference to values that were successful in the past.

To speed up ZO methods, many methods, such as\nvariance reduced stochastic ZO gradients and learning an adaptive Gaussian\ndistribution, have recently been proposed to reduce the variances of ZO\ngradients. However, it is still an open problem whether there is a space to\nfurther improve the convergence of ZO methods. To explore this problem, in this\npaper, we propose a new reinforcement learning based ZO algorithm (ZO-RL) with\nlearning the sampling policy for generating the perturbations in ZO\noptimization instead of using random sampling. To find the optimal policy, an\nactor-critic RL algorithm called deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with\ntwo neural network function approximators is adopted. The learned sampling\npolicy guides the perturbed points in the parameter space to estimate a more\naccurate ZO gradient. To the best of our knowledge, our ZO-RL is the first\nalgorithm to learn the sampling policy using reinforcement learning for ZO\noptimization which is parallel to the existing methods. Especially, our ZO-RL\ncan be combined with existing ZO algorithms that could further accelerate the\nalgorithms.

We introduce the provable repair problem,\nwhich is the problem of repairing a network N to construct a new network N'\nthat satisfies a given specification. If the safety specification is over a\nfinite set of points, our Provable Point Repair algorithm can find a provably\nminimal repair satisfying the specification, regardless of the activation\nfunctions used. For safety specifications addressing convex polytopes\ncontaining infinitely many points, our Provable Polytope Repair algorithm can\nfind a provably minimal repair satisfying the specification for DNNs using\npiecewise-linear activation functions. The key insight behind both of these\nalgorithms is the introduction of a Decoupled DNN architecture, which allows us\nto reduce provable repair to a linear programming problem.

In this setting, we show that Gibbs states satisfy uniform\nexponential decay of correlations and, moreover, the mutual information between\ntwo regions decays exponentially with their distance, irrespective of the\ntemperature.

Typically, it is achieved\nusing surround-view fisheye cameras, focusing on the near-field area around the\nvehicle. The majority of current depth estimation approaches focus on employing\njust a single camera, which cannot be straightforwardly generalized to multiple\ncameras. The depth estimation model must be tested on a variety of cameras\nequipped to millions of cars with varying camera geometries. Even within a\nsingle car, intrinsics vary due to manufacturing tolerances. Deep learning\nmodels are sensitive to these changes, and it is practically infeasible to\ntrain and test on each camera variant. As a result, we present novel\ncamera-geometry adaptive multi-scale convolutions which utilize the camera\nparameters as a conditional input, enabling the model to generalize to\npreviously unseen fisheye cameras. Additionally, we improve the distance\nestimation by pairwise and patchwise vector-based self-attention encoder\nnetworks. We evaluate our approach on the Fisheye WoodScape surround-view\ndataset, significantly improving over previous approaches. We also show a\ngeneralization of our approach across different camera viewing angles and\nperform extensive experiments to support our contributions. To enable\ncomparison with other approaches, we evaluate the front camera data on the\nKITTI dataset (pinhole camera images) and achieve state-of-the-art performance\namong self-supervised monocular methods.

However, the quantitative study of\nrecord preservation in chemical images raises new questions that call for the\nexpertise of the computer vision community.

Another important issue\nis the evaluation of post-depositional layer changes, for which the chemical\nimages provide rich information. Accordingly, the time is ripe to begin an\nintensified exchange among the two scientific communities of computer vision\nand ice core science.

We propose a fallback accretion\nmodel that a part of ejecta from the neutron star merger falls back and forms a\ndisk around the central compact object. In the super-Eddington accretion phase,\nthe X-ray luminosity stays near the Eddington limit of a few solar masses and\nthe radio is weak, as observed. This will be followed by a power law decay. The\nduration of the constant luminosity phase conveys the initial fallback\ntimescale $t_0$ in the past. The current multi-year duration requires $t_0 >\n3$--$30$ sec, suggesting that the disk wind rather than the dynamical ejecta\nfalls back after the jet launch. Future observations in the next decades will\nprobe the timescale of $t_0 \\sim 10$--$10^4$ sec, around the time of extended\nemission in short gamma-ray bursts.

Specifically, with\nthe emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs), not only is the demand for the\ncomputing power of IoT devices increasing but also privacy concerns are pushing\ncomputations towards the edge. To overcome inadequate resources, several\nstudies have proposed the distribution of work among IoT devices.

However, AT exhibits severe robust\noverfitting: cross-entropy loss on adversarial examples, so-called robust loss,\ndecreases continuously on training examples, while eventually increasing on\ntest examples. In practice, this leads to poor robust generalization, i.e.,\nadversarial robustness does not generalize well to new examples. In this paper,\nwe study the relationship between robust generalization and flatness of the\nrobust loss landscape in weight space, i.e., whether robust loss changes\nsignificantly when perturbing weights. To this end, we propose average- and\nworst-case metrics to measure flatness in the robust loss landscape and show a\ncorrelation between good robust generalization and flatness. For example,\nthroughout training, flatness reduces significantly during overfitting such\nthat early stopping effectively finds flatter minima in the robust loss\nlandscape. Similarly, AT variants achieving higher adversarial robustness also\ncorrespond to flatter minima.

This forms a barrier\ntowards achieving high data rates. Moreover, the implementation of high order\nmodulation schemes is restricted by the requirements of intensity modulation\n(IM) and direct detection (DD), which demand the use of real unipolar signals.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel amplitude, phase and quadrant (APQ)\nmodulation scheme that fits into the IM/DD restrictions in VLC systems. The\nproposed scheme decomposes the complex and bipolar symbols of high order\nmodulations into three different symbols that carry the amplitude, phase and\nquadrant information of the intended symbol. The constructed symbols are\nassigned different power levels and are transmitted simultaneously, i.e.\nexploiting the entire bandwidth and time resources. The receiving terminal\nperforms successive interference cancellation to extract and decode the three\ndifferent symbols, and then uses them to decide the intended complex bipolar\nsymbol. We evaluate the performance of the proposed APQ scheme in terms of\nsymbol-error-rate and achievable system throughput for different setup\nscenarios. The obtained results are compared with generalized spatial shift\nkeying (GSSK). The presented results show that APQ offers a higher reliability\ncompared to GSSK across the simulation area, while providing lower hardware\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 15:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

In computational\nhomogenization, the microstructure is thus explicitly modeled inside the\nmacrostructure, leading to a coupled two-scale formulation. Unfortunately, the\nhigh computational costs of such multiscale simulations often render the\nsolution of design, optimization, or inverse problems infeasible. To address\nthis issue, we propose in this work a non-intrusive reduced basis method to\nconstruct inexpensive surrogates for parametrized microscale problems; the\nmethod is specifically well-suited for multiscale simulations since the coupled\nsimulation is decoupled into two independent problems: (1) solving the\nmicroscopic problem for different (loading or material) parameters and learning\na surrogate model from the data; and (2) solving the macroscopic problem with\nthe learned material model. The proposed method has three key features. First,\nthe microscopic stress field can be fully recovered. Second, the method is able\nto accurately predict the stress field for a wide range of material parameters;\nfurthermore, the derivatives of the effective stress with respect to the\nmaterial parameters are available and can be readily utilized in solving\noptimization problems. Finally, it is more data efficient, i.e. requiring less\ntraining data, as compared to directly performing a regression on the effective\nstress. For the microstructures in the two test problems considered, the mean\napproximation error of the effective stress is as low as 0.1% despite using a\nrelatively small training dataset. Embedded into the macroscopic problem, the\nreduced order model leads to an online speed up of approximately three orders\nof magnitude while maintaining a high accuracy as compared to the FE$^2$\nsolver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 15:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 13:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Firstly, for the\nundetected area between EEG electrodes, an improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation\nalgorithm is developed for EEG channels information completion, which allows us\nto extract a wider range of adjacent space features. Then, motivated by the\nspatial symmetric mechanism of human brain, we fold the input EEG channels data\nwith five different symmetrical strategies, which enable the proposed network\nto extract the information of space features of EEG signals more effectively.\nFinally, a 3DCNN-based spatial, temporal extraction, and a multi-voting\nstrategy of ensemble learning are integrated to model a new neural network.\nWith this network, the spatial features of different symmetric folding signals\ncan be extracted simultaneously, which greatly improves the robustness and\naccuracy of emotion recognition. The experimental results on DEAP and SEED\ndatasets show that the proposed algorithm has comparable performance in terms\nof recognition accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 12:59:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 04:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 07:44:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 01:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}
