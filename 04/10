Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and\npipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these\nmethods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to\nexpensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting\non other devices to make progress.\n  In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor,\npipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs\nand models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline\nparallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that\ncan improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing\napproaches. We quantitatively study the trade-offs between tensor, pipeline,\nand data parallelism, and provide intuition as to how to configure distributed\ntraining of a large model.

Our first contribution is\nto identify the distinction between skew in ad delivery due to protected\ncategories such as gender or race, from skew due to differences in\nqualification among people in the targeted audience.

Our method controls for job\nqualification by comparing ad delivery of two concurrent ads for similar jobs,\nbut for a pair of companies with different de facto gender distributions of\nemployees. We describe the careful statistical tests that establish evidence of\nnon-qualification skew in the results. Third, we apply our proposed methodology\nto two prominent targeted advertising platforms for job ads: Facebook and\nLinkedIn.

The model reproduces\nmany statistical features of such intermittent signals, as the statistics of\nburst (or avalanche) durations and sizes, with their power law exponents that\nwould characterise the dynamics as critical. Beyond such \"critical exponents\",\nthe measure of the average shape of the avalanche has also been proposed. Here,\nthe exact calculation of average and fluctuations of the avalanche shape for\nthe ABBM model is presented, showing that its normalised shape is independent\nfrom the external drive. Moreover, average and fluctuations of the\nmulti-avalanche shape, that is a sequence of avalanches of fixed total\nduration, is also computed. Surprisingly, the two quantities (avalanche and\nmulti-avalanche normalised shapes) are identical. This result is obtained using\nthe exact solution of the ABBM model, obtained leveraging the equivalence with\nthe Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process (CIR), through an exact \"time change\". A\npresentation of this and other known exact results is provided: notably the\ncorrespondence of the ABBM/CIR model with the generalised Bessel process,\ndescribing the dynamics of the modulus of the multi dimensional\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. As a consequence, the correspondence between the\nexcursion (avalanche) and bridge (multi-avalanche) shape distributions, turns\nto apply to all the aforementioned stochastic processes.

Our analyses clearly reveal that the\ninteraction models should be carefully handled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 17:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Harnessing the\nfull advantage of transverse spatial photonic encoding using the\nLaguerre-Gaussian (LG) basis in the quantum domain requires control over both\nthe azimuthal (twisted) and radial (rippled) components of photons. However,\nprecise measurement of the radial photonic degree-of-freedom has proven to be\nexperimentally challenging primarily due to its transverse amplitude structure.\nHere we demonstrate the generation and certification of full-field\nLaguerre-Gaussian entanglement between photons pairs generated by spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion in the telecom regime. By precisely tuning the\noptical system parameters for state generation and collection, and adopting\nrecently developed techniques for precise spatial mode measurement, we are able\nto certify fidelities up to 85% and entanglement dimensionalities up to 26 in a\n43-dimensional radial and azimuthal LG mode space. Furthermore, we study\ntwo-photon quantum correlations between 9 LG mode groups, demonstrating a\ncorrelation structure related to mode group order and inter-modal cross-talk.\nIn addition, we show how the noise-robustness of high-dimensional entanglement\ncertification can be significantly increased by using measurements in multiple\nLG mutually unbiased bases.

We composed a sample of 111 dwarf gravity-mode pulsators observed\nby the Kepler space telescope whose light curves allowed for determination of\ntheir near-core rotation rates. For this sample we assembled HERMES\nhigh-resolution optical spectroscopy at the 1.2-m Mercator telescope. Our\nspectroscopic information offers additional observational input to also model\nthe envelope layers of these non-radially pulsating dwarfs. We determined\nstellar parameters and surface abundances in a homogeneous way from atmospheric\nanalysis with spectrum normalisation based on a new machine learning tool. Our\nresults suggest a systematic overestimation of [M/H] in the literature for the\nstudied F-type dwarfs, presumably due to normalisation limitations caused by\nthe dense line spectrum of these rotating stars. CNO-surface abundances were\nfound to be uncorrelated with the rotation properties of the F-type stars. For\nthe B-type stars, we find a hint of deep mixing from C and O abundance ratios;\nN abundances have too large uncertainties to reveal a correlation with the\nrotation of the stars. Our spectroscopic stellar parameters and abundance\ndeterminations allow for future joint spectroscopic, astrometric (Gaia), and\nasteroseismic modelling of this legacy sample of gravity-mode pulsators, with\nthe aim to improve our understanding of transport processes in the\ncore-hydrogen burning phase of stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 17:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

For dim or crowded\nsources, likelihood based inference methods are required to estimate the\nuncertainty on the characteristics of the source population. In this work, a\nnew parametric likelihood is constructed for this problem using Compound\nPoisson Generator (CPG) functionals which incorporate instrumental effects from\nfirst principles. We demonstrate that the CPG approach exhibits a number of\nadvantages over Non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF) - an existing method -\nin a series of test scenarios in the context of X-ray astronomy. These\ndemonstrations show that the effect of the point-spread function, effective\narea, and choice of point-source spatial distribution cannot, generally, be\nfactorised as they are in NPTF, while the new CPG construction is validated in\nthese scenarios. Separately, an examination of the diffuse-flux emission limit\nis used to show that most simple choices of priors on the standard\nparameterisation of the population model can result in unexpected biases: when\na model comprising both a point-source population and diffuse component is\napplied to this limit, nearly all observed flux will be assigned to either the\npopulation or to the diffuse component. A new parametrisation is presented for\nthese priors which properly estimates the uncertainties in this limit. In this\nchoice of priors, CPG correctly identifies that the fraction of flux assigned\nto the population model cannot be constrained by the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 08:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

For example, a healthcare provider may be interested in the effect of a\ntreatment plan for a specific subset of their patients; policymakers may be\nconcerned with the impact of a policy in a particular state within a given\npopulation. In these cases, the focus is on a specific finite population, as\nopposed to an infinite super-population. Such a population can be characterized\nby fixing some attributes that are intrinsic to them, leaving unexplained\nvariations like measurement error as random. Inference for a population with\nfixed attributes can then be modeled as inferring parameters of a conditional\ndistribution. Accordingly, it is desirable that confidence intervals are\nconditionally valid for the realized population, instead of marginalizing over\nmany possible draws of populations.\n  We provide a statistical inference framework for parameters of finite\npopulations with known attributes. Leveraging the attribute information, our\nestimators and confidence intervals closely target a specific finite\npopulation. When the data is from the population of interest, our confidence\nintervals attain asymptotic conditional validity given the attributes, and are\nshorter than those for super-population inference. In addition, we develop\nprocedures to infer parameters of new populations with differing covariate\ndistributions; the confidence intervals are also conditionally valid for the\nnew populations under mild conditions.

Because the fully relativistic FEW model waveforms\nare for now limited to eccentric orbits in the Schwarzschild spacetime, we also\nintroduce an improved Augmented Analytic Kludge (AAK) model that describes\ngeneric Kerr inspirals. Both waveform models can be accelerated using graphics\nprocessing unit (GPU) hardware. With the GPU-accelerated waveforms in hand, a\nvariety of studies are performed including an analysis of EMRI mode content,\ntemplate mismatch, and fully Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based EMRI\nparameter estimation. We find relativistic EMRI waveform templates can be\ngenerated with fewer harmonic modes ($\\sim10-100$) without biasing signal\nextraction. However, we show for the first time that extraction of a\nrelativistic injection with semi-relativistic amplitudes can lead to strong\nbias and anomalous structure in the posterior distribution for certain regions\nof parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 19:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Then it finds a mapping of\nx-entities with its corresponding y-entities. Next, it generates a chart type\nsuitable for the given text: bar, line or pie. Combination of these three\nstages is capable of generating visualization from the given analytical text.\nWe have also constructed a dataset for this problem.

The RaidaR\nimages cover a wide range of realistic rain-induced artifacts, including fog,\ndroplets, and road reflections, which can effectively augment existing street\nscene datasets to improve data-driven machine perception during rainy weather.\nTo facilitate efficient annotation of a large volume of images, we develop a\nsemi-automatic scheme combining manual segmentation and an automated processing\nakin to cross validation, resulting in 10-20 fold reduction on annotation time.\nWe demonstrate the utility of our new dataset by showing how data augmentation\nwith RaidaR can elevate the accuracy of existing segmentation algorithms.

A variety of methods have been proposed to mitigate these errors\nusing classical post processing.

Recent\nproposals to use sub-exponential approximations rely on small and/or\nshort-ranged error correlations. In this paper, we introduce and demonstrate a\nmethodology to categorize and quantify multiqubit readout error correlations.\nTwo distinct types of error correlations are considered: sensitivity of the\nmeasurement of a given qubit to the state of nearby \"spectator\" qubits, and\nmeasurement operator covariances. We deploy this methodology on IBMQ quantum\ncomputers, finding that error correlations are indeed small compared to the\nsingle-qubit readout errors on IBMQ Melbourne (15 qubits) and IBMQ Manhattan\n(65 qubits), but that correlations on IBMQ Melbourne are long-ranged and do not\ndecay with inter-qubit distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 21:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

To date, researchers have proposed various\nautomated program repair (APR) techniques to reduce efforts of manual\ndebugging. However, given a real-world buggy program, a typical APR technique\nusually generates a large number of patches, each of which needs to be\nvalidated against the original test suite which incurs extremely high\ncomputation costs. Although existing APR techniques have already leveraged\nvarious static and/or dynamic information to find the desired patches faster,\nthey are still rather costly. In a recent work, researchers proposed unified\ndebugging to leverage the patch execution information during APR to help boost\nfault localization; in this way,the application scope of APR techniques can be\nextended to all possible bugs, e.g., the patch execution information during APR\ncan help with manual repair of the bugs that cannot be automatically fixed.\nInspired by unified debugging, this work proposes SeAPR (Self-Boosted Automated\nProgram Repair), the first technique to leverage the earlier patch execution\ninformation during APR to help boost automated repair itself on-the-fly. Our\nbasic intuition is that patches similar to earlier high-quality/low-quality\npatches should be promoted/degraded to speed up the detection of the desired\npatches. This experimental study on 12 state-of-the-art APR systems\ndemonstrates that, overall, SeAPR can substantially reduce the number of patch\nexecutions with negligible overhead. Our study also investigates the impact of\nvarious configurations on SeAPR. Lastly, our study demonstrates that SeAPR can\neven leverage the patch execution information from other APR tools from the\nsame buggy program to further boost APR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 21:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

In spectroscopic galaxy\nsurveys this can be due to the misclassification of an emission line; for\nexample in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) low\nredshift [OII] emitters may make up a few percent of the observed Ly${\\alpha}$\nemitter (LAE) sample. The presence of contaminants affects the measured\ncorrelation functions and power spectra. Previous attempts to deal with this\nusing the cross-correlation function have assumed sources at a fixed redshift,\nor not modelled evolution within the adopted redshift bins. However, in\nspectroscopic surveys like HETDEX, where the contamination fraction is likely\nto be redshift dependent, the observed clustering of misclassified sources will\nappear to evolve strongly due to projection effects, even if their true\nclustering does not. We present a practical method for accounting for the\npresence of contaminants with redshift-dependent contamination fractions and\nprojected clustering. We show using mock catalogues that our method, unlike\nexisting approaches, yields unbiased clustering measurements from the upcoming\nHETDEX survey in scenarios with redshift-dependent contamination fractions\nwithin the redshift bins used. We show our method returns auto-correlation\nfunctions with systematic biases much smaller than the statistical noise for\nsamples with at least as high as 7 per cent contamination.

Common methods for time-varying data such as functional\ndata analysis are infeasible when observations are time courses of networks or\nother complex non-Euclidean random objects that are elements of general metric\nspaces. In such spaces, only pairwise distances between the data objects are\navailable and a strong limitation is that one cannot carry out arithmetic\noperations due to the lack of an algebraic structure. We combat this complexity\nby a generalized notion of mean trajectory taking values in the object space.\nFor this, we adopt pointwise Fr\\'echet means and then construct pointwise\ndistance trajectories between the individual time courses and the estimated\nFr\\'echet mean trajectory, thus representing the time-varying objects and\nnetworks by functional data. Functional principal component analysis of these\ndistance trajectories can reveal interesting features of dynamic networks and\nobject time courses and is useful for downstream analysis. Our approach also\nmakes it possible to study the empirical dynamics of time-varying objects,\nincluding dynamic regression to the mean or explosive behavior over time.

The central problem is to use the limited\nnumber of vaccines in a country to reduce the risk of infection and mitigate\neconomic uncertainty at the same time. In this paper, we propose a simple\neconomic model for vaccine allocation across two types of workers:\nwhite-collars can work from home; while blue-collars must work on site. These\nworker types are complementary to each other, thus a negative shock to the\nsupply of either one decreases the demand for the other that leads to\nunemployment. Using parameters of blue and white-collar labor supply, their\ninfection risks, productivity losses at home office during lock-down, and\navailable vaccines, we express the optimal share of vaccines allocated to\nblue-collars. The model points to the dominance of blue-collar vaccination,\nespecially during waves when their relative infection risks increase and when\nthe number of available vaccines is limited. Taking labor supply data from 28\nEuropean countries, we quantify blue-collar vaccine allocation that minimizes\nunemployment across levels of blue- and white-collar infection risks. The model\nfavours blue-collar vaccination identically across European countries in case\nof vaccine scarcity. As more vaccines become available, economies that host\nlarge-shares of employees in home-office shall increasingly immunize them in\ncase blue-collar infection risks can be kept down. Our results highlight that\nvaccination plans should include workers and rank them by type of occupation.\nWe propose that prioritizing blue-collar workers during infection waves and\nearly vaccination can also favour economy besides helping the most vulnerable\nwho can transmit more infection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 23:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

This has led to the development of\nimplicit schemes that are increasingly favoured by practitioners for their\ncomputational efficiency. The transport equation requires knowledge of the\nvelocity field, which results from an elliptic problem (Darcy problem) that is\nthe most expensive part of the computation. When considering large reservoirs,\na cost-effective way of approximating the Darcy problems is using multiscale\ndomain decomposition (MDD) methods. They allow for the pressure and velocity\nfields to be computed on coarse meshes (large scale), while detailed basis\nfunctions are defined locally, usually in parallel, in a much finer grid (small\nscale). In this work we adopt the Multiscale Robin Coupled Method (MRCM,\n[Guiraldello, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 355 (2018) pp. 1-21], [Rocha, et al.,\nJ. Comput.

In\nthis article we investigate the combination of the MRCM with implicit transport\nschemes. A sequentially implicit strategy is proposed, with different\ntrust-region algorithms ensuring the convergence of the transport solver. The\nmethod is assessed on several very stringent 2D two-phase problems,\ndemonstrating its stability even for large time steps.

These pipelines often recur regularly (e.g.,\ndaily or weekly), as BI reports need to be refreshed, and ML models need to be\nretrained. However, it is widely reported that in complex production pipelines,\nupstream data feeds can change in unexpected ways, causing downstream\napplications to break silently that are expensive to resolve.\n  Data validation has thus become an important topic, as evidenced by notable\nrecent efforts from Google and Amazon, where the objective is to catch data\nquality issues early as they arise in the pipelines.

We\nsynthesize and comparatively study three novel kinds of 0D organic-inorganic\nhybrid tin halide compounds. They are efficient light emitters with a highest\nquantum yield of 92.3%. Although they have the same compositional organic\ngroup, the most stable phases are composed of octahedra for the bromide and\niodide but disphenoids (see-saw structures) for the chloride. They separately\nexhibit biexponential and monoexponential luminescence decays due to different\nsymmetries (Ci group for octahedra and C2 group for disphenoids) and\ncorresponding different electronic structures. The chloride has the largest\nabsorption photon energy among the three halides, but it has the smallest\nemission photon energy. A model regarding the unoccupied energy band degeneracy\nis proposed based on the experiments and density functional theory\ncalculations, which explains well the experimental phenomena and reveals the\ncrucial role of polyhedron type in determining the optical properties of the 0D\ntin halide compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 04:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 02:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

The depth map intra prediction in 3D\nextensions of the HEVC applies intra modes with auxiliary depth modeling modes\n(DMMs) to better preserve depth edges and handle motion discontinuities.\nAlthough such modes enable high efficiency compression, but at the cost of very\nhigh encoding complexity. Skipping conventional intra coding modes and DMMs in\ndepth coding limits practical applicability of the HEVC for 3D display\napplications. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-complexity scheme for\ndepth video compression based on low-rank tensor decomposition and HEVC intra\ncoding. The proposed scheme leverages spatial and temporal redundancy by\ncompactly representing the depth sequence as a high-order tensor. Tensor\nfactorization into a set of factor matrices following CANDECOMP PARAFAC (CP)\ndecomposition via alternating least squares give a low-rank approximation of\nthe scene geometry. Further, compression of factor matrices with HEVC intra\nprediction support arbitrary target accuracy by flexible adjustment of bitrate,\nvarying tensor decomposition ranks and quantization parameters. The results\ndemonstrate proposed approach achieves significant rate gains by efficiently\ncompressing depth planes in low-rank approximated representation. The proposed\nalgorithm is applied to encode depth maps of benchmark Ballet and Breakdancing\nsequences. The decoded depth sequences are used for view synthesis in a\nmulti-view video system, maintaining appropriate rendering quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 04:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Of late, TMP for manipulation has attracted\nsignificant interest resulting in a proliferation of different approaches. In\ncontrast, TMP for navigation has received considerably less attention.\nAutonomous robots operating in real-world complex scenarios require planning in\nthe discrete (task) space and the continuous (motion) space. In\nknowledge-intensive domains, on the one hand, a robot has to reason at the\nhighest-level, for example, the objects to procure, the regions to navigate to\nin order to acquire them; on the other hand, the feasibility of the respective\nnavigation tasks have to be checked at the execution level. This presents a\nneed for motion-planning-aware task planners. In this paper, we discuss a\nprobabilistically complete approach that leverages this task-motion interaction\nfor navigating in large knowledge-intensive domains, returning a plan that is\noptimal at the task-level. The framework is intended for motion planning under\nmotion and sensing uncertainty, which is formally known as belief space\nplanning. The underlying methodology is validated in simulation, in an office\nenvironment and its scalability is tested in the larger Willow Garage world.

Phys. 126, 167 (2011) to include dynamical effects,\nwhich are missing in the usual eikonal description of these reactions.\nEncouraging results have been obtained for total breakup cross sections in\ncomparison to more elaborate reaction models.\n  Purpose: We extend these comparisons to more differential breakup cross\nsections expressed as functions of the relative energy or parallel momentum\nbetween the core and halo neutron.\n  Method: ERT predictions of these cross sections are compared to\nstate-of-the-art calculations.\n  Results: The hypotheses upon which the ERT is based are confirmed and their\nrange of validity is made clearer. The actual ordering of the evolution\noperators {affects ERT differential} cross sections and a specific choice leads\nto excellent agreement with the reference calculation. Dynamical effects in the\ntreatment of the neutron-target interaction can be significant in the\nparallel-momentum observable.\n  Conclusions: The role of the different interactions in the dynamics of\nbreakup reactions of one-neutron halo nuclei are better understood and\nimprovements to the ERT are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 08:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The HDR 3D\nimages could be generated in low-cost by fusing low-dynamic-range (LDR) images\nacquired using a stereo camera with various exposure settings. In this paper,\nan efficient scheme for coding multi-exposure stereo images is proposed based\non a tensor low-rank approximation scheme. The multi-exposure fusion can be\nrealized to generate HDR stereo output at the decoder for increased realism and\nexaggerated binocular 3D depth cues.\n  For exploiting spatial redundancy in LDR stereo images, the stack of\nmulti-exposure stereo images is decomposed into a set of projection matrices\nand a core tensor following an alternating least squares Tucker decomposition\nmodel. The compact, low-rank representation of the scene, thus, generated is\nfurther processed by 3D extension of High Efficiency Video Coding standard.

However, implementing such operators\nefficiently with complex hardware intrinsics such as matrix multiply is a task\nnot yet automated gracefully. Solving this task often requires joint program\nand data layout transformations. First solutions to this problem have been\nproposed, such as TVM, UNIT or ISAMIR, which work on a loop-level\nrepresentation of operators and specify data layout and possible program\ntransformations before the embedding into the operator is performed. This\ntop-down approach creates a tension between exploration range and search space\ncomplexity, especially when also exploring data layout transformations such as\nim2col, channel packing or padding.\n  In this work, we propose a new approach to this problem. We created a\nbottom-up method that allows the joint transformation of both compuation and\ndata layout based on the found embedding. By formulating the embedding as a\nconstraint satisfaction problem over the scalar dataflow, every possible\nembedding solution is contained in the search space. Adding additional\nconstraints and optmization targets to the solver generates the subset of\npreferable solutions.\n  An evaluation using the VTA hardware accelerator with the Baidu DeepBench\ninference benchmark shows that our approach can automatically generate code\ncompetitive to reference implementations. Further, we show that dynamically\ndetermining the data layout based on intrinsic and workload is beneficial for\nhardware utilization and performance. In cases where the reference\nimplementation has low hardware utilization due to its fixed deployment\nstrategy, we achieve a geomean speedup of up to x2.813, while individual\noperators can improve as much as x170.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 10:39:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 06:16:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 06:42:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 06:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

During cooling from mold to room temperature, these\nstresses can be relaxed by large deformations resulting from an instability of\nthe unwarped configuration (i.e., buckling). This article investigates the\nthermal buckling of thin FRP disks via an analytical formulation based on the\nFoppl-von Karman theory. Expanding on our previous work, cylindrical orthotropy\nwith material parameters varying over the disk thickness is assumed in order to\naccount for thickness dependency of the glass fiber orientation distribution. A\ndisk parameter generalizing the thermal anisotropy ratio for homogeneous\northotropic disks is introduced and its relation with the occurrence and\nperiodicity of buckling is discussed. This is done for a skin-coreskin model,\nfor which the core-to-total thickness ratio is defined. For fiber orientation\ndistributions typical of injection-molded disks, it is found that there exists\na value of the thickness ratio for which no buckling occurs. It is also\ndemonstrated that the periodicity of the first buckling mode is described by\nthe generalized thermal anisotropy ratio, thus extending the results obtained\nfor a homogeneous fiber orientation distribution. Improvements in the accuracy\nof the predictions for experimental data available in the literature when using\nthe skin-core-skin model are shown. Finally, we study the relation between\nbuckling temperature and disk thickness and propose an expression for the\ndependence of the normalized buckling temperature on the thermal anisotropy\nratio.

In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-level reward modeling approach that factorizes a reward into a\nthree-level hierarchy: domain, act, and slot. Based on inverse adversarial\nreinforcement learning, our designed reward model can provide more accurate and\nexplainable reward signals for state-action pairs.Extensive evaluations show\nthat our approach can be applied to a wide range of reinforcement\nlearning-based dialog systems and significantly improves both the performance\nand the speed of convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 12:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

However, in order to solve the strict evolution\nbehavior of wave packet, it is necessary not only to determine the parameters\nof various physical quantities such as mass, but also to carry out the complex\nintegration process in configuration space and momentum space. In the final\nanalysis, the evolution behavior of wave packet is the evolution behavior of\ndistribution function parameters with time. Using the method of grey system\ntheory, the time-varying parameters are replaced by time-varying response\nseries, and then the formal structure is constructed according to the physical\nmeaning of time evolution to realize the approximate simulation and approximate\ncalculation of wave function expression. The advantage of this method is that\nit can simulate the evolution of wave packet under the uncertainty of each\nphysical quantity. Based on the grey system theory, this paper uses GM (1,1)\nmodel to replace the time response function of wave packet distribution,\nobtains the simulated evolution behavior of wave packet wave function by means\nof mathematical techniques such as variational method, and makes error analysis\nand correction. In practical application, the approximate evolution behavior of\nwave function can be obtained only by determining the parameters of expansion\ncoefficient of wave function. In this paper, the Gauss wave packet is taken as\nan example to discuss the method. The grey system theory of mathematical\nmodeling is introduced into physical calculation for the first time, and an\napproximate calculation method which can be widely used in wave packet\nevolution calculation is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 12:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Existing state-of-the-art CNN-based methods either use histograms\nof all the frequencies or rely on heuristics to select histograms of specific\nlow frequencies to classify single and double compressed images. However, even\namidst lower frequencies of double compressed images/patches, histograms of all\nthe frequencies do not have distinguishable features to separate them from\nsingle compressed images. This paper directly extracts the quantized DCT\ncoefficients from the JPEG images without decompressing them in the pixel\ndomain, obtains all AC frequencies' histograms, uses a module based on $1\\times\n1$ depth-wise convolutions to learn the inherent relation between each\nhistogram and corresponding q-factor, and utilizes a tailor-made BiLSTM network\nfor selectively encoding these feature vector sequences. The proposed system\noutperforms several baseline methods on a relatively large and diverse publicly\navailable dataset of single and double compressed patches.

It\nhas been shown that (A) none of these spin-2 energy-momentum tensors are gauge\ninvariant and (B) the Noether and Hilbert energy-momentum tensors are not, in\ngeneral, equivalent; therefore uniqueness criteria is difficult to specify.\nConventional wisdom states that the various published energy-momentum tensors\nfor linearized gravity can be derived from the canonical Noether\nenergy-momentum tensor of spin-2 Fierz-Pauli theory by adding ad-hoc\n'improvement' terms (the divergence of a superpotential and terms proportional\nto the equations of motion), that these superpotentials are in some way unique\nor physically significant, and that this implies some meaningful connection to\nthe Noether procedure. To explore this question of uniqueness, we consider the\nmost general possible energy-momentum tensor for linearized gravity with free\ncoefficients using the Fock method. We express this most general\nenergy-momentum tensor as the canonical Noether tensor, supplemented by the\ndivergence of a general superpotential plus all possible terms proportional to\nthe equations of motion.

The relation to MP\nalgorithms reveals that the smoothness, or lack of smoothness of the mapping\nbetween the policy parameter space and the outcome space plays a key role in\nthe search efficiency. In particular, we show empirically that, if the mapping\nis smooth enough, i.e. if two close policies in the parameter space lead to\nsimilar outcomes, then diversity algorithms tend to inherit exploration\nproperties of MP algorithms.

The model consists of a\nsystem of parabolic partial differential equations for the variables\nrepresenting the concentrations of the bio-components constituting the waste\nmatrix and takes into account convective and diffusive phenomena. The plug-flow\nreactor is modelled as a one-dimensional domain; the waste matrix moves in the\ndirection of the reactor axis and undergoes diffusive phenomena which reproduce\nthe movement of the bio-components along the reactor axis due to a gradient in\nconcentration. The velocity characterizing the convection of the waste matrix\nis not fixed a priori but it is considered as an additional unknown of the\nmathematical problem. The variation in the convective velocity allows to\naccount the mass variation occurring along a plug-flow reactor due to the\nconversion of solids. The equation governing the convective velocity is derived\nby considering the density of the waste matrix within the reactor constant over\ntime and the sum of the volume fractions of the bio-components constituting the\nwaste matrix constrained to unity. The waste matrix undergoes biochemical\ntransformations catalysed by anaerobic microbial species which lead to the\nproduction of gaseous methane, the final product of the anaerobic digestion\nprocess. Biochemical processes are modelled using a simplified scheme and a\ndifferential equation is used to describe the dynamics of the produced gaseous\nmethane. A finite difference scheme is used for the numerical integration.\nModel consistency is showed through numerical simulations which investigate the\neffect of the variation of some operating parameters on process performance.\nThe model is then applied to a real case scenario of engineering interest.\nSimulations produce results in good agreement with experimental observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 14:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

However, the\ngeneric features, widely used in both stages, are not reliable for\ncharacterizing unseen objects, leading to poor generalization. To address this,\nwe introduce a novel approach for more accurate and efficient spatio-temporal\nsegmentation.

The best 3D video-realistic VR avatars that minimize the uncanny\neffect rely on person-specific (PS) models. However, these PS models are\ntime-consuming to build and are typically trained with limited data\nvariability, which results in poor generalization and robustness. Major sources\nof variability that affects the accuracy of facial expression transfer\nalgorithms include using different VR headsets (e.g., camera configuration,\nslop of the headset), facial appearance changes over time (e.g., beard,\nmake-up), and environmental factors (e.g., lighting, backgrounds). This is a\nmajor drawback for the scalability of these models in VR. This paper makes\nprogress in overcoming these limitations by proposing an end-to-end\nmulti-identity architecture (MIA) trained with specialized augmentation\nstrategies. MIA drives the shape component of the avatar from three cameras in\nthe VR headset (two eyes, one mouth), in untrained subjects, using minimal\npersonalized information (i.e., neutral 3D mesh shape). Similarly, if the PS\ntexture decoder is available, MIA is able to drive the full avatar\n(shape+texture) robustly outperforming PS models in challenging scenarios. Our\nkey contribution to improve robustness and generalization, is that our method\nimplicitly decouples, in an unsupervised manner, the facial expression from\nnuisance factors (e.g., headset, environment, facial appearance).

Our main tool\nis the theory of renormalized traces of pseudodifferential operators on compact\nsmooth manifolds without boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 18:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 18:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Hence, we extend the state of\nthe art Multi-objective optimization (MOO) solver, SMPSO, by incorporating EM\nin it. As a consequence, we develop the mathematical formalism of constriction\nfairness which is at the core of extended SMPSO algorithm.

Relation Extraction is able to detect\nsemantic relations between entities in sentences. Currently, many efficient\napproaches have been applied to relation extraction tasks. Supervised learning\napproaches especially have good performance. However, there are still many\ndifficult challenges. One of the most serious problems is that manually labeled\ndata is difficult to acquire. In most cases, limited data for supervised\napproaches equals lousy performance. Thus here, under the situation with only\nlimited training data, we focus on how to improve the performance of our\nsupervised baseline system with unsupervised pre-training. Feature is one of\nthe key components in improving the supervised approaches. Traditional\napproaches usually apply hand-crafted features, which require expert knowledge\nand expensive human labor. However, this type of feature might suffer from data\nsparsity: when the training set size is small, the model parameters might be\npoorly estimated. In this thesis, we present several novel unsupervised\npre-training models to learn the distributed text representation features,\nwhich are encoded with rich syntactic-semantic patterns of relation\nexpressions. The experiments have demonstrated that this type of feature,\ncombine with the traditional hand-crafted features, could improve the\nperformance of the logistic classification model for relation extraction,\nespecially on the classification of relations with only minor training\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 12:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}
