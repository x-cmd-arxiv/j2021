In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach called Cross-domain Adaptive Clustering to\naddress this problem. To achieve both inter-domain and intra-domain adaptation,\nwe first introduce an adversarial adaptive clustering loss to group features of\nunlabeled target data into clusters and perform cluster-wise feature alignment\nacross the source and target domains. We further apply pseudo labeling to\nunlabeled samples in the target domain and retain pseudo-labels with high\nconfidence. Pseudo labeling expands the number of ``labeled\" samples in each\nclass in the target domain, and thus produces a more robust and powerful\ncluster core for each class to facilitate adversarial learning.

Several reaction routes have been proposed and\nexperimentally verified under various interstellar conditions to explain the\nformation pathways involved. Most noticeably, the non-energetic processing of\nC$_2$H$_2$ ice with OH-radicals and H-atoms was shown to provide formation\nroutes to ketene, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and vinyl alcohol (CH$_2$CHOH) along\nthe H$_2$O formation sequence on grain surfaces. In this work, the\nnon-energetic formation scheme is extended with laboratory measurements\nfocusing on the energetic counterpart, induced by cosmic rays penetrating the\nH$_2$O-rich ice mantle. The focus here is on the H$^+$ radiolysis of\ninterstellar C$_2$H$_2$:H$_2$O ice analogs at 17 K. Ultra-high vacuum\nexperiments were performed to investigate the 200 keV H$^+$ radiolysis\nchemistry of predeposited C$_2$H$_2$:H$_2$O ices, both as mixed and layered\ngeometries. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor in situ\nnewly formed species as a function of the accumulated energy dose (or H$^+$\nfluence). The infrared (IR) spectral assignments are further confirmed in\nisotope labeling experiments using H$_2$$^{18}$O. The energetic processing of\nC$_2$H$_2$:H$_2$O ice not only results in the formation of (semi-) saturated\nhydrocarbons (C$_2$H$_4$ and C$_2$H$_6$) and polyynes as well as cumulenes\n(C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_4$H$_4$), but it also efficiently forms O-bearing COMs,\nincluding vinyl alcohol, ketene, acetaldehyde, and ethanol, for which the\nreaction cross-section and product composition are derived.

However, the current sub-60 Hz sensitivity of LIGO has\nnot yet reached its design target and the excess noise can be more than an\norder of magnitude below 20 Hz. It is limited by nonlinearly coupled noises\nfrom auxiliary control loops which are also nonstationary, posing challenges to\nrealistic early-warning pipelines. Nevertheless, machine-learning-based neural\nnetworks provide ways to simultaneously improve the low-frequency sensitivity\nand mitigate its nonstationarity, and detect the real-time gravitational-wave\nsignal with a very short computational time. We propose to achieve this by\ninputting both the main gravitational-wave readout and key auxiliary witnesses\nto a compound neural network. Using simulated data with characteristic\nrepresenting the real LIGO detectors, our machine-learning-based neural\nnetworks can reduce nonlinearly coupled noise by about a factor of 5 and allows\na typical binary neutron star (neutron-star-black-hole) to be detected 100 s\n(10 s) before the merger at a distance of 40 Mpc (160 Mpc). If one can further\nreduce the noise to the fundamental limit, our neural networks can achieve\ndetection out to a distance of 80 Mpc and 240 Mpc for binary neutron stars and\nneutron-star-black-holes, respectively. It thus demonstrates that utilizing\nmachine-learning-based neural networks is a promising direction for the timely\ndetection of the coalescence of electromagnetically bright LIGO/Virgo sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 16:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

However, current one-shot trackers solely rely on\nsingle-frame detections to predict candidate bounding boxes, which may be\nunreliable when facing disastrous visual degradation, e.g., motion blur,\nocclusions. Once a target bounding box is mistakenly classified as background\nby the detector, the temporal consistency of its corresponding tracklet will be\nno longer maintained. In this paper, we set out to restore the bounding boxes\nmisclassified as ``fake background'' by proposing a re-check network. The\nre-check network innovatively expands the role of ID embedding from data\nassociation to motion forecasting by effectively propagating previous tracklets\nto the current frame with a small overhead. Note that the propagation results\nare yielded by an independent and efficient embedding search, preventing the\nmodel from over-relying on detection results. Eventually, it helps to reload\nthe ``fake background'' and repair the broken tracklets.

These events may carry important clues about the astrophysical\nhost environments of the GW sources. In this paper, we present the\ndistributions of the effective spin parameter ($\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}$), the\nprecession spin parameter ($\\chi_\\mathrm{p}$), and the chirp mass\n($m_\\mathrm{chirp}$) expected in hierarchical mergers. Under a wide range of\nassumptions, hierarchical mergers produce (i) a monotonic increase of the\naverage of the typical total spin for merging binaries, which we characterize\nwith ${\\bar \\chi}_\\mathrm{typ}\\equiv\n\\overline{(\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}^2+\\chi_\\mathrm{p}^2)^{1/2}}$, up to roughly the\nmaximum $m_\\mathrm{chirp}$ among first-generation (1g) BHs, and (ii) a plateau\nat ${\\bar \\chi}_\\mathrm{typ}\\sim 0.6$ at higher $m_\\mathrm{chirp}$. We suggest\nthat the maximum mass and typical spin magnitudes for 1g BHs can be estimated\nfrom ${\\bar \\chi}_\\mathrm{typ}$ as a function of $m_\\mathrm{chirp}$. The GW\ndata observed in LIGO/Virgo O1--O3a prefers an increase in ${\\bar\n\\chi}_\\mathrm{typ}$ at low $m_\\mathrm{chirp}$, which is consistent with the\ngrowth of the BH spin magnitude by hierarchical mergers, at $\\sim 2 \\sigma$\nconfidence. A Bayesian analysis suggests that 1g BHs have the maximum mass of\n$\\sim 15$--$30\\,M_\\odot$ if the majority of mergers are of high-generation BHs\n(not among 1g-1g BHs), which is consistent with mergers in active galactic\nnucleus disks and/or nuclear star clusters, while if mergers mainly originate\nfrom globular clusters, 1g BHs are favored to have non-zero spin magnitudes of\n$\\sim 0.3$.

Previous studies suggested that the BPX-shaped bulge\ncan either be developed by bar buckling or by vertical inner Lindblad resonance\n(vILR) heating without buckling. In this paper, we study the observable\nconsequence of an BPX-shaped bulge built up quickly after bar formation via\nvILR heating without buckling, using an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of an\nisolated Milky Way-like galaxy. We found that the BPX-shaped bulge is dominated\nby stars born prior to bar formation. This is because the bar suppresses star\nformation, except for the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) region and its tips. The\nstars formed near the bar ends have higher Jacobi energy, and when these stars\nlose their angular momentum, their non-circular energy increases to conserve\nJacobi energy. This prevents them from reaching the vILR to be heated to the\nBPX region. By contrast, the NSD forms after the bar formation. From this\nsimulation and general considerations, we expect that the age distributions of\nthe NSD and BPX-shaped bulge formed without bar buckling do not overlap each\nother. Then, the transition age between these components betrays the formation\ntime of the bar, and is testable in future observations of the Milky Way and\nextra-galactic barred galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 22:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

We investigate the mechanisms regulating\nthe formation of stars in different environments within nearby star-forming\ngalaxies from the PHANGS sample. Methods: Integral field spectroscopic data and\nradio-interferometric observations of 18 galaxies were combined to explore the\nexistence of the resolved star formation main sequence (rSFMS), resolved\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation (rKS), and resolved molecular gas main sequence\n(rMGMS), and we derived their slope and scatter at spatial resolutions from 100\npc to 1 kpc (under various assumptions). Results: All three relations were\nrecovered at the highest spatial resolution (100 pc). Furthermore, significant\nvariations in these scaling relations were observed across different galactic\nenvironments. The exclusion of non-detections has a systematic impact on the\ninferred slope as a function of the spatial scale. Finally, the scatter of the\n$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{mol. gas + stellar}$ versus $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$ correlation\nis smaller than that of the rSFMS, but higher than that found for the rKS.\nConclusions: The rMGMS has the tightest relation at a spatial scale of 100 pc\n(scatter of 0.34 dex), followed by the rKS (0.41 dex) and then the rSFMS (0.51\ndex). This is consistent with expectations from the timescales involved in the\nevolutionary cycle of molecular clouds. Surprisingly, the rKS shows the least\nvariation across galaxies and environments, suggesting a tight link between\nmolecular gas and subsequent star formation.

This\nis the case at low luminosities, when the jet-corona coupling dominates the\nenergy output in both populations. Previous attempts to extend this framework\nto a wider AGN population have been extremely challenging due to heavy hydrogen\nabsorption of the accretion disc continuum and starlight contamination from the\nhost galaxies. We present the luminosity-excitation diagram (LED), based on the\n[OIV]$_{25.9\\mu m}$ and [NeII]$_{12.8\\mu m}$ mid-infrared nebular line fluxes.\nThis tool enables to probe the accretion disc contribution to the ionising\ncontinuum. When applied to a sample of 167 nearby AGN, the LED recovers the\ncharacteristic q-shaped morphology outlined by individual X-ray binaries during\na typical accretion episode, allowing us to tentatively identify the main\naccretion states. The soft state would include broad-line Seyferts and about\nhalf of the Seyfert 2 population, showing highly excited gas and radio-quiet\ncores consistent with disc-dominated nuclei. The hard state mostly includes\nlow-luminosity AGN ($\\leq 10^{-3}\\, \\rm{L_{Edd}}$) characterised by\nlow-excitation radio-loud nuclei and a negligible disc contribution. The\nremaining half of Seyfert 2 nuclei and the bright LINERs show low excitation at\nhigh accretion luminosities, and could be identified with the bright-hard and\nintermediate states. Their hosts show ongoing star formation in the central\nkiloparsecs. We discuss the above scenario, its potential links with the galaxy\nevolution picture and the possible presence of accretion state transitions in\nAGN, as suggested by the growing population of changing-look quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Today, the unique\nfeatures of quantum objects have led to the advent of promising quantum\ntechnologies [2, 3]. However, the macroscopic world is manifestly classical,\nand the nature of the quantum-to-classical crossover remains one of the most\nchallenging open question of Science to date. In this respect, moving objects\nplay a specific role [4, 5]. Pioneering experiments over the last few years\nhave begun exploring quantum behaviour of micron-sized mechanical\nsystems,either by passively cooling single GHz modes, or by adapting laser\ncooling techniques developed in atomic physics to cool specific modes far below\nthe temperature of their surroundings [6-11]. Here instead we describe a very\ndifferent approach, passive cooling of a micromechanical system down to 500\nmicroK, reducing the average number of quanta in the fundamental vibrational\nmode at 15 MHz to just 0.3 (with even lower values expected for higher\nharmonics); the challenge being to be still able to detect the motion without\ndisturbing the system noticeably. With such an approach higher harmonics and\nthe surrounding environment are also cooled, leading to potentially much longer\nmechanical coherence times, and enabling experiments questioning mechanical\nwave-function collapse [12], potentially from the gravitational background [13,\n14], and quantum thermodynamics [15]. Beyond the average behaviour, here we\nalso report on the fluctuations of the fundamental vibrational mode of the\ndevice in-equilibrium with the cryostat.

We\napplied ML interpretability tools to a classifier trained to predict AGN type\nfrom spectra, to demonstrate the use of such tools in this context. We trained\na support-vector machine on 3346 high-quality, low redshift AGN spectra from\nSDSS DR15 with an existing reliable classification as type 1, type 2, or\nintermediate type. On a selection of test-set spectra, we computed the gradient\nof the predicted class probability and we built saliency maps.

Saliency maps show why a given AGN type was predicted by\nour classifier, resulting in a physical interpretation in terms of regions of\nthe spectrum that affected its decision, making it no longer a black box. These\nregions coincide with those used by human experts such as relevant spectral\nlines, and are even used in a similar way, with the classifier e.g. effectively\nmeasuring the width of a line by weighing its center and its tails oppositely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

An important generalization of the Oiori\nformula which is widely used in modern seismology is presented. The generalized\nlaw is also expressed by an algebraic formula, but it contains an additional\nparameter, which makes it possible to more flexibly approximate the\nobservational data. The alternative approach to the theoretical description of\naftershocks is to use the differential evolution models. To simulate the\naveraged dynamics of aftershocks, it is proposed the Verhulst differential\nequation, also known as the logistic equation.

The image reconstruction problem of DOT is an\nill-posed inverse problem, due to the non-linear light propagation in tissues\nand limited boundary measurements. The ill-posedness means that the image\nreconstruction is sensitive to measurement and modelling errors. The Bayesian\napproach for the inverse problem of DOT offers the possibility of incorporating\nprior information about the unknowns, rendering the problem less ill-posed. It\nalso allows marginalisation of modelling errors utilising the so-called\nBayesian approximation error method. A more recent trend in image\nreconstruction techniques is the use of deep learning techniques, which have\nshown promising results in various applications from image processing to\ntomographic reconstructions. In this work, we study the non-linear DOT inverse\nproblem of estimating the absorption and scattering coefficients utilising a\n`model-based' learning approach, essentially intertwining learned components\nwith the model equations of DOT.

However, a systematic, statistically\nmeaningful analysis of such an approach remains missing. The aim of this work\nis to devise an automated, statistically robust technique to identify\nkinematical perturbations induced by the presence of planets in a gas disc, and\nto accurately infer their location. For this purpose, we produce hydro\nsimulations of planet-disc interactions with different planet masses, 0.3, 1.0\nand 3.0 $M_{Jup}$, at a radius of $R=100$ au in the disc, and perform radiative\ntransfer calculations of CO to simulate observables for 13 planet azimuths.\nUsing the DISCMINER package, we fit the synthetic data cubes with a Keplerian\nmodel of the channel-by-channel emission to study line profile differences,\nincluding deviations from Keplerian rotation. The detection technique, based on\nline centroid differences, captures localised planet-driven perturbations, and\ncan distinguish them from axisymmetric velocity perturbations. The method can\ndetect all three simulated planets, at all azimuths, with an average accuracy\nof $\\pm3^\\circ$ in azimuth and $\\pm8$ au in radius. Owing to disc structure and\nline-of-sight projection effects, planets at azimuths close to $\\pm45^\\circ$\nyield the highest velocity fluctuations, whereas those at limiting cases,\n$0^\\circ$ and $\\pm90^\\circ$, drive the lowest. The observed peak velocities\nrange within 40$-$70, 70$-$170 and 130$-$450 m s$^{-1}$ for 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0\n$M_{Jup}$ planets. Our analysis indicates that the variance of peak velocities\nis boosted near planets due to organised gas motions prompted by their\nlocalised gravitational well. We propose an approach that exploits this\nvelocity coherence to provide, for the first time, statistically significant\ndetections of localised planet-driven perturbations in the gas disc kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 20:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 18:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 09:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

The BraTS challenge consists of a 3D\nsegmentation of a 240x240x155x4 input image into a set of tumor classes.\nBecause of the large volume and need for 3D convolutional layers, this task is\nvery memory intensive. To address this, prior approaches use smaller cropped\nimages while constraining the model's depth and width. Our 3D U-Net uses a\nreversible version of the mobile inverted bottleneck block defined in\nMobileNetV2, MnasNet and the more recent EfficientNet architectures to save\nactivation memory during training. Using reversible layers enables the model to\nrecompute input activations given the outputs of that layer, saving memory by\neliminating the need to store activations during the forward pass. The inverted\nresidual bottleneck block uses lightweight depthwise separable convolutions to\nreduce computation by decomposing convolutions into a pointwise convolution and\na depthwise convolution. Further, this block inverts traditional bottleneck\nblocks by placing an intermediate expansion layer between the input and output\nlinear 1x1 convolution, reducing the total number of channels. Given a fixed\nmemory budget, with these memory saving techniques, we are able to train image\nvolumes up to 3x larger, models with 25% more depth, or models with up to 2x\nthe number of channels than a corresponding non-reversible network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 21:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 01:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The design of robust algorithms relies on surrogate losses since\nthe optimization of the adversarial loss with most hypothesis sets is NP-hard.\nBut which surrogate losses should be used and when do they benefit from\ntheoretical guarantees? We present an extensive study of this question,\nincluding a detailed analysis of the H-calibration and H-consistency of\nadversarial surrogate losses. We show that, under some general assumptions,\nconvex loss functions, or the supremum-based convex losses often used in\napplications, are not H-calibrated for important hypothesis sets such as\ngeneralized linear models or one-layer neural networks. We then give a\ncharacterization of H-calibration and prove that some surrogate losses are\nindeed H-calibrated for the adversarial loss, with these hypothesis sets.

To mitigate the secondary co-channel interference\ninflected at PUs, stringent secondary transmit power constraints are defined\nfor the secondary access points (S-APs). A generalized pilots sharing scheme is\nused to locally estimate the uplink channels at P-APs/S-APs, and thereby,\nconjugate precoders are adopted to serve PUs/SUs in the same time-frequency\nresource element.

The purpose of this paper is to describe a new post-processing\nalgorithm dedicated to the reconstruction of the spatial distribution of light\nreceived from off-axis sources, in particular from circumstellar disks.\n  Methods. Built on the recent PACO algorithm dedicated to the detection of\npoint-like sources, the proposed method is based on the local learning of patch\ncovariances capturing the spatial fluctuations of the stellar leakages. From\nthis statistical modeling, we develop a regularized image reconstruction\nalgorithm (REXPACO) following an inverse problem approach based on a forward\nimage formation model of the off-axis sources in the ADI sequences.\n  Results. Injections of fake circumstellar disks in ADI sequences from the\nVLT/SPHERE-IRDIS instrument show that both the morphology and the photometry of\nthe disks are better preserved by REXPACO compared to standard postprocessing\nmethods like cADI. In particular, the modeling of the spatial covariances\nproves usefull in reducing typical ADI artifacts and in better disentangling\nthe signal of these sources from the residual stellar contamination. The\napplication to stars hosting circumstellar disks with various morphologies\nconfirms the ability of REXPACO to produce images of the light distribution\nwith reduced artifacts. Finally, we show how REXPACO can be combined with PACO\nto disentangle the signal of circumstellar disks from the signal of candidate\npoint-like sources.\n  Conclusions. REXPACO is a novel post-processing algorithm producing\nnumerically deblurred images of the circumstellar environment.

Traditional record linkage techniques calculate string\nsimilarities between quasi-identifying (QID) values, such as the names and\naddresses of people. Errors, variations, and missing QID values can however\nlead to low linkage quality because the similarities between records cannot be\ncalculated accurately.

We first generate attribute signatures\n(concatenated QID values) using an Apriori based selection of suitable QID\nattributes, and then relational signatures that encapsulate relationship\ninformation between records. Combined, these signatures can uniquely identify\nindividual records and facilitate fast and high quality linking of very large\ndatabases through accurate similarity calculations between records.

To build a robust predictive model, these sparse data may\nneed to be augmented with simulated data, especially when the design space is\nmulti-dimensional. Simulations, however, often suffer from an inherent bias.\nEstimation of this bias may be poorly constrained not only because of data\nsparsity, but also because traditional predictive models fit only one type of\nobserved outputs, such as scalars or images, instead of all available output\ndata modalities, which might have been acquired and simulated at great cost. To\nbreak this limitation and open up the path for multi-modal calibration, we\npropose to combine a novel, transfer learning technique for suppressing the\nbias with recent developments in deep learning, which allow building predictive\nmodels with multi-modal outputs. First, we train an initial neural network\nmodel on simulated data to learn important correlations between different\noutput modalities and between simulation inputs and outputs. Then, the model is\npartially retrained, or transfer learned, to fit the experiments; a method that\nhas never been implemented in this type of architecture. Using fewer than 10\ninertial confinement fusion experiments for training, transfer learning\nsystematically improves the simulation predictions while a simple output\ncalibration, which we design as a baseline, makes the predictions worse. We\nalso offer extensive cross-validation with real and carefully designed\nsynthetic data.

The proposed DNN architecture is evaluated with respect to its\nability to accurately reconstruct heterogeneous congestion patterns under\nvarying input data sparsity. Therefore, a large set of empirical Floating-Car\nData (FCD) collected on German freeway A9 during two months is utilized.

APC systems, like all\nother measurement devices, are susceptible to error, which is treated as random\nnoise and is required to not exceed certain bounds. The demand for very low\nerrors is especially fueld by applications like revenue sharing, which is in\nthe billions, annually. As a result, both the requirements as well as the costs\nheavily increased. In this work, we address the latter problem and present a\nsolution to increase the efficiency of initial or recurrent (e.g. yearly or\nmore frequent) APC validation. Our new approach, the partitioned equivalence\ntest, is an extension to this widely used statistic hypothesis test and\nguarantees the same bounded, low user risk while reducing effort. This can be\nused to either cut costs or to extend validation without cost increase. It\ninvolves a pre-classification step, which itsself can be arbitrary, so we\nevaluated several use cases: entirely manual and algorithmic, artificial\nintelligence assisted workflows. For former, by restructuring the evaluation of\nmanual counts, our new statistical test can be used as a drop-in replacement\nfor existing test procedures. The largest savings, however, result from latter\nalgorithmic use cases: Due to the user risk being as bounded as in the original\nequivalence test, no additional requirements are introduced.

The proposed self-correction\nlearning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding\npseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain\ninformation to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels.\nExtensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets\ndemonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nsegmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods.\nAblation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in\nour model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and\nself-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to\nmulti-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical\ndeployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 00:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The scaling values have a common hyper-parameter that is an order of\nexpansion of an ideal scaling value that achieves hard thresholding. We simply\ncall this estimator a scaled soft thresholding estimator. The scaled soft\nthresholding is a general method that includes the soft thresholding and\nnon-negative garrote as special cases and gives an another derivation of\nadaptive LASSO. We then derived the degree of freedom of the scaled soft\nthresholding by means of the Stein's unbiased risk estimate and found that it\nis decomposed into the degree of freedom of soft thresholding and the reminder\nconnecting to hard thresholding. In this meaning, the scaled soft thresholding\ngives a natural bridge between soft and hard thresholding methods. Since the\ndegree of freedom represents the degree of over-fitting, this result implies\nthat there are two sources of over-fitting in the scaled soft thresholding. The\nfirst source originated from soft thresholding is determined by the number of\nun-removed coefficients and is a natural measure of the degree of over-fitting.\nWe analyzed the second source in a particular case of the scaled soft\nthresholding by referring a known result for hard thresholding. We then found\nthat, in a sparse, large sample and non-parametric setting, the second source\nis largely determined by coefficient estimates whose true values are zeros and\nhas an influence on over-fitting when threshold levels are around noise levels\nin those coefficient estimates. In a simple numerical example, these\ntheoretical implications has well explained the behavior of the degree of\nfreedom.

In a recent study, we found\nthat this bistability could be destroyed by removing the singularity through\ncutting a hole around the vertex, depending on the size and shape of the hole.\nThis paper extends our recent work and is based on the following observations\nin tabletop models of creased disks with circular holes: (i) reducing the\ncircumference of the creased disk by removing an annular sector could increase\nthe hole size to be as large as the disk without destroying the bistability,\n(ii) with a single crease, the circular hole could be as large as the disk\nwithout loss of the bistability, and (iii) a family of stable inverted states\ncan be obtained by inverting the disk almost anywhere along the crease. An\ninextensible strip model is implemented to investigate these phenomena. We\nformulate a minimal facet of the creased disk as a two-point boundary value\nproblem with the creases modeled as nonlinear hinges, and use numerical\ncontinuation to conduct parametric studies.

Our\nnumerical results confirm the qualitative observations in (i)-(iii) and further\nreveal unexpected results caused by the coupling between these geometric\nparameters.

Currently, such attack methods are based on\nthe hypothesis that the substitute model and the victim model learn similar\ndecision boundaries, and they conventionally apply Sign Method (SM) to\nmanipulate the gradient as the resultant perturbation. Although SM is\nefficient, it only extracts the sign of gradient units but ignores their value\ndifference, which inevitably leads to a deviation. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel Staircase Sign Method (S$^2$M) to alleviate this issue, thus boosting\nattacks. Technically, our method heuristically divides the gradient sign into\nseveral segments according to the values of the gradient units, and then\nassigns each segment with a staircase weight for better crafting adversarial\nperturbation. As a result, our adversarial examples perform better in both\nwhite-box and black-box manner without being more visible. Since S$^2$M just\nmanipulates the resultant gradient, our method can be generally integrated into\nthe family of FGSM algorithms, and the computational overhead is negligible.\nExtensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed methods, which significantly improve the transferability (i.e., on\naverage, \\textbf{5.1\\%} for normally trained models and \\textbf{12.8\\%} for\nadversarially trained defenses).

We have searched for bright optical\ntransients at the localizations of the FRBs (<1 arcsec) in the template\nsubtracted images.

For a solution set with\n$\\mu$ solutions on a Pareto front, a larger hypervolume means a better solution\nset. Investigating the distribution of the solution set with the largest\nhypervolume is an important topic in EMO, which is the so-called hypervolume\noptimal $\\mu$-distribution. Theoretical results have shown that the $\\mu$\nsolutions are uniformly distributed on a linear Pareto front in two dimensions.\nHowever, the $\\mu$ solutions are not always uniformly distributed on a\nsingle-line Pareto front in three dimensions.

Quality learning representation of unseen classes (or styles) is\ncritical to facilitate novel image generation and better generative\nunderstanding of unseen visual classes, i.e., zero-shot learning (ZSL). By\ngenerating representations of unseen classes based on their semantic\ndescriptions, e.g., attributes or text, generative ZSL attempts to\ndifferentiate unseen from seen categories. The proposed GRaWD loss is defined\nby constructing a dynamic graph that includes the seen class/style centers and\ngenerated samples in the current minibatch.

However,\nthe mechanisms underlying microbial diversity are still under debate, as simple\nmathematical models only permit as many species to coexist as there are\nresources. A plethora of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origins\nof microbial diversity, but many of these analyses omit a key property of real\nmicrobial ecosystems: the propensity of the microbes themselves to change their\ngrowth properties within and across generations. In order to explore the impact\nof this key property on microbial diversity, we expand upon a recently\ndeveloped model of microbial diversity in fluctuating environments. We\nimplement changes in growth strategy in two distinct ways. First, we consider\nthe regulation of a cell's enzyme levels within short, ecological times, and\nsecond we consider evolutionary changes driven by mutations across generations.\nInterestingly, we find that these two types of microbial responses to the\nenvironment can have drastically different outcomes. Enzyme regulation may\ncollapse diversity over long enough times while, conversely,\nstrategy-randomizing mutations can produce a \"rich-get-poorer\" effect that\npromotes diversity. This work makes explicit, using a simple serial-dilutions\nframework, the conflicting ways that microbial adaptation and evolution can\naffect community diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 05:41:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 09:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

A sliding motion\nis applied to target objects to generate tactile vibration data. However,\nsituations exist where such a sliding motion is infeasible due to geometrical\nconstraints in the environment or an object's fragility which cannot resist\nfriction forces. This paper explores a novel approach to achieve\nvibration-based tactile perception without a sliding motion. To this end, our\nkey idea is injecting a mechanical vibration into a soft tactile sensor system\nand measuring the propagated vibration inside it by a sensor. Soft tactile\nsensors are deformed by the contact state, and the touched objects' shape or\ntexture should change the characteristics of the vibration propagation.\nTherefore, the propagated-vibration data are expected to contain useful\ninformation for recognizing touched environments. We developed a prototype\nsystem for a proof-of-concept: a mechanical vibration is applied to a\nbiomimetic (soft and vibration-based) tactile sensor from a small, mounted\npiezoelectric actuator. As a verification experiment, we performed two\nclassification tasks for sandpaper's grit size and a slit's gap widths using\nour approach and compared their accuracies with that of using sliding motions.\nOur approach resulted in 70% accuracy for the grit size classification and 99%\naccuracy for the gap width classification. These results are comparable to or\nbetter than the comparison methods with a sliding motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

This work proposes a novel Context-based Tandem Network (CTNet)\nby interactively exploring the spatial contextual information and the channel\ncontextual information, which can discover the semantic context for semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, the Spatial Contextual Module (SCM) is leveraged to\nuncover the spatial contextual dependency between pixels by exploring the\ncorrelation between pixels and categories. Meanwhile, the Channel Contextual\nModule (CCM) is introduced to learn the semantic features including the\nsemantic feature maps and class-specific features by modeling the long-term\nsemantic dependence between channels. The learned semantic features are\nutilized as the prior knowledge to guide the learning of SCM, which can make\nSCM obtain more accurate long-range spatial dependency. Finally, to further\nimprove the performance of the learned representations for semantic\nsegmentation, the results of the two context modules are adaptively integrated\nto achieve better results. Extensive experiments are conducted on three\nwidely-used datasets, i.e., PASCAL-Context, ADE20K and PASCAL VOC2012.

One common approach to\nanalyzing such high-dimensional data is to use linear errors-in-variables\nmodels; however, current methods for fitting such models are computationally\nexpensive. In this paper, we present two efficient screening procedures, namely\ncorrected penalized marginal screening and corrected sure independence\nscreening, to reduce the number of variables for final model building. Both\nscreening procedures are based on fitting corrected marginal regression models\nrelating the outcome to each contaminated covariate separately, which can be\ncomputed efficiently even with a large number of features. Under mild\nconditions, we show that these procedures achieve screening consistency and\nreduce the number of features considerably, even when the number of covariates\ngrows exponentially with the sample size. Additionally, if the true covariates\nare weakly correlated, corrected penalized marginal screening can achieve full\nvariable selection consistency. Through simulation studies and an analysis of\ngene expression data for bone mineral density of Norwegian women, we\ndemonstrate that the two new screening procedures make estimation of linear\nerrors-in-variables models computationally scalable in high dimensional\nsettings, and improve finite sample estimation and selection performance\ncompared with estimators that do not employ a screening stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The evolution of the tumor\nfraction is governed by a variational inequality corresponding to a double\nobstacle nonlinearity occurring in the associated potential. In addition, the\ncontrol and state variables are nonlinearly coupled and, furthermore, the cost\nfunctional contains a nondifferentiable term like the $L^1$-norm in order to\ninclude sparsity effects which is of utmost relevance, especially time\nsparsity, in the context of cancer therapies as applying a control to the\nsystem reflects in exposing the patient to an intensive medical treatment. To\ncope with the difficulties originating from the variational inequality in the\nstate system, we employ the so-called \"deep quench approximation\" in which the\nconvex part of the double obstacle potential is approximated by logarithmic\nfunctions. For such functions, first-order necessary conditions of optimality\ncan be established by invoking recent results.

However, the accurate diagnosis of this disease is expensive,\nespecially in developing countries. This article concerns a cost-efficient\nmethod for estimating prevalence of breast cancer, when diagnosis is based on a\ncomprehensive biopsy procedure. Multistage ranked set sampling (MSRSS) is\nutilized to develop a proportion estimator. This design employs some visually\nassessed cytological covariates, which are pertinent to determination of breast\ncancer, so as to provide the experimenter with a more informative sample.\nTheoretical properties of the proposed estimator are explored. Evidence from\nnumerical studies is reported. The developed procedure can be substantially\nmore efficient than its competitor in simple random sampling (SRS). In some\nsituations, the proportion estimation in MSRSS needs around 76% fewer\nobservations than that in SRS, given a precision level. Thus, using MSRSS may\nlead to a considerable reduction in cost with respect to SRS. In many medical\nstudies, e.g. diagnosing breast cancer based on a full biopsy procedure, exact\nquantification is difficult (costly and/or time-consuming), but the potential\nsample units can be ranked fairly accurately without actual measurements.

Remarkably, the submillimeter plasmonic bubble\nis found to be periodically attracted to and repelled from the\nnanoparticle-decorated substrate, with frequencies of around a few kHz. We\nidentify the competition between solutal and thermal Marangoni forces as origin\nof the periodic bouncing. The former arises due to the selective vaporization\nof ethanol at the substrate's side of the bubble, leading to a solutal\nMarangoni flow towards the hot substrate, which pushes the bubble away.

While this protects the\nconfidentiality and integrity of communication, it prevents network monitoring\nsystems (NMS) and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) from effectively analyzing\nthe now encrypted payloads. Therefore, many enterprise networks have deployed\nman-in-the-middle (MitM) proxies that intercept TLS connections at the network\nborder to examine packet payloads and thus retain some visibility. However,\nrecent studies have shown that TLS interception often reduces connection\nsecurity and potentially introduces additional attack vectors to the network.\nIn this paper, we present a cooperative approach in which end-hosts as\ncryptographic endpoints selectively provide TLS key material to NMS for\ndecryption. This enables endpoints to control who can decrypt which content and\nlets users retain privacy for chosen connections. We implement a prototype\nbased on the Zeek NMS that is able to receive key material from hosts, decrypt\nTLS connections and perform analyzes on the cleartext. The patch is freely\navailable and we plan to upstream our changes to Zeek once they are mature\nenough. In our evaluation, we discuss how our approach conceptually requires\nsignificantly less computational resources compared to the commonly deployed\nMitM proxies.

It is well known that humans spend 80% of\ntheir time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to\nthree main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost\nindoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent\nindoor mobility, and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in\nmobility. To deal with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a\nTransformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility at\nmultiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input\nenterprise WiFi system logs to extract human mobility trajectories from\nsmartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the\nmobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and micro, to design a\nmulti-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours\nto an entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding\ncaptures the mobility periodicity and correlations across various scales while\nTransformers capture long-term mobility dependencies boosting model prediction\nperformance. This approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first\npredicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro-mobility,\nconditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the\ntopological constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that\nWiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10% points higher than the\ncurrent state-of-art models.

However, it remains difficult for observations to tell whether these\nintermediate-sized exoplanets have surfaces and where their surfaces are\nlocated. Here we propose that the abundances of trace species in the visible\natmospheres of these sub-Neptunes can be used as proxies for determining the\nexistence of surfaces and approximate surface conditions. As an example, we\nused a state-of-the-art photochemical model to simulate the atmospheric\nevolution of K2-18b and investigate its final steady-state composition with\nsurfaces located at different pressures levels (Psurf). We find the surface\nlocation has a significant impact on the atmospheric abundances of trace\nspecies, making them deviate significantly from their thermochemical\nequilibrium and \"no-surface\" conditions. This result arises primarily because\nthe pressure-temperature conditions at the surface determine whether\nphotochemically-produced species can be recycled back to their favored\nthermochemical-equilibrium forms and transported back to the upper atmosphere.\nFor an assumed H2-rich atmosphere for K2-18b, we identify seven chemical\nspecies that are most sensitive to the existence of surfaces: ammonia (NH3),\nmethane (CH4), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), carbon\nmonoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The ratio between the observed and the\nno-surface abundances of these species, can help distinguish the existence of a\nshallow surface (Psurf < 10 bar), an intermediate surface (10 bar < Psurf < 100\nbar), and a deep surface (Psurf > 100 bar). This framework can be applied\ntogether with future observations to other sub-Neptunes of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 09:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 20:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

The novelty of the\nFarmer-Joshi model is that the dynamics are driven by trade entry and exit\nthresholds alone. We recover the known claim that some important stylized facts\nobserved in financial markets cannot be easily found under calibration -- in\nparticular those relating to the auto-correlations in the absolute values of\nthe price fluctuations, and sufficient kurtosis. However, rather than concerns\nrelating to the calibration method, what is novel here is that we extended the\nFarmer-Joshi model to include agent adaptation using an Brock and Hommes\napproach to strategy fitness based on trading strategy profitability. We call\nthis an adaptive Farmer-Joshi model: the model allows trading agents to switch\nbetween strategies by favouring strategies that have been more profitable over\nsome period of time determined by a free-parameter fixing the profit monitoring\ntime-horizon. In the adaptive model we are able to calibrate and recover\nadditional stylized facts, despite apparent degeneracy's. This is achieved by\ncombining the interactions of trade entry levels with trade strategy switching.\nWe use this to argue that for low-frequency trading across days, as calibrated\nto daily sampled data, feed-backs can be accounted for by strategy die-out\nbased on intermediate term profitability; we find that the average trade\nmonitoring horizon is approximately two to three months (or 40 to 60 days) of\ntrading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 09:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

We propose a hybrid\nscheme by integrating industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and intelligent\nhealth monitoring algorithms to handle this challenge. To start with, an IIoT\nnetwork is constructed to sense and store measurements. Specifically,\ntemperature sensors are properly chosen and deployed at the inlet and outlet of\nthe water tank to measure water temperature. Second, with temperature\ninformation, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm named mixture slow\nfeature analysis (MSFA) to timely evaluate the health status of the integrated\nHP. Characterized by frequent operation switches of different HPs due to the\nvariable demand for hot water, various heating patterns with different heating\nspeeds are observed. Slowness, a kind of dynamics to measure the varying speed\nof steady distribution, is properly considered in MSFA for both heating pattern\ndivision and health evaluation. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is\nverified through a real integrated HP with five connected HPs installed ten\nyears ago. The experimental results show that MSFA is capable of accurately\nidentifying health status of the system, especially failure at a preliminary\nstage compared to its competing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 10:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Our proposed method, the Shadow\nNeural Radiance Field (S-NeRF) follows recent advances in implicit volumetric\nrepresentation learning. For each scene, we train S-NeRF using very high\nspatial resolution optical images taken from known viewing angles. The learning\nrequires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image\nreconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both\nfrom a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky),\nwe extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the\nSun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect\nillumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field\nas a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of\nthese factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared\nto NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full\n3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, and\ntransient object filtering, without any explicit shape supervision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 10:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Specifically, spitzoid melanocytic tumors are one of the most\nchallenging melanocytic lesions due to their ambiguous morphological features.\nThe gold standard for its diagnosis and prognosis is the analysis of skin\nbiopsies. In this process, dermatopathologists visualize skin histology slides\nunder a microscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last\nyears, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool\nthat could support pathologists in daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, no\nautomatic CAD systems have yet been proposed for the analysis of spitzoid\nlesions. Regarding common melanoma, no proposed system allows both the\nselection of the tumoral region and the prediction of the diagnosis as benign\nor malignant. Motivated by this, we propose a novel end-to-end\nweakly-supervised deep learning model, based on inductive transfer learning\nwith an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine the embedding\nfeatures of the latent space. The framework is composed of a source model in\ncharge of finding the tumor patch-level patterns, and a target model focuses on\nthe specific diagnosis of a biopsy.

As type II bursts are signatures of propagating shock\nwaves that are associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), a rich\nvariety of radio emissions can be expected. However, sometimes DH type II\nbursts appear in the dynamic spectra without other or earlier radio signatures.\nOne explanation for them could be that the flare-CME launch happens on the far\nside of the Sun, and the emission is observed only when the source gets high\nenough in the solar atmosphere. In this study we have analysed 26 radio type II\nbursts that started at DH waves and were well-separated ('isolated') from other\nradio emission features. These bursts were identified from all DH type II\nbursts observed in 1998-2016, and for 12 events we had observations from at\nleast two different viewing angles with the instruments onboard Wind and STEREO\nsatellites. We found that only 30% of the type II bursts had their source\norigin on the far side of the Sun, but also that no bursts originated from the\ncentral region of the Sun (longitudes E30 - W40). Almost all of the isolated DH\ntype II bursts could be associated with a shock near the CME leading front, and\nonly few were determined to be shocks near the CME flank regions. In this\nrespect our result differs from earlier findings. Our analysis, which included\ninspection of various CME and radio emission characteristics, suggests that the\nisolated DH type II bursts could be a special subgroup within DH type II\nbursts, where the radio emission requires particular coronal conditions to form\nand to die out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 10:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Here, we investigate the effects of direct\ndeposition of different dielectric materials (Al$_2$O$_3$, SiO$_2$, SiN$_x$)\nonto atomically thin (monolayer) TMDC WS$_2$ on its optical response. Atomic\nlayer deposition (ALD), electron beam evaporation (EBE), plasma enhanced\nchemical vapour deposition (PECVD), and magnetron sputtering methods of\nmaterial deposition are investigated. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements\nreveal quenching of the excitonic emission after all deposition processes. The\nreduction in neutral exciton PL is linked to the increased level of charge\ndoping and associated rise of the trion emission, and/or the localized (bound)\nexciton emission. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allows us to clearly\ncorrelate the observed changes of excitonic emission with the increased levels\nof lattice disorder and defects. Overall, the EBE process results in the lowest\nlevel of doping and defect densities and preserves the spectral weight of the\nexciton emission in the PL, as well as the exciton oscillator strength.\nEncapsulation with ALD appears to cause chemical changes, which makes it\ndistinct from all other techniques. Sputtering is revealed as the most\naggressive deposition method for WS$_2$, fully quenching its optical response.\nOur results demonstrate and quantify the effects of direct deposition of\ndielectric materials onto monolayer WS$_2$, which can provide a valuable\nguidance for the efforts to integrate monolayer TMDCs into functional\noptoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Unlike previous\napproaches that computed a single restoration using MAP or MMSE, our method\nmakes explicit the uncertainty in the restored images and guarantees that all\npatches in the restored images will be typical given the patch prior. Unlike\nprevious approaches that used implicit priors on fixed-size images, our\napproach can be used with images of any size. Our experimental results show\nthat posterior sampling using patch priors yields images of high perceptual\nquality and high PSNR on a range of challenging image restoration problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Recent numerical simulations show that\nunder certain conditions, the energy is accumulated at the largest scales of\nthe system, forming coherent vortex structures known as condensates. We\nanalytically describe the interaction of a strong condensate with weak\nsmall-scale turbulent pulsations and obtain an equation that allows us to\ndetermine the radial velocity profile $U(r)$ of a coherent vortex. When\nexternal rotation is fast, the velocity profiles of cyclones and anticyclones\nare identical to each other and are well described by the dependence $U(r)\n\\propto \\pm r \\ln (R/r)$, where $R$ is the transverse size of the vortex. As\nthe external rotation decreases, this symmetry disappears: the maximum velocity\nin cyclones is greater and the position of the maximum is closer to the axis of\nthe vortex in comparison with anticyclones. Besides, our analysis shows that\nthe size $R$ of the anticyclone cannot exceed a certain critical value, which\ndepends on the Rossby and Reynolds numbers.

Conventionally, the SBIR schema\nmainly considers simultaneous mappings among the two image views and the\nsemantic side information. Therefore, it is desirable to consider fine-grained\nclasses mainly in the sketch domain using highly discriminative and\nsemantically rich feature space. However, the existing deep generative\nmodeling-based SBIR approaches majorly focus on bridging the gaps between the\nseen and unseen classes by generating pseudo-unseen-class samples. Besides,\nviolating the ZSL protocol by not utilizing any unseen-class information during\ntraining, such techniques do not pay explicit attention to modeling the\ndiscriminative nature of the shared space. Also, we note that learning a\nunified feature space for both the multi-view visual data is a tedious task\nconsidering the significant domain difference between sketches and color\nimages. In this respect, as a remedy, we introduce a novel framework for\nzero-shot SBIR. While we define a cross-modal triplet loss to ensure the\ndiscriminative nature of the shared space, an innovative cross-modal attention\nlearning strategy is also proposed to guide feature extraction from the image\ndomain exploiting information from the respective sketch counterpart. In order\nto preserve the semantic consistency of the shared space, we consider a graph\nCNN-based module that propagates the semantic class topology to the shared\nspace. To ensure an improved response time during inference, we further explore\nthe possibility of representing the shared space in terms of hash codes.\nExperimental results obtained on the benchmark TU-Berlin and the Sketchy\ndatasets confirm the superiority of CrossATNet in yielding state-of-the-art\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 12:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

We resolve this ambiguity\nby self-consistently extending the relativistic disc solution through the ISCO\nto the black hole horizon by calculating the inspiral of an average disc\nparticle subject to turbulent disc forces, using a new particle-in-disc\ntechnique. Traditionally it has been assumed that the stress at the ISCO is\nzero, with material plunging approximately radially into the black hole at\nclose to the speed of light. We demonstrate that in fact the inspiral is less\nsevere, with several (~4-17) orbits completed before the horizon. This leads to\na small non-zero stress and luminosity at and inside the ISCO, with a local\nsurface temperature at the ISCO between ~0.15 and 0.3 times the maximum surface\ntemperature of the disc, in the case where no dynamically important net\nmagnetic field is present. For a range of disc parameters we calculate the\nvalue of the inner stress/surface temperature, which is required when fitting\nrelativistic thin disc models to observations.

Our basic motivation is that motion is an\nimportant and universal signal that can drive us to adaptively select frames\nfrom videos. Accordingly, we propose two important properties in our MGSampler\ndesign: motion sensitive and motion uniform. First, we present two different\nmotion representations to enable us to efficiently distinguish the\nmotion-salient frames from the background. Then, we devise a motion-uniform\nsampling strategy based on the cumulative motion distribution to ensure the\nsampled frames evenly cover all the important segments with high motion\nsalience. Our MGSampler yields a new principled and holistic sampling scheme,\nthat could be incorporated into any existing video architecture.

We also demonstrate how these frameworks act as a\nconfused deputy in manager-assisted credential phishing attacks. Our results\ndemonstrate the need for significant improvements to mobile autofill\nframeworks. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the design and\nimplementation of secure autofill frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 13:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

To\nreach a dichotomous clinical decision, a threshold would be imposed to\ndistinguish subjects with disease from non-diseased individuals. Among various\nperformance metrics for a continuous biomarker, specificity at a controlled\nsensitivity level (or vice versa) is often desirable for clinical utility since\nit directly targets where the clinical test is intended to operate. Covariates,\nsuch as age, race, and sample collection, could impact the controlled\nsensitivity level in subpopulations and may also confound the association\nbetween biomarker and disease status. Therefore, covariate adjustment is\nimportant in such biomarker evaluation. In this paper, we suggest to adopt a\nparsimonious quantile regression model for the diseased population, locally at\nthe controlled sensitivity level, and assess specificity with\ncovariate-specific control of the sensitivity. Variance estimates are obtained\nfrom a sample-based approach and bootstrap. Furthermore, our proposed local\nmodel extends readily to a global one for covariate adjustment for the receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve over the sensitivity continuum. We\ndemonstrate computational efficiency of this proposed method and restore the\ninherent monotonicity in the estimated covariate-adjusted ROC curve. The\nasymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation\nstudies show favorable performance of the proposal.

Some works incorporate the local comparisons through\ncross-modal local matching and reasoning. These complex operations introduce\ntremendous computation.

The local\ncross-modal similarities are computed between the video feature and text\nfeature within the same center. This design enables the meticulous local\ncomparison and reduces the computational cost of the interaction between each\ntext-video pair.

We\nderive instead a method that minimizes the cost function representing the\ndistance between the assignment function of the original particle and that of\nthe sum of split particles. Depending on the interpolation degree and the\ndimension of the problem, we provide tabulated results for the weight and\nposition of the split particles. This strategy represents no overhead in\ncomputing time and for a large enough number of split-particles it\nasymptotically tends to the exact solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate properties of $R_e$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the\ncity of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and\nhigh-risk subpopulations. The response of $R_e$ to two types of control\nmeasures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations\nis characterized. A nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to\ninclude the effects of diminishing returns. We propose three types of heuristic\nstrategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing $R_e$, and we\nexhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of\ndeaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic\nstrategies, which consider only the effects of controls on $R_e$, without\nregard to subpopulation; and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize\ncontrol of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three\nheuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target\nvalue for $R_e$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value.\nThis heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the\nentire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that\nmaximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic\nstrategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease.\nThe model shows that delaying the start of control measures past a certain\npoint greatly worsens strategy outcomes. We conclude that the effective\nreproduction can be a valuable real-time indicator in determining\ncost-effective control strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The only information given in advance is about the\ntarget-measurement model and the constraint that there is no more than one\ntarget in the scenario. To solve these challenges, we model the movement of the\ntarget by using a trajectory function of time (T-FoT). Data-driven T-FoT\ninitiation and termination strategies are proposed for identifying the\n(re-)appearance and disappearance of the target. During the existence of the\ntarget, real target measurements are distinguished from clutter if the target\nindeed exists and is detected, in order to update the T-FoT at each scan for\nwhich we design a least-squares estimator.

With every passing year, our dependency on the\nrenewable sources of energy is increasing exponentially. As a result, complex\nand hybrid generation systems are being designed and developed to meet the\nenergy demands and ensure energy security in a country. The continual\nimprovement in the technology and an effort towards the provision of\nuninterrupted power to the end-users is strongly dependent on an effective and\nfault resilient Operation and Maintenance (O&M) system. Ingenious algorithms\nand techniques are hence been introduced aiming to minimize equipment and plant\ndowntime. Efforts are being made to develop robust Prognostic Maintenance\nsystems that can identify the faults before they occur. To this aim, complex\nData Analytics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being used to increase\nthe overall efficiency of these prognostic maintenance systems.\n  This paper provides an overview of the predictive/prognostic maintenance\nframeworks reported in the literature. We pay a particular focus to the\napproaches, challenges including data-related issues, such as the availability\nand quality of the data and data auditing, feature engineering,\ninterpretability, and security issues. Being a key aspect of ML-based\nsolutions, we also discuss some of the commonly used publicly available\ndatasets in the domain. The paper also identifies key future research\ndirections. We believe such detailed analysis will provide a baseline for\nfuture research in the domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

Initially,\na transmission impedance surface is analyzed and compared with the reflection\none. Then, interferograms associated with the scalar admittance distribution\nare defined according to the number and direction of the radiation beams.

Visualisation of such emotions is traditionally carried out\nusing the most popular layouts, as bar plots or tables, which are however\nsub-optimal. The classic representation of the Plutchik's wheel follows the\nprinciples of proximity and opposition between pairs of emotions: spatial\nproximity in this model is also a semantic proximity, as adjacent emotions\nelicit a complex emotion (a primary dyad) when triggered together; spatial\nopposition is a semantic opposition as well, as positive emotions are opposite\nto negative emotions. The most common layouts fail to preserve both features,\nnot to mention the need of visually allowing comparisons between different\ncorpora in a blink of an eye, that is hard with basic design solutions. We\nintroduce PyPlutchik, a Python library specifically designed for the\nvisualisation of Plutchik's emotions in texts or in corpora. PyPlutchik draws\nthe Plutchik's flower with each emotion petal sized after how much that emotion\nis detected or annotated in the corpus, also representing three degrees of\nintensity for each of them. Notably, PyPlutchik allows users to display also\nprimary, secondary, tertiary and opposite dyads in a compact, intuitive way. We\nsubstantiate our claim that PyPlutchik outperforms other classic visualisations\nwhen displaying Plutchik emotions and we showcase a few examples that display\nour library's most compelling features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 19:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

In terms of robot control, this framework is proposing\nspecifically a high-level control architecture independent of the low-level\ncontrol, meaning these two required level of control can be developed\nseparately from each other.
