For simulating SGN\nat low computational costs and without changing the learning rate or batch\nsize, we propose the Positive-Negative Momentum (PNM) approach that is a\npowerful alternative to conventional Momentum in classic optimizers.

The most well known example --\nsuperconductivity -- is caused by the formation and condensation of pairs of\nelectrons. A key property of superconductors is diamagnetism: magnetic fields\nare screened by dissipationless currents. Fundamentally, what distinguishes\nsuperconducting states from normal states is a spontaneously broken symmetry\ncorresponding to long-range coherence of fermion pairs. Here we report a set of\nexperimental observations in hole doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ which are\nnot consistent with conventional superconducting behavior. Our specific-heat\nmeasurements indicate the formation of fermionic bound states when the\ntemperature is lowered from the normal state.

The finite resistance and the lack\nof any detectable diamagnetic screening in this state exclude the spontaneously\nbroken symmetry associated with superconducting two-fermion correlations.\nInstead, combined evidence from transport and thermodynamic measurements\nindicates that the formation of fermionic bound states leads to spontaneous\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry above the superconducting transition\ntemperature. These results demonstrate the existence of a\nbroken-time-reversal-symmetry bosonic metal state.

Existing model execution\napproaches (interpretation of models or code generation) do not support the\nexecution of partial models. Supporting the execution of partial models at the\nearly stages of software development allows early detection of defects, which\ncan be fixed more easily and at a lower cost. This paper proposes a conceptual\nframework for the execution of partial models, which consists of three steps:\nstatic analysis, automatic refinement, and input-driven execution. First, a\nstatic analysis that respects the execution semantics of models is applied to\ndetect problematic elements of models that cause problems for the execution.\nSecond, using model transformation techniques, the models are refined\nautomatically, mainly by adding decision points where missing information can\nbe supplied. Third, refined models are executed, and when the execution reaches\nthe decision points, it uses inputs obtained either interactively or by a\nscript that captures how to deal with partial elements. We created an execution\nengine called PMExec for the execution of partial models of UML-RT (i.e., a\nmodeling language for the development of soft real-time systems) that embodies\nour proposed framework. We evaluated PMExec based on several use-cases that\nshow that the static analysis, refinement, and application of user input can be\ncarried out with reasonable performance and that the overhead of approach,\nwhich is mostly due to the refinement and the increase in model complexity it\ncauses, is manageable.

The resulting precision is much greater than that possible\nwith either the macroscopic classical or microscopic quantum states alone. In\nthe context of quantifying non-classicality, the amount by which a\nnon-classical state can enhance precision in this way has been termed its\n\"metrological power\". Given the technological difficulty of producing\nhigh-amplitude non-classical states of light, this use of non-classical light\nis likely to provide a technological advantage much sooner than the Heisenberg\nscaling employing much stronger non-classical states. To date, the enhancement\nprovided by weak nonclassical states has been calculated only for specific\nmeasurement configurations.

Transaction requests in these networks may\nbe declined because of unavailability of funds due to temporary uneven\ndistribution of the channel balances. In this paper, we investigate how to\nalleviate unnecessary payment blockage via proper prioritization of the\ntransaction execution order. Specifically, we consider the scheduling problem\nin PCNs: as transactions continuously arrive on both sides of a channel, nodes\nneed to decide which ones to process and when in order to maximize their\nobjective, which in our case is the channel throughput. We introduce a\nstochastic model to capture the dynamics of a payment channel under random\narrivals, and propose that channels can hold incoming transactions in buffers\nup to some deadline in order to enable more elaborate processing decisions. We\ndescribe a policy that maximizes the channel success rate/throughput for\nuniform transaction requests of fixed amounts, both in the presence and absence\nof buffering capabilities, and formally prove its optimality. We also develop a\ndiscrete event simulator of a payment channel, and evaluate different heuristic\nscheduling policies in the more general heterogeneous amounts case, with the\nresults showing superiority of the heuristic extension of our policy in this\ncase as well. Our work opens the way for more formal research on improving PCN\nperformance via joint consideration of routing and scheduling decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 16:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

OxDNA captures the salt concentration effect on small\ndsDNA mechanics. But it is found to be ineffective to reproduce the\nsalt-dependent mechanical properties of DNTs. Also, unlike Martini, the time\nevolved PX DNA and DNT structures from the oxDNA models are comparable to the\nall-atom MD simulated structures.

In the case of a half-space coated with a\n{\\it single} layer, it is known that when the shear modulus $\\mu_f$ of the\nlayer is larger than the shear modulus $\\mu_s$ of the half-space, a linear\nanalysis predicts the existence of a critical stretch and wave number, whereas\na weakly nonlinear analysis predicts the existence of a threshold value of the\nmodulus ratio $\\mu_s/\\mu_f\\approx 0.57$ below which the buckling is\nsuper-critical and above which the buckling is sub-critical. It is shown in\nthis paper that when another layer is added, a larger variety of behaviour can\nbe observed. For instance, buckling can occur at a preferred wavenumber\nsuper-critically even if both layers are softer than the half-space although\nthe top layer would need to be harder than the bottom layer. When the shear\nmodulus of the bottom layer lies in a certain interval, the super-critical to\nsub-critical transition can happen a number of times as the shear modulus of\nthe top layer is increased gradually. Thus, an extra layer imparts more\nflexibility in producing wrinkling patterns with desired properties, and our\nweakly nonlinear analysis provides a road map on the parameter regimes where\nthis can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

This paper attempts to address the problem of drones detection\nfrom other flying drones. The erratic movement of the source and target drones,\nsmall size, arbitrary shape, large intensity variations, and occlusion make\nthis problem quite challenging. In this scenario, region-proposal based methods\nare not able to capture sufficient discriminative foreground-background\ninformation. Also, due to the extremely small size and complex motion of the\nsource and target drones, feature aggregation based methods are unable to\nperform well. To handle this, instead of using region-proposal based methods,\nwe propose to use a two-stage segmentation-based approach employing\nspatio-temporal attention cues. During the first stage, given the overlapping\nframe regions, detailed contextual information is captured over convolution\nfeature maps using pyramid pooling. After that pixel and channel-wise attention\nis enforced on the feature maps to ensure accurate drone localization. In the\nsecond stage, first stage detections are verified and new probable drone\nlocations are explored. To discover new drone locations, motion boundaries are\nused. This is followed by tracking candidate drone detections for a few frames,\ncuboid formation, extraction of the 3D convolution feature map, and drones\ndetection within each cuboid. The proposed approach is evaluated on two\npublicly available drone detection datasets and outperforms several competitive\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 18:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

The nature of\nthe information paradox and its resolution in our Dirichlet problem have a\nnatural understanding in terms of the strength of gravity on the two branes and\nat the anchoring location. By sliding the anchor to the defect, we demonstrate\nthat the limit where gravity decouples from the anchor is continuous -- in\nother words, as far as island physics is considered, weak gravity on the anchor\nis identical to no gravity. The weak and (moderately) strong gravity regions on\nthe brane are separated by a \"Dirichlet wall\".

To address this, a sequential strategy is\nusually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a\nsmall radius suffices. However, such sequential approaches, instantiated by\neither a pyramid structure over a deep neural network's feature hierarchy or by\na recurrent neural network, are slow due to the inherent need for sequential\nprocessing of cost volumes. In this paper, we propose dilated cost volumes to\ncapture small and large displacements simultaneously, allowing optical flow\nestimation without the need for the sequential estimation strategy. To process\nthe cost volume to get pixel-wise optical flow, existing approaches employ 2D\nor separable 4D convolutions, which we show either suffer from high GPU memory\nconsumption, inferior accuracy, or large model size. Therefore, we propose\nusing 3D convolutions for cost volume filtering to address these issues. By\ncombining the dilated cost volumes and 3D convolutions, our proposed model\nDCVNet not only exhibits real-time inference (71 fps on a mid-end 1080ti GPU)\nbut is also compact and obtains comparable accuracy to existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

For this purpose, we present an online gaussian mixture-based\nclustering method (OGMC). The key idea of this method is the proposal that an\nidentity can be represented by more than just one distribution or cluster.\nUsing feature vectors (f-vectors) extracted from the incoming faces, OGMC\ngenerates clusters that may be connected to others depending on their proximity\nand their robustness. Every time a cluster is updated with a new sample, its\nconnections are also updated. With this approach, we reduce the dependency of\nthe clustering process on the order and the size of the incoming data and we\nare able to deal with complex data distributions.

The\nnewly identified candidates (44) in addition to the spectroscopically confirmed\nUCDs (61), increases the number of known Fornax UCD considerably (105). Almost\nall of the new UCD candidates are located outside the Fornax cluster core (360\nkpc), where all of the known UCDs were found. The distribution of UCDs within\nthe Fornax cluster shows that a population of UCDs may form in low-density\nenvironments.

Translating Fornax's proper motion into a\nGalactocentric velocity is thus sensitively dependent on Fornax's assumed\ndistance: the observed distance uncertainty, $\\pm 8\\%$, implies pericentric\ndistances that vary between $r_{\\rm peri}\\sim 50$ and $r_{\\rm peri}\\sim 150$\nkpc.

The\nuse of multiple narrow-band S-PLUS filters enables SPHINX to achieve\nsubstantially lower levels of \"catastrophic failures\" (large offsets in\nmetallicity estimates relative to spectroscopic determinations) than previous\nefforts using a single metallicity-sensitive narrow-band filter. We constrain\nthe exponential slope of the Milky Way's K-dwarf halo metallicity distribution\nfunction (MDF), $\\lambda_{10, \\textrm{[Fe/H]}} = 0.85 \\pm 0.21$, over the\nmetallicity range $-2.5 < \\textrm{[Fe/H]} < -1.0$; the MDF of our local-volume\nK-dwarf sample is well-represented by a gamma distribution with parameters\n$\\alpha=2.8$ and $\\beta=4.2$. S-PLUS photometry obtains absolute carbon\nabundances with a precision of $\\sim 0.35$dex for stars with $T_{\\rm eff} <\n6500$K. We identify 364 candidate carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, obtain\nassignments of these stars into the Yoon-Beers morphological groups in the\n$A$(C)-[Fe/H] space, and derive the CEMP frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Besides their benefits, the DNNs\nhave the following three major drawbacks among the others: (i) Researchers have\nstruggled with over-fitting and under-fitting issues in the training of DNNs,\n(ii) determination of even a coarse structure for the DNN may take days, and\n(iii) most of the time, the proposed network structure is too large to be too\nbulky to be used in real time applications.

An appealing\napproach to effectively decouple the problem is to judiciously order the events\nsuch that decisions can be made over sequences of tasks. As many problems\nencountered in practice are over-constrained, we must instead find relaxed\nsolutions in which certain requirements are dropped. This motivates a\nformulation of optimality with respect to the costs of relaxing constraints and\nthe problem of finding an optimal ordering under which this relaxing cost is\nminimum. In this paper, we present Generalized Conflict-directed Ordering\n(GCDO), a branch-and-bound ordering method that generates an optimal total\norder of events by leveraging the generalized conflicts of both inconsistency\nand suboptimality from sub-solvers for cost estimation and solution space\npruning. Due to its ability to reason over generalized conflicts, GCDO is much\nmore efficient in finding high-quality total orders than the previous\nconflict-directed approach CDITO. We demonstrate this by benchmarking on\ntemporal network configuration problems, which involves managing networks over\ntime and makes necessary tradeoffs between network flows against CDITO and\nMixed Integer-Linear Programing (MILP). Our algorithm is able to solve two\norders of magnitude more benchmark problems to optimality and twice the\nproblems compared to CDITO and MILP within a runtime limit, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 18:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

For the pure gravity case, the associated hierarchy\ncorresponds to the Gardner hierarchy, also known as the \"mixed KdV-mKdV\" one,\nwhile for the case of higher spin gravity, they are identified with the\n\"modified Gelfand-Dickey\" hierarchies. The complete integrable structure of the\nhierarchies, i.e., the phase space, the Poisson brackets and the infinite\nnumber of commuting conserved charges, are directly obtained from the\nasymptotic structure and the conserved surface integrals in the gravitational\ntheories. Consequently, the corresponding Miura transformation is recovered\nfrom a purely geometric construction in the bulk. Black hole solutions that fit\nwithin our boundary conditions, the Hamiltonian reduction at the boundary and\nmore general thermodynamic ensembles called \"Generalized Gibbs Ensemble\" are\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 19:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

This is clear because\nthe conditions on allowed operations are time asymmetric. It is odd, though,\nbecause Schoedinger's equation is time symmetric and probability theory does\nnot care about time direction. In this work we provide a time symmetric\nframework for operational theories in general and for Quantum Theory in\nparticular.\n  The clearest expression of the time asymmetry of standard Operational Quantum\nTheory is that the deterministic effect is unique - meaning there is only one\nway to ignore the future - while deterministic (i.e normalised) states are not\nunique. In this paper, this time asymmetry is traced back to a time asymmetric\nunderstanding of the most basic elements of an operational theory - namely the\noperations (or boxes) out of which circuits are built. We modify this allowing\noperations to have classical incomes as well as classical outcomes on these\noperations. We establish a time symmetric operational framework for circuits\nbuilt out of operations. In particular, we demand that the probability\nassociated with a circuit is the same whether we calculate it forwards in time\nor backwards in time. We do this by imposing various double properties. These\nare properties wherein a forward in time and a backward in time version of the\nsame property are required.

The use of multiple\nAI-powered RISs allows changing the propagation direction of the signals\ntransmitted from a mmW access point (AP) thereby improving coverage\nparticularly for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. However, due to the\npossibility of highly stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an\nintelligent controller to jointly optimize the mmW AP beam and RIS phase shifts\nis a daunting task. In this regard, first, a parametric risk-sensitive episodic\nreturn is proposed to maximize the expected bit rate and mitigate the risk of\nmmW link blockage. Then, a closed-form approximation of the policy gradient of\nthe risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. Next, the problem\nof joint beamforming for mmW AP and phase shift control for mmW RISs is modeled\nas an identical payoff stochastic game within a cooperative multi-agent\nenvironment, in which the agents are the mmW AP and the RISs. Two centralized\nand distributed controllers are proposed to control the policies of the mmW AP\nand RISs. To directly find an optimal solution, the parametric functional-form\npolicies for these controllers are modeled using deep recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs). Simulation results show that the error between policies of the optimal\nand the RNN-based controllers is less than 1.5%. Moreover, the variance of the\nachievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based controllers is 60% less than\nthe variance of the risk-averse baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 19:15:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 13:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

But when humans are working with multiple robots or the robot is\nperforming an intricate task often the human must make several corrections to\nfix the robot's behavior. Prior research assumes each of these physical\ncorrections are independent events, and learns from them one-at-a-time.\nHowever, this misses out on crucial information: each of these interactions are\ninterconnected, and may only make sense if viewed together. Alternatively,\nother work reasons over the final trajectory produced by all of the human's\ncorrections. But this method must wait until the end of the task to learn from\ncorrections, as opposed to inferring from the corrections in an online fashion.\nIn this paper we formalize an approach for learning from sequences of physical\ncorrections during the current task.

In this paper, we present\nthe overall architecture of the real-time data infrastructure and identify\nthree scaling challenges that we need to continuously address for each\ncomponent in the architecture. At Uber, we heavily rely on open source\ntechnologies for the key areas of the infrastructure. On top of those\nopen-source software, we add significant improvements and customizations to\nmake the open-source solutions fit in Uber's environment and bridge the gaps to\nmeet Uber's unique scale and requirements. We then highlight several important\nuse cases and show their real-time solutions and tradeoffs. Finally, we reflect\non the lessons we learned as we built, operated and scaled these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 20:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

Practically, a DTR is a sequence of decision\nrules that specify, for each of several points in time, how available\ninformation about the individual's status and progress should be used in\npractice to decide which treatment (e.g., type or intensity) to deliver.

While previous RL and approximate MPC\nmethods must be specifically trained for each building, our key improvement is\nthat our controller can generalize to many buildings, electricity rates, and\nthermostat setpoint schedules without additional, effort-intensive retraining.\nTo provide this versatility, we have adapted the traditional Behavioral Cloning\napproach through (1) a constraint-informed parameter grouping (CIPG) method\nthat provides a more efficient representation of the training data; (2) an\nMPC-Guided training data generation method using the DAgger algorithm that\nimproves stability and constraint satisfaction; and (3) a new deep learning\nmodel-structure called reverse-time recurrent neural networks (RT-RNN) that\nallows future information to flow backward in time to more effectively\ninterpret the temporal information in disturbance predictions.

The study of plasmonic catalyst materials has traditionally\nfocused on late transition metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu. In recent years,\nthere has been increasing interest in the plasmonic properties of a set of\nearth-abundant elements such as Mg, which exhibit interesting hydrogenation\nchemistry with potential applications in hydrogen storage. This work explores\nthe optical, electronic, and catalytic properties of a set of metallic Mg\nnanoclusters with up to 2057 atoms using time-dependent density functional\ntight-binding and density functional theory calculations. Our results show that\nMg nanoclusters are able to produce highly energetic hot electrons with\nenergies of up to 4 eV. By electronic structure analysis, we find that these\nhot electrons energetically align with electronic states of physisorbed\nmolecular hydrogen, occupation of which by hot electrons can promote the\nhydrogen dissociation reaction. We also find that the reverse reaction,\nhydrogen evolution on metallic Mg, can potentially be promoted by hot\nelectrons, but following a different mechanism. Thus, from a theoretical\nperspective, Mg nanoclusters display very promising behaviour for their use in\nlight promoted storage and release of hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 22:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

Selective Regression Testing (SRT) is a technique\nthat executes only a subset of tests the regression test suite can detect\nsoftware failures more efficiently. Previous SRT studies mainly focused on\nstandard desktop applications. Node.js applications are considered hard to\nperform test reduction because of Node's asynchronous, event-driven programming\nmodel and because JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. In this paper,\nwe present NodeSRT, a Selective Regression Testing framework for Node.js\napplications. By performing static and dynamic analysis, NodeSRT identifies the\nrelationship between changed methods and tests, then reduces the regression\ntest suite to only tests that are affected by the change to improve the\nexecution time of the regression test suite. To evaluate our selection\ntechnique, we applied NodeSRT to two open-source projects: Uppy and Simorgh,\nthen compared our approach with the retest-all strategy and current\nindustry-standard SRT technique: Jest OnlyChange. The results demonstrate that\nNodeSRT correctly selects affected tests based on changes and is 250% faster,\n450% more precise than the Jest OnlyChange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 22:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

Method: MyoMapNet utilizes a simple\nfully-connected NN to estimate T1 values from 5 (native) or 4 (post-contrast)\nT1-weighted images. Native MOLLI-5(3)3 T1 was collected in 717 subjects (386\nmales, 55$\\pm$16.5 years) and post-contrast MOLLI-4(1)3(1)2 in 535 subjects\n(232 male, 56.5$\\pm$15 years). The dataset was divided into training (80%) and\ntesting (20%), where 20% of the training set was used to optimize MyoMapNet\narchitecture (size and loss functions). We used MyoMapNet to estimate T1 and\nECV maps with the first 5 (native) or 4 (post-contrast) T1-weighted images from\nthe corresponding MOLLI sequence compared to the conventional and an\nabbreviated MOLLI using similar number of T1-weighted images with 3-parameter\ncurve-fitting. Results: In our preliminary optimizaiton step, we determined\nthat a 5-layers NN trained using mean-absolute-error loss yields lower\nestimation errors and was used subsequently in independent testing study. The\nmyocardial T1 by MyoMapNet was similar to MOLLI (1200$\\pm$45ms vs.\n1199$\\pm$46ms; P=0.3 for native T1, and 27.3$\\pm$3.5% vs. 27.1$\\pm$4%; P=0.4\nfor ECV). MyoMapNet had significantly smaller errors in T1 estimations compared\nto abbreviated-MOLLI (1$\\pm$17ms vs. 31$\\pm$34ms, P<0.01 for in native T1, and\n0.1$\\pm$1.3% vs. 1.9$\\pm$2.5%, P<0.01 for ECV). The duration of T1 estimation\nwas approximately 2 ms per slice using MyoMapNet.

For instance, the extraction of attributes from images allows an\neCommerce search engine to produce retrieval results with higher precision. The\ntraditional manner to build an attribute extractor is by training a\nconvnet-based classifier with a fixed number of classes. However, this approach\ndoes not scale for real applications where the number of attributes changes\nfrequently. Therefore in this work, we propose an approach for extracting\nvisual attributes from images, leveraging the learned capability of the hidden\nlayers of a general convolutional network to discriminate among different\nvisual features.

This\nhas led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias.\nHowever, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study\nprotocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test\nmany forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned\nspecifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved\nevaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to\nask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate\nseven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and\nhyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets.

We use Biased MNIST and a visual question answering\n(VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning\nto the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning\ndistributions, which is critical because for many applications the test\ndistribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms\nexploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are\nhighly sensitive to the choice of tuning set.

This study proposes an\nend-to-end learning-based approximate method for subgraph matching task, called\nsubgraph matching network (Sub-GMN). The proposed Sub-GMN firstly uses graph\nrepresentation learning to map nodes to node-level embedding. It then combines\nmetric learning and attention mechanisms to model the relationship between\nmatched nodes in the data graph and query graph. To test the performance of the\nproposed method, we applied our method on two databases. We used two existing\nmethods, GNN and FGNN as baseline for comparison.

On average running time Sub-GMN runs 20-40\ntimes faster than FGNN. In addition, the average F1-score of Sub-GMN on all\nexperiments with dataset 2 reached 0.95, which demonstrates that Sub-GMN\noutputs more correct node-to-node matches.\n  Comparing with the previous GNNs-based methods for subgraph matching task,\nour proposed Sub-GMN allows varying query and data graphes in the\ntest/application stage, while most previous GNNs-based methods can only find a\nmatched subgraph in the data graph during the test/application for the same\nquery graph used in the training stage.

Full-duplex technology can further enhance\nthe advantages of mmWave massive MIMO systems. However, strong\nself-interference (SI) is the major limiting factor in full-duplex technology.\nHence, this paper proposes a novel angular-based joint hybrid\nprecoding/combining (AB-JHPC) technique for the full-duplex mmWave massive-MIMO\nsystems. Our primary goals are listed as: (i) improving the self-interference\ncancellation (SIC), (ii) increasing the intended signal power, (iii) decreasing\nthe channel estimation overhead, (iv) designing the massive MIMO systems with a\nlow number of RF chains. First, the RF-stage of AB-JHPC is developed via slow\ntime-varying angle-of-departure (AoD) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. A\njoint transmit/receive RF beamformer design is proposed for covering\n(excluding) the AoD/AoA support of intended (SI) channel. Second, the BB-stage\nof AB-JHPC is constructed via the reduced-size effective intended channel.\nAfter using the well-known singular value decomposition(SVD) approach at the\nBB-stage, we also propose a new semi-blind minimum mean square error (S-MMSE)\ntechnique to further suppress the residual SI power by using AoD/AoA\nparameters. The numerical results demonstrate that the SI signal is remarkably\ncanceled via the proposed AB-JHPC technique. It is shown that AB-JHPC achieves\n85.7 dB SIC and the total amount of SIC almost linearly increases via antenna\nisolation techniques. We observe that the proposed full-duplex mmWave massive\nMIMO systems double the achievable rate capacity compared to its half-duplex\ncounterpart as the antenna array size increases and the transmit/receive\nantenna isolation improves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 01:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

In practice, due to processing and feedback delays,\nestimated CSI can be outdated, which can severely deteriorate the performance\nof the communication system. Besides, to feedback estimated CSI, a strong\ncompression of the CSI, evaluated at the user equipment (UE), is performed to\nreduce the over-the-air (OTA) overhead. Such compression strongly reduces the\nprecision of the estimated CSI, which ultimately impacts the performance of\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding. Motivated by such issues, we\npresent a novel scalable idea of reporting CSI in wireless networks, which is\napplicable to both time-division duplex (TDD) and frequency-division duplex\n(FDD) systems. In particular, the novel approach introduces the use of a\nchannel predictor function, e.g., Kalman filter (KF), at both ends of the\ncommunication system to predict CSI. Simulation-based results demonstrate that\nthe novel approach reduces not only the channel mean-squared-error (MSE) but\nalso the OTA overhead to feedback the estimated CSI when there is immense\nvariation in the mobile radio channel. Besides, in the immobile radio channel,\nfeedback can be eliminated, which brings the benefit of further reducing the\nOTA overhead.

Although RL algorithms are guaranteed to converge\nto optimal policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs), this only holds in the\npresence of static environments. However, this assumption is very restrictive.\nIn many real-world problems like ride-sharing, traffic control, etc., we are\ndealing with highly dynamic environments, where RL methods yield only\nsub-optimal decisions. To mitigate this problem in highly dynamic environments,\nwe (1) adopt an online Dirichlet change point detection (ODCP) algorithm to\ndetect the changes in the distribution of experiences, (2) develop a Deep Q\nNetwork (DQN) agent that is capable of recognizing diurnal patterns and making\ninformed dispatching decisions according to the changes in the underlying\nenvironment.

However, to actively control the SPP interference\nwithin subcycle in time (usually less than several femtoseconds in the visible\nrange) is still missing, which hinders the ultimate manipulation of SPP\ninterference on ultrafast time scale. In this paper, the interference between\nSPPs launched by a hole dimer, which was excited by a grazing incident free\nelectron beam without direct contact, was manipulated through both propagation\nand initial phase difference control. Particularly, using cathodoluminescence\nspectroscopy, the appearance of higher-order interference orders was obtained\nthrough propagation phase control by increasing separation distances of the\ndimer.

We explore the effectiveness of some\nrepresentative detectors utilized as the second-phase detector in two-phase\nWSOD and propose a two-phase WSOD architecture. In addition, we present a\nstrategy to establish the pseudo ground truth (PGT) used to train the\nsecond-phase detector. Unlike previous works that regard top one bounding boxes\nas PGT, we consider more bounding boxes to establish the PGT annotations. This\nalleviates the insufficient learning problem caused by the low recall of PGT.\nWe also propose some strategies to refine the PGT during the training of the\nsecond detector. Our strategies suspend the training in specific epoch, then\nrefine the PGT by the outputs of the second-phase detector. After that, the\nalgorithm continues the training with the same gradients and weights as those\nbefore suspending. Elaborate experiments are conduceted on the PASCAL VOC 2007\ndataset to verify the effectiveness of our methods. As results demonstrate, our\ntwo-phase architecture improves the mAP from 49.17% to 53.21% compared with the\nsingle PCL model. Additionally, the best PGT generation strategy obtains a 0.7%\nmAP increment. Our best refinement strategy boosts the performance by 1.74%\nmAP.

While UDA focuses on the target domain, we\nargue that the performance on both source and target domains matters, as in\npractice which domain a test example comes from is unknown. In this paper we\nextend UDA by proposing a new task called unsupervised domain expansion (UDE),\nwhich aims to adapt a deep model for the target domain with its unlabeled data,\nmeanwhile maintaining the model's performance on the source domain.

However, most motion information in existing videos are\ndifficult to label and training a model with good motion representations with\nsupervision will thus require a large amount of human labour for annotation.

We propose a novel prediction\nmodel, referred to as the lane-aware prediction (LaPred) network, which uses\nthe instance-level lane entities extracted from a semantic map to predict the\nmulti-modal future trajectories. For each lane candidate found in the\nneighborhood of the target agent, LaPred extracts the joint features relating\nthe lane and the trajectories of the neighboring agents. Then, the features for\nall lane candidates are fused with the attention weights learned through a\nself-supervised learning task that identifies the lane candidate likely to be\nfollowed by the target agent. Using the instance-level lane information, LaPred\ncan produce the trajectories compliant with the surroundings better than 2D\nraster image-based methods and generate the diverse future trajectories given\nmultiple lane candidates. The experiments conducted on the public nuScenes\ndataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaPred method\nsignificantly outperforms the existing prediction models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 04:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

However, most if not all of these methods tend to apply a\nsingle filter that is homogeneous over the entire image. This is also\nparticularly true when an encoder-decoder type deep architecture is trained for\nthe task. However, it is natural to view a camera image as heterogeneous, as\nthe color intensity and the artificial noise are distributed vastly different,\neven across the two dimensional domain of a single image. Varied Moire ringing,\nmotion-blur, color-bleaching or lens based projection distortions can all\npotentially lead to a heterogeneous image artifact filtering problem. In this\npaper, we present a specific patch-based, local subspace deep neural network\nthat improves Camera ISP to be robust to heterogeneous artifacts (especially\nimage denoising). We call our three-fold deep trained model the Patch Subspace\nLearning Autoencoder (PSL-AE).

Specifically, when the\ntemperature increases, the magnonic energy gap at Dirac points closes and\nreopens at a critical temperature, $T_c$. By showing that the Chern numbers of\nthe magnonic bands are distinct above and below $T_c$, we confirm that the\ngap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase\ntransitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall\nconductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at $T_c$, which\ncan serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature. Our theory\npredicts that in $\\rm{CrI_3}$ such a phenomenon exists and is experimentally\naccessible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 05:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 03:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

The\nstudy of flow in micro-scale networks focuses on low Reynolds numbers where\nsmall volumes of fluids move at slow speeds. The flow physics at these scales\nis governed by the Stokes equation, which is linear. This linearity property\nallows for relatively simple theoretical and computational solutions that\ngreatly aid in the understanding, modeling and designing of micro-scale\nnetworks.\n  At larger scales and faster flow rates, macrofluidic networks are also\nimportant but the flow physics is quite different.

Are risk\nanalysts better decision makers than CISOs? Do security experts exhibit more\neffective strategies than board members? This paper explores the effect that\ndifferent experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's\ncyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied\nbackgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill\nsets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in\nthe wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how\nchoices are affected by player background (e.g.,~cyber security experts versus\nrisk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and\ndifferent team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various\nmixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game\ndecisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully\ncomprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 06:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

We define a family of catalytic entropies that\nquantifies catalytically extractable entropy within a quantum state and show\nhow much degeneracy of quantum state can boost the catalytic entropy beyond its\nordinary entropy. Based on this, we demonstrate that a randomness source can be\nactually exhausted after a certain amount of randomness is extracted. We apply\nthis theory to systems under conservation law that forbids superposition of\ncertain quantum states and find that non-maximally mixed states can yield the\nmaximal catalytic entropy. We discuss implications of this theory to various\ntopics including catalytic randomness absorption, the no-secret theorem and the\npossibility of multi-party infinite catalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 07:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

While most of early methods are focused on unsupervised DA\n(UDA), several studies on semi-supervised DA (SSDA) are recently suggested. In\nSSDA, a small number of labeled target images are given for training, and the\neffectiveness of those data is demonstrated by the previous studies. However,\nthe previous SSDA approaches solely adopt those data for embedding ordinary\nsupervised losses, overlooking the potential usefulness of the few yet\ninformative clues.

The choice to deploy raw\naudio and mel-spectrograms enabled us to better represent how humans perceive\nmusic, and to potentially draw sounds for new arrangements from the vast\ncollection of music recordings accumulated in the last century. In absence of\nan objective way of evaluating the output of both generative adversarial\nnetworks and music generative systems, we further defined a possible metric for\nthe proposed task, partially based on human (and expert) judgement. Finally, as\na comparison, we replicated our results with Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image\ntranslation network, and we showed that our approach outperforms it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 09:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 10:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

This work explores relationship-aware complex-scene image\ngeneration, where multiple objects are inter-related as a scene graph.

One is to predict new positions in\nan incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the\nother is to enhance data association by generating more discriminative identity\nembeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but\nhandled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position\nprediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by\ntemporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as\nidentity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules\ncan make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors,\ntherefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for\nassociation. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost\nidentity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention\nmodules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position\nprediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong\nrobustness to occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nour proposed model over a wide range of existing methods on MOTChallenge\nbenchmarks.

A tradeoff between harvesting energy and keeping\nthe user's natural movements should be balanced via optimization techniques. In\nprevious studies, the hardware itself has been specialized in advance for a\nsingle task like walking with constant speed on a flat. A key ingredient is\nContinuous Variable Transmission (CVT) to extend it applicable for multiple\ntasks. CVT could continuously adjust its gear ratio to balance the tradeoff for\neach task; however, such gear-ratio optimization problem remains open yet since\nits optimal solution may depend on the user, motion, and environment.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on a framework for data-driven optimization of a\ngear ratio in a CVT-equipped biomechanical energy harvester. Since the data\ncollection requires a heavy burden on the user, we have to optimize the gear\nratio for each task in the shortest possible time. To this end, our framework\nis designed sample-efficiently based on the fact that the user encounters\nmultiple tasks, which are with similarities with each other. Specifically, our\nframework employs multi-task Bayesian optimization to reuse the optimization\nresults of the similar tasks previously optimized by finding their\nsimilarities. Through experiments, we confirmed that, for each task, the\nproposed framework could achieve the optimal gear ratio of around 50~\\% faster\nthan one by random search, and that takes only around 20~minutes. Experimental\nresults also suggested that the optimization can be accelerated by actively\nexploiting similarities with previously optimized tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 10:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Due to the necessity of correct state\nobservation in such a FB controller, it is sensitive to sensing failures. To\nalleviate this drawback of the FB controllers, feedback error learning\nintegrates one of them with a feedforward (FF) controller. RL can be improved\nby dealing with the FB/FF policies, but to the best of our knowledge, a\nmethodology for learning them in a unified manner has not been developed.

Aims: In this study, we aim to holistically chart the\ndecision-making that happens on all dimensions of a migration project towards\nmicroservices (including, but not limited to, the technical dimension). Method:\nWe investigate 16 different migration cases in a grounded theory interview\nstudy, with 19 participants that recently migrated towards microservices. This\nstudy strongly focuses on the human aspects of a migration, through\nstakeholders and their decisions. Results: We identify 3 decision-making\nprocesses consisting of 22decision-points and their alternative options.

The original\ngeomagnetic field series were obtained at the Coimbra Magnetic Observatory\n(COI, Portugal) in 01.01.2007-31.12.2017. The data were analyzed separately for\neach of 12 months. The geomagnetic field components X, Y and Z were analyzed\nindependently. The Sq and SD variations obtained with QD were compared with the\nprincipal components from PCA (PCs, daily variation of the geomagnetic field of\ndifferent types) using the correlation analysis. In this study only the PCA\nability to extract daily variations similar to ones acquired using the standard\napproach with QD was analyzed. The results for X, and Y and Z are essentially\ndifferent. The Sq variation is always filtered to the 1st PCA mode for Y and Z,\nwhereas the SD variation is filtered either to the 2nd or 3rd mode. For X the\nSq variation tends to be filtered to the 2nd mode, while the SD variation is\nmore often filtered to the 1st mode. The number of the PCs classified either as\nSq or SD follows seasonal and decadal variations of the geomagnetic activity.\nThe analysis showed that PCA can automatically extract the Sq variation from\nthe observations of Y and Z; however complementary analysis (for example, a\ncomparison to a reference curve) is needed to identify a PC corresponding to\nthe SD variation. For X component, the automatic extraction of the Sq or SD\nvariations is not possible, and the complementary analysis is always needed.\nThe dataset used in this paper is described in detail in a companion paper by\nMorozova et al.

In this work, we propose a recursive block diagonalization algorithm\nfor computing bivariate functions of matrices of small to medium size, for\nwhich dense liner algebra is appropriate. The algorithm combines a blocking\nstrategy, as in the Schur-Parlett scheme, and an evaluation procedure for the\ndiagonal blocks. We discuss two implementations of the latter.

After works of\nCoron-Ghidaglia, Ding and Chen-Ding, one knows blow-up solutions under\nsmallness of initial energy for m>=3. soon later, 2 dimensional blowup\nsolutions were found by Chang-Ding-Ye. The first part of this paper is devoted\nto construction of new examples of finite time blow-up solutions without\nsmallness conditions for 3<=m<7. In fact, when considering rotational symmetric\nharmonic heat flow from B_1\\subset R^m to S^m\\subset R^{m+1}, we will prove\nthat the maximal solution blows up in finite time if b>\\vartheta_m, and exists\nfor all time if 0<b<\\pi/2. This result can be regarded as a generalization of\nresults of Chang-Ding-Ye nad Chang-Ding to higher dimensional case, which\nrelies on a completely different argument. The second part of the paper study\nthe rate of blow-up solutions. When M is a bounded domain in R^2 and consider\nDirichlet boundary condition on \\partial M, Hamilton has obtained that the\nblowup rate must be faster than (T-t)^{-1}. Under a similar setting, it was\nlater improved a litttle by Topping to (T-t)^{-1}|log(T-t)|.

Some of these features\nare mostly local and useful for the organisation of e.g. argument structure of\na predication; others are persistent over the course of a discourse and\nnecessary for achieving a reasonable level of understanding of the content.\nThis paper describes a model for high-dimensional representation for utterance\nand text level data including features such as constructions or contextual\ndata, based on a mathematically principled and behaviourally plausible approach\nto representing linguistic information. The implementation of the\nrepresentation is a straightforward extension of Random Indexing models\npreviously used for lexical linguistic items. The paper shows how the\nimplemented model is able to represent a broad range of linguistic features in\na common integral framework of fixed dimensionality, which is computationally\nhabitable, and which is suitable as a bridge between symbolic representations\nsuch as dependency analysis and continuous representations used e.g. in\nclassifiers or further machine-learning approaches. This is achieved with\noperations on vectors that constitute a powerful computational algebra,\naccompanied with an associative memory for the vectors. The paper provides a\ntechnical overview of the framework and a worked through implemented example of\nhow it can be applied to various types of linguistic features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 12:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

Effects of CP-phases require the simultaneous presence of two\ndifferent flavor-changing neutral current NSI parameters.

In a long series of\nspectroscopic monitoring of the star in 2013-2020, we detected variations in\nH-alpha and NaI D absorptions at radial velocities of infall (accretion) and\noutflow (wind) with a period of about 22 days.

Conventionally,\nthe search for cathode materials relies on experimental trial-and-error and a\ntraversing of existing computational/experimental databases. While these\nmethods have led to the discovery of several commercially-viable cathode\nmaterials, the chemical space explored so far is limited and many phases will\nhave been overlooked, in particular those that are metastable. We describe a\ncomputational framework for battery cathode exploration, based on ab initio\nrandom structure searching (AIRSS), an approach that samples local minima on\nthe potential energy surface to identify new crystal structures. We show that,\nby delimiting the search space using a number of constraints, including\nchemically aware minimum interatomic separations, cell volumes, and space group\nsymmetries, AIRSS can efficiently predict both thermodynamically stable and\nmetastable cathode materials. Specifically, we investigate LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and\nLixCuyFz to demonstrate the efficiency of the method by rediscovering the known\ncrystal structures of these cathode materials. The effect of parameters, such\nas minimum separations and symmetries, on the efficiency of the sampling is\ndiscussed in detail. The adaptation of the minimum interatomic distances, on a\nspecies-pair basis, from low-energy optimized structures to efficiently capture\nthe local coordination environment of atoms, is explored. A family of novel\ncathode materials based, on the transition-metal oxalates,is proposed. They\ndemonstrate superb energy density, oxygen-redox stability, and lithium\ndiffusion properties. This article serves both as an introduction to the\ncomputational framework, and as a guide to battery cathode material discovery\nusing AIRSS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 12:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Using this the bubbles are found to significantly enhance flow\nanisotropy at all scales compared with the unladen case, and for some bubble\ncases, very strong anisotropy persists down to the smallest flow scales. The\nstrongest anisotropy observed was for the cases involving small bubbles.\nConcerning the inter-scale energy transfer, our results indicate that for the\nbubble-laden cases, the energy transfer is from large to small scales, just as\nfor the unladen case. However, there is evidence of an upscale transfer when\nconsidering the transfer of energy associated with particular components of the\nvelocity field.

We find that the\ninteraction energy increases as $\\ln(d)$ for $d\\to 0$ and it decreases as\n$d^{-2}$ when $d\\to \\infty$. The PCF shows oscillatory behavior at all\ndensities considered here. As two parallel wires approach each other, interwire\ncorrelations increase while intrawire correlations decrease as evidenced by the\nbehavior of the PCF, SSF, and MD. The system evolves from two monowires of\ndensity parameter $r_\\text{s}$ to a single monowire of density parameter\n$r_\\text{s}/2$ as $d$ is reduced from infinity to zero. The MD reveals\nTomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid behavior with a power-law nature near\n$k_\\text{F}$ even in the presence of an extra interwire interaction between the\nelectrons in biwire systems. It is observed that when $d$ is reduced the MD\ndecreases for $k<k_\\text{F}$ and increases for $k>k_\\text{F}$, similar to its\nbehavior with increasing $r_\\text{s}$. The TL liquid exponent is extracted by\nfitting the MD data near $k_\\text{F}$, from which the TL liquid interaction\nparameter $K_{\\rho}$ is calculated. The value of the TL parameter is found to\nbe in agreement with that of a single wire for large separation between the two\nwires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 14:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 10:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

To\nvalidate the analytical developments, the non-perturbative analysis is made by\ntaking advantage of Poincar\\'e surfaces of section.

The physical background of the EFB turbulence\nclosures is based on the budget equations for the turbulent kinetic and\npotential energies and turbulent fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, as well as\nthe turbulent flux of particles. The EFB turbulence closure is designed for\nstratified geophysical flows from neutral to very stable stratification and it\nimplies that turbulence is maintained by the velocity shear at any\nstratification. In a steady-state, expressions for the turbulent flux of\npassive scalar and the anisotropic non-symmetric turbulent diffusion tensor are\nderived, and universal flux Richardson number dependencies of the components of\nthis tensor are obtained. The diagonal component in the vertical direction of\nthe turbulent diffusion tensor is suppressed by strong stratification, while\nthe diagonal components in the horizontal directions are not suppressed, and\nthey are dominant in comparison with the other components of turbulent\ndiffusion tensor. This implies that any initially created strongly\ninhomogeneous particle cloud is evolved into a thin pancake in horizontal plane\nwith very slow increase of its thickness in the vertical direction. The\nturbulent Schmidt number increases linearly with the gradient Richardson\nnumber. Considering the applications of these results to the atmospheric\nboundary-layer turbulence, the theoretical relationships are derived which\nallow to determine the turbulent diffusion tensor as a function of the vertical\ncoordinate measured in the units of the local Obukhov length scale. The\nobtained relations are potentially useful in modelling applications of particle\ndispersion in the atmospheric boundary-layer turbulence and free atmosphere\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 14:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 15:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Some recent modeling studies have proposed that\ncondensation of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the winter pole is a contributing\nfactor to maintaining the annulus through the release of latent heat. Dust and\ntopographic forcing are also known to be causes of internal and interannual\nvariability in the polar vortices. However, coupling between these factors\nremains uncertain, and previous studies of their impact on vortex structure and\nvariability have been largely limited to a single Martian global climate model\n(MGCM). Here, by further developing a novel MGCM, we decompose the relative\nroles of latent heat and dust as drivers for the variability and structure of\nthe northern Martian polar vortex. We also consider how Martian topography\nmodifies the driving response. By also analyzing a reanalysis dataset we show\nthat there is significant dependence in the polar vortex structure and\nvariability on the observations assimilated. In both model and reanalysis, high\natmospheric dust loading (such as that seen during a global dust storm) can\ndisrupt the vortex, cause the destruction of PV in the low-mid altitudes (> 0.1\nhPa), and significantly reduce spatial and temporal vortex variability.

In this work we consider shocks originating from\nmagnetized ejecta, extend the energy-conserving hydrodynamical model of Yan et\nal. (2007) to the MHD limit by applying the magnetized jump conditions from\nZhang & Kobayashi (2005). Compared with the non-conservative models, our\nLorentz factor of the whole shocked region is larger by a factor\n$\\lesssim\\sqrt{2}$. The total pressure of the forward shocked region is higher\nthan the reversed shocked region, in the relativistic regime with a factor of\nabout 3 in our interstellar medium (ISM) cases while ejecta magnetization\ndegree $\\sigma<1$, and a factor of about 2.4 in the wind cases. For $\\sigma\\le\n1$, the non-conservative model loses $32-42$% of its total energy for ISM\ncases, and for wind cases $25-38$%, which happens specifically in the forward\nshocked region, making the shock synchrotron emission from the forward shock\nless luminous than expected.

An agrivoltaic system must optimize\nsunlight-sharing between the solar panels and crops to maximize the food-energy\nyields, subject to appropriate constraints. Given the emerging diversity of\nmonofacial and bifacial farms, the lack of a standardized crop-specific metric\n(to evaluate the efficacy of the irradiance sharing) has made it difficult to\noptimize and assess the performance of agrivoltaic systems. Here we introduce a\nnew metric, light productivity factor (LPF), that evaluates the effectiveness\nof irradiance sharing for a given crop type and PV array design. The metric\nallows us to identify optimal design parameters including the spatial PV array\ndensity, panel orientation, and single axis tracking schemes specific to the\nPAR needs of the crop. By definition, LPF equals 1 for PV-only or crop-only\nsystems. The AV systems enhances LPF between 1 and 2 depending on the shade\nsensitivity of the crop, PV array configuration, and the season. While\ntraditional fixed-tilt systems increase LPF significantly above 1, we find LPF\nis maximized at 2 for shade-tolerant crops with a solar farm based on single\naxis sun tracking scheme. Among the fixed tilt systems, East-West faced\nbifacial vertical solar farms is particularly promising because it produces\nsmallest variability in the seasonal yield for shade sensitive crops, while\nproviding LPF comparable to the standard North-South faced solar farms.\nAdditional benefits include reduced soiling and ease of movement of large-scale\ncombine-harvester and other farming equipment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 15:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

In educational contexts,\nthere are differing definitions of plagiarism depending on the institution.\nProminent scholars of plagiarism include Rebecca Moore Howard, Susan Blum,\nTracey Bretag, and Sarah Elaine Eaton, among others. Plagiarism is considered a\nviolation of academic integrity and a breach of journalistic ethics. It is\nsubject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, expulsion from school or\nwork, substantial fines and even incarceration. Recently, cases of \"extreme\nplagiarism\" have been identified in academia. The modern concept of plagiarism\nas immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century,\nparticularly with the Romantic movement. Generally, plagiarism is not in itself\na crime, but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court for\nprejudices caused by copyright infringement, violation of moral rights, or\ntorts. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism\nand copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not\nequivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright\ninfringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by\ncourts. Plagiarism might not be the same in all countries. Some countries, such\nas India and Poland, consider plagiarism to be a crime, and there have been\ncases of people being imprisoned for plagiarizing.

Moreover, we\nexploit a sparse recovery and weighted average of candidates (SR-WAC) based\nmethod to set up an initiation, which can efficiently approach a superior local\noptimal solution. It is shown from the simulation results that the proposed\nmethod has a much higher localization accuracy and outperforms the other\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 02:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}
