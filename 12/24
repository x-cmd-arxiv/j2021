Since the first data acquisition\nin October 2019, more than 35 sessions have been performed for a total of 52\nhours of observations. The detector has been observing Earth at night-time in\nthe UV range and detected a wide variety of transient sources all of which have\nbeen modelled through Monte Carlo simulations. Mini-EUSO is also capable of\ndetecting meteors and potentially space debris and we performed simulations for\nsuch events to estimate their impact on future missions for cosmic ray science\nfrom space. We show here examples of the simulation work done in this framework\nto analyse the Mini-EUSO data. The expected response of Mini-EUSO with respect\nto ultra high energy cosmic ray showers has been studied. The efficiency curve\nof Mini-EUSO as a function of primary energy has been estimated and the energy\nthreshold for Cosmic Rays has been placed to be above 10^{21} eV. We compared\nthe morphology of several transient events detected during the mission with\ncosmic ray simulations and excluded that they can be due to cosmic ray showers.\nTo validate the energy threshold of the detector, a system of ground based\nflashers is being used for end-to-end calibration purposes. We therefore\nimplemented a parameterisation of such flashers into the JEM-EUSO simulation\nframework and studied the response of the detector with respect to such\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The innovations have been\nlargely focused on cancer pathology (i.e., tumor segmentation and\ncharacterization). In non-cancer pathology, the learning algorithms can be\nasked to examine more comprehensive tissue types simultaneously, as a\nmulti-label setting. The prior arts typically needed to train multiple\nsegmentation networks in order to match the domain-specific knowledge for\nheterogeneous tissue types (e.g., glomerular tuft, glomerular unit, proximal\ntubular, distal tubular, peritubular capillaries, and arteries). In this paper,\nwe propose a dynamic single segmentation network (Omni-Seg) that learns to\nsegment multiple tissue types using partially labeled images (i.e., only one\ntissue type is labeled for each training image) for renal pathology. By\nlearning from ~150,000 patch-wise pathological images from six tissue types,\nthe proposed Omni-Seg network achieved superior segmentation accuracy and less\nresource consumption when compared to the previous the multiple-network and\nmulti-head design.

EDC\nenables detecting errors in cache memory while ECC is used to correct erroneous\ncache blocks. ECCs are often costly as they impose considerable area and energy\noverhead on cache memory. Reducing this overhead has been the subject of many\nstudies. In particular, a previous study has suggested mapping ECC to the main\nmemory at the expense of high cache traffic and energy. A major source of this\nexcessive traffic and energy is the high frequency of cache writes. In this\nwork, we show that a significant portion of cache writes are silent, i.e., they\nwrite the same data already existing. We build on this observation and\nintroduce Traffic-aware ECC (or simply TCC). TCC detects silent writes by an\nefficient mechanism. Once such writes are detected updating their ECC is\navoided effectively reducing L2 cache traffic and access frequency. Using our\nsolution, we reduce L2 cache access frequency by 8% while maintaining\nperformance. We reduce L2 cache dynamic and overall cache energy by up to 32%\nand 8%, respectively. Furthermore, TCC reduces L2 cache miss rate by 3%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 16:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Nearly a decade after\nthe first proposals for these hybrid architectures, the real technology has\nfinally reached commercial availability with Intel Optane(TM) DC Persistent\nMemory (DCPMM). This raises the challenge of designing systems that realize\nthis potential in practice, namely through effective approaches that\ndynamically decide at which memory tier should pages be placed. In this paper,\nwe are the first, to our knowledge, to systematically analyze tiered page\nplacement on real DCPMM-based systems.

Our experimental evaluation of HyPlacer shows\nthat it outperforms both solutions proposed in past literature and placement\noptions that are currently available in off-the-shelf DCPMM-equipped Linux\nsystems, reaching an improvement of up to 11x when compared to the default\nmemory policy in Linux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 16:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Unfortunately, arbitrarily\nordering sending and receiving messages to maximise computation-communication\noverlap (a popular optimisation to message-passing applications) opens up a\nPandora's box of further subtle concurrency bugs.\n  To guarantee deadlock-freedom by construction, we present Rumpsteak: a new\nRust framework based on multiparty session types. Previous session type\nimplementations in Rust are either built upon synchronous and blocking\ncommunication and/or limited to two-party interactions. Crucially, none support\nthe arbitrary ordering of messages for efficiency.\n  Rumpsteak instead targets asynchronous async/await code. Its unique ability\nis allowing developers to arbitrarily order send/receive messages while\npreserving deadlock-freedom. For this, Rumpsteak incorporates two recent\nadvanced session type theories: (1) k-multiparty compatibility (kmc), which\nglobally verifies the safety of a set of participants, and (2) asynchronous\nmultiparty session subtyping, which locally verifies optimisations in the\ncontext of a single participant. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm for\nasynchronous subtyping that is both sound and decidable.\n  We first evaluate the performance and expressiveness of Rumpsteak against\nthree previous Rust implementations.

Although the\nnon-paraxial corrections stay small, they are dynamically enhanced during the\ninteraction of the electron with the grating whose length exceeds the Rayleigh\nlength of the packet.\n  To simplify the possible experimental setup where such effects could be\nmeasured, we study the dependence of these effects on the inclination angle,\ni.e. the angle between the mean velocity of the packet and the surface of the\ngrating. There is a minimal angle such that the multipole expansion always\nstays valid at the grating surface. In such a regime, the quadrupole\ncontribution to the Smith-Purcell radiation can become the leading one, which\nrepresents a novel quantum effect impossible for classical point-like\nelectrons.\n  Thus, the impact of the wave-packet shape (vortex structure or non-spherical\nshape) can be observed experimentally by comparing the radiation for different\norientations of the grating in the single-electron regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 16:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

It is found that, in\nthe regime of low drift velocity, the linear stage of the instability in PIC\nsimulations differs significantly from the theoretical predictions, whereas in\nthe Vlasov simulations it does not. A series of highly resolved PIC simulations\nwith increasingly large numbers of macroparticles per cell is performed using a\nnumber of different PIC codes.\n  All the simulations predict highly similar growth rates that are several\ntimes larger than those calculated from the linear theory. As a result, we find\nthat the true convergence of the PIC simulations in the linear regime is\nelusive to achieve in practice and can easily be misidentified.\n  The discrepancy between the theoretical and observed growth rates is\nattributed to the initial noise inherently present in PIC simulations, but not\nin Vlasov simulations, that causes particle trapping even though the fraction\nof trapped particles is low. We show analytically that even weak distortions of\nthe electron velocity distribution function (such as flattening due to particle\ntrapping) result in significant modifications of the growth rates. It is also\nfound that the common quiet-start method for PIC simulations leads to more\naccurate growth rates but only if the maximum growth rate mode is perturbed\ninitially.

The proposed approach, latent time NODE (LT-NODE), treats $T$ as a\nlatent variable and apply Bayesian learning to obtain a posterior distribution\nover $T$ from the data. In particular, we use variational inference to learn an\napproximate posterior and the model parameters. Prediction is done by\nconsidering the NODE representations from different samples of the posterior\nand can be done efficiently using a single forward pass. As $T$ implicitly\ndefines the depth of a NODE, posterior distribution over $T$ would also help in\nmodel selection in NODE. We also propose, adaptive latent time NODE (ALT-NODE),\nwhich allow each data point to have a distinct posterior distribution over\nend-times.

Locally, i.e. in each mesh cell, an averaged normal is reconstructed by\nfitting a plane in a least squares sense to the volume fraction data of\nneighboring cells while implicitly accounting for volume conservation in the\ncell at hand. The resulting minimization problem is solved approximately by\nemploying a Newton-type method. Moreover, applying the Reynolds transport\ntheorem allows to assess the regularity of the derivatives. Since the\ndivergence theorem implies that the volume fraction can be cast as a sum of\nface-based quantities, our method considerably simplifies the numerical\nprocedure for applications in three spatial dimensions while demonstrating an\ninherent ability to robustly deal with unstructured meshes. We discuss the\ntheoretical foundations, regularity and appropriate error measures, along with\nthe details of the numerical algorithm. Finally, numerical results for convex\nand non-convex hypersurfaces embedded in cuboidal and tetrahedral meshes are\npresented, where we obtain second-order convergence for the normal alignment\nand symmetric volume difference. Moreover, the findings are substantiated by\ncompletely new deep insights into the minimization procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Our study\nraises the intriguing possibility that (i) there could be similar diffuse\ngalaxies that have been mistakenly interpreted as interacting galaxies due to\ntheir superposition, and (ii) UV or H$\\alpha$ could be a way to detect such\ndiffuse galaxies in our local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

We show that the long-time average of connected correlation\nfunctions of observables, along space-time rays of almost every speed,\nvanishes. This holds in any state that is invariant under space-time\ntranslations and that satisfies weak clustering properties in space. Further,\nwe show that the long-time limit of the n-th moment, with respect to the state,\nof a ray-averaged observable converges to the n-th power of its ensemble\naverage, which means that there are no fluctuations of ray averages in the long\ntime limit.

In this work we focus on two forms of\nattention mechanisms: attention modules and self-attention. Attention modules\nare used to reweight the features of each layer input tensor. Different modules\nhave different ways to perform this reweighting in fully connected or\nconvolutional layers. The attention models studied are completely modular and\nin this work they will be used with the popular ResNet architecture.\nSelf-Attention, originally proposed in the area of Natural Language Processing\nmakes it possible to relate all the items in an input sequence. Self-Attention\nis becoming increasingly popular in Computer Vision, where it is sometimes\ncombined with convolutional layers, although some recent architectures do away\nentirely with convolutions. In this work, we study and perform an objective\ncomparison of a number of different attention mechanisms in a specific computer\nvision task, the classification of samples in the widely used Skin Cancer MNIST\ndataset. The results show that attention modules do sometimes improve the\nperformance of convolutional neural network architectures, but also that this\nimprovement, although noticeable and statistically significant, is not\nconsistent in different settings. The results obtained with self-attention\nmechanisms, on the other hand, show consistent and significant improvements,\nleading to the best results even in architectures with a reduced number of\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

The main difficulty in\nmeasuring the 21 cm signal is the presence of bright foregrounds that require\nvery accurate interferometric calibration. Closure quantities may circumvent\nthe calibration requirements but may be, however, affected by direction\ndependent effects, particularly antenna primary beam responses. This work\ninvestigates the impact of antenna primary beams affected by mutual coupling on\nthe closure phase and its power spectrum. Our simulations show that primary\nbeams affected by mutual coupling lead to a leakage of foreground power into\nthe EoR window, which can be up to $\\sim4$ orders magnitude higher than the\ncase where no mutual coupling is considered. This leakage is, however,\nessentially confined at $k < 0.3$~$h$~Mpc$^{-1}$ for triads that include 29~m\nbaselines. The leakage magnitude is more pronounced when bright foregrounds\nappear in the antenna sidelobes, as expected. Finally, we find that triads that\ninclude mutual coupling beams different from each other have power spectra\nsimilar to triads that include the same type of mutual coupling beam,\nindicating that beam-to-beam variation within triads (or visibility pairs) is\nnot the major source of foreground leakage in the EoR window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 16:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 05:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 12:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

This\ncombination is particularly advantageous for time-constrained delivery routing\nin dense urban areas, where battery recharging along routes can be too\ntime-consuming to economically justify the use of all-electric vehicles.\nHowever, switching from electric to conventional fossil fuel modes also results\nin higher costs and emissions and lower efficiency. This paper analyzes this\nheterogeneous vehicle routing problem and describes two solution methods: an\nexact branch-price-and-cut algorithm and an iterated tabu search metaheuristic.\nFrom a methodological perspective, we find that the exact algorithm\nconsistently obtains tight lower bounds that also serve to certify the\nmetaheuristic solutions as near-optimal.

In addition, we use a lightweight semantic\ndecoder during training to provide supervision to the intermediate semantic\nprior maps at every stage. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating\nsemantic priors enhances the performance of the established hierarchical\nencoders with a slight increase in the number of FLOPs. We provide empirical\nproof by integrating SeMask into Swin Transformer and Mix Transformer backbones\nas our encoder paired with different decoders. Our framework achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art of 58.25% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset and improvements of over\n3% in the mIoU metric on the Cityscapes dataset. The code and checkpoints are\npublicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/SeMask-Segmentation .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 13:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 09:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

The performance of local\nself-attention (LSA) is just on par with convolution and inferior to dynamic\nfilters, which puzzles researchers on whether to use LSA or its counterparts,\nwhich one is better, and what makes LSA mediocre. To clarify these, we\ncomprehensively investigate LSA and its counterparts from two sides:\n\\emph{channel setting} and \\emph{spatial processing}. We find that the devil\nlies in the generation and application of spatial attention, where relative\nposition embeddings and the neighboring filter application are key factors.\nBased on these findings, we propose the enhanced local self-attention (ELSA)\nwith Hadamard attention and the ghost head. Hadamard attention introduces the\nHadamard product to efficiently generate attention in the neighboring case,\nwhile maintaining the high-order mapping. The ghost head combines attention\nmaps with static matrices to increase channel capacity. Experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of ELSA.

Scattered light from this dust is also a source of\nbackground flux which must be overcome by future missions to image Earthlike\nplanets. This study quantifies the sensitivity of the Nancy Grace Roman Space\nTelescope Coronagraph to light scattered by exozodi, the zodiacal dust around\nother stars. Using a sample of 149 nearby stars, previously selected for\noptimum detection of habitable exoplanets by space observatories, we find the\nmaximum number of exozodiacal disks with observable \\textit{inner} habitable\nzone boundaries is six and the number of observable outer habitable boundaries\nis 74. One zodi was defined as the visible-light surface brightness of 22\n$m_{\\rm V}\\ $arcsec$^{-2}$ around a solar-mass star, approximating the\nscattered light brightness in visible light at the Earth-equivalent insolation.\nIn the speckle limited case, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited by\nspeckle temporal stability rather than shot noise, the median $5\\sigma$\nsensitivity to habitable zone exozodi is 12 zodi per resolution element. This\nestimate is calculated at the inner-working angle of the coronagraph, for the\ncurrent best estimate performance, neglecting margins on the uncertainty in\ninstrument performance and including a post-processing speckle suppression\nfactor. For an log-norm distribution of exozodi levels with a median exozodi of\n3$\\times$ the solar zodi, we find that the Roman Coronagraph would be able to\nmake 5$\\sigma$ detections of exozodiacal disks in scattered light from 13\nsystems with a 95\\% confidence interval spanning 7-20 systems. This sensitivity\nallows Roman Coronagraph to complement ground-based measurements of exozodiacal\nthermal emission and constrain dust albedos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 19:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

The OPD between a pair of telescopes is induced by\ndifferential optical properties such as atmospheric refraction, telescope\nalignment, etc. This has classically been measured using a fringe tracker that\nprovides corrections to a piston actuator to account for this difference. An\nauxiliary method, known as the Piston Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx) has\nbeen developed to measure the OPD, or differential 'piston' of the wavefront,\ninduced by the atmosphere at each telescope. Previously, this method was\noutlined and results obtained from LBT adaptive optics (AO) data for a single\ntelescope aperture were presented.

The results indicate that the\ntelescope and instrumental noise of the combined VLTI and GRAVITY systems\ndominate over the atmospheric turbulence contributions. However, good agreement\nbetween simulated and on-sky P-REx data indicates that if the telescope and\ninstrumental noise were reduced to atmospheric piston noise levels, P-REx has\nthe potential to reduce the OPD root mean square of piston turbulence by up to\na factor of 10 for frequencies down to 1 Hz.

The main difficulty is the high dimensionality of the RNNs output\nwhich consists in the internal state variable distribution in the\nmicro-structure. We thus propose and compare several surrogate models based on\na dimensionality reduction: i) direct RNN modeling with implicit NNW\ndimensionality reduction, ii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction, and iii)\nRNN with PCA dimensionality reduction and dimensionality break down, i.e. the\nuse of several RNNs instead of a single one.

We observe that the performance of MPRs is highly sensitive to\nthe meta-paths they use, but existing works manually select the meta-paths from\nmany possible ones.

Methods: Continuous arterial BP,\nelectrocardiography (ECG), and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were acquired\nfrom 29 patients undergoing surgery. After extracting 9 features from the PPG\nand ECG signals, we dynamically selected features upon each intermittent\nmeasurement (every 10 min) of SBP based on feature robustness and the principle\nof correlation-based feature selection. Finally, multiple linear regression\nmodels were built to combine these features to estimate SBP every 30 s.\nResults: Compared to the reference SBP, the proposed method achieved a mean of\ndifference at 0.08 mmHg, a standard deviation of difference at 7.97 mmHg, and a\ncorrelation coefficient at 0.89 (p < 0.001).

First, the\nnonlinear system is approximated as a polynomial nonlinear state-space (PNLSS)\nsystem, and a linear parameter-varying (LPV) representation of the PNLSS model\nis obtained. To reduce the potentially large number of scheduling parameters in\nthe resulting LPV system, an approach based on the cascade feedforward neural\nnetwork (CFNN) is proposed. We account for the approximation and reduction\nerrors through the addition of a norm-bounded, causal, dynamic uncertainty in\nthe LFT system. Falsification is used in a novel way to perform guided\nsimulations for deriving a norm bound on the dynamic uncertainty and generating\ndata for training the CFNN. Then, robustness analysis using integral quadratic\nconstraint theory is carried out to choose an LFT representation that leads to\na computationally tractable analysis problem and useful analysis results.\nFinally, the proposed approach is used to obtain an LFT representation for the\nnonlinear equations of motion of a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 22:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

This\nchallenge calls for better evidence as well as for the theoretical concepts to\ndescribe it. Here we briefly summarise the theoretical questions surrounding\nthe role of vegetation cover in the dynamics of a moist atmosphere. We discuss\nthe previously unrecognized sensitivity of local wind power to condensation\nrate as revealed by our analysis of the continuity equation for a gas mixture.\nUsing the framework of condensation-induced atmospheric dynamics, we then show\nthat with the temperature contrast between land and ocean increasing up to a\ncritical threshold, ocean-to-land moisture transport reaches a tipping point\nwhere it can stop or even reverse. Land-ocean temperature contrasts are\naffected by both global and regional processes, in particular, by the surface\nfluxes of sensible and latent heat that are strongly influenced by vegetation.\nOur results clarify how a disturbance of natural vegetation cover, e.g., by\ndeforestation, can disrupt large-scale atmospheric circulation and moisture\ntransport. In view of the increasing pressure on natural ecosystems, successful\nstrategies of mitigating climate change require taking into account the impact\nof vegetation on moist atmospheric dynamics. Our analysis provides a\ntheoretical framework to assess this impact. The available data for Eurasia\nindicate that the observed climatological land-ocean temperature contrasts are\nclose to the threshold. This can explain the increasing fluctuations in the\ncontinental water cycle including droughts and floods and signifies a yet\ngreater potential importance for large-scale forest conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 23:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

EHR data, represented as a\nthree-dimensional analogue of a matrix (tensor), is decomposed into\ntwo-dimensional factors that can be interpreted as computational phenotypes.\nMethods: We apply constrained tensor factorization to derive computational\nphenotypes and predict mortality in cohorts of patients with breast, prostate,\ncolorectal, or lung cancer in the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data\nWarehouse from 2000 to 2015. In our experiments, we examined using a supervised\nterm in the factorization algorithm, filtering tensor co-occurrences by medical\nindication, and incorporating additional social determinants of health (SDOH)\ncovariates in the factorization process. We evaluated the resulting\ncomputational phenotypes qualitatively and by assessing their ability to\npredict five-year mortality using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic.\nResults: Filtering by medical indication led to more concise and interpretable\nphenotypes. Mortality prediction performance (AUC) varied under the different\nexperimental conditions and by cancer type (breast: 0.623 - 0.694, prostate:\n0.603 - 0.750, colorectal: 0.523 - 0.641, and lung: 0.517 - 0.623).

Most previous works adopt a bottom-up\ntwo-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from high\ntime complexity or sub-optimal designs. In this work, we propose a novel SGG\nmethod to address the aforementioned issues, formulating the task as a\nbipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a\ntransformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and\npredicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the\nrelation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate\nrepresentation based on a structural predicate generator that leverages the\ncompositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling\nmodule to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our\nentity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an\nend-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able\nto achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging\nbenchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher\nefficiency in inference.

As a remedy, we show that\npolynomially-tailed losses restore the effects of importance reweighting in\ncorrecting distribution shift in overparameterized models. We characterize the\nbehavior of gradient descent on importance weighted polynomially-tailed losses\nwith overparameterized linear models, and theoretically demonstrate the\nadvantage of using polynomially-tailed losses in a label shift setting.\nSurprisingly, our theory shows that using weights that are obtained by\nexponentiating the classical unbiased importance weights can improve\nperformance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our analysis with\nneural network experiments on a subpopulation shift and a label shift dataset.\nWhen reweighted, our loss function can outperform reweighted cross-entropy by\nas much as 9% in test accuracy. Our loss function also gives test accuracies\ncomparable to, or even exceeding, well-tuned state-of-the-art methods for\ncorrecting distribution shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 08:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 05:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

It is assumed that the\ntwo hard X-ray photons emitted from an astrophysical source are scattered on a\nfree electron and converted into a single soft photon of optical range. Using\nQED S-matrix formalism for the derivation of a cross-section of direct double\nCompton (DDC) and assuming detailed balance conditions we give an analytical\nexpression for the cross-section of the IDC process. It is shown that at fixed\nenergies of incident photons the inverse cross-section has no infra-red\ndivergences and its behavior is completely defined by the spectral\ncharacteristics of the photon source itself, in particular, by the finite\ninteraction time of radiation with an electron. Thus, even for the direct\nprocess, the problem of resolving infrared divergence actually refers to a real\nphysical source of radiation in which photons are never actually plane waves.\nAs a result the physical frequency profile of the scattered radiation for\ndirect as well as inverse double Compton processes is a function of both the\nintensity and line shape of the incident photon field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 08:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

For example,\nedit distance of two strings of length $n$ can be solved in $O(n^2/w)$ time. In\na reasonable classical model of computation, one can assume $w=\\Theta(\\log n)$.\nThere are conditional lower bounds for such problems stating that speed-ups\nwith factor $n^\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ would lead to breakthroughs in\ncomplexity theory. However, these conditional lower bounds do not cover quantum\nmodels of computing. Indeed, Boroujeni et al. (J. ACM, 2021) showed that edit\ndistance can be approximated within a factor $3$ in sub-quadratic time\n$O(n^{1.81})$ using quantum computing. They also showed that, in their chosen\nmodel of quantum computing, the approximation factor cannot be improved using\nsub-quadractic time.\n  To break through the aforementioned classical conditional lower bounds and\nthis latest quantum lower bound, we enrich the model of computation with a\nquantum random access memory (QRAM), obtaining what we call the word QRAM\nmodel. Under this model, we show how to convert the bit-parallelism of\nquadratic time solvable problems into quantum algorithms that attain speed-ups\nwith factor $n$. The technique we use is simple and general enough to apply to\nmany bit-parallel algorithms that use Boolean logics and bit-shifts. To apply\nit to edit distance, we first show that the famous $O(n^2/w)$ time bit-parallel\nalgorithm of Myers (J. ACM, 1999) can be adjusted to work without arithmetic +\noperations. As a direct consequence of applying our technique to this variant,\nwe obtain linear time edit distance algorithm under the word QRAM model for\nconstant alphabet. We give further results on a restricted variant of the word\nQRAM model to give more insights to the limits of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 09:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 18:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 14:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

To facilitate the theoretical analysis,\nonly single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in\nthis paper, i.e., the MMSE estimation is performed based on the received pilot\nsignals at each AP separately. Inspired by the decoupling principle of replica\nsymmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent\nand identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the\ncorresponding decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse\nsignal vectors with independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.)\nnon-zero components, which plays a key role in the theoretical analysis of SMV\nbased MMSE estimation of the effective channel coefficients in cell-free\nmassive MIMO systems with massive connectivity.

Most of the real world data we encounter are asynchronous event\nsequence, so the last decades have been characterized by the implementation of\nvarious point process into the field of social networks,electronic medical\nrecords and financial transactions. At the beginning, Hawkes process and its\nvariants which can simulate simultaneously the self-triggering and mutual\ntriggering patterns between different events in complex sequences in a clear\nand quantitative way are more popular.Later on, with the advances of neural\nnetwork, neural Hawkes process has been proposed one after another, and\ngradually become a research hotspot. The proposal of the transformer Hawkes\nprocess (THP) has gained a huge performance improvement, so a new upsurge of\nthe neural Hawkes process based on transformer is set off. However, THP does\nnot make full use of the information of occurrence time and type of event in\nthe asynchronous event sequence. It simply adds the encoding of event type\nconversion and the location encoding of time conversion to the source encoding.\nAt the same time, the learner built from a single transformer will result in an\ninescapable learning bias.

To address\nthe challenge, numerous defense strategies, including reactive and proactive\nones, have been proposed for robustness improvement. From the perspective of\nimage feature space, some of them cannot reach satisfying results due to the\nshift of features. Besides, features learned by models are not directly related\nto classification results. Different from them, We consider defense method\nessentially from model inside and investigated the neuron behaviors before and\nafter attacks. We observed that attacks mislead the model by dramatically\nchanging the neurons that contribute most and least to the correct label.\nMotivated by it, we introduce the concept of neuron influence and further\ndivide neurons into front, middle and tail part. Based on it, we propose\nneuron-level inverse perturbation(NIP), the first neuron-level reactive defense\nmethod against adversarial attacks. By strengthening front neurons and\nweakening those in the tail part, NIP can eliminate nearly all adversarial\nperturbations while still maintaining high benign accuracy. Besides, it can\ncope with different sizes of perturbations via adaptivity, especially larger\nones. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three datasets and six models show\nthat NIP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines against eleven adversarial\nattacks.

When\nthe reactive sites of both polymers are chemically orthogonal so that only\nintramolecular bonds are possible, the interactions become more repulsive the\ncloser to periodic the sequence is. The opposite effect is found if both\npolymers have the same type of reactive sites and intermolecular bonds can be\nformed. We test the validity of the effective potentials in solution, from high\ndilution to far above the overlap concentration, by comparing simulations of\nthe effective fluid with those of the real all-monomer system.

One is\nbased on the classical Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) model that includes a finite\nLarmor radius (FLR) correction and the Landau closure for the longitudinal\nmode. Another one takes into account the effect of cyclotron resonance in\naddition to Landau resonance, which is referred to as the cyclotron resonance\nclosure (CRC) model. While the linear property of the parallel firehose\ninstability is better described by the CGL model, the electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron instability driven unstable by the cyclotron resonance is reproduced\nonly by the CRC model. Nonlinear simulation results for the parallel firehose\ninstability performed with the two models are also discussed. Although the\nlinear and quasilinear isotropization phases are consistent with theory in both\nmodels, long-term behaviors may be substantially different. The final state\nobtained by the CRC model may be reasonably understood in terms of the marginal\nstability condition. In contrast, the lack of cyclotron damping in the CGL\nmodel makes it rather difficult to predict the long-term behavior with a simple\nphysical argument. This suggests that incorporating the collisionless damping\nboth for longitudinal and transverse modes is crucial for a nonlinear fluid\nsimulation model of collisionless plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 14:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Our\nfirst proposed approach bounds the number of maximum states that constitute a\nprefix-alignment to be retained by any case in memory. The second proposed\napproach bounds the number of cases that are allowed to retain more than a\nsingle state, referred to as multi-state cases. Building on top of the two\nproposed approaches, our third approach further bounds the number of maximum\nstates that the multi-state cases can retain. All these approaches forget the\nstates in excess to their defined limits and retain a meaningful summary of\nthem. Computing prefix-alignments in the future is then resumed for such cases\nfrom the current position contained in the summary. We highlight the\nsuperiority of all proposed approaches compared to a state of the art\nprefix-alignment-based OCC technique through experiments using real-life event\ndata under a streaming setting. Our approaches substantially reduce memory\nconsumption by up to 80% on average, while introducing a minor accuracy drop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

We first\npropose a multi-agent DRL algorithm with centralized training (DRL-CT) to\ntackle the joint resource allocation problem.
