Most\nof the existing literature assumes the covariate vectors $x_t$'s are\nindependently and identically distributed (i.i.d.); the few papers that relax\nthis assumption either sacrifice model generality or yield sub-optimal regret\nbounds. In this paper we show that a simple pricing algorithm has an\n$O(d\\sqrt{T}\\log T)$ regret upper bound without assuming any statistical\nstructure on the covariates $x_t$ (which can even be arbitrarily chosen). The\nupper bound on the regret matches the lower bound (even under the i.i.d.\nassumption) up to logarithmic factors. Our paper thus shows that (i) the i.i.d.\nassumption is not necessary for obtaining low regret, and (ii) the regret bound\ncan be independent of the (inverse) minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix\nof the $x_t$'s, a quantity present in previous bounds.

Methods: The data set comprised 217 samples, with 113 stage Ta tumor\ntissue samples and 104 stage T1 tumor tissue samples. The top 766 genes were\nchosen. P.value<0.0001 and |logFC|=1 was used to change the cutoff criteria for\ndefining DEGs.

A value between 0 (no accuracy) and 1\n(perfect accuracy), the accuracy of a classification model is dependent on\nseveral factors, notably: the classification rule or algorithm used, the\nintrinsic characteristics of the tool used to do the classification, and the\nrelative frequency of the elements being classified. Several accuracy metrics\nexist, each with its own advantages in different classification scenarios. In\nthis manuscript, we show that relative to a perfect accuracy of 1, the positive\nprevalence threshold ($\\phi_e$), a critical point of maximum curvature in the\nprecision-prevalence curve, bounds the $F{_{\\beta}}$ score between 1 and\n1.8/1.5/1.2 for $\\beta$ values of 0.5/1.0/2.0, respectively; the $F_1$ score\nbetween 1 and 1.5, and the Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FM) between 1 and $\\sqrt{2}\n\\approx 1.414$. We likewise describe a novel $negative$ prevalence threshold\n($\\phi_n$), the level of sharpest curvature for the negative predictive\nvalue-prevalence curve, such that $\\phi_n$ $>$ $\\phi_e$. The area between both\nthese thresholds bounds the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) between\n$\\sqrt{2}/2$ and $\\sqrt{2}$. Conversely, the ratio of the maximum possible\naccuracy to that at any point below the prevalence threshold, $\\phi_e$, goes to\ninfinity with decreasing prevalence. Though applications are numerous, the\nideas herein discussed may be used in computational complexity theory,\nartificial intelligence, and medical screening, amongst others. Where\ncomputational time is a limiting resource, attaining the prevalence threshold\nin binary classification systems may be sufficient to yield levels of accuracy\ncomparable to that under maximum prevalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 2021 21:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Over the\npast several years, Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to\nsuch data.

Existing neural hybrid video coding approaches rely\non optical flow or Gaussian-scale flow for prediction, which cannot support\nfine-grained adaptation to diverse motion content.

Specifically, on the one\nhand, we produce a reference feature pyramid as prediction sources and then\ntransmit cross-scale flows that leverage the feature scale to control the\nprecision of prediction. On the other hand, for the first time, a weighted\nprediction mechanism is introduced even if only a single reference frame is\navailable, which can help synthesize a fine prediction result by transmitting\ncross-scale weight maps.

We\napply this proposal in object detection tasks and develop a model named\nMiti-DETR. Miti-DETR reserves the inputs of each single attention layer to the\noutputs of that layer so that the \"non-attention\" information has participated\nin any attention propagation. The formed residual self-attention network\naddresses two critical issues: (1) stop the self-attention networks from\ndegenerating to rank-1 to the maximized degree; and (2) further diversify the\npath distribution of parameter update so that easier attention learning is\nexpected. Miti-DETR significantly enhances the average detection precision and\nconvergence speed towards existing DETR-based models on the challenging COCO\nobject detection dataset.

This\npaper deals with the subcategory of bugs named silent bugs: they lead to wrong\nbehavior but they do not cause system crashes or hangs, nor show an error\nmessage to the user. Such bugs are even more dangerous in DL applications and\nframeworks due to the \"black-box\" and stochastic nature of the systems (the end\nuser can not understand how the model makes decisions). This paper presents the\nfirst empirical study of Keras and TensorFlow silent bugs, and their impact on\nusers' programs. We extracted closed issues related to Keras from the\nTensorFlow GitHub repository. Out of the 1,168 issues that we gathered, 77 were\nreproducible silent bugs affecting users' programs. We categorized the bugs\nbased on the effects on the users' programs and the components where the issues\noccurred, using information from the issue reports. We then derived a threat\nlevel for each of the issues, based on the impact they had on the users'\nprograms.

A Leonard pair on $V$ is an\nordered pair of diagonalizable $\\mathbb{F}$-linear maps $A : V \\to V$ and $A^*\n: V \\to V$ that each act in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion on an eigenbasis\nfor the other one.

However, the majority of\nthese models lack explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe\nproperties that derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this\nlimitation we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range electrostatic\ninteraction between ions (nuclei+core electrons) and valence electrons with\nthat of distributions of spherical Gaussian charges located at ionic and\nelectronic sites. The latter are rigorously defined in terms of the centers of\nthe maximally localized Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local\natomic environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the deep\npotential long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian\ncharge system is added to short-range interactions that are represented as in\nthe standard DP model. The resulting potential energy surface is smooth and\npossesses analytical forces and virial. Missing effects in the standard DP\nscheme are recovered, improving on accuracy and predictive power. By including\nlong-range electrostatics, DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the\npotential energy surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on\nsmaller systems.

The transcription of handwritten content\npresent in digitized documents is significant in analyzing historical archives\nor digitizing information from handwritten documents, forms, and\ncommunications.

This Thesis\naddresses the offline continuous handwritten text recognition (HTR) problem,\nconsisting of developing algorithms and models capable of transcribing the text\npresent in an image without the need for the text to be segmented into\ncharacters. For this purpose, we have proposed a new recognition model based on\nintegrating two types of deep learning architectures: convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, respectively. The\nconvolutional component of the model is oriented to identify relevant features\npresent in characters, and the seq2seq component builds the transcription of\nthe text by modeling the sequential nature of the text. For the design of this\nnew model, an extensive analysis of the capabilities of different convolutional\narchitectures in the simplified problem of isolated character recognition has\nbeen carried out in order to identify the most suitable ones to be integrated\ninto the continuous model. Additionally, extensive experimentation of the\nproposed model for the continuous problem has been carried out to determine its\nrobustness to changes in parameterization. The generalization capacity of the\nmodel has also been validated by evaluating it on three handwritten text\ndatabases using different languages: IAM in English, RIMES in French, and\nOsborne in Spanish, respectively. The new proposed model provides competitive\nresults with those obtained with other well-established methodologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 07:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

In this thesis, we design an efficient platform, MPCLeague, for\nPPML in the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC) setting using Secure\nMulti-party Computation (MPC) techniques.\n  MPC, the holy-grail problem of secure distributed computing, enables a set of\nn mutually distrusting parties to perform joint computation on their private\ninputs in a way that no coalition of t parties can learn more information than\nthe output (privacy) or affect the true output of the computation\n(correctness).

This thesis focuses on designing efficient MPC frameworks for 2, 3\nand 4 parties, with at most one corruption and supports ring structures.\n  At the heart of this thesis are four frameworks - ASTRA, SWIFT, Tetrad,\nABY2.0 - catered to different settings.

While server\nsharing among jobs improves resource utilization, interference among co-located\nDL jobs occurs due to resource contention. Interference-aware job placement has\nbeen studied, with white-box approaches based on explicit interference modeling\nand black-box schedulers with reinforcement learning. In today's clusters\ncontaining thousands of GPU servers, running a single scheduler to manage all\narrival jobs in a timely and effective manner is challenging, due to the large\nworkload scale.

The refractive\nindex is usually determined from Snell's law using the minimum deviation angle\nthrough a prism. A medium that partially absorbs light has complex permittivity\n(or permeability), and its refractive index has an imaginary part. Because of\nthe imaginary part, Snell's law does not hold for light-absorbing media.\nAccordingly, other methods is required to determine the complex value of the\nrefractive index in a light-absorbing medium. The exact solution of Maxwell's\nequations was obtained for light passing through a prism composed of a\nlight-absorbing medium. Thereby the optical path was determined. The difference\nof optical paths between light-absorbing medium and transparent medium was\ncalculated numerically. The difference is very large in the neighborhood of\nperfect reflection area of transparent medium. We found two methods to\ndetermine the complex value of the refractive index using the optical path.\nBoth methods analyzed the solutions in detail for two specific incident angles.\nThe deviation angles corresponding to the two incident angles determined the\ncomplex value of the prism's refractive index. The obtained refractive index is\nindependent of the apex angle of the prism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 11:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 15:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

The applied TISTA\nruns linear Landweber iterations implemented with a trained regularization\nnetwork designed based on U-net architecture.

The reconstructed calculation sequence, of\nthe Plimpton 322 cuneiform tablet, presented and described here, shows in its\ncompleteness that, around 3800 years ago there already was a systematically\napplied exact measuring system, with the usage of trigonometric function\nvalues. With this approach one can plausibly explain that, as we still it\npractice today, a geometry of the circle has been used for this calculation. It\nis based on, but not only, of the usage of the regularities, which 1200 years\nlater, were named after Pythagoras. During a second calculation step, for an\nintended scaled documentation, presentation or transfer to other locations, the\ndimensionless calculated function value, was extended, with a fractional part,\nor more exact spelled a common factor. This transformation creates a real\nmeasurable length from the ratios, always related to the smallest unit. The\nsystematic usage by means of inclining triangles already in old Babylonian\ntimes, goes far beyond the previously known level of this age. The accuracy of\nthe individual calculation is just as verifiable and on exactly the same level\nas the trigonometric functions used today. However, at least at this point in\ntime, the Babylonians were content with dividing a quarter circle into at least\n150 inclining triangles. This old Babylonian trigonometric function value\nsystem, together with the here described \"Babylonian diagonal calculation\", is\nthus the forerunner of the Greek chord calculation and the Indo-Arabic\ntrigonometric functions of the early Middle Ages, which we still use today.

On the one\nhand, this generality allows GRL to model almost every domain possible, e.g.\\\nBandits, MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, and history-based environments. On the other hand,\nin general, the near-optimal policies in GRL are functions of complete history,\nwhich hinders not only learning but also planning in GRL. The usual way around\nfor the planning part is that the agent is given a Markovian abstraction of the\nunderlying process. So, it can use any MDP planning algorithm to find a\nnear-optimal policy. The Extreme State Aggregation (ESA) framework has extended\nthis idea to non-Markovian abstractions without compromising on the possibility\nof planning through a (surrogate) MDP. A distinguishing feature of ESA is that\nit proves an upper bound of $O\\left(\\varepsilon^{-A} \\cdot\n(1-\\gamma)^{-2A}\\right)$ on the number of states required for the surrogate MDP\n(where $A$ is the number of actions, $\\gamma$ is the discount-factor, and\n$\\varepsilon$ is the optimality-gap) which holds \\emph{uniformly} for\n\\emph{all} domains.

Moreover,\nin many important cases (e.g, average treatment effects and avearage\nderivatives) the bound is shown to depend on easily interpretable quantities\nthat measure the explanatory power of the omitted variables. Therefore, simple\nplausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables\n(in explaining treatment and outcome variation) are sufficient to place overall\nbounds on the size of the bias. Furthermore, we use debiased machine learning\nto provide flexible and efficient statistical inference on learnable components\nof the bounds. Finally, empirical examples demonstrate the usefulness of the\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 15:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 14:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 00:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Such data is typically\nextracted in the form of time series data, which can be investigated with data\nmining techniques to summarize behaviors of a range of subjects including\nhumans and animals. While enabling cheap and mass collection of data,\ncontinuous sensor data recording results in datasets which are big in size and\nvolume, which are challenging to process and analyze with traditional\ntechniques in a timely manner. Such collected sensor data is typically\nextracted in the form of time series data.

Shape-based classification determines the best class according\nto a distance measure. Feature-based classification, on the other hand,\nmeasures properties of the time series and finds the best class according to\nthe set of features defined for the time series. In this dissertation, we\ndemonstrate that neither of the two techniques will dominate for some problems,\nbut that some combination of both might be the best. In other words, on a\nsingle problem, it might be possible that one of the techniques is better for\none subset of the behaviors, and the other technique is better for another\nsubset of behaviors.

In UAM,\naircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the\naerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables\nUAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe\ntransportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity\nperformance for UAM, a spatial model is proposed. For this setup, the\ndistribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its\nassociated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced\nby the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio\n(SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity\nperformance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then,\nleveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous\nfederated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is\nproposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM\noperations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is\nintroduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction\nmodel used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical\nderivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate\nthat the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction\nmodel faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a\nstaleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the\nperformance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's\nturbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design\nguidelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 14:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms\nhave focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results\naccording to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our\ninvestigation reinforces the fact that such customer-centric design of these\nservices may lead to unfair distribution of exposure to the producers, which\nmay adversely impact their well-being. On the other hand, a pure\nproducer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. As more and more\npeople are depending on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to\nensure fairness to both producers and customers. In this work, by mapping a\nfair personalized recommendation problem to a constrained version of the\nproblem of fairly allocating indivisible goods, we propose to provide fairness\nguarantees for both sides. Formally, our proposed {\\em FairRec} algorithm\nguarantees Maxi-Min Share ($\\alpha$-MMS) of exposure for the producers, and\nEnvy-Free up to One Item (EF1) fairness for the customers. Extensive\nevaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of {\\em\nFairRec} in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in\noverall recommendation quality. Finally, we present a modification of FairRec\n(named as FairRecPlus) that at the cost of additional computation time,\nimproves the recommendation performance for the customers, while maintaining\nthe same fairness guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 05:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}
