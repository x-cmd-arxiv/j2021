The parameters are then retrieved by\napplying the inverse of the embedding to the network predictions. The results\nare shown for the problem of X-ray imaging of solar flares with data from the\nSpectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays. In this case, the parameter space is\na family of Moebius strips that collapse into a point. Our simulation studies\nshow that the use of a neural network for predicting the parameters directly\nfrom the data yields systematic errors due to the non-Euclidean topology of the\nparameter space. The proposed strategy overcomes the topological issues and\nfurnishes stable and accurate reconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In addition we used HI data from\nthe Southern Galactic Plane Survey. Two radiative transfer models were used to\nfit the observed data.

We\nprove that at high temperature, there are three sub-regimes concerning the\nstrength of external field $h \\approx \\rho N^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\rho,\\alpha\\in\n(0,\\infty)$. In the super-critical regime $\\alpha < 1/4$, the variance of the\nlog-partition function is $\\approx N^{1-4\\alpha}$. In the critical regime\n$\\alpha = 1/4$, the fluctuation is of constant order but depends on $\\rho$.\nWhereas, in the sub-critical regime $\\alpha>1/4$, the variance is $\\Theta(1)$\nand does not depend on $\\rho$. We explicitly express the asymptotic mean and\nvariance in all three regimes and prove Gaussian central limit theorems. Our\nproofs mainly follow two approaches. One utilizes quadratic coupling and\nGuerra's interpolation scheme for Gaussian disorder, extending to many other\nspin glass models. However, this approach can prove the CLT only at very high\ntemperatures. The other one is a cluster-based approach for general symmetric\ndisorders, first used in the seminal work of Aizenman, Lebowitz, and\nRuelle~(Comm.~Math.~Phys.~112 (1987), no.~1, 3--20) for the zero external field\ncase. It was believed that this approach does not work if the external field is\npresent. We show that if the external field is present but not too strong, it\nstill works with a new cluster structure. In particular, we prove the CLT up to\nthe critical temperature in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model when $\\alpha\n\\ge 1/4$. We further address the generality of this cluster-based approach.\nSpecifically, we give similar results for the multi-species SK model and\ndiluted SK model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 22:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 17:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

This work investigates a\nwaveform-defined security (WDS) framework, which differs fundamentally from\ntraditional PLS techniques used in today's systems. The framework is not\ndependent on channel conditions such as signal power advantage and channel\nstate information (CSI). Therefore, the framework is more reliable than channel\ndependent beamforming and artificial noise (AN) techniques. In addition, the\nframework is more than just increasing the cost of eavesdropping. By\nintentionally tuning waveform patterns to weaken signal feature diversity and\nenhance feature similarity, eavesdroppers will not be able to identify\ncorrectly signal formats. The wrong classification of signal formats would\nresult in subsequent detection errors even when an eavesdropper uses\nbrute-force detection techniques. To get a robust WDS framework, three impact\nfactors, namely training data feature, oversampling factor and bandwidth\ncompression factor (BCF) offset, are investigated. An optimal WDS waveform\npattern is obtained at the end after a joint study of the three factors. To\nensure a valid eavesdropping model, artificial intelligence (AI) dependent\nsignal classifiers are designed followed by optimal performance achievable\nsignal detectors. To show the compatibility in available communication systems,\nthe WDS framework is successfully integrated in IEEE 802.11a with nearly no\nadding computational complexity. Finally, a low-cost software-defined radio\n(SDR) experiment is designed to verify the feasibility of the WDS framework in\nresource-constrained communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

First, given the\nunprecedented amount of data collected by utilities, a sparse dictionary-based\nensemble spectral clustering (SDESC) method is proposed to decompose historical\noutage datasets, which enjoys good computational efficiency and scalability.\nSpecifically, each outage sample is represented by a linear combination of a\nsmall number of selected dictionary samples using a density-based method. Then,\nthe dictionary-based representation is utilized to perform the spectral\nanalysis to group the data samples with similar features into the same subsets.\nIn the second stage, a knowledge-transfer-added restoration time prediction\nmodel is trained for each subset by combining weather information and\noutage-related features. The transfer learning technology is introduced with\nthe aim of dealing with the underestimation problem caused by data imbalance in\ndifferent subsets, thus improving the model performance. Furthermore, to\nconnect unseen outages with the learned outage subsets, a t-distributed\nstochastic neighbor embedding-based strategy is applied.

The foot point of HXR\nsources result from the direct interaction of non-thermal electron beams with\nplasma in the lower part of the solar atmosphere, where the density increases\nrapidly. Therefore, we can estimate the plasma density distribution along the\nnon-thermal electron beam directly from the observations of the altitude-energy\nrelation obtained for the HXR foot point sources. The relation's shape is\ndensity-dependent and is also determined by the power-law distribution of\nnon-thermal electrons. Additionally, during the impulsive phase these\nparameters may change dramatically. Thus, the interpretation of observed HXR\nfoot point sources' altitudes is not straightforward and needs detailed\nnumerical modelling of the electron precipitation process. The numerical model\nwas calculated using the hydrodynamic 1D model with an application of the\nFokker-Planck formalism for non-thermal beam precipitation. HXR data from\nRHESSI were used to trace chromospheric density changes during a non-thermal\nemission burst, in detail. We have found that the amount of mass that\nevaporated from the chromosphere is in good agreement with the ranges obtained\nfrom hydrodynamical modelling of a flaring loop, and from an analysis of\nobserved emission measure in the loop top, and with specific scaling laws.\nConsistency between the obtained values shows that HXR images may provide an\nimportant constraint for models - a mass of plasma that evaporated due to a\nnon-thermal electron beam depositing energy in the chromosphere. High-energy,\nnon-thermal sources' (above 20 keV in this case) positions fit the column\ndensity changes obtained from the hydrodynamical model perfectly.

The two-body reduced density matrix (2-RDM)\nformalism reduces this coordinate dependence to that of four particles\nirrespective of the wave function's dimensionality, providing a promising path\nto solve the many-body problem. Unfortunately, errors arise in this approach\nbecause the 2-RDM cannot practically be constrained to guarantee that it\ncorresponds to a valid wave function. Here we approach this so-called\n$N$-representability problem by expanding the 2-RDM in a complete basis of\ntwo-electron wave functions and studying the matrix formed by the expansion\ncoefficients.

Spectral information acquired from these detectors\ncan be used to extract volumetric material composition maps of the object of\ninterest. If the materials and their spectral responses are known a priori, the\nimage reconstruction step is rather straightforward. If they are not known,\nhowever, the maps as well as the responses need to be estimated jointly. A\nconventional workflow in spectral CT involves performing volume reconstruction\nfollowed by material decomposition, or vice versa. However, these methods\ninherently suffer from the ill-posedness of the joint reconstruction problem.\nTo resolve this issue, we propose 'A Dictionary-based Joint reconstruction and\nUnmixing method for Spectral Tomography' (ADJUST). Our formulation relies on\nforming a dictionary of spectral signatures of materials common in CT and prior\nknowledge of the number of materials present in an object. In particular, we\ndecompose the spectral volume linearly in terms of spatial material maps, a\nspectral dictionary, and the indicator of materials for the dictionary\nelements. We propose a memory-efficient accelerated alternating proximal\ngradient method to find an approximate solution to the resulting bi-convex\nproblem. From numerical demonstrations on several synthetic phantoms, we\nobserve that ADJUST performs exceedingly well compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we address the robustness of ADJUST\nagainst limited and noisy measurement patterns. The demonstration of the\nproposed approach on a spectral micro-CT dataset shows its potential for\nreal-world applications.

For solving these problems, zeroth-order (ZO)\nmethods that only need function evaluations are often more efficient than FO\nmethods or sometimes the only options. In this paper, we propose a novel\nzeroth-order inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ZO-iALM) to solve black-box\noptimization problems, which involve a composite (i.e., smooth+nonsmooth)\nobjective and functional constraints. Under a certain regularity condition\n(also assumed by several existing works on FO methods), the query complexity of\nour ZO-iALM is $\\tilde{O}(d\\varepsilon^{-3})$ to find an $\\varepsilon$-KKT\npoint for problems with a nonconvex objective and nonconvex constraints, and\n$\\tilde{O}(d\\varepsilon^{-2.5})$ for nonconvex problems with convex\nconstraints, where $d$ is the variable dimension. This appears to be the first\nwork that develops an iALM-based ZO method for functional constrained\noptimization and meanwhile achieves query complexity results matching the\nbest-known FO complexity results up to a factor of $d$. With an extensive\nexperimental study, we show the effectiveness of our method. The applications\nof our method span from classical optimization problems to practical machine\nlearning examples such as resource allocation in sensor networks and\nadversarial example generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

One of the\nprocesses capable of initiating identifiable CRE is an interaction of an\nultra-high energy (UHE) photon with the solar magnetic field which results in\nan electron pair production and the subsequent synchrotron radiation. The\nresultant electromagnetic cascade forms a very characteristic line-like front\nof a very small width ($\\sim$ meters), stretching from tens of thousands to\neven many millions of kilometers. In this contribution we present the results\nof applying a toy model to simulate detections of such CRE at the ground level\nwith an array of ideal detectors of different dimensions. The adopted approach\nallows us to assess the CRE detection feasibility for a specific configuration\nof a detector array. The process of initiation and propagation of an\nelectromagnetic cascade originated from an UHE photon passing near the Sun, as\nwell as the resultant particle distribution on ground, were simulated using the\nCORSIKA program with the PRESHOWER option, both modified accordingly. The\nstudied scenario results in photons forming a cascade that extends even over\ntens of millions of kilometers when it arrives at the top of the Earth's\natmosphere, and the photon energies span practically the whole cosmic ray\nenergy spectrum. The topology of the signal consists of very extended CRE\nshapes, and the characteristic, very much elongated disk-shape of the particle\ndistribution on ground illustrates the potential for identification of CRE of\nthis type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Recent\nstructural clustering methods have focused on the use of internal coordinates\ndue to the innate rotational and translational invariance of these features.\nThe vast number of possible internal coordinates necessitates a feature space\nsupervision step to make clustering tractable, but yields a protocol that can\nbe system type specific. Particle positions offer an appealing alternative to\ninternal coordinates, but suffer from a lack of rotational and translational\ninvariance, as well as a perceived insensitivity to regions of structural\ndissimilarity. Here, we present a method, denoted shape-GMM, that overcomes the\nshortcomings of particle positions using a weighted maximum likelihood (ML)\nalignment procedure. This alignment strategy is then built into an expectation\nmaximization Gaussian mixture model (GMM) procedure to capture metastable\nstates in the free energy landscape. The resulting algorithm distinguishes\nbetween a variety of different structures, including those indistinguishable by\nRMSD and pair-wise distances, as demonstrated on several model systems.\nShape-GMM results on an extensive simulation of the the fast-folding HP35\nNle/Nle mutant protein support a 4-state folding/unfolding mechanism which is\nconsistent with previous experimental results and provides kinetic detail\ncomparable to previous state of the art clustering approaches, as measured by\nthe VAMP-2 score. Currently, training of shape-GMMs is recommended for systems\n(or subsystems) that can be represented by $\\lesssim$ 200 particles and\n$\\lesssim$ 100K configurations to estimate high-dimensional covariance matrices\nand balance computational expense. Once a shape-GMM is trained, it can be used\nto predict the cluster identities of millions of configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 16:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Unlike\nconvolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous\nyears, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies\nin the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the\nself-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory\nutilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To\nalleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ\nself-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the\ncomplexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window\ninteraction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new\nshift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that\naggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions.\nThe key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and\nefficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by\nincorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show\nimprovements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy\nwith state-of-the-art models.

Hands have been separately studied, but the focus\nhas been on generating realistic static grasps of objects. To synthesize\nvirtual characters that interact with the world, we need to generate full-body\nmotions and realistic hand grasps simultaneously. Both sub-problems are\nchallenging on their own and, together, the state-space of poses is\nsignificantly larger, the scales of hand and body motions differ, and the\nwhole-body posture and the hand grasp must agree, satisfy physical constraints,\nand be plausible. Additionally, the head is involved because the avatar must\nlook at the object to interact with it. For the first time, we address the\nproblem of generating full-body, hand and head motions of an avatar grasping an\nunknown object. As input, our method, called GOAL, takes a 3D object, its\nposition, and a starting 3D body pose and shape. GOAL outputs a sequence of\nwhole-body poses using two novel networks. First, GNet generates a goal\nwhole-body grasp with a realistic body, head, arm, and hand pose, as well as\nhand-object contact. Second, MNet generates the motion between the starting and\ngoal pose. This is challenging, as it requires the avatar to walk towards the\nobject with foot-ground contact, orient the head towards it, reach out, and\ngrasp it with a realistic hand pose and hand-object contact. To achieve this,\nthe networks exploit a representation that combines SMPL-X body parameters and\n3D vertex offsets.

We reevaluate this in the context of supersymmetric\nstring vacua in the desert region and show that even though heuristically the\nspecies scale is compatible with expectations, the BPS states of the actual\nstring vacua lead to a stronger dependence of the cutoff scale on the number of\nmassless modes. We propose that this discrepancy, which can be captured by the\n\"BPS desert conjecture\", resurrects the idea of a uniform bound on the number\nof light modes as a way to avoid the black hole species problem. This\nconjecture also implies a stronger form of the Tadpole Conjecture, which leads\nto an obstruction in stabilizing all moduli semi-classically for large number\nof moduli in flux compactifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Recent approaches using machine learning (ML) models as the\ndecoders offer both improved performance and great adaptability to unknown\nenvironments, where traditional decoders struggle. We introduce a general\nframework to further boost the performance and applicability of ML models. We\npropose to combine ML decoders with a competing discriminator network that\ntries to distinguish between codewords and noisy words, and, hence, guides the\ndecoding models to recover transmitted codewords. Our framework is\ngame-theoretic, motivated by generative adversarial networks (GANs), with the\ndecoder and discriminator competing in a zero-sum game. The decoder learns to\nsimultaneously decode and generate codewords while the discriminator learns to\ntell the differences between decoded outputs and codewords. Thus, the decoder\nis able to decode noisy received signals into codewords, increasing the\nprobability of successful decoding. We show a strong connection of our\nframework with the optimal maximum likelihood decoder by proving that this\ndecoder defines a Nash equilibrium point of our game. Hence, training to\nequilibrium has a good possibility of achieving the optimal maximum likelihood\nperformance. Moreover, our framework does not require training labels, which\nare typically unavailable during communications, and, thus, seemingly can be\ntrained online and adapt to channel dynamics. To demonstrate the performance of\nour framework, we combine it with the very recent neural decoders and show\nimproved performance compared to the original models and traditional decoding\nalgorithms on various codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Their interaction with the quantum light induces\ninteractions between the molecules. The resulting hybrid light-matter states\nexhibit complex structure even if only a single vibrational coordinate per\nmolecule is considered. Since all molecules are identical, it is appealing to\nstart from the uniform situation where all molecules possess the same value of\nthis vibrational coordinate. Then, polaritons and dark states follow like in\natoms, but are functions of this coordinate, and this vibrational degree of\nfreedom makes the physics different from that of atoms. However, in spite of\nall molecules being identical, each molecule does have its own vibrational\ncoordinate. It is thus a vital issue to understand the meaning of the uniform\nsituation and how to depart from it, and enable one to realistically\ninvestigate the ensemble. A rigorous and physically relevant meaning of the\npolariton energy curves in the uniform situation has been found. It is proven\nthat any point on a polariton curve is a minimum or maximum for departing from\nthe uniform situation. It is shown how to explicitly compute the energetic\nimpact of departing from the uniform situation using solely properties of a\nsingle free molecule. The dark states and their behavior upon departing from\nthe uniform situation are analyzed as well. Useful techniques not used in this\ntopical domain are introduced and general results on, e.g., minimum energy\npath, symmetry breaking and restoration, are obtained. It is shown how to\ntransfer the findings to include several or even many nuclear degrees of\nfreedom per molecule and thus to address the problem of quantum light\ninteracting with many complex molecules. The interplay of several degrees of\nfreedom in a single molecule of the ensemble leads to qualitatively different\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

The maximum payload for schemes with ${\\Delta}$VEGA\nmanoeuvre is 500 kg using Soyuz 2.1.b, 2,000 kg using Proton-M and Delta IV\nHeavy and exceeds $12,000$ kg using SLS. For schemes with only Jupiter gravity\nassist, payload mass is twice less than for ones with ${\\Delta}$VEGA manoeuvre.\nAs a possible expansion of the mission to Sedna, it is proposed to send a small\nspacecraft to another TNO during the primary flight to Sedna.

In the reverse direction, we\nprove that every $n$-dimensional normed space $X$ satisfies $e(X)\\ge n^c$,\nwhere $c>0$ is a universal constant. Our core technical contribution is a\ngeometric structural result on stochastic clustering of finite dimensional\nnormed spaces which implies upper bounds on their Lipschitz extension moduli\nusing an extension method of Lee and the author. The separation modulus of a\nmetric space $(M,d_M)$ is the infimum over $\\sigma>0$ such that for any\n$\\Delta>0$ there is a distribution over random partitions of $M$ into clusters\nof diameter at most $\\Delta$ such that for every $x,y\\in M$ the probability\nthat they belong to different clusters is at most $\\sigma d_M(x,y)/\\Delta$. We\nobtain upper and lower bounds on the separation moduli of finite dimensional\nnormed spaces that relate them to well-studied volumetric invariants. Using\nthese connections, we find the growth rate of the separation moduli of various\nnormed spaces. We formulate a conjecture on isomorphic reverse isoperimetry\nthat can be used with our volumetric bounds on the separation modulus to obtain\nmany more asymptotic evaluations of the separation moduli of normed spaces. Our\nestimates on the separation modulus imply improved bounds on the Lipschitz\nextension moduli of various classical spaces.

However, for hydrogen-bonded systems the\nmotion of light H nuclei on the electronic potential energy surface is often\naffected by quantum delocalization. Using path integral molecular dynamics, we\nshow that nuclear quantum effects lead to a relatively small change in the\nstructure of clays, but one that is comparable to the variation incurred by\ntreating the clay at different levels of electronic structure theory.\nAccounting for quantum effects weakens the hydrogen bonds in clays, with\nH-bonds between different layers of the clay affected more than those within\nthe same layer; this is ascribed to the fact that the confinement of an H atom\ninside a layer is independent of its participation in hydrogen-bonding.

To this end, we propose a\nMulti-grained Input-adaptive Vision Transformer framework dubbed MIA-Former\nthat can input-adaptively adjust the structure of ViTs at three\ncoarse-to-fine-grained granularities (i.e., model depth and the number of model\nheads/tokens).

We present results from full nuclear network\ncalculations that now include these reactions and determine their impact on\ncrust composition, crust impurity, heating, and cooling. We find that a large\nnumber of neutron transfer reactions indeed occur and impact crust models. In\nparticular, we identify a new type of reaction cycle that brings a pair of\nnuclei across the nuclear chart into equilibrium via alternating neutron\ncapture and neutron release, interspersed with a neutron transfer. While\nneutron transfer reactions lead to changes in crust model predictions, and need\nto be considered in future studies, previous conclusions concerning heating,\ncooling, and compositional evolution are remarkably robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

It exhibited unique quasi-soft X-ray spectra of characteristic\ntemperature $kT\\sim0.3$ keV for several years at the peak, but in a recent\nChandra observation (10 yrs into the outburst) a super-soft X-ray spectrum of\n$kT\\sim0.15$ keV was detected. Such dramatic spectral softening could signal\nthe transition from the super-Eddington to thermal state or the temporary\npresence of a warm absorber. Here we report on our study of four new XMM-Newton\nfollow-up observations of the source. We found that they all showed super-soft\nspectra, suggesting that the source had remained super-soft for $>5$ yrs. Then\nits spectral change is best explained as due to the super-Eddington to thermal\nspectral state transition. The fits to the thermal state spectra suggested a\nsmaller absorption toward the source than that obtained in Lin et al.

However, the ubiquitous viscoplasticity and associated wall\nslip behavior of hydrogels handicap the accurate characterization of their\nrheological material functions. Here parallel-disk and cone-and-plate\nviscometers were used to characterize the shear viscosity and wall slip\nbehavior of a crosslinked poly(acrylic acid), PAA, hydrogel (carbomer,\nspecifically Carbopol). It is demonstrated that parallel-disk viscometry, i.e.,\nthe steady torsional flow in between two parallel disks, but not the\ncone-and-plate flow can be used to determine the yield stress and other\nparameters of viscoplastic constitutive equations and wall slip behavior\nunambiguously.

In a series of recent inspiring papers Alt, Ducatez, and Knowles have\nrigorously shown that these systems exhibit a \"semilocalized\" phase in the\ntails of the spectrum where the eigenvectors are exponentially localized on a\nsub-extensive set of nodes with anomalously large degree. We propose two\napproximate analytical strategies to analyze this regime based respectively on\nthe simple \"rules of thumb\" for localization and ergodicity and on an\napproximate treatment of the self-consistent cavity equation for the resolvent.\nBoth approaches suggest the existence of two different regimes: a fully\nAnderson localized phase at the spectral edges, in which the eigenvectors are\nlocalized around a unique center, and an intermediate partially delocalized but\nnon-ergodic phase, where the eigenvectors spread over many resonant\nlocalization centers. In this phase the exponential decay of the effective\ntunneling amplitudes between the localization centers is counterbalanced by the\nlarge number of nodes towards which tunneling can occur, and the system\nexhibits mini-bands in the local spectrum over which the Wigner-Dyson\nstatistics establishes.

There is increasing interest in the field as\nthe deployment of self-operating vehicles promises safer and more ecologically\nfriendly transportation systems. With the rise of computationally powerful\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques, autonomous vehicles can sense their\nenvironment with high precision, make safe real-time decisions, and operate\nreliably without human intervention. However, intelligent decision-making in\nautonomous cars is not generally understandable by humans in the current state\nof the art, and such deficiency hinders this technology from being socially\nacceptable. Hence, aside from making safe real-time decisions, the AI systems\nof autonomous vehicles also need to explain how their decisions are constructed\nin order to be regulatory compliant across many jurisdictions. Our study sheds\ncomprehensive light on the development of explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI) approaches for autonomous vehicles. In particular, we make the following\ncontributions. First, we provide a thorough overview of the state-of-the-art\nstudies on XAI for autonomous driving.

The light yield and\nwavelength spectra of these materials were characterized by exciting the sample\nwith 285 nm UV light which acted as a proxy for Cherenkov light in the\ndetector. Spectral measurements indicate at least part of the fluorescence of\nthe acrylic is due to additives. Time-resolved measurements show the light\nyields of our acrylic sample, TPB sample, and the relative light between both\nsamples, all increase when cooling down. At room temperature, the light yield\nof our acrylic sample relative to the TPB sample is 0.3 %, while it reaches 0.5\n% at 4 K. The main fluorescence time constant of the acrylic is less than a few\nnanoseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 23:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Rotational instability is considered to induce the observed activities.\nIf this is the case, because Gaults breakup event has not been detected,\nsurface failure is likely, implying its surface materials are constantly\nejected while its major body remains intact. Given this scenario, we first\nconstrain Gaults bulk cohesive strength. We then characterize heliocentric\ntrajectories of ejected particles over thousands of years. The results show\nthat Gault may be sensitive to structural failure at the current spin period (~\n2.5 hr). Gaults bulk density needs to be below 1.75 g/cm^3 in order for\nparticles on the equatorial surface to be shed due to centrifugal forces. In\nthis case, Gault requires cohesive strength of at least ~ 200 Pa to maintain\nthe structure at the center, whereas the surface strength needs to be less than\n~ 100 Pa to induce mass shedding. This suggests that Gaults structure may\nconsist of a weak surface layer atop a strong core. The trajectories of dust\nejected from Gault depend on how efficiently they are accelerated by solar\nradiation pressure. Escaped particle clouds with sizes on the order of 100\nmicrometers could collide with Gault after about 700 to 5300 years with speeds\nof ~ 0.2 km/sec. This implies a temporal increase in the impact flux and\ncomplex interactions between the ejected particles and their host body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 23:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Unfortunately, power-gates increase the\nsystem's power-delivery impedance and voltage guardband, limiting the system's\nmaximum attainable voltage (i.e., Vmax) and, thus, the CPU core's maximum\nattainable frequency (i.e., Fmax). As a result, systems that are performance\nconstrained by the CPU frequency (i.e., Fmax-constrained), such as high-end\ndesktops, suffer significant performance loss due to power-gates.\n  To mitigate this performance loss, we propose DarkGates, a hybrid system\narchitecture that increases the performance of Fmax-constrained systems while\nfulfilling their power efficiency requirements. DarkGates is based on three key\ntechniques: i) bypassing on-chip power-gates using package-level resources\n(called bypass mode), ii) extending power management firmware to support\noperation either in bypass mode or normal mode, and iii) introducing deeper\nidle power states.\n  We implement DarkGates on an Intel Skylake microprocessor for client devices\nand evaluate it using a wide variety of workloads.

Carbon\nfiber prepregs are aged at 0x, 1x, 2x, and 3x the out life in an environmental\nchamber at constant temperature and humidity. Degree of cure is measured via\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) while tension, compression, and shear\ntests are performed to investigate the effects that aging has on these\nmechanical properties. For the first time, Mode I intra-laminar fracture and\nits size effect are also investigated by means of fracture tests on\ngeometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens.\n  From the tension, compression, and shear experiments it is seen that the out\ntime has no effect on the elastic moduli. However, the strength increases with\nincreasing age of the specimens for all the loading conditions. The percent\nincrease compared to the non-aged material ranges from 15% to 33%. This is\nlikely caused by plasticization of the matrix with age, allowing for higher\nenergy absorption.\n  More complex trends are reported for the SENT specimens for all the sizes. It\nis found that the fracture energy and characteristic length initially decrease\nwith age, and then finally increase for the longest out time. This trend is\nowed to two factors with countering effects on the fracture behavior: 1) the\nincrease of the average number of platelets with increasing aging due to\nincrease in resin viscosity, and 2) the plasticization of the matrix with\naging.\n  The results from this study suggest that Discontinuous Fiber Composites\n(DFCs) made from reused materials can have equal, if not better, performance\nthan non-aged DFCs.

We\nargue that diversity alone is not sufficient and that the characteristics of\nthe training data need to be adapted to those of the new dataset such as camera\nviewpoint, position, human actions, and body size. To this end, we propose\nAdaptPose, an end-to-end framework that generates synthetic 3D human motions\nfrom a source dataset and uses them to fine-tune a 3D pose estimator. AdaptPose\nfollows an adversarial training scheme. From a source 3D pose the generator\ngenerates a sequence of 3D poses and a camera orientation that is used to\nproject the generated poses to a novel view.

However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference\nGCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world\ngraphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN\ngraphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse.\nFurthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution\nand therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in\nprohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus\nsubstantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed\nGCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost\nGCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD\nintegrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs\nto be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the\nmodel accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely\ntwo levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of\nacceleration.

In edge or on-premise clouds, cold-start\nrightsizing the cluster at the time of installation is crucial in avoiding the\nrecurrent capital expenditure. In both these cases, rightsizing has to balance\ncost-performance trade-off for a given application with multiple tasks, where\neach task can demand multiple resources, and the cloud offers nodes with\ndifferent capacity and cost. Multidimensional bin-packing can address this\ncold-start rightsizing problem, but assumes that every task is always active.\nIn contrast, real-world tasks (e.g. load bursts, batch and dead-lined tasks\nwith time-limits) may be active only during specific time-periods or may have\ndynamic load profiles. The cluster cost can be reduced by reusing resources via\ntime sharing and optimal packing. This motivates our generalized problem of\ncold-start rightsizing for time-limited tasks: given a timeline, time-periods\nand resource demands for tasks, the objective is to place the tasks on a\nminimum cost cluster of nodes without violating node capacities at any time\ninstance. We design a baseline two-phase algorithm that performs penalty-based\nmapping of task to node-type and then, solves each node-type independently. We\nprove that the algorithm has an approximation ratio of O(D min(m, T)), where D,\nm and T are the number of resources, node-types and timeslots, respectively. We\nthen present an improved linear programming based mapping strategy, enhanced\nfurther with a cross-node-type filling mechanism. Our experiments on synthetic\nand real-world cluster traces show significant cost reduction by LP-based\nmapping compared to the baseline, and the filling mechanism improves further to\nproduce solutions within 20% of (a lower-bound to) the optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

The algorithm is\nbased on the complex behavior of a high-dimensional dynamical system and is\ninspired by the maximum entropy principle of statistical inference. In this\npaper, we propose an extension of the herding algorithm, called entropic\nherding, which generates a sequence of distributions instead of points.\nEntropic herding is derived as the optimization of the target function obtained\nfrom the maximum entropy principle. Using the proposed entropic herding\nalgorithm as a framework, we discuss a closer connection between herding and\nthe maximum entropy principle. Specifically, we interpret the original herding\nalgorithm as a tractable version of entropic herding, the ideal output\ndistribution of which is mathematically represented. We further discuss how the\ncomplex behavior of the herding algorithm contributes to optimization. We argue\nthat the proposed entropic herding algorithm extends the application of herding\nto probabilistic modeling. In contrast to original herding, entropic herding\ncan generate a smooth distribution such that both efficient probability density\ncalculation and sample generation become possible.

The\ntechnique is similar to conditional sampling in statistical contexts, but the\nintention is different: in conditional sampling the aim is to reduce the\nvariance, rather than to achieve smoothness. Preintegration involves an initial\nintegration with respect to one well chosen real-valued variable. Griebel, Kuo,\nSloan [Math.

Instead, norm internalizers, by\npolarizing, catalyzing, and stabilizing cooperation, can increase levels of\ncooperation of other agent types, while only making up a minority of the\npopulation themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 04:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 20:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 21:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 04:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The main\nobstacle of this problem is the degeneracies in the space of coefficients: a\ngiven SMEFT truncated at a finite dimension can be mapped to infinitely many UV\ntheories. We discuss these degeneracies at the dimension-8 level, and show that\npositivity bounds play a crucial role in the inverse problem. In particular,\nthe degeneracies either vanish or become significantly limited for SMEFTs that\nlive on or close to the positivity bounds. The UV particles of these SMEFTs,\nand their properties such as spin, charge, other quantum numbers, and\ninteractions with the SM particles, can often be uniquely determined, assuming\ndimension-8 coefficients are measured. The allowed region for SMEFTs, which\nforms a convex cone, can be systematically constructed by enumerating its\ngenerators. We show that a geometric notion, extremality, conveniently connects\nthe positivity problem with the inverse problem. We discuss the implications of\na SMEFT living on an extremal ray, on a $k$-face, and on the vertex of the\npositive cone. We also show that the information of the dimension-8\ncoefficients can be used to set exclusion limits on all individual UV states\nthat interact with the SM, independent of specific model assumptions.

The local\npermutation test determines the significance of a test statistic by locally\nshuffling samples which share similar values of the conditioning variables $Z$,\nand it forms a natural extension of the usual permutation approach for\nunconditional independence testing. Despite its simplicity and empirical\nsupport, the theoretical underpinnings of the local permutation test remain\nunclear. Motivated by this gap, this paper aims to establish theoretical\nfoundations of local permutation tests with a particular focus on binning-based\nstatistics. We start by revisiting the hardness of conditional independence\ntesting and provide an upper bound for the power of any valid conditional\nindependence test, which holds when the probability of observing collisions in\n$Z$ is small. This negative result naturally motivates us to impose additional\nrestrictions on the possible distributions under the null and alternate. To\nthis end, we focus our attention on certain classes of smooth distributions and\nidentify provably tight conditions under which the local permutation method is\nuniversally valid, i.e. it is valid when applied to any (binning-based) test\nstatistic. To complement this result on type I error control, we also show that\nin some cases, a binning-based statistic calibrated via the local permutation\nmethod can achieve minimax optimal power. We also introduce a double-binning\npermutation strategy, which yields a valid test over less smooth null\ndistributions than the typical single-binning method without compromising much\npower.

Further, the possibility of extending\nthis model to monitor natural corrosion is discussed with required\nmodifications. Unlike previous studies, pore saturation (PS) is continuously\nmonitored and its existing experimental correlations with electrolyte\nconductivity and oxygen diffusivity in the vicinity of partial corrosion are\nadopted so that the model can be extended to simulate natural corrosion.

Here we establish that `internal' loops within a modified-ring\npolymer architecture enhances entropic repulsion between two overlapping\npolymers confined in a cylinder. Moreover it also induces entropy-driven\nspatial organization of polymer segments as seen in-vivo. To that end, we\ndesign polymers of different architectures in our simulations, by introducing a\nminimal number of cross-links between particular monomers along the chain\ncontour. This helps us to identify the underlying mechanisms which lead to\nfaster segregation of spatially overlapping polymers as well as localization of\nspecific polymer segments. The observed segregation dynamics of overlapping\npolymers is aided in our simulations by the frequent release of topological\nconstraints, implemented by allowing chains to cross each at regular intervals.\nAdditionally, we compare the segregation dynamics timescales with that of\nself-avoiding polymers and thereby highlight the significance of Topoisomerase\nin biological systems where DNA-strands are allowed to occasionally pass\nthrough each other.

Predicting\nenergy band alignment at the interfaces is crucial for their design, but\nrepresents a challenging problem due to the large scales of the system, the\nenergy precision required and a wide range of physical phenomena that occur at\nthe interface. To tackle this problem, we use many-body perturbation theory in\nthe non-self-consistent GW approximation, orbital relaxation corrections for\norganic semiconductors, and line-up potential method for inorganic\nsemiconductors which allows for tractable and accurate computing of energy band\nalignment in crystalline van-der-Waals hybrid inorganic-organic semiconductor\ninterfaces. In this work, we study crystalline tetracene physisorbed on the\nclean hydrogen-passivated 1x2 reconstructed (100) silicon surface. Using this\ncomputational approach, we find that the energy band alignment is determined by\nan interplay of the mutual dynamic dielectric screening of two materials and\nthe formation of a dipole layer due to a weak hybridization of atomic/molecular\norbitals at the interface. We also emphasize the significant role of the\nexchange-correlation effects in predicting band offsets for the hybrid\ninorganic-organic semiconductor interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 07:57:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 04:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Methods such as factor\nanalysis and principal component analysis have the downside of not offering\nmuch interpretability of its inferred latent variables.

Sparse factor analysis has been used in a wide range of areas\nincluding genomics, signal processing, and economics. We compare two Bayesian\ninference techniques for sparse factor analysis, namely Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC), and variational inference (VI). VI is computationally faster than\nMCMC, at the cost of a loss in accuracy. We derive MCMC and VI algorithms and\nperform a comparison using both simulated and biological data, demonstrating\nthat the higher computational efficiency of VI is desirable over the small gain\nin accuracy when using MCMC.

However, the local optimality in existing works is often\nestimated inaccurately or using an unreasonable assumption, limiting its\ncapability in steganalysis. In this paper, we propose to estimate the local\noptimality in a more reasonable and comprehensive fashion, and generalize the\nconcept of local optimality in two aspects. First, the local optimality\nmeasured in a rate-distortion sense is jointly determined by MV and predicted\nmotion vector (PMV), and the variability of PMV will affect the estimation for\nlocal optimality. Hence we generalize the local optimality from a static\nestimation to a dynamic one. Second, the PMV is a special case of MV, and can\nalso reflect the embedding traces in MVs. So we generalize the local optimality\nfrom the MV domain to the PMV domain. Based on the two generalizations of local\noptimality, we construct new types of steganalytic features and also propose\nfeature symmetrization rules to reduce feature dimension. Extensive experiments\nperformed on three databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nfeatures, which achieve state-of-the-art in both accuracy and robustness in\nvarious conditions, including cover source mismatch, video prediction methods,\nvideo codecs, and video resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 08:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

In the process, we\nextend existing balance analyses to the contrastive margin loss, include batch\nsize in the balance, and explain how to aggregate loss elements from the batch\nto maintain near-optimal performance over a larger range of batch sizes.\nExtensive experiments with benchmarks from deep metric learning and\nself-supervised learning show that optimal hyper-parameters are found faster\nwith our method than with other common search methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 09:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

To address this problem, we propose a two-stage\nstep-by-step learning framework to localize and recognize sounding objects in\ncomplex audiovisual scenarios using only the correspondence between audio and\nvision. First, we propose to determine the sounding area via coarse-grained\naudiovisual correspondence in the single source cases.

The\npurpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the world of Bayesian model\ndetermination, by surveying modern shrinkage and variable selection algorithms\nand methodologies. Bayesian inference is a natural probabilistic framework for\nquantifying uncertainty and learning about model parameters, and this feature\nis particularly important for inference in modern models of high dimensions and\nincreased complexity.\n  We begin with a linear regression setting in order to introduce various\nclasses of priors that lead to shrinkage/sparse estimators of comparable value\nto popular penalized likelihood estimators (e.g.\\ ridge, lasso).

Finally, we explore how priors developed for the simple regression\nsetting can be extended in a straightforward way to various classes of\ninteresting econometric models.

The permeability range for 12,000\nrealizations of a random porous structure is examined using a\nrecently-developed modelling approach, which results in up to two orders of\nmagnitude permeability variations in low porosities. These findings are\ncompared with previous results for 13,000 realizations with a scaled-down size,\nand it is shown that the permeability histogram does not converge towards a\nnarrower spectrum using larger domain sizes. The similarity between advective\ntransport in an ensemble of porous media and a random walk phenomenon, accepted\nin the literature, is revisited and the inadequacy of the assumptions employed\nis discussed. It is shown that the conventional definition of advective\ntransport in a porous medium, which is generally assumed to follow Hadamard's\ndefinition of well-posedness, cannot be realised. The reconstruction of a\nporous structure from macroscopic parameters is in itself an ill-posed inverse\nproblem. To clarify this issue, explaining the ontic and epistemic\nidentifications of a porous medium, it is discussed that while ontic\nidentification cannot be employed for transport analysis, epistemic\nidentification leads to non-unique solutions. It is finally suggested that a\nparadigm shift is required for better formulation of the transport\ncharacteristics of porous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 09:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

However, affected by the complexity of indoor\nenvironments, it is still highly challenging to achieve continuous and reliable\nindoor positioning. Currently, 5G cellular networks are being deployed\nworldwide, the new technologies of which have brought the approaches for\nimproving the performance of wireless indoor positioning. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the indoor positioning under the 5G new radio (NR), which has been\nstandardized and being commercially operated in massive markets. Specifically,\na solution is proposed and a software defined receiver (SDR) is developed for\nindoor positioning. With our SDR indoor positioning system, the 5G NR signals\nare firstly sampled by universal software radio peripheral (USRP), and then,\ncoarse synchronization is achieved via detecting the start of the\nsynchronization signal block (SSB). Then, with the assistance of the pilots\ntransmitted on the physical broadcasting channel (PBCH), multipath acquisition\nand delay tracking are sequentially carried out to estimate the time of arrival\n(ToA) of received signals. Furthermore, to improve the ToA ranging accuracy,\nthe carrier phase of the first arrived path is estimated. Finally, to quantify\nthe accuracy of our ToA estimation method, indoor field tests are carried out\nin an office environment, where a 5G NR base station (known as gNB) is\ninstalled for commercial use. Our test results show that, in the static test\nscenarios, the ToA accuracy measured by the 1-{\\sigma} error interval is about\n0.5 m, while in the pedestrian mobile environment, the probability of range\naccuracy within 0.8 m is 95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 10:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Previous CRS assumes\nthat the user has a clear target item. However, for many users who resort to\nCRS, they might not have a clear idea about what they really like.\nSpecifically, the user may have a clear single preference for some attribute\ntypes (e.g. color) of items, while for other attribute types, the user may have\nmultiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple\nacceptable attribute instances (e.g. black and red) of one attribute type.\nTherefore, the users could show their preferences over items under multiple\ncombinations of attribute instances rather than a single item with unique\ncombination of all attribute instances. As a result, we first propose a more\nrealistic CRS learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round\nConversational Recommendation, where users may have multiple interests in\nattribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially\noverlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with the\nnew CRS learning setting, in this paper, we propose a novel learning framework\nnamely, Multi-Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning . In order\nto obtain user preferences more efficiently, the agent generates multi-choice\nquestions rather than binary yes/no ones on specific attribute instance.\nBesides, we propose a union set strategy to select candidate items instead of\nexisting intersection set strategy in order to overcome over-filtering items\nduring the conversation. Finally, we design a Multi-Interest Policy Learning\nmodule, which utilizes captured multiple interests of the user to decide next\naction, either asking attribute instances or recommending items.

With the convolutional neural networks showing strong capability\nin computer vision tasks, the performance of image denoising has also been\nbrought up by CNN based methods. Though CNN based image denoisers show\npromising results on this task, most of the current CNN based methods try to\nlearn the mapping from noisy image to clean image directly, which lacks the\nexplicit exploration of prior knowledge of images and noises. Natural images\nare observed to obey the reciprocal power law, implying the low-frequency band\nof image tend to occupy most of the energy. Thus in the condition of AGWN\n(additive gaussian white noise) deterioration, low-frequency band tend to\npreserve a higher PSNR than high-frequency band. Considering the spatial\nmorphological consistency of different frequency bands, low-frequency band with\nmore fidelity can be used as a guidance to refine the more contaminated\nhigh-frequency bands. Based on this thought, we proposed a novel network\narchitecture denoted as IGNet, in order to refine the frequency bands from low\nto high in a progressive manner. Firstly, it decomposes the feature maps into\nhigh- and low-frequency subbands using DWT (discrete wavelet transform)\niteratively, and then each low band features are used to refine the high band\nfeatures. Finally, the refined feature maps are processed by a decoder to\nrecover the clean result. With this design, more inter-frequency prior and\ninformation are utilized, thus the model size can be lightened while still\nperserves competitive results. Experiments on several public datasets show that\nour model obtains competitive performance comparing with other state-of-the-art\nmethods yet with a lightweight structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 10:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Assuming $\\mathsf{CT}$ and countable\nchoice invalidates the law of excluded middle, thereby also invalidating\nclassical intuitions prevalent in textbooks on computability. On the other\nhand, results like Rice's theorem are not provable without a form of choice. In\ncontrast to existing work, we base our investigations in constructive type\ntheory with a separate, impredicative universe of propositions where countable\nchoice does not hold and thus a priori $\\mathsf{CT}_{\\phi}$ and the law of\nexcluded middle seem to be consistent. We introduce various parametric\nstrengthenings of $\\mathsf{CT}_{\\phi}$, which are equivalent to assuming\n$\\mathsf{CT}_\\phi$ and an $S^m_n$ operator for $\\phi$ like in the $S^m_n$\ntheorem. The strengthened axioms allow developing synthetic computability\ntheory without choice, as demonstrated by elegant synthetic proofs of Rice's\ntheorem. Moreover, they seem to be not in conflict with classical intuitions\nsince they are consequences of the traditional analytic form of $\\mathsf{CT}$.\n  Besides explaining the novel axioms and proofs of Rice's theorem we\ncontribute machine-checked proofs of all results in the Coq proof assistant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 10:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

The decoder uses a\nbi-directional LSTM architecture along with a signal to noise ratio (SNR)-aware\nattention NN to decode the message. The proposed code overcomes two major\nshortcomings of the previously proposed DNN-based codes over channels with\npassive output feedback: (i) the SNR-aware attention mechanism at the decoder\nenables reliable application of the same trained NN over a wide range of SNR\nvalues; (ii) curriculum training with batch-size scheduling is used to speed up\nand stabilize training while improving the SNR-robustness of the resulting\ncode.

However, it reflects with different\nstrength in their profiles, which is observed as different widths of the wing\ncomponents. The strongest outflow signature is observed in the [O III] lines,\nwhich have the broadest wing components, weaker in Halpha and [N II], and the\nweakest in [S II]. These results imply that considered lines arise in different\nparts of an outflowing region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 11:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

While our naked eyes are able to\nextract contextual information almost instantly, even from far away, image\nresolution and computational resources limitations make detecting smaller\nobjects (that is, objects that occupy a small pixel area in the input image) a\ngenuinely challenging task for machines and a wide-open research field. This\nstudy explores how the popular YOLOv5 object detector can be modified to\nimprove its performance in detecting smaller objects, with a particular\napplication in autonomous racing. To achieve this, we investigate how replacing\ncertain structural elements of the model (as well as their connections and\nother parameters) can affect performance and inference time. In doing so, we\npropose a series of models at different scales, which we name `YOLO-Z', and\nwhich display an improvement of up to 6.9% in mAP when detecting smaller\nobjects at 50% IOU, at the cost of just a 3ms increase in inference time\ncompared to the original YOLOv5. Our objective is to inform future research on\nthe potential of adjusting a popular detector such as YOLOv5 to address\nspecific tasks and provide insights on how specific changes can impact small\nobject detection.

A celebrated result by Jain [Combinatorica'01] provides a\n2-approximation for a wide class of these problems. However nothing better is\nknown even for very basic special cases, raising the natural question whether\nany improved approximation factor is possible at all.\n  In this paper we address one of the most basic problems in this family for\nwhich 2 is still the best-known approximation factor, the Forest Augmentation\nProblem (FAP): given an undirected unweighted graph (that w.l.o.g. is a forest)\nand a collection of extra edges (links), compute a minimum cardinality subset\nof links whose addition to the graph makes it 2-edge-connected. Several\nbetter-than-2 approximation algorithms are known for the special case where the\ninput graph is a tree, a.k.a. the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP). Recently\nthis was achieved also for the weighted version of TAP, and for the\nk-edge-connectivity generalization of TAP. These results heavily exploit the\nfact that the input graph is connected, a condition that does not hold in FAP.\n  In this paper we breach the 2-approximation barrier for FAP. Our result is\nbased on two main ingredients. First, we describe a reduction to the Path\nAugmentation Problem (PAP), the special case of FAP where the input graph is a\ncollection of disjoint paths. Our reduction is not approximation preserving,\nhowever it is sufficiently accurate to improve on a factor 2 approximation.\nSecond, we present a better-than-2 approximation algorithm for PAP, an open\nproblem on its own. Here we exploit a novel notion of implicit credits which\nmight turn out to be helpful in future related work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 11:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

In this model,\nonline algorithms are supplied with future predictions, and the goal is for the\ncompetitive ratio to smoothly interpolate between the best offline and online\nbounds as a function of the prediction error. In this paper, we study online\ngraph problems with predictions. Our contributions are the following:\n  * The first question is defining prediction error. For graph/metric problems,\nthere can be two types of error, locations that are not predicted, and\nlocations that are predicted but the predicted and actual locations do not\ncoincide exactly.

Early\nand accurate detection of brain metastases is very essential for treatment\nplanning and prognosis in radiation therapy. To improve brain metastasis\ndetection performance with deep learning, a custom detection loss called\nvolume-level sensitivity-specificity (VSS) is proposed, which rates individual\nmetastasis detection sensitivity and specificity in (sub-)volume levels. As\nsensitivity and precision are always a trade-off in a metastasis level, either\na high sensitivity or a high precision can be achieved by adjusting the weights\nin the VSS loss without decline in dice score coefficient for segmented\nmetastases. To reduce metastasis-like structures being detected as false\npositive metastases, a temporal prior volume is proposed as an additional input\nof DeepMedic. The modified network is called DeepMedic+ for distinction. Our\nproposed VSS loss improves the sensitivity of brain metastasis detection for\nDeepMedic, increasing the sensitivity from 85.3% to 97.5%. Alternatively, it\nimproves the precision from 69.1% to 98.7%. Comparing DeepMedic+ with DeepMedic\nwith the same VSS loss, 44.4% of the false positive metastases are reduced in\nthe high sensitivity model and the precision reaches 99.6% for the high\nspecificity model.

To bridge this gap, we present\nthe first systematic large-scale analysis of how readers browse Wikipedia.\nUsing billions of page requests from Wikipedia's server logs, we measure how\nreaders reach articles, how they transition between articles, and how these\npatterns combine into more complex navigation paths. We find that navigation\nbehavior is characterized by highly diverse structures. Although most\nnavigation paths are shallow, comprising a single pageload, there is much\nvariety, and the depth and shape of paths vary systematically with topic,\ndevice type, and time of day. We show that Wikipedia navigation paths commonly\nmesh with external pages as part of a larger online ecosystem, and we describe\nhow naturally occurring navigation paths are distinct from targeted navigation\nin lab-based settings. Our results further suggest that navigation is abandoned\nwhen readers reach low-quality pages. Taken together, these insights contribute\nto a more systematic understanding of readers' information needs and allow for\nimproving their experience on Wikipedia and the Web in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 12:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 12:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

We consider a topological superconductor (TSC) hosting two Majorana bound\nstates at its boundary ($n$ side). Within an effective low-energy model, the\nMBSs are coherently tunnel-coupled to a spin-split electron level on the QD\nwhich is placed close to one of the MBSs. Holes on the QD are tunnel-coupled to\na normal conducting reservoir ($p$ side). Via electron-hole recombination,\nphotons in the optical range are emitted, which have direct information on the\nMBS-properties through the recombined electrons. Using a master equation\napproach, we calculate the polarization-resolved photon emission intensities\n(PEIs). In the weak coupling regime between MBSs and QD, we find an analytical\nexpression for the PEI which allows to clearly distinguish the cases of well\nseparated MBSs at zero energy from overlapping MBSs. For separated MBSs, the\nMajorana spinor-polarization is given by the relative widths of the two PEI\npeaks associated with the two spin states on the QD. For overlapping MBSs, a\ncoupling to the distant (nonlocal) MBS causes a shift of the emission peaks.\nAdditionally, we show that quasiparticle poisoning (QP) influences the PEI\ndrastically and changes its shot noise from super-Poissonian to sub-Poissonian.\nIn the strong coupling regime, more resonances emerge in the PEI due to\nspin-mixing effects. Finally, we comment on how our proposal could be\nimplemented using a Majorana nanowire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 13:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 15:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel font generation method that learns localized styles, namely\ncomponent-wise style representations, instead of universal styles. The proposed\nstyle representations enable the synthesis of complex local details in text\ndesigns. However, learning component-wise styles solely from a few reference\nglyphs is infeasible when a target script has a large number of components, for\nexample, over 200 for Chinese. To reduce the number of required reference\nglyphs, we represent component-wise styles by a product of component and style\nfactors, inspired by low-rank matrix factorization. Owing to the combination of\nstrong representation and a compact factorization strategy, our method shows\nremarkably better few-shot font generation results (with only eight reference\nglyphs) than other state-of-the-art methods.

Given a directed graph with non-negative edge weights, our\ngoal is to compute a shortest path from a given source node to any of several\ntarget nodes. Basically, our idea is to equip an adapted version of Dijkstras\nalgorithm with machine learning predictions to solve this problem: Based on the\ntrace of the algorithm, we design a neural network that predicts the shortest\npath distance after a few iterations. The prediction is then used to prune the\nsearch space explored by Dijkstras algorithm, which may significantly reduce\nthe number of operations on the underlying priority queue. We note that our\nalgorithm works independently of the specific method that is used to arrive at\nsuch predictions. Crucially, we require that our algorithm always computes an\noptimal solution (independently of the accuracy of the prediction) and provides\na certificate of optimality. As we show, in the worst-case this might force our\nalgorithm to use the same number of queue operations as Dijkstras algorithm,\neven if the prediction is correct.

We derive structural\ninsights that allow us to lower bound these savings on partial random\ninstances. In these instances, an adversary can fix the instance arbitrarily\nexcept for the weights of a subset of relevant edges, which are chosen\nrandomly. Our bound shows that the number of relevant edges which are pruned\nincreases as the prediction error decreases.

We expect these findings to further\nstimulate experimental research on the design and optimization of\nsuperinductors for a better performance and miniaturization of quantum devices\nsuch as qubits circuits and microwave detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 15:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

While this field\ncanonically considers a single agent, the situation where multiple agents, or\neven an infinite amount of agents are contracted by a principal are growing in\nprominence and pose interesting and realistic problems. Here, agents form a\nNash equilibrium among themselves, and a Stackelberg equilibrium between\nthemselves as a collective and the principal.\n  We apply this framework to the problem of implementing Renewable Energy\nCertificate (REC) markets, where the principal requires regulated firms (power\ngenerators) to pay a non-compliance penalty which is inversely proportional to\nthe amount of RECs they have. RECs can be obtained by generating electricity\nfrom clean sources or purchasing on the market.

We confirm the fine-structure lines\nof [MgIV]4.49um and [ArVI]4.53um as good BHA rate tracers for the 1<z<3 range,\nand we propose the [NeVI]7.65um line as the best tracer for redshifts of z<1.5.\nWe suggest the use of the [ArII]6.98um and [ArIII]8.99um lines to measure the\nSF rate, for z<3 and z<2. At higher redshifts, the PAH features at 6.2um and\n7.7um can be observed at z<3 and z<2.7 respectively. Rest-frame far-IR\nspectroscopy is currently being collected in high redshift galaxies (z>3) with\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We confirm that the [CII]158um line is a\ngood tracer of the SF rate and can in most cases (0.9<z<2 and 3<z<9) be\nobserved, and we propose the use of the combination of [OIII]88um and [OI]145um\nlines as an alternative SF rate tracer, that can be detected above z>3. We\nconclude, however, that the current and foreseen facilities will not be able to\ncover properly the peak of the obscured SF and BHA activities at the Cosmic\nNoon of galaxy evolution and a new IR space telescope, actively cooled to\nobtain very good sensitivities, covering the full IR spectral range from about\n10um to 300um, will be needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 15:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 10:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

We made\nuse of public and private photometry to select the stars to be observed with\nFLAMES.

We collected spectra for 62 confirmed OCs (a few more were\ntaken from the ESO archive). Among them are very young clusters, where the main\ntargets are pre-main sequence stars, clusters with very hot and massive stars\ncurrently on the main sequence, intermediate-age and old clusters where evolved\nstars are the main targets. The selection of targets was as inclusive and\nunbiased as possible and we observed a representative fraction of all possible\ntargets, thus collecting the largest, most accurate, and most homogeneous\nspectroscopic data set on ever achieved.

For a\nlong time, frequent visits to customers were required because they could not\ndetermine the amount of remaining gas without a staff visit and observation. To\nsolve this problem, smart meters are started to be employed to acquire gas\nconsumption more frequently without visiting customers. In this study, we\nconstruct a system to optimize plans for cylinder replacement, and evaluate it\nwith a large-scale field test. We propose an algorithm to create a replacement\nplan with three steps: estimating the replacement date, acquiring the customer\nlist for replacement, and determining the delivery route. A more accurate\nestimation of the replacement date can be acquired with a smart meter, which is\nused for making a customer list for replacement. The formulation for making a\ncustomer list enables the gas provider to replace cylinders some days before\nthe date when the gas would run out. It can suppress the concentration of\nreplacements on certain days. Large-scale verification experiments were\nperformed with more than 1,000 customers in Chiba prefecture in Japan.

Statistical\nmechanics of point particles in an unbounded perfect gas is commonly accepted\nas a foundation for understanding many systems, including liquids like the\nconcentrated salt solutions of life and electrochemical technology, from\nbatteries to nanodevices. Liquids, however, are not gases. Liquids are filled\nwith interacting molecules and so the model of a perfect gas is imperfect. Here\nwe show that statistical mechanics without bounds (in space) is impossible as\nwell as imperfect, if the molecules interact as charged particles, as nearly\nall atoms do. The behavior of charged particles is not defined until boundary\nstructures and values are defined because charges are governed by the Maxwell\npartial differential equations. Partial differential equations require boundary\nconditions to be computable or well defined. The Maxwell equations require\nboundary conditions on finite sized spatial boundaries (i.e., structures).\nBoundary conditions cannot be defined 'at infinity' in a general (i.e., unique)\nway because the limiting process that defines infinity includes such a wide\nvariety of behavior, from light waves that never decay, to fields from dipole\nand multipolar charges that decay steeply, to Coulomb fields that decay but not\nso steeply. Statistical mechanics involving charges thus involves spatial\nboundaries and boundary conditions of finite size. Nearly all matter involves\ncharges, thus nearly all statistical mechanics requires structures and boundary\nconditions on those structures. Boundaries and boundary conditions are not\nprominent in classical statistical mechanics. Including boundaries is a\nchallenge to mathematicians. Statistical mechanics must describe bounded\nsystems if it is to provide a proper foundation for studying matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Ever since G\\\"{o}del's and Cohen's\nproofs that the ZFC cannot be used to disprove or approve continuum hypothesis,\ni.e., that it is independent of the ZFC axioms there are efforts of adding at\nleast one new axiom to ZFC that should illuminate the structure of infinite\nsets. The two main contenders for addition to ZFC are the inner-model axiom\n'V-ultimate L' that builds a universe of sets from the ground up and Martin's\naxiom that allows to expand it outward in all directions. If Martin's axiom is\ncorrect, then the continuum hypothesis is false, and if the inner-model axiom\nis right, then the continuum hypothesis is true. That model dependent view is\nunderlined with the L\\\"{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem, no theory can have only\nnondenumerable models; if a theory has a nondenumerable model, it must have\ndenumerably infinite ones as well. Accepting axiomatization in whatever shape\nmeans the notions 'denumerable' and 'nondenumerable' turn out to be relative\nand it requires to accept the relativization of cardinals as it is first\npointed out by Skolem and Carnap. To show the impact of axiomatization\nconsidered will be as an example a set created by a successive generation of\nalgebraic pairs, each filled with a single transcendental number, and examined\nwill be the impact of the axiom of choice on the determining the property of\nsuch set. It will be shown that the given example supports the\nL\\\"{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem. To underline the uncertainty implied by that\ntheorem considered will be Wagner's $\\Sigma$ model that generates a set in a\nconstructive way, different from ZF. For the first time, provided will be an\nexplicit example that satisfies Wagner's model.

In this representation, each\ntoroidal field line lies entirely in a surface, which is named a toroidal field\nsurface. The poloidal field is represented by the curl of another toroidal\nfield and it threads a stack of toroidal field surfaces. If the toroidal field\nsurfaces are either spheres or planes, the poloidal-toroidal (PT)\nrepresentation is known to have a special property that the curl of a poloidal\nfield is again a toroidal field . We name a PT representation with this\nproperty a standard PT representation while one without the property is called\na generalized PT representation. In this paper, we have addressed the question\nwhether there are other toroidal field surfaces allowing a standard PT\nrepresentation than spheres and planes.

It has been widely used when analysts\nperform security analysis on software (systems) whose source code is\nunavailable, such as vulnerability search and malware analysis. However,\ncurrent decompilation tools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for\nyears, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term\nmaintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an\nideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar\nfunctionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g.,\nmeaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately,\nexisting manually-defined rule-based decompilation techniques only functionally\nrestore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to\nrecover semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural\ndecompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate and\nuser-friendly high-level PL, effectively improving its readability and\nunderstandability. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approaches called\nSEAM. Evaluations on four real-world applications show that SEAM has an average\naccuracy of 94.41%, which is much better than prior neural machine translation\n(NMT) models.

An alternative to the brute force approach is inverse design.\nIn this paradigm, one starts from the desired optical response of a material\nand then determines the design parameters that are needed to obtain this\noptical response. There are many algorithms known in the literature that\nimplement this inverse design. Some of the best performing, recent approaches\nare based on Deep Learning. The central idea is to train a neural network to\npredict the optical response for given design parameters. Since neural networks\nare completely differentiable, we can compute gradients of the response with\nrespect to the design parameters. We can use these gradients to update the\ndesign parameters and get an optical response closer to the one we want. This\nallows us to obtain an optimal design much faster compared to the brute force\napproach. In my thesis, I use Deep Learning for the inverse design of the\nFabry-P\\'erot resonator. This system can be described fully analytically and is\ntherefore ideal to study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}
