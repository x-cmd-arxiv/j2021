We\nfirst show that there is a class of functions called $K$-Lipschitz continuous\nand can be approximated by a ReLU neural network of two layers to have an\napproximation order $O(d^2/n)$, and then we introduce the K-modulus of\ncontinuity of multivariate functions and derive the approximation rate for any\ncontinuous function $f\\in C([0,1]^d)$ based on KST.

When using the standard discrete least squares method (DLS) to\napproximate a continuous function $f$ over $[0, 1]^d$, one expects to use a\ndense data set $P$, a large number of data locations and function values over\nthe locations. Based on the LKB splines, the structure of K-inner functions\nleads to a sparse solution of the linear system associated with the DLS.\nFurthermore, there exists a magic set of points from $P$ with much small in\nsize such that the rooted mean squares error (RMSE) from the DLS based on the\nmagic set is similar to the RMSE of the DLS based on the original set $P$. In\naddition, the number of LKB-splines used for approximation is the same as the\nsize of the magic data set.

A different idea has been recently proposed, named Friendly\nTraining, which consists in altering the input data by adding an automatically\nestimated perturbation, with the goal of facilitating the learning process of a\nneural classifier. The transformation progressively fades-out as long as\ntraining proceeds, until it completely vanishes. In this work we revisit and\nextend this idea, introducing a radically different and novel approach inspired\nby the effectiveness of neural generators in the context of Adversarial Machine\nLearning. We propose an auxiliary multi-layer network that is responsible of\naltering the input data to make them easier to be handled by the classifier at\nthe current stage of the training procedure. The auxiliary network is trained\njointly with the neural classifier, thus intrinsically increasing the 'depth'\nof the classifier, and it is expected to spot general regularities in the data\nalteration process. The effect of the auxiliary network is progressively\nreduced up to the end of training, when it is fully dropped and the classifier\nis deployed for applications. We refer to this approach as Neural Friendly\nTraining. An extended experimental procedure involving several datasets and\ndifferent neural architectures shows that Neural Friendly Training overcomes\nthe originally proposed Friendly Training technique, improving the\ngeneralization of the classifier, especially in the case of noisy data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 16:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Properly dealing with the flow of such data requires building data\npipelines, to control the complete life cycle of data streams from data\nacquisition at the data source, edge and fog processing, to Cloud side storage\nand analytics. Data analytics tasks need to be executed dynamically at\ndifferent distances from the data sources and often on very heterogeneous\nhardware devices. This can be streamlined by the use of a Serverless (or FaaS)\ncloud computing model, where tasks are defined as virtual functions, which can\nbe migrated from edge to cloud (and vice versa) and executed in an event-driven\nmanner on data streams. In this work, we investigate the benefits of building\nServerless data pipelines (SDP) for IoT data analytics and evaluate three\ndifferent approaches for designing SDPs: 1) Off-the-shelf data flow tool (DFT)\nbased, 2) Object storage service (OSS) based and 3) MQTT based. Further, we\napplied these strategies on three fog applications (Aeneas, PocketSphinx, and\ncustom Video processing application) and evaluated the performance by comparing\ntheir processing time (computation time, network communication and disk access\ntime), and resource utilization. Results show that DFT is unsuitable for\ncompute-intensive applications such as video or image processing, whereas OSS\nis best suitable for this task. However, DFT is nicely fit for\nbandwidth-intensive applications due to the minimum use of network resources.\nOn the other hand, MQTT-based SDP is observed with increase in CPU and Memory\nusage as the number of...<truncted to fit character limit in Arxiv>\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 17:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

In these methods, class-object relationships are used to associate\nvisual patterns with the semantic side information because these relationships\nalso tend to appear in texts. Therefore, word vector methods would reflect them\nin their latent representations. Inspired by these methods and by video\ncaptioning's ability to describe events not only with a set of objects but with\ncontextual information, we propose a method in which video captioning models,\ncalled observers, provide different and complementary descriptive sentences. We\ndemonstrate that representing videos with descriptive sentences instead of deep\nfeatures, in ZSAR, is viable and naturally alleviates the domain adaptation\nproblem, as we reached state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the UCF101\ndataset and competitive performance on HMDB51 without their training sets.

To improve the\nend-to-end performance of such services, a key-value cache must achieve a high\ncache hit ratio with high throughput. In this paper, we propose a new cache\nreplacement algorithm, multi-step LRU, which achieves high throughput by\nefficiently exploiting SIMD instructions without using per-item additional\nmemory (LRU metadata) to record information such as the last access timestamp.\nFor a small set of items that can fit within a vector register, SIMD-based LRU\nmanagement without LRU metadata is known (in-vector LRU). It remembers the\naccess history by reordering items in one vector using vector shuffle\ninstruction. In-vector LRU alone cannot be used for a caching system since it\ncan manage only few items. Set-associative cache is a straightforward way to\nbuild a large cache using in-vector LRU as a building block. However, a naive\nset-associative cache based on in-vector LRU has a poorer cache hit ratio than\nthe original LRU although it can achieve a high throughput. Our multi-step LRU\nenhances naive set-associative cache based on in-vector LRU for improving cache\naccuracy by taking both access frequency and access recency of items into\naccount while keeping the efficiency by SIMD instructions. Our results indicate\nthat multi-step LRU outperforms the original LRU and GCLOCK algorithms in terms\nof both execution speed and cache hit ratio. Multi-step LRU improves the cache\nhit ratios over the original LRU by implicitly taking access frequency of items\nas well as access recency into account. The cache hit ratios of multi-step LRU\nare similar to those of ARC, which achieves a higher a cache hit ratio in a\ntradeoff for using more LRU metadata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 18:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Therefore, it is\nnecessary to design pooling methods that aggregate the graph representations of\nvarying size to representations of fixed size which can be used in downstream\ntasks, such as graph classification. Existing graph pooling methods offer no\nguarantee with regards to the similarity of a graph representation and its\npooled version. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing FlowPool,\na pooling method that optimally preserves the statistics of a graph\nrepresentation to its pooled counterpart by minimising their Wasserstein\ndistance. This is achieved by performing a Wasserstein gradient flow with\nrespect to the pooled graph representation. Our method relies on a versatile\nimplementation which can take into account the geometry of the representation\nspace through any ground cost and computes the gradient of the Wasserstein\ndistance with automatic differentiation. We propose the differentiation of the\nWasserstein flow layer using an implicit differentiation scheme. Therefore, our\npooling method is amenable to automatic differentiation and can be integrated\nin end-to-end deep learning architectures. Further, FlowPool is invariant to\npermutations and can therefore be combined with permutation equivariant feature\nextraction layers in GNNs in order to obtain predictions that are independent\nof the ordering of the nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nleads to an increase in performance compared to existing pooling methods when\nevaluated on graph classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 20:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 13:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

There are various methods used in\npractice, which differ in terms of the geographic granularity at which the\npredictive model is trained -- e.g., segment-based methods predict travel time\nat the level of road segments (or a combination of several adjacent road\nsegments) and then aggregate across the route, whereas route-based methods use\ngeneric information about the trip, such as origin and destination, to predict\ntravel time. Though various forms of these methods have been developed, there\nhas been no rigorous theoretical comparison regarding their accuracies, and\nempirical studies have, in many cases, drawn opposite conclusions.\n  We provide the first theoretical analysis of the predictive accuracy of\nvarious ETA prediction methods. In a finite-sample setting, we give mild\nconditions under which a segment-based method is more accurate than a wide\nvariety of route-based methods. Then we analyze an asymptotic setting in which\nthe number of trip observations grows with the size of the road network. Under\na broad range of trip-generating processes on a grid network, we show that a\nclass of very simple segment-based methods is at least as good, up to a\nlogarithmic factor, as any possible predictor. In other words, segment-based\nmethods are asymptotically optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

This approach enables us to create a unified model (trained\nonce) for three common segmentation tasks, which come with distinct challenges:\nreferring expression segmentation, zero-shot segmentation and one-shot\nsegmentation.

One of the\nmost fundamental strategies developed for this task is the optimal unambiguous\nmeasurement.

EPR-steering is a property that is more general than\nBell-nonlocality and yet more restrictive than entanglement. Quantum discord on\nthe other hand, captures non-classical behaviour beyond that of entanglement,\nand its study has remained of active research interest during the past two\ndecades. Exploring the behaviour of these quantum properties in different\nphysical scenarios, like those simulated by open quantum systems, is therefore\nof crucial importance for understanding their viability for quantum\ntechnologies. In this work, we analyse the behaviour of EPR-steering,\nentanglement, and quantum discord, for two-qubit states under various quantum\nprocesses. First, we consider the three noisy channel scenarios of; phase\ndamping, generalised amplitude damping and stochastic dephasing channel.\nSecond, we explore the behaviour of these quantum properties in an entanglement\nswapping scenario. We quantify EPR-steering by means of an inequality with\nthree-input two-output measurement settings, and address quantum discord as the\ninterferometric power of quantum states. Our findings are the following. First,\nwe show that some of the relatively straightforward noisy channels here\nconsidered, can induce non-trivial dynamics such as sudden death as well as\ndeath and revival of EPR-steering and entanglement. Second, we find that\nalthough noisy channels in general reduce the amount of correlations present in\nthe system, the swapping protocol on the other hand displays scenarios where\nthese quantum correlations can be enhanced. These results therefore illustrate\nthat quantum processes do not exclusively affect the quantum properties of\nphysical systems in a negative manner, but that they can also have positive\neffects on such properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 23:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Moreover, these\napps have become so sophisticated that they can bypass anti-malware measures to\nprotect the users. Therefore, it is safe to admit that traditional anti-malware\ntechniques have become cumbersome, sparking the urge to develop an efficient\nway to detect Android malware.\n  This paper presents hybrid-Flacon, a hybrid pattern Android malware detection\nand categorization framework. It combines dynamic and static features of\nAndroid malware, which are from network traffic and code graph structure. In\nhybrid-Flacon, we treat network traffic as a dynamic feature and process it as\na 2D image sequence. Meanwhile, hybrid-Flacon handles each network flow in the\npacket as a 2D image and uses a bidirectional LSTM network to process those\n2D-image sequences to obtain vectors representing network packets. We use the\nprogram code graph for a static feature and introduce natural language\nprocessing (NLP) inspired techniques on function call graph (FCG).

The reason for the suboptimal distillation of a large\nnetwork (teacher) to a smaller network (student) is largely attributed to the\ngap in the learning capacities of given teacher-student pair. While it is hard\nto distill all the knowledge of a teacher, the quality of distillation can be\ncontrolled to a large extent to achieve better performance. Our experiments\nshow that the quality of distillation is largely governed by the quality of\nteacher's response, which in turn is heavily affected by the presence of\nsimilarity information in its response. A well-trained large capacity teacher\nloses similarity information between classes in the process of learning\nfine-grained discriminative properties for classification. The absence of\nsimilarity information causes the distillation process to be reduced from one\nexample-many class learning to one example-one class learning, thereby\nthrottling the flow of diverse knowledge from the teacher. With the implicit\nassumption that only the instilled knowledge can be distilled, instead of\nfocusing only on the knowledge distilling process, we scrutinize the knowledge\ninculcation process. We argue that for a given teacher-student pair, the\nquality of distillation can be improved by finding the sweet spot between batch\nsize and number of epochs while training the teacher. We discuss the steps to\nfind this sweet spot for better distillation. We also propose the distillation\nhypothesis to differentiate the behavior of the distillation process between\nknowledge distillation and regularization effect. We conduct all our\nexperiments on three different datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 02:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Linear wavepacket analysis reveals\namplifying oblique first-modes as well as planar and oblique entropy-layer\ndisturbances. The receptivity of entropic-instabilities is found to be largest\nfor actuation seeded in the entropy-layer; the corresponding linear evolution\nis characterized by an intensification in the wall-normal plane, coupled with\nstreamwise tilting. The transition process that arises from entropy-layer wave\ninteractions via the oblique breakdown mechanism is examined in detail. Oblique\nentropy-layer disturbances interact non-linearly with each other and induce\nstreamwise streaks in the boundary-layer. These undergo further destabilization\ndownstream, through a combination of lift-up and Orr-like mechanisms, leading\nto turbulence onset. Sinuous subharmonic oscillations induced by the\nentropic-disturbances are the dominant streak instabilities. Slanted\nhook-shaped structures are observed in the temperature perturbations, and are\nattributed to an Orr-like mechanism in the entropy-layer. Further, temperature\nperturbations amplify on the crests of the low-speed streaks in the\nentropy-layer and generate disturbances through triadic interactions. These\ndisturbances aid in the transfer of perturbation energy into the\nboundary-layer, eventually leading to spanwise homogenization and near-wall\nstreak generation. Towards the end of the breakdown region, spectral broadening\naccompanied by the appearance of an inertial sub-range in the boundary-layer\nindicates the approach of the flow towards turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 03:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2022 20:32:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 00:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Unfortunately,\nsuch code segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet\nchallenges (e.g., external library not found) that might prevent questions from\nreceiving prompt and appropriate solutions. A previous study produced a catalog\nof potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of issues reported at\nSO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers)\nperceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers' perspective is\ninevitable to introduce interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility.\nWe thus attempt to understand developers' perspectives by surveying 53 users of\nSO.

EC tools need to be manually configured\nfor optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g., k-mer size)\nare both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the performance\n(i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a reference\ngenome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We introduce\nLerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna first\ncreates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads; then,\ncalculates the perplexity metric to evaluate the corrected reads for different\nparameter choices. Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment\nrate without using a reference genome. The fundamental intuition of our\napproach is that the perplexity metric is inversely correlated with the quality\nof the assembly after error correction. Results: First, we show that the best\nk-mer value can vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. Second,\nwe show the gains of our LM using its component attention-based transformers.\nWe show the model's estimation of the perplexity metric before and after error\ncorrection. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better the k-mer\nsize. We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for\nthe corrected reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity,\nenabling the automated selection of k-mer values for better error correction,\nand hence, improved assembly quality. Additionally, we show that our\nattention-based models have significant runtime improvement for the entire\npipeline -- 18X faster than previous works, due to parallelizing the attention\nmechanism and the use of JIT compilation for GPU inferencing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 05:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Current best-performing methods mainly include span-based and\nsequence-to-sequence models, where unfortunately the former merely focus on\nboundary identification and the latter may suffer from exposure bias. In this\nwork, we present a novel alternative by modeling the unified NER as word-word\nrelation classification, namely W^2NER. The architecture resolves the kernel\nbottleneck of unified NER by effectively modeling the neighboring relations\nbetween entity words with Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word-*\n(THW-*) relations.

To this end, a new image\ncodec paradigm for both human and machine uses is proposed in this work.\nFirstly, the high-level instance segmentation map and the low-level signal\nfeatures are extracted with neural networks. Then, the instance segmentation\nmap is further represented as a profile with the proposed 16-bit gray-scale\nrepresentation. After that, both 16-bit gray-scale profile and signal features\nare encoded with a lossless codec. Meanwhile, an image predictor is designed\nand trained to achieve the general-quality image reconstruction with the 16-bit\ngray-scale profile and signal features. Finally, the residual map between the\noriginal image and the predicted one is compressed with a lossy codec, used for\nhigh-quality image reconstruction. With such designs, on the one hand, we can\nachieve scalable image compression to meet the requirements of different human\nconsumption; on the other hand, we can directly achieve several machine vision\ntasks at the decoder side with the decoded 16-bit gray-scale profile, e.g.,\nobject classification, detection, and segmentation.

Quantifying the reliability of DL model predictions in\nthe form of uncertainties could enable clinical review of the most uncertain\nregions, thereby building trust and paving the way toward clinical translation.\nSeveral uncertainty estimation methods have recently been introduced for DL\nmedical image segmentation tasks.

For the SHG spectra of $MoS_2/MoSe_2$\nin the low photon-energy region, opposite to the $MoS_2/MoS_2$, their peak\nvalues are very sensitive to the variable tint, due to the strong\n$t_{int}$-dependent IOT dominating in the band edge; the larger the tint, the\nlarger the SHG. For the SHG of $MoS_2/MoS_2$ in the high photon-energy region,\ncomparing to the $MoS_2/MoSe_2$, their peak values will decrease in a much more\nnoticeable way as the $t_{int}$ increases, due to the larger reduction of band\nnesting effect. Our study not only can successfully explain the puzzling\nexperimental observations for the different SHG responses in different bilayer\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides under variable tint, but also may provide a\ngeneral understanding for designing controllable the SHG effects in the vdW\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 07:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

While recent years have witnessed many promising news\nrecommendation models, they mostly capture the user-news interactions on the\ndocument-level in a static manner. However, in real-world scenarios, the news\ncan be quite complex and diverse, blindly squeezing all the contents into an\nembedding vector can be less effective in extracting information compatible\nwith the personalized preference of the users. In addition, user preferences in\nthe news recommendation scenario can be highly dynamic, and a tailored dynamic\nmechanism should be designed for better recommendation performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel dynamic news recommender model. For better\nunderstanding the news content, we leverage the attention mechanism to\nrepresent the news from the sentence-, element- and document-levels,\nrespectively. For capturing users' dynamic preferences, the continuous time\ninformation is seamlessly incorporated into the computing of the attention\nweights.

To comprehensively model the dynamic characters, we firstly\nenhance the traditional attention mechanism by incorporating both absolute and\nrelative time information, and then we propose a dynamic negative sampling\nmethod to optimize the users' implicit feedback.

This\npaper proposes a structural relation network (SRN) for occlusion-robust\nlandmark localization. Unlike most existing methods that simply exploit the\nshape constraint, the proposed SRN aims to capture the structural relations\namong different facial components. These relations can be considered a more\npowerful shape constraint against occlusion. To achieve this, a hierarchical\nstructural relation module (HSRM) is designed to hierarchically reason the\nstructural relations that represent both long- and short-distance spatial\ndependencies. Compared with existing network architectures, HSRM can\nefficiently model the spatial relations by leveraging its geometry-aware\nnetwork architecture, which reduces the semantic ambiguity caused by occlusion.\nMoreover, the SRN augments the training data by synthesizing occluded faces. To\nfurther extend our SRN for occluded video data, we formulate the occluded face\nsynthesis as a Markov decision process (MDP). Specifically, it plans the\nmovement of the dynamic occlusion based on an accumulated reward associated\nwith the performance degradation of the pre-trained SRN. This procedure\naugments hard samples for robust facial landmark tracking.

It inspires an increasing number of entertainment\napplications but also incurs severe threats to individual privacy and even\npolitical security meanwhile. To mitigate such risks, many countermeasures have\nbeen proposed. However, the great majority methods are designed in a passive\nmanner, which is to detect whether the facial images or videos are tampered\nafter their wide propagation. These detection-based methods have a fatal\nlimitation, that is, they only work for ex-post forensics but can not prevent\nthe engendering of malicious behavior. To address the limitation, in this\npaper, we propose a novel framework of initiative defense to degrade the\nperformance of facial manipulation models controlled by malicious users. The\nbasic idea is to actively inject imperceptible venom into target facial data\nbefore manipulation. To this end, we first imitate the target manipulation\nmodel with a surrogate model, and then devise a poison perturbation generator\nto obtain the desired venom. An alternating training strategy are further\nleveraged to train both the surrogate model and the perturbation generator. Two\ntypical facial manipulation tasks: face attribute editing and face reenactment,\nare considered in our initiative defense framework. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in different\nsettings. Finally, we hope this work can shed some light on initiative\ncountermeasures against more adversarial scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 09:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Fuzzers are fast enough, but they still\nspend a good portion of time to restart a crashed application and then fuzz it\nfrom the beginning. Fuzzing an application from a point deeper in the execution\nis also important. To do this, a user needs to take a snapshot of the program\nwhile fuzzing it on top of an emulator, virtual machine, or by utilizing a\nspecial kernel module to enable checkpointing. Even with this ability, it can\nbe difficult to attach a fuzzer after restoring a checkpoint. As a result, most\nfuzzers leverage a form of fork-server design.\n  We propose a novel testing architecture that allows users to attach a fuzzer\nafter the program has started running. We do this by natively checkpointing the\ntarget application at a point of interest, and attaching the fuzzer after\nrestoring the checkpoint. A fork-server may even be engaged at the point of\nrestoration. This not only improves the throughput of the fuzzing campaign by\nminimizing startup time, but opens up a new way to fuzz applications. With this\narchitecture, a user can take a series of checkpoints at points of interest,\nand run parallel tests to reduce the overall state-complexity of an individual\ntest. Checkpoints allow us to begin fuzzing from a deeper point in the\nexecution path, omitting prior execution from the required coverage path.

While this depletion of TLS is thought to have a close relationship\nwith the dramatic decrease of quasi-localized modes (QLMs), it has yet to be\nclearly formalized. In this work, we argue, based on the\n\\textit{soft-potential} model, that TLS correspond to QLMs with typical\nfrequency $\\omega_0$. The density $n_0$ of TLS is proportional to both the\ndensity of QLMs $D_L(\\omega_0)$, and the fraction of symmetric double-wells\n$f(\\omega_0)$ at $\\omega_0$, i.e., $n_0 \\propto D_L(\\omega_0)f(\\omega_0)$.

Remarkably, the order of magnitude of estimations for\n$n_0$ agrees with that found in experiments in amorphous silicon.

An intelligent jammer is\nable to change its policy to minimize the probability of being traced by\nlegitimate nodes. Thus, an anti-jamming mechanism capable of constantly\nadjusting to the jamming policy is required to combat such a jammer.\nRemarkably, existing anti-jamming methods are not applicable here because they\nmainly focus on mitigating jamming attacks with an invariant jamming policy,\nand they rarely consider an intelligent jammer as an adversary. Therefore, in\nthis paper, to employ a jamming type recognition technique working alongside an\nanti-jamming technique is proposed. The proposed recognition method employs a\nrecurrent neural network that takes the jammer's occupied channels as inputs\nand outputs the jammer type. Under this scheme, the real-time jammer policy is\nfirst identified, and, then, the most appropriate countermeasure is chosen.\nConsequently, any changes to the jammer policy can be instantly detected with\nthe proposed recognition technique allowing for a rapid switch to a new\nanti-jamming method fitted to the new jamming policy. To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed recognition method, the accuracy of the detection\nis derived as a function of the jammer policy switching time. Simulation\nresults show the detection accuracy for all the considered users numbers is\ngreater than 70% when the jammer switches its policy every 5 time slots and the\naccuracy raises to 90% when the jammer policy switching time is 45.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 04:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Sector growth is, for the first time, pushing developments to deep\nwater, into a brand new environment: seasonally stratified shelf seas.\nSeasonally stratified shelf seas, where water density varies with depth, have a\ndisproportionately key role in primary production, marine ecosystem and\nbiochemically cycles. Infrastructure will directly mix stratified shelf seas.\nThe magnitude of this mixing, additional to natural background processes, has\nyet to be fully quantified.
