Unfortunately its success\ncomes at the expense of an explicit memory to store samples from past tasks,\nwhich hampers scalability to continual learning settings with a large number of\ntasks. In this paper, we introduce generative kernel continual learning, which\nexplores and exploits the synergies between generative models and kernels for\ncontinual learning. The generative model is able to produce representative\nsamples for kernel learning, which removes the dependence on memory in kernel\ncontinual learning. Moreover, as we replay only on the generative model, we\navoid task interference while being computationally more efficient compared to\nprevious methods that need replay on the entire model. We further introduce a\nsupervised contrastive regularization, which enables our model to generate even\nmore discriminative samples for better kernel-based classification performance.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used continual learning\nbenchmarks that demonstrate the abilities and benefits of our contributions.\nMost notably, on the challenging SplitCIFAR100 benchmark, with just a simple\nlinear kernel we obtain the same accuracy as kernel continual learning with\nvariational random features for one tenth of the memory, or a 10.1\\% accuracy\ngain for the same memory budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 16:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Many SER application systems often\nacquire and transmit speech data collected at the client-side to remote cloud\nplatforms for inference and decision making. However, speech data carry rich\ninformation not only about emotions conveyed in vocal expressions, but also\nother sensitive demographic traits such as gender, age and language background.\nConsequently, it is desirable for SER systems to have the ability to classify\nemotion constructs while preventing unintended/improper inferences of sensitive\nand demographic information. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine\nlearning paradigm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively\nwithout sharing their local data. This training approach appears secure and can\nimprove privacy for SER. However, recent works have demonstrated that FL\napproaches are still vulnerable to various privacy attacks like reconstruction\nattacks and membership inference attacks. Although most of these have focused\non computer vision applications, such information leakages exist in the SER\nsystems trained using the FL technique. To assess the information leakage of\nSER systems trained using FL, we propose an attribute inference attack\nframework that infers sensitive attribute information of the clients from\nshared gradients or model parameters, corresponding to the FedSGD and the\nFedAvg training algorithms, respectively. As a use case, we empirically\nevaluate our approach for predicting the client's gender information using\nthree SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, CREMA-D, and MSP-Improv. We show that\nthe attribute inference attack is achievable for SER systems trained using FL.\nWe further identify that most information leakage possibly comes from the first\nlayer in the SER model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 16:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 00:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 23:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

In fact, the internal heterogeneous structure of this\nkind of tissues leads to a wide range of mechanical behaviours, which then\ndetermine their own function(s). Characterising these behaviours implies an\nimportant experimental effort in terms of tissue harvesting, samples\npreparation and implementation of testing protocols - which, often, are not\nstandardised.

In order to model the behaviours\nof heterogeneous tissues and identify material parameters, a large volume of\nreproducible experimental data is required; unfortunately, such an amount of\ninformation is often not available. In reality, most of the studies that are\nfocused on the identification of material parameters, are largely based on\nsmall sets of experimental data, which present a large variability.

First, we derive the exact expressions for the mean number of\nstationary points of the least-square loss function in the framework of the\nKac-Rice approach combined with the Random Matrix Theory for Wishart Ensemble,\nand then perform its asymptotic analysis as $N\\to \\infty$ at a fixed\n$\\alpha=M/N>1$ in various regimes. In particular, this analysis allows to\nextract the Large Deviation Function for the density of the smallest Lagrange\nmultiplier $\\lambda_{min}$ associated with the problem, and in this way to find\nits most probable value. This can be further used to predict the asymptotic\nminimal value ${\\cal E}_{min}$ of the loss function as $N\\to \\infty$. Finally,\nwe develop an alternative approach based on the replica trick to conjecture the\nform of the Large Deviation function for the density of ${\\cal E}_{min}$ at\n$N\\gg 1$. As a by-product, we find the value of the {\\it compatibility\nthreshold} $\\alpha_c$ which is the minimal value of the asymptotic ratio $M/N$\nsuch that the random linear system on the $N-$sphere is typically compatible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 20:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Our main objective is to establish what features of the model of the\nmobile agent and the environment allow linear exploration time. We study agents\nthat, upon entering to a node, do not receive as input the edge via which they\nentered. In such a model, deterministic memoryless exploration is infeasible,\nhence the agent needs to be allowed to use some memory. The memory can be\nlocated at the agent or at each node. The existing lower bounds show that if\nthe memory is either only at the agent or only at the nodes, then the\nexploration needs superlinear time. We show that tree exploration in\ndual-memory model, with constant memory at the agent and logarithmic at each\nnode is possible in linear time when one of two additional features is present:\nfixed initial state of the memory at each node (so called clean memory) or a\nsingle movable token. We present two algorithms working in linear time for\narbitrary trees in these two models. On the other hand, in our lower bound we\nshow that if the agent has a single bit of memory and one bit is present at\neach node, then exploration may require quadratic time on paths, if the initial\nmemory at nodes could be set arbitrarily (so called dirty memory). This shows\nthat having clean node memory or a token allows linear exploration of trees in\nthe model with two types of memory, but having neither of those features may\nlead to quadratic exploration time even on a simple path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 20:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Traditional EM methods first filter immortal wires using the Blech\ncriterion, and then perform EM analysis based on Black's equation on the\nremaining wires. The Blech criterion is based on finding the steady-state\nstress in a two-terminal wire segment, but most on-chip structures are\nconsiderably more complex. Current-density-based assessment methodologies,\ni.e., Black's equation and the Blech criterion, which are predominantly used to\ndetect EM-susceptible wires, do not capture the physics of EM, but alternative\nphysics-based methods involve the solution of differential equations and are\nslow. This paper uses first principles, based on solving fundamental stress\nequations that relate electron wind and back-stress forces to the stress\nevolution in an interconnect, and devises a technique that analyzes any general\ntree or mesh interconnect structure to test for immortality. The resulting\nsolution is extremely computationally efficient and its computation time is\nlinear in the number of metal segments. Two variants of the method are\nproposed: a current-density-based method that requires traversals of the\ninterconnect graph, and a voltage-based formulation negates the need for any\ntraversals. The methods are applied to large interconnect networks for\ndetermining the steady-state stress at all nodes and test all segments of each\nnetwork for immortality. The proposed model is applied to a variety of tree and\nmesh structures and is demonstrated to be fast. By construction, it is an exact\nsolution and it is demonstrated to match much more computationally expensive\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 21:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Predicting potential hERG and Nav1.5 blockers at the outset of the drug\ndiscovery process can resolve this problem and can, therefore, decrease the\ntime and expensive cost of developing safe drugs. One fast and cost-effective\napproach is to use in silico predictive methods to weed out potential hERG and\nNav1.5 blockers at the early stages of drug development. Here, we introduce two\nrobust 2D descriptor-based QSAR predictive models for both hERG and Nav1.5\nliability predictions.

In a context\nof growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable\ngenerators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously\nmonitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system's behavior\nunder various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately,\nsystematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not\npractical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this\nlimitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e.,\na Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in\nmilliseconds.

This question is\nanalogous to the classical problem of optimal (supervised) statistical\nlearning, where there are well-known complexity measures (e.g., VC dimension\nand Rademacher complexity) that govern the statistical complexity of learning.\nHowever, characterizing the statistical complexity of interactive learning is\nsubstantially more challenging due to the adaptive nature of the problem. The\nmain result of this work provides a complexity measure, the Decision-Estimation\nCoefficient, that is proven to be both necessary and sufficient for\nsample-efficient interactive learning. In particular, we provide:\n  1. a lower bound on the optimal regret for any interactive decision making\nproblem, establishing the Decision-Estimation Coefficient as a fundamental\nlimit.\n  2. a unified algorithm design principle, Estimation-to-Decisions (E2D), which\ntransforms any algorithm for supervised estimation into an online algorithm for\ndecision making. E2D attains a regret bound matching our lower bound, thereby\nachieving optimal sample-efficient learning as characterized by the\nDecision-Estimation Coefficient.\n  Taken together, these results constitute a theory of learnability for\ninteractive decision making. When applied to reinforcement learning settings,\nthe Decision-Estimation Coefficient recovers essentially all existing hardness\nresults and lower bounds. More broadly, the approach can be viewed as a\ndecision-theoretic analogue of the classical Le Cam theory of statistical\nestimation; it also unifies a number of existing approaches -- both Bayesian\nand frequentist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 02:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 06:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Estimating root-related parameters from GPR radargrams\ngreatly facilitates root health monitoring and imaging. However, the task of\nestimating root-related parameters is challenging as the root reflection is a\ncomplex function of multiple root parameters and root orientations. Existing\nmethods can only estimate a single root parameter at a time without considering\nthe influence of other parameters and root orientations, resulting in limited\nestimation accuracy under different root conditions. In addition, soil\nheterogeneity introduces clutter in GPR radargrams, making the data processing\nand interpretation even harder. To address these issues, a novel neural network\narchitecture, called mask-guided multi-polarimetric integration neural network\n(MMI-Net), is proposed to automatically and simultaneously estimate multiple\nroot-related parameters in heterogeneous soil environments.

We also measure the difference in performance of using\nplatform-specific metadata as a feature in classification.\n  We demonstrate that classification performance is similar on feedback from\nunseen apps compared to seen apps in the majority of cases tested. However, the\nclassifiers do not perform well on unseen datasets. We show that multi-dataset\ntraining or zero shot classification approaches can somewhat mitigate this\nperformance decrease. Finally, we find that using metadata as features in\nclassifying bug reports and feature requests does not lead to a statistically\nsignificant improvement in the majority of datasets tested. We discuss the\nimplications of these results on developing user feedback classification models\nto analyse and extract software requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 03:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Existing approaches utilizing line features\nhave primarily employed a measurement model that uses line re-projection.\nHowever, the direction vectors used in the 3D line mapping process cannot be\ncorrected because the line measurement model employs only the lines' normal\nvectors in the Pl\\\"{u}cker coordinate. As a result, problems like degeneracy\nthat occur during the 3D line mapping process cannot be solved. To tackle the\nproblem, this paper presents a UV-SLAM, which is an unconstrained line-based\nSLAM using vanishing points for structural mapping. This paper focuses on using\nstructural regularities without any constraints, such as the Manhattan world\nassumption. For this, we use the vanishing points that can be obtained from the\nline features. The difference between the vanishing point observation\ncalculated through line features in the image and the vanishing point\nestimation calculated through the direction vector is defined as a residual and\nadded to the cost function of optimization-based SLAM.

By rederiving its effective Kitaev model with spins, we\ndiscover a novel topological phase diagram, which assigns a more precise\nconstraint on the magnetic field strength for the emergence of Majorana zero\nmodes. It then turns out the effective pairing strength dressed by the\nproximity effect exhibits a significant dependence on the magnetic field, and\nthus the topological phase region is refined as a closed triangle in the phase\ndiagram with chemical potential vs. Zeeman energy(which is obviously different\nfrom the open hyperbolic region known before). This prediction is confirmed\nagain by an exact calculation of quantum transport, where the zero bias peak of\n$2e^{2}/h$ in the differential conductance spectrum, as the necessary evidence\nfor the Majorana zero modes, disappears when the magnetic field grows too\nstrong.

It is demonstrated experimentally in this study that\nunlike the conventional WPE algorithm, the VACE-WPE can be explicitly trained\nto cancel out both late reverberation and background noise. To build the\nfront-end, the VACE-WPE is first independently (pre)trained to produce \"noisy\"\ndereverberated signals.

LLC contains one novel\nsearch space which consists of 3 types of blocks and learnable connections, and\none differentiable search algorithm to enable the efficient search process.\nExtensive experiments on five real-world datasets are conducted, and the\nresults show that the searched layer-wise connections can not only improve the\nperformance but also alleviate the over-smoothing problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 09:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

We study the clusters using optical and near-infrared\n(NIR) datasets. We use the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) PMs in order to\nperform a PM-decontamination procedure and build final catalogues.

Yet, the urgent demand for ubiquitous\nintelligence will generate a large number of concurrent FL tasks, which may\nseriously aggravate the scarcity of communication resources. By exploiting the\nanalog superposition of electromagnetic waves, over-the-air computation\n(AirComp) is an appealing solution to alleviate the burden of communication\nrequired by FL. However, sharing frequency-time resources in over-the-air\ncomputation inevitably brings about the problem of inter-task interference,\nwhich poses a new challenge that needs to be appropriately addressed. In this\npaper, we study over-the-air federated multi-task learning (OA-FMTL) over the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access (MAC) channel. We propose\na novel model aggregation method for the alignment of local gradients of\ndifferent devices, which alleviates the straggler problem in over-the-air\ncomputation due to the channel heterogeneity. We establish a\ncommunication-learning analysis framework for the proposed OA-FMTL scheme by\nconsidering the spatial correlation between devices, and formulate an\noptimization problem for the design of transceiver beamforming and device\nselection. To solve this problem, we develop an algorithm by using alternating\noptimization (AO) and fractional programming (FP), which effectively mitigates\nthe impact of inter-task interference on the FL learning performance. We show\nthat due to the use of the new model aggregation method, device selection is no\nlonger essential, thereby avoiding the heavy computational burden involved in\nselecting active devices. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the\nanalysis and the superb performance of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 10:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 12:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

First, we study the equilibrium\ncase and identify the interlayer hopping processes that are most crucial for\nthe appearance of a Hofstadter butterfly. Surprisingly, the hopping processes\nthat are important for the appearance of the Hofstadter butterfly can be\ncategorized as AA stacking type - that is interlayer hoppings between\nequivalent sublattices. This is in contrast to AB/BA-type hoppings that are\nimportant for the appearance of flat bands in magic angle TBG and were\ndiscussed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 106405 (2019)]. We also find that if\nAB-type interlayer-hopping processes are turned off the resulting model is\nchiral but differs from the model discussed in \\cite{Tarnopolsky}. Therefore,\nTBG has two separate chiral limits - one of them is important to understand the\nformation of flat bands and the other for the Hofstadter butterfly. Taking this\nas motivation we discuss how the role of AA-type hoppings in combination with\nlattice relaxation effects can make individual Landau levels slightly harder to\nresolve in an experimental setting than one would expect from a non-relaxed\nlattice setting. Finally, we consider the impact of different forms of light on\nthe fractal structure of the butterfly.

We find the control\nfields which maximize the population transfer to the target state for a given\nduration $T$, without using any penalty involving the population of the lossy\nintermediate state, but under the constraint that the sum of the intensities of\nthe pump and Stokes pulses is constant, so the total field has constant\namplitude and the only control parameter is the mixing angle of the two fields.\nIn the optimal solution the mixing angle changes in the bang-singular-bang\nmanner, where the initial and final bangs correspond to equal instantaneous\nrotations, while the intermediate singular arc to a linear change with time. We\nshow that the optimal angle of the initial and final rotations is the unique\nsolution of a transcendental equation where duration $T$ appears as a\nparameter, while the optimal slope of the intermediate linear change as well as\nthe optimal transfer efficiency are expressed as functions of this optimal\nangle. The corresponding optimal solution recovers the counterintuitive\npulse-sequence, with nonzero pump and Stokes fields at the boundaries. We also\nshow with numerical simulations that, transfer efficiency values close to the\noptimal derived using the approximate system, can also be obtained with the\noriginal STIRAP system using dissipation rates comparable to the maximum\ncontrol amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 11:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Later studies\nsuggested evolutionary effects and added dusty clumps and polar winds but left\nthe basic picture intact. However, recent high-resolution images of the\narchetypal type-2 galaxy NGC 1068 suggested a more radical revision. They\ndisplayed a ring-like emission feature which the authors advocated to be hot\ndust surrounding the black hole at the radius where the radiation from the\ncentral engine evaporates the dust. That ring is too thin and too far tilted\nfrom edge-on to hide the central engine, and ad hoc foreground extinction is\nneeded to explain the type-2 classification. These images quickly generated\nreinterpretations of the type 1-2 dichotomy. Here we present new multi-band\nmid-infrared images of NGC1068 that detail the dust temperature distribution\nand reaffirm the original model.

However, deep\nlearning-based visualaudio fixation prediction is still in its infancy. At\npresent, only a few visual-audio sequences have been furnished, with real\nfixations being recorded in real visual-audio environments. Hence, it would be\nneither efficient nor necessary to recollect real fixations under the same\nvisual-audio circumstances. To address this problem, this paper promotes a\nnovel approach in a weakly supervised manner to alleviate the demand of\nlarge-scale training sets for visual-audio model training. By using only the\nvideo category tags, we propose the selective class activation mapping (SCAM)\nand its upgrade (SCAM+). In the spatial-temporal-audio circumstance, the former\nfollows a coarse-to-fine strategy to select the most discriminative regions,\nand these regions are usually capable of exhibiting high consistency with the\nreal human-eye fixations. The latter equips the SCAM with an additional\nmulti-granularity perception mechanism, making the whole process more\nconsistent with that of the real human visual system. Moreover, we distill\nknowledge from these regions to obtain complete new spatial-temporal-audio\n(STA) fixation prediction (FP) networks, enabling broad applications in cases\nwhere video tags are not available. Without resorting to any real human-eye\nfixation, the performances of these STA FP networks are comparable to those of\nfully supervised networks.

To assess\nthe effectiveness of agricultural practices, researchers often turn to\nrandomized field experiments, which are reliable for identifying causal effects\nbut are often limited in scope and therefore lack external validity. Recently,\nresearchers have also leveraged large observational datasets from satellites\nand other sources, which can lead to conclusions biased by confounding\nvariables or systematic measurement errors.

Further, the causal estimates based on our method\nsuggest that benefits of crop rotations on corn yield are lower in years and\nlocations with high temperatures whereas the benefits of crop rotations on soy\nyield are higher in years and locations with high temperatures.

In contrast, for rarely seen or occluded actions, the estimated\npositions of multiple joints largely deviate from the ground truth values for a\nconsecutive sequence of frames, rendering significant jitters on them. To\ntackle this problem, we propose to attach a dedicated temporal-only refinement\nnetwork to existing pose estimators for jitter mitigation, named SmoothNet.\nUnlike existing learning-based solutions that employ spatio-temporal models to\nco-optimize per-frame precision and temporal smoothness at all the joints,\nSmoothNet models the natural smoothness characteristics in body movements by\nlearning the long-range temporal relations of every joint without considering\nthe noisy correlations among joints. With a simple yet effective motion-aware\nfully-connected network, SmoothNet improves the temporal smoothness of existing\npose estimators significantly and enhances the estimation accuracy of those\nchallenging frames as a side-effect. Moreover, as a temporal-only model, a\nunique advantage of SmoothNet is its strong transferability across various\ntypes of estimators and datasets.

This\nproblem, known as the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem (GOPP), has\nfound numerous applications in statistics, computer vision, and imaging\nscience. While one commonly-used method is finding the least squares estimator,\nit is generally an NP-hard problem to obtain the least squares estimator\nexactly due to the notorious nonconvexity. In this work, we apply the\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and the generalized power method to\nsolve this generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem. In particular, we assume\nthe data are generated from a signal-plus-noise model: each observed point\ncloud is a noisy copy of the same unknown point cloud transformed by an unknown\northogonal matrix and also corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. We show that\nthe generalized power method (equivalently alternating minimization algorithm)\nwith spectral initialization converges to the unique global optimum to the SDP\nrelaxation, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Moreover, this\nlimiting point is exactly the least squares estimator and also the maximum\nlikelihood estimator. In addition, we derive a block-wise estimation error for\neach orthogonal matrix and the underlying point cloud. Our theoretical bound is\nnear-optimal in terms of the information-theoretic limit (only loose by a\nfactor of the dimension and a log factor). Our results significantly improve\nthe state-of-the-art results on the tightness of the SDP relaxation for the\ngeneralized orthogonal Procrustes problem, an open problem posed by Bandeira,\nKhoo, and Singer in 2014.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

However, what is not clear is whether this fragmentation\ngives rise to cores massive enough to form directly high-mass stars, or leads\nto cores of low and intermediate mass that generate massive stars acquiring\nmaterial from their environment. Detailed studies towards clumps at early\nstages of star formation are needed to collect observational evidence that shed\nlight on this issue. The infrared-quiet massive clump AGAL G035.1330-00.7450,\nlocated at a distance of 2.1 kpc, is a promising object to study both the\nfragmentation and the star formation activity at early stages. Using millimeter\nobservations of continuum and molecular lines obtained from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array database at Bands 6 and 7, we study the substructure of this\nsource. The angular resolution of the data at Band 7 is about 0\\farcs7, which\nallow us to resolve structures of about 0.007 pc ($\\sim$1500 au).

The moment 1 map of the CH$_3$CN emission suggests\nthe presence of a rotating disk towards C1, which is confirmed by the CH$_3$OH\nand CH$_3$OCHO (20-19) emissions. On the other hand, CN N=2-1 emission shows a\nclumpy and filamentary structure that seems to connect all the cores. These\nfilaments might be tracing the remnant gas of the fragmentation processes\ntaking place within the clump, or gas that is being transported towards the\ncores, which would imply a competitive accretion scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Existing\nactive learning algorithms, especially in the context of batch-mode deep\nBayesian active models, rely heavily on the quality of uncertainty estimations\nof the model, and are often challenging to scale to large batches. In this\npaper, we propose Batch-BALanCe, a scalable batch-mode active learning\nalgorithm, which combines insights from decision-theoretic active learning,\ncombinatorial information measure, and diversity sampling. At its core,\nBatch-BALanCe relies on a novel decision-theoretic acquisition function that\nfacilitates differentiation among different equivalence classes. Intuitively,\neach equivalence class consists of hypotheses (e.g., posterior samples of deep\nneural networks) with similar predictions, and Batch-BALanCe adaptively adjusts\nthe size of the equivalence classes as learning progresses. To scale up the\ncomputation of queries to large batches, we further propose an efficient\nbatch-mode acquisition procedure, which aims to maximize a novel information\nmeasure defined through the acquisition function.

In such situations, most existing\nClick-Through Rate (CTR) models can't generalize well to online serving due to\ndistribution uncertainty of the upcoming occasion. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel CTR model named MOEF for recommendations under frequent changes of\noccasions. Firstly, we design a time series that consists of occasion signals\ngenerated from the online business scenario. Since occasion signals are more\ndiscriminative in the frequency domain, we apply Fourier Transformation to\nsliding time windows upon the time series, obtaining a sequence of frequency\nspectrum which is then processed by Occasion Evolution Layer (OEL). In this\nway, a high-order occasion representation can be learned to handle the online\ndistribution uncertainty.

The presence of a magnetic guide field induces several types of\nanisotropy in solar wind turbulence. The energy cascade rate between scales in\nthe inertial range depends strongly on the direction of this magnetic guide\nfield, splitting the energy cascade according to the parallel and perpendicular\ndirections with respect to magnetic guide field. Aims. Using more than two\nyears of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations, the isotropy and anisotropy\nenergy cascade rates are investigated. The variance and normalized fluctuation\nratios, the kinetic and magnetic energies, and the normalized cross-helicity\nand residual energy are studied. The connection between the heliocentric\ndistance, the local temperature of the plasma, and the energy cascade\ncomponents is made. Methods. Using exact relations for fully developed\nincompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the incompressible energy\ncascade rate is computed. In particular, using the isotropy and 2D and slab\nassumptions, the isotropic, perpendicular, and parallel energy cascade rate\ncomponents are estimated. Results. The variance anisotropy ratios, for both\nvelocity and magnetic fields, do not exhibit a dependence with respect to the\nheliocentric distance $r$ between 0.2 and 0.8 au. While the velocity normalized\nfluctuation ratio shows a dependence with $r$, the magnetic normalized\nfluctuation ratio does not. A strong correlation between the isotropic and\nanisotropic energy cascade rates and the temperature is found. A clear\ndominance of the perpendicular cascades over the parallel cascades as PSP\napproaches the Sun is observed. A dominant 2D cascade and/or geometry over the\nslab component in slow solar wind turbulence in the largest MHD scales is\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 17:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 15:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The article contains a\ncase study that analyses how the Boolean cube has been included and explained\nin more than 80 different sources. However, organized material on the Boolean\ncube is lacking. We examine and show why the topic of the Boolean cube deserves\nto be studied in the course on Discrete Structures -- a basic part of the\nComputer Science curriculum. The benefits of mastering such knowledge and\nprogramming skills are pointed out. A sample lecture on the $n$-dimensional\nBoolean cube (including selected exercises, their answers, hints or solutions)\nis developed and discussed. It introduces, generalizes and relates many\nconcepts from different subjects in the area of Discrete Mathematics and\noutside it. So the lecturers can use the sample lecture when teaching those\nsubjects. In this way, all these concepts become more understandable,\napplicable and useful to the students. The lecture can be taught in a form of\npresentation or given to the students for \"Online self-learning\", in order to\nwrite homework, or develop a course project related to the topic, etc. All\nsupporting resources to the lecture are available for free use at\n\\cite{VB_Lect}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 10:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

In the case of 2D microplatelets, rotating\nmagnetic fields are typically used to orient them parallel to each other in a\nbrick-and-mortar fashion. Thanks to this microstructure, the resulting\ncomposites achieve enhanced mechanical and functional properties. However,\nparts with complex geometry require their microstructure to be specifically\ntuned and controlled locally in 3D. Although the tunability of the\nmicrostructure along the vertical direction has already been demonstrated using\nmagnetic orientation combined with sequential or continuous casting,\ncontrolling the particle orientation in the horizontal plane in a fast and\neffective fashion remains challenging. Here, we propose to use rotating\nmagnetic arrays to control the in-plane orientation of ferromagnetic Nickel\nflakes distributed in uncured polymeric matrices. We experimentally studied the\norientation of the flakes in response to magnets rotating at various\nfrequencies and precessing angles. Then, we used COMSOL to model the magnetic\nfield from rotating magnetic arrays and predicted the resulting in-plane\norientations. To validate the approach, we created composites with locally\noriented flakes. This work could initiate reverse-engineering methods to design\nthe microstructure in composite materials with intricate geometrical shapes for\nstructural or functional applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 11:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

The high stakes of\nexistential risk studies (ERS) necessitate serious scrutiny and\nself-reflection. We argue that existing approaches to studying existential risk\nare not yet fit for purpose, and perhaps even run the risk of increasing harm.\nWe highlight general challenges in ERS: accommodating value pluralism, crafting\nprecise definitions, developing comprehensive tools for risk assessment,\ndealing with uncertainty, and accounting for the dangers associated with taking\nexceptional actions to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The most influential\nframework for ERS, the 'techno-utopian approach' (TUA), struggles with these\nissues and has a unique set of additional problems: it unnecessarily combines\nthe study of longtermism and longtermist ethics with the study of extinction,\nrelies on a non-representative moral worldview, uses ambiguous and inadequate\ndefinitions, fails to incorporate insights from risk assessment in relevant\nfields, chooses arbitrary categorisations of risk, and advocates for dangerous\nmitigation strategies. Its moral and empirical assumptions might be\nparticularly vulnerable to securitisation and misuse. We suggest several key\nimprovements: separating the study of extinction ethics (ethical implications\nof extinction) and existential ethics (the ethical implications of different\nsocietal forms), from the analysis of human extinction and global catastrophe;\ndrawing on the latest developments in risk assessment literature; diversifying\nthe field, and; democratising its policy recommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 08:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}
