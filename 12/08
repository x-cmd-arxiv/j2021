However, this appealing idea is frustrated by the\ndifficulty of designing an effective shaping strategy that takes into account\nthe nonlinearity and long memory of the fiber channel, as well as the possible\ninterplay with other nonlinearity mitigation strategies. As a result, only\nlittle progress has been made so far, while the optimal shaping distribution\nand the ultimate channel capacity remain unknown.

Researchers have paid much attention\non its partially observable and cooperative settings for meeting real-world\nrequirements. For testing performance of different algorithms, standardized\nenvironments are designed such as the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which is\none of the most successful MARL benchmarks. To our best knowledge, most of\ncurrent environments are synchronous, where agents execute actions in the same\npace. However, heterogeneous agents usually have their own action spaces and\nthere is no guarantee for actions from different agents to have the same\nexecuted cycle, which leads to asynchronous multi-agent cooperation. Inspired\nfrom the Wargame, a confrontation game between two armies abstracted from real\nworld environment, we propose the first Partially Observable Asynchronous\nmulti-agent Cooperation challenge (POAC) for the MARL community. Specifically,\nPOAC supports two teams of heterogeneous agents to fight with each other, where\nan agent selects actions based on its own observations and cooperates\nasynchronously with its allies. Moreover, POAC is a light weight, flexible and\neasy to use environment, which can be configured by users to meet different\nexperimental requirements such as self-play model, human-AI model and so on.\nAlong with our benchmark, we offer six game scenarios of varying difficulties\nwith the built-in rule-based AI as opponents. Finally, since most MARL\nalgorithms are designed for synchronous agents, we revise several\nrepresentatives to meet the asynchronous setting, and the relatively poor\nexperimental results validate the challenge of POAC.

The reason for this can be untangled by considering the varied\nresponse of octahedral tilts and rotations to hydrostatic pressure and their\ntrilinear coupling with the polar instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 16:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The close analogy between\nthis magnonic pseudospin systems and that of electronic charge carriers led to\nthe prediction of fascinating phenomena in antiferromagnets. Recently, the\nassociated dynamics of antiferromagnetic pseudospin has been experimentally\ndemonstrated and, in particular, the first observation of the magnon Hanle\neffect has been reported. We here expand the magnonic spin transport\ndescription by explicitly taking into account contributions of finite-spin\nlow-energy magnons.

For both a 15 nm and a 100 nm thick film,\nwe find a distinct signal caused by the magnon Hanle effect. However, the\nmagnonic spin signal exhibits clear differences in both films. In contrast to\nthe thin film, for the thicker one, we observe an oscillating behavior in the\nhigh magnetic field range as well as an additional offset signal in the low\nmagnetic field regime.

The collapse itself drives\npredominantly irrotational motions that cannot be responsible for dynamo\naction. We find that, with a weak magnetic field, one-third of the work done by\nthe gravitational force goes into compressional heating and the remaining\ntwo-thirds go first into kinetic energy of the turbulence before a fraction of\nit is converted further into magnetic and finally thermal energies. Close to\nthe collapse, however, these fractions change toward 1/4 and 3/4 for\ncompressional heating and kinetic energy, respectively. When the magnetic field\nis strong, the compressional heating fraction is unchanged. Out of the\nremaining kinetic energy, one quarter goes directly into magnetic energy via\nwork against the Lorentz force. The fraction of vortical motions diminishes in\nfavor of compressive motions that are almost exclusively driven by the Jeans\ninstability. For an initially uniform magnetic field, field amplification at\nscales larger than those of the initial turbulence are driven by tangling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 17:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 10:11:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 11:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

It is the principle goal of this paper to analyze what is the\nback-reacted geometry that corresponds to a given quantum state. The story is\nshown to be dramatically different for the Hartle-Hawking state (HH) and for\nthe Boulware state. In the HH case the back-reacted geometry is a modification\nof the classical black hole metric that still has a smooth horizon with a\nregular curvature. On the other hand, for the Boulware state the classical\nhorizon is replaced by a throat in which the $(tt)$ component of the metric\n(while non-zero) is extremely small. The value of the metric at the throat is\nbounded by the inverse of the classical black hole entropy. On the other side\nof the throat the spacetime is ended at a null singularity. More generally, we\nidentify a family of quantum states and their respective back-reacted\ngeometries. We also identify a certain duality in the space of states. Finally,\nwe study a hybrid set-up where both physical and non-physical fields, such as\nthe ghosts, could be present.

Once an invasive population has\nestablished in a new habitat, eradication can be financially and logistically\nimpossible, motivating management strategies to rely heavily upon prevention\nmeasures aimed at reducing the introduction and spread. To be productive,\non-the-ground management of aquatic invasive species requires effective\ndecision-making surrounding the allocation of limited resources. Watercraft\ninspections play an important role in managing aquatic invasive species by\npreventing the overland transport of invasive species between waterbodies and\nproviding education to boaters. In this study, we developed and tested an\ninteractive web-based decision-support tool, AIS Explorer: Prioritization for\nWatercraft Inspections, to guide AIS managers in developing efficient\nwatercraft inspection plans. The decision-support tool is informed by a novel\nnetwork model that maximized the number of inspected watercraft that move from\nAIS-infested to uninfested waterbodies, within and outside of counties in\nMinnesota, USA. It was iteratively built with stakeholder feedback, including\nconsultations with county managers, beta-testing of the web-based application,\nand workshops to educate and train end-users.

The AIS Explorer: Prioritization for Watercraft\nInspections application makes optimized research outputs accessible in multiple\ndynamic forms that maintain pace with the identification of new infestations\nand local needs.

There are five Platonic solids in three dimensions, but there are\nalso solids with Platonic properties (also known as regular polyhedra) in four\nand higher dimensions. The concept of Platonic Bell inequalities in the\nthree-dimensional Euclidean space was introduced by Tavakoli and Gisin [Quantum\n4, 293 (2020)]. For any three-dimensional Platonic solid, an arrangement of\nprojective measurements is associated where the measurement directions point\ntoward the vertices of the solids. For the higher dimensional regular\npolyhedra, we use the correspondence of the vertices to the measurements in the\nabstract Tsirelson space. We give a remarkably simple formula for the quantum\nviolation of all the Platonic Bell inequalities, which we prove to attain the\nmaximum possible quantum violation of the Bell inequalities, i.e. the Tsirelson\nbound. To construct Bell inequalities with a large number of settings, it is\ncrucial to compute the local bound efficiently. In general, the computation\ntime required to compute the local bound grows exponentially with the number of\nmeasurement settings. We find a method to compute the local bound exactly for\nany bipartite two-outcome Bell inequality, where the dependence becomes\npolynomial whose degree is the rank of the Bell matrix. To show that this\nalgorithm can be used in practice, we compute the local bound of a 300-setting\nPlatonic Bell inequality based on the halved dodecaplex. In addition, we use a\ndiagonal modification of the original Platonic Bell matrix to increase the\nratio of quantum to local bound.

We address this limitation by introducing Ref-NeRF, which\nreplaces NeRF's parameterization of view-dependent outgoing radiance with a\nrepresentation of reflected radiance and structures this function using a\ncollection of spatially-varying scene properties. We show that together with a\nregularizer on normal vectors, our model significantly improves the realism and\naccuracy of specular reflections. Furthermore, we show that our model's\ninternal representation of outgoing radiance is interpretable and useful for\nscene editing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 18:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The longitudinal motion of the\nstream follows geodesics in the Kerr spacetime and the evolution in the\ntransverse dimensions is decoupled from the longitudinal motion. Using an\napproximate tidal equation, we calculate the evolution of the stream thickness\nalong the geodesic, during which we treat the effect of nozzle shocks as a\nperfect bounce. Intersection occurs when the thickness exceeds the closest\napproach separation. This algorithm allows us to explore a wide parameter space\nof orbital angular momenta, inclinations, and BH spins to obtain the properties\nof stream intersection. We identify two collision modes, split evenly among all\ncases: \"rear-end\" collisions near the pericenter at an angle close to $0$ and\n\"head-on\" collisions far from the pericenter at an angle close to $\\pi$. The\nintersection typically occurs between consecutive half-orbits with a delay time\nthat spans a wide range (from months up to a decade). The intersection radius\ngenerally increases with the orbital angular momentum and depends less strongly\non the inclination and BH spin. The thickness ratio of the colliding ends is of\norder unity. The transverse separation is a small fraction of the sum of the\ntwo thicknesses, so a large fraction of the stream is shock-heated in an offset\ncollision. Many of the numerical results can be analytically understood in a\npost-Newtonian picture, where the orientation of an elliptical orbit undergoes\napsidal and Lense-Thirring precessions. Instead of thickness inflation due to\nenergy dissipation at nozzle shocks as invoked in earlier works, we find the\nphysical reason for stream collision to be a geometric one. After the\ncollision, we expect the gas to undergo secondary shocks and form an accretion\ndisk, generating bright electromagnetic emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

Potential angular\nstructures are generally ignored, except to explain flux ratios anomalies.\nSurprisingly, the impact of azimuthal structures on extended images of the\nsource has not been characterized, nor its impact on the H0 inference. We\naddress this task by creating mock images of a point source embedded in an\nextended source, lensed by an elliptical galaxy on which multipolar components\nare added to emulate boxy/discy isodensity contours. Modeling such images with\na density profile free of angular structure allow us to explore the\ndetectability of image deformation induced by the multipoles in the residual\nframe. Multipole deformations are almost always detectable for our highest\nsignal-to-noise mock data. However the detectability depends on the lens\nellipticity and Einstein radius, on the S/N of the data, and on the specific\nlens modeling strategy. Multipoles also introduce small changes to the time\ndelays. We therefore quantify how undetected multipoles would impact H0\ninference. When no multipoles are detected in the residuals, the impact on H0\nfor a given lens is in general less than a few km/s/Mpc, but in the worst case\nscenario, combining low S/N in the ring and large intrinsic boxyness/discyness,\nthe bias on H0 can reach 10-12 km/s/Mpc. If we now look at the inference on H0\nfrom a population of lensing galaxies, having a distribution of multipoles\nrepresentative of what is found in the light-profile of elliptical galaxies, we\nthen find a systematic bias on H0 < 1%. The comparison of our mock systems to\nthe state-of-the-art time delay lens sample studied by the H0LiCOW and TDCOSMO\ncollaborations, indicates that multipoles are currently unlikely to be a source\nof substantial systematic bias on the inferred value of H0 from time-delay\nlenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 12:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Such\nobservational evidence has been a matter of debate for years and usually is\ninterpreted as a signature of the $\\gamma$-ray emission originating upstream in\nthe jet, with the emitting region becoming radio transparent at larger scales.\nIn this paper, we show, by means of self-consistent numerical modelling, that\nthe adiabatic expansion of relativistic blob can explain these delays. We use\nthe JetSeT framework to reproduce the numerical modelling of the\nradiative/accelerative processes, reproducing the temporal evolution, from the\ninitial flaring activity, and the subsequent expansion. We follow the spectral\nevolution and the light curves, investigating the relations among the observed\nparameters, rise, time, and decay time, identifying the link with the physical\nparameters. We find that, when adiabatic expansion is active, lags due to the\nshift of the synchrotron frequency occur, with an offset equal to the distance\nin time between the flaring onset and the beginning of the expansion, whilst\nthe rising and decaying timescales depend on the velocity of the expansion and\non time required to the source to exhibit a synchrotron self-absorption\nfrequency. We derive an inter-band response function, and we investigate the\neffects of the competitions between radiative and adiabatic cooling timescales\non the response. We apply the response function to long-term radio and\n$\\gamma-$ray light curves of Mrk 421, Mrk 501 and 3C 273, finding a\nsatisfactory agreement on the log-term behaviour, and we use a Monte Carlo\nMarkov Chain approach, to estimate some physical relevant parameters.

We present an\napproach for determining the location and number of change-points in piecewise\nexponential models.

Afterwards we\ndemonstrate, to all orders in the Post-Minkowskian expansion, the link between\nthe radiated energy and the ultraviolet pole in the radial action in\ndimensional regularization due to tail effects. This implies, as expected, that\nthe B2B correspondence for the conservative sector remains unchanged for\nlocal-in-time radiation-reaction tail effects with generic orbits. As a side\nproduct, this allows us to read off the energy flux from the associated pole in\nthe tail Hamiltonian. We show that the B2B map also holds for non-local-in-time\nterms, but only in the large-eccentricity limit. Remarkably, we find that all\nof the trademark logarithmic contributions to the radial action map unscathed\nbetween generic unbound and bound motion. However, unlike logarithms, other\nterms due to non-local effects do not transition smoothly to quasi-circular\norbits. We conclude with a discussion on these non-local pieces. Several checks\nof the B2B dictionary are displayed using state-of-the-art knowledge in\nPost-Newtonian/Minkowskian theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 20:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 14:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

The simulated nanomagnet array has an input\nnanomagnet that is excited with focused SAW and coupled to several nanomagnets,\nseven of which serve as output nanomagnets. The SAW has a carrier frequency of\n4 GHz whose amplitude is modulated to provide different inputs of sine and\nsquare waves of 100 MHz frequency. The responses of the selected output\nnanomagnets are processed by reading the envelope of their magnetization state,\nwhich is used to train the output weights using regression method (e.g.\nMoore-Penrose pseudoinverse operation). For classification, a random sequence\nof 100 square and sine wave samples are used, of which 80 % are used for\ntraining, and the rest of the samples used for testing. We achieve 100 %\ntraining accuracy and 100 % testing accuracy for different combination of\nnanomagnets as outputs. Further, the STM and PC is calculated to be ~ 5.5 bits\nand ~ 5.3 bits respectively, which is indicative of the proposed acoustically\ndriven nanomagnet oscillator array being well suited for physical reservoir\ncomputing applications. Finally, the ability to use high frequency (4GHz,\nwavelength ~1 micron) SAW makes the device scalable to small dimensions, while\nthe ability to modulate the envelope at lower frequency (100 MHz) adds\nflexibility to encode different signals beyond the sine and square waves\ndemonstrated here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 21:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 10:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 13:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The student model\nmeanwhile solves a pretext task by exploiting this prior knowledge. We also\nintroduce a novel pretext task, Video Segment Pace Prediction or VSPP, which\nrequires our model to predict the playback speed of a randomly selected segment\nof the input video to provide more reliable self-supervised representations.\nOur experimental results show superior results to the state of the art on both\nUCF101 and HMDB51 datasets when pretraining on K100 in apple-to-apple\ncomparisons. Additionally, we show that our auxiliary pretraining, auxSKD, when\nadded as an extra pretraining phase to recent state of the art self-supervised\nmethods (i.e. VCOP, VideoPace, and RSPNet), improves their results on UCF101\nand HMDB51.

An initially tearing-stable Harris sheet is\nfrozen into a persistently driven incompressible flow so that its\ncharacteristic thickness gradually decreases in time. As the CS thins, the\nstrength of the reconnecting field increases, and adiabatic invariance in the\ninflowing fluid elements produces a field-biased pressure anisotropy with\nexcess perpendicular pressure. At large plasma beta, this anisotropy excites\nthe mirror instability, which deforms the reconnecting field on ion-Larmor\nscales and dramatically reduces the effective thickness of the CS. Tearing\nmodes whose wavelengths are comparable to that of the mirrors then become\nunstable, triggering reconnection on smaller scales and at earlier times than\nwould have occurred if the thinning CS were to have retained its Harris\nprofile. A novel method for identifying and tracking X-points is introduced,\nyielding X-point separations that are initially intermediate between the\nperpendicular and parallel mirror wavelengths in the upstream plasma.

By asking to find the minimum amount of resources\nrequired to perform a computation under the constraint that the algorithm\nprovides a correct answer with a targeted accuracy, it is possible to optimize\nthe whole computer in order to minimize the resources spent, while being sure\nto have a correct answer with a high probability.

In this paper we propose a\nfeedback controller which stabilizes the system around an arbitrary pressure\nsetpoint, using only topside measurement, and assuming unknown reservoir\nparameters. A particular challenge with this problem is the distributed and\nhighly nonlinear nature of the system dynamics. As the control model we use the\n``reduced Drift Flux Model'' which models gas-liquid flow as a nonlinear\ntransport equation with a non-local integral source term. The observer\nestimates the distributed gas concentration, downhole pressure and reservoir\nparameters by solving the system dynamics backwards relative to how the gas\nrises in the well. The control inputs are then constructed by designing target\nstates over the next sampling period and again solving reversed dynamics to\nobtain the required topside pressures. The resulting controller is implemented\nwith a 2 minute zero-order hold to accommodate the actuation limitation\nsituation on an actual drilling rig. The results are illustrated in simulations\nwith a industry standard Drift Flux formulation as the plant model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 22:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

The current work\npractice is to use majority-voted labels to overrule the disagreement. However,\nin the subjective data labeling tasks such as hate speech annotation,\ndisagreement among individual labelers can be difficult to resolve. In this\npaper, we explored why such disagreements occur using a mixed-method approach -\nincluding interviews with experts, concept mapping exercises, and\nself-reporting items - to develop a multidimensional scale for distilling the\nprocess of how annotators label a hate speech corpus. We tested this scale with\n170 annotators in a hate speech annotation task. Results showed that our scale\ncan reveal facets of individual differences among annotators (e.g., age,\npersonality, etc.), and these facets' relationships to an annotator's final\nlabel decision of an instance. We suggest that this work contributes to the\nunderstanding of how humans annotate data.

However, ML compilers targeting MCMs need\nto solve complex optimization problems optimally and efficiently to achieve\nthis high performance. One such problem is the multi-chip partitioning problem\nwhere compilers determine the optimal partitioning and placement of operations\nin tensor computation graphs on chiplets in MCMs. Partitioning ML graphs for\nMCMs is particularly hard as the search space grows exponentially with the\nnumber of chiplets available and the number of nodes in the neural network.\nFurthermore, the constraints imposed by the underlying hardware produce a\nsearch space where valid solutions are extremely sparse.

The Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism, which\nis one of the most important methods of modern nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics, allows for a systematic derivation of irreversible transport\nequations from reversible microdynamics and thus provides a useful framework\nfor understanding this issue. However, discussions of the Mori-Zwanzig\nformalism in philosophy of physics tend to focus on simple variants rather than\non the more sophisticated ones used in modern physical research. In this work,\nI will close this gap by studying the problems of probability and\nirreversibility using the example of Grabert's time-dependent projection\noperator formalism. This allows to give a more solid mathematical foundation to\nvarious concepts from the philosophical literature, in particular Wallace's\nsimple dynamical conjecture and Robertson's theory of autonomous macrodynamics.\nMoreover, I will explain how the Mori-Zwanzig formalism allows to resolve the\ntension between epistemic and ontic approaches to probability in statistical\nmechanics.

The nanogrid considered in this paper consists of a PV, EV battery, load\nand a turbine supplementary unit.

We propose to tune the AFE\nABP$_2$X$_6$ monolayers into the FE ordering through interface engineering. The\nmechanism is that there are couplings between the charge polarizations of the\nABP$_2$X$_6$ monolayers and the local dipoles as well as the induced electronic\npolarizations in the substrate which have a tendency to stabilize the FE\nordering. We further perform first-principles calculations for CuInP$_2$Se$_6$\nand CuCrP$_2$S$_6$ monolayers and their van der Waals heterostructures. We find\nthat an AFE CuInP$_2$Se$_6$ monolayer becomes FE as interfaced with graphene,\nMoS$_2$, and h-BN monolayers. In contrast, the CuCrP$_2$S$_6$ monolayer remains\nAFE since there is a large energy difference between the AFE and FE phases.\nInterfacing it with a MoTe$_2$ monolayer induces a metal-insulator transition\nfor the heterostructure, whereas interfacing with a polar surface MgO(111) can\ndrive it into FE. The interfacing effect can also be used to manipulate the FE\nproperties of ABP$_2$X$_6$ multilayers. We further find that the AFE-to-FE\ntransition is electrically switchable in these systems. In particular, it is\naccompanied by an indirect-direct band-gap transition for the CuInP$_2$Se$_6$\nmonolayer. Our study offers an effective approach to tune the FE and electronic\nproperties of ABP$_2$X$_6$ thin films for applications in electronics and\noptoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 01:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

Recent observations\nof neutron stars, in both electromagnetic and gravitational-wave spectra, have\nalready constrained significantly the nuclear symmetry energy at high\ndensities. Training deep neural networks to learn a computationally efficient\nrepresentation of the mapping between astrophysical observables of neutron\nstars, such as masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities, and the nuclear\nsymmetry energy allows its density dependence to be determined reliably and\naccurately.

The\nquestion is, does its quantum perturbations decohere with an inflationary\nexpansion of the universe.

We use a few simple\nquantum mechanical models to expound where the fallacy originated: The highly\nsqueezed ellipse quadrature in phase space cannot be simplified to a line, and\nthe Wigner function cannot be replaced by a delta function. These amount to\ntaking only the leading order contributions in seeking the semiclassical limit\nand ignoring the subdominant contributions where quantum features reside. Doing\nso violates the bounds of the Wigner function, and its wave functions possess\nnegative eigenvalues. Moreover, the Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty relation\nfor a pure state is violated. For inflationary cosmological perturbations, in\naddition to these features, entanglement exists between the created pairs. This\nuniquely quantum feature cannot be easily argued away. Indeed it could be our\nbest hope to retroduce the quantum nature of cosmological perturbations and the\ntrace of an inflaton field.

Existing mechanistic\nmodels nicely capture the disease dynamics. However, to forecast the future,\nthey require the transmission rate to be known, limiting their prediction\npower. Typically, a hypothesis is made on the form of the transmission rate\nwith respect to time. Yet the real form is too complex to be mechanistically\nmodeled due to the unknown dynamics of many influential factors. We tackle this\nproblem by using a hypothesis-free machine-learning algorithm to estimate the\ntransmission rate from data on non-pharmaceutical policies, and in turn\nforecast the confirmed cases using a mechanistic disease model. More\nspecifically, we build a hybrid model consisting of a mechanistic ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) model and a generalized boosting model (GBM). To\ncalibrate the parameters, we develop an \"inverse method\" that obtains the\ntransmission rate inversely in time from the other variables in the ODE model\nand then feed it into the GBM to connect with the policy data. The resulting\nmodel forecasted the number of daily confirmed cases up to 35 days in the\nfuture in the United States with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of\n27%. Being partly data-driven, the method is more accurate than typical\nmechanistic models and meanwhile more intuitive, and possibly reliable, than\npurely data-based machine learning models.

To address this issue, we\npropose the Semantic Pyramid Network (SPN) motivated by the idea that learning\nmulti-scale semantic priors from specific pretext tasks can greatly benefit the\nrecovery of locally missing content in images. SPN consists of two components.\nFirst, it distills semantic priors from a pretext model into a multi-scale\nfeature pyramid, achieving a consistent understanding of the global context and\nlocal structures. Within the prior learner, we present an optional module for\nvariational inference to realize probabilistic image inpainting driven by\nvarious learned priors. The second component of SPN is a fully context-aware\nimage generator, which adaptively and progressively refines low-level visual\nrepresentations at multiple scales with the (stochastic) prior pyramid. We\ntrain the prior learner and the image generator as a unified model without any\npost-processing.

Recent observations of the galaxy redshift survey provide\nrelevant data to confront the principle with observation. We present a\nhomogeneity test for the matter distribution using the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy\nsample and clarify the ontological status of the CP. As a homogeneity\ncriterion, we compare the observed data with similarly constructed random\ndistributions using the number count in the truncated cones method. Comparisons\nare also made with three theoretical results using the same method: (i) the\ndark matter halo mock catalogs from the N-body simulation, (ii) the log-normal\ndistributions derived from the theoretical matter power spectrum, and (iii)\ndirect estimation from the theoretical power spectrum. We show that the\nobserved distribution is statistically impossible as a random distribution up\nto 300 Mpc/h in radius, which is around the largest statistically available\nscale. However, comparisons with the three theoretical results show that the\nobserved distribution is consistent with these theoretically derived results\nbased on the CP. We show that the observed galaxy distribution (light) and the\nsimulated dark matter distribution (matter) are quite inhomogeneous even on a\nlarge scale. Here, we clarify that there is no inconsistency surrounding the\nontological status of the CP in cosmology. In practice, the CP is applied to\nthe metric and the metric fluctuation is extremely small in all cosmological\nscales. This allows the CP to be valid as the averaged background in metric.\nThe matter fluctuation, however, is decoupled from the small nature of metric\nfluctuation in the subhorizon scale. What is directly related to the matter in\nEinstein's gravity is the curvature, a quadratic derivative of the metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 06:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

To achieve this, DA methods include a source classification\nobjective to extract the source knowledge and a domain alignment objective to\ndiminish the domain shift, ensuring knowledge transfer. Typically, former DA\nmethods adopt some weight hyper-parameters to linearly combine the training\nobjectives to form an overall objective. However, the gradient directions of\nthese objectives may conflict with each other due to domain shift. Under such\ncircumstances, the linear optimization scheme might decrease the overall\nobjective value at the expense of damaging one of the training objectives,\nleading to restricted solutions.

We argue that new advances on models and metrics\nshould each more directly benefit and inform the other. We therefore propose a\ngeneralization of leaderboards, bidimensional leaderboards (Billboards), that\nsimultaneously tracks progress in language generation models and metrics for\ntheir evaluation. Unlike conventional unidimensional leaderboards that sort\nsubmitted systems by predetermined metrics, a Billboard accepts both generators\nand evaluation metrics as competing entries. A Billboard automatically creates\nan ensemble metric that selects and linearly combines a few metrics based on a\nglobal analysis across generators. Further, metrics are ranked based on their\ncorrelation with human judgments. We release four Billboards for machine\ntranslation, summarization, and image captioning. We demonstrate that a linear\nensemble of a few diverse metrics sometimes substantially outperforms existing\nmetrics in isolation. Our mixed-effects model analysis shows that most\nautomatic metrics, especially the reference-based ones, overrate machine over\nhuman generation, demonstrating the importance of updating metrics as\ngeneration models become stronger (and perhaps more similar to humans) in the\nfuture.

Current detections for it are mostly indirect. The spacetime effects\nof dark energy can be locally described by the SdSw metric. Understanding these\nlocal effects exactly is an essential step towards the direct probe of dark\nenergy. From first principles, we prove that dark energy can exert a repulsive\ndark force on astrophysical scales, different from the Newtonian attraction of\nboth visible and dark matter. One way of measuring local effects of dark energy\nis through the gravitational deflection of light. We geometrize the bending of\nlight in any curved static spacetime. First of all, we define a generalized\ndeflection angle, referred to as the Gaussian deflection angle, in a\nmathematically strict and conceptually clean way. Basing on the Gauss-Bonnet\ntheorem, we then prove that the Gaussian deflection angle is equivalent to the\nsurface integral of the Gaussian curvature over a chosen lensing patch. As an\napplication of the geometrization, we study the problem of whether dark energy\naffects the bending of light and provide a strict solution to this problem in\nthe SdSw spacetime. According to this solution, we propose a method to overcome\nthe difficulty of measuring local dark energy effects. Exactly speaking, we\nfind that the lensing effect of dark energy can be enhanced by 14 orders of\nmagnitude when properly choosing the lensing patch in certain cases. It means\nthat we can probe the existence and nature of dark energy directly in our Solar\nSystem.

How can you rationally\naggregate/combine a finite set of Pareto optimal models while preserving Pareto\nefficiency? This question is nontrivial because weighted model averaging does\nnot, in general, preserve Pareto efficiency. This paper presents an answer in\nfour logical steps: (1) A rational aggregation rule should preserve Pareto\nefficiency (2) Due to the complete class theorem, Pareto optimal models must be\nBayesian, i.e., they minimize a risk where the true state of nature is averaged\nwith respect to some prior. Therefore each Pareto optimal model can be\nassociated with a prior, and Pareto efficiency can be maintained by aggregating\nPareto optimal models through their priors. (3) A prior can be interpreted as a\npreference ranking over models: prior $\\pi$ prefers model A over model B if the\naverage risk of A is lower than the average risk of B. (4) A\nrational/consistent aggregation rule should preserve this preference ranking:\nIf both priors $\\pi$ and $\\pi'$ prefer model A over model B, then the prior\nobtained by aggregating $\\pi$ and $\\pi'$ must also prefer A over B. Under these\nfour steps, we show that all rational/consistent aggregation rules are as\nfollows: Give each individual Pareto optimal model a weight, introduce a weak\norder/ranking over the set of Pareto optimal models, aggregate a finite set of\nmodels S as the model associated with the prior obtained as the weighted\naverage of the priors of the highest-ranked models in S. This result shows that\nall rational/consistent aggregation rules must follow a generalization of\nhierarchical Bayesian modeling.

Although several\nevaluation metrics have been proposed, they generally assess the quality of the\nwhole generated image distribution. For Reference-guided Image Synthesis (RIS)\ntasks, i.e., rendering a source image in the style of another reference image,\nwhere assessing the quality of a single generated image is crucial, these\nmetrics are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a general learning-based\nframework, Reference-guided Image Synthesis Assessment (RISA) to quantitatively\nevaluate the quality of a single generated image. Notably, the training of RISA\ndoes not require human annotations. In specific, the training data for RISA are\nacquired by the intermediate models from the training procedure in RIS, and\nweakly annotated by the number of models' iterations, based on the positive\ncorrelation between image quality and iterations.

Traditionally, the\nconcept of a shortest path is considered for graphs with scalar edge weights,\nwhich makes it possible to compute the length of a path by adding up the\nindividual edge weights. Yet, graphs with scalar edge weights are severely\nlimited in their expressivity, since oftentimes edges are used to encode\nsignificantly more complex interrelations. In this work we compensate for this\nmodelling limitation and introduce the novel graph-theoretic concept of a\nshortest path in a graph with matrix-valued edges. To this end, we define a\nmeaningful way for quantifying the path length for matrix-valued edges, and we\npropose a simple yet effective algorithm to compute the respective shortest\npath.

In this work, we\npropose a Multimodal Training Unimodal Test (MTUT) framework for robust face\nclassification, which exploits the cross-modality relationship during training\nand applies it as a complementary of the imperfect single modality input during\ntesting. Technically, during training, the framework (1) builds both\nintra-modality and cross-modality autoencoders with the aid of facial\nattributes to learn latent embeddings as multimodal descriptors, (2) proposes a\nnovel multimodal embedding divergence loss to align the heterogeneous features\nfrom different modalities, which also adaptively avoids the useless modality\n(if any) from confusing the model. This way, the learned autoencoders can\ngenerate robust embeddings in single-modality face classification on test\nstage.

We focus our attention on the\ndynamics of the so-called `weak' and `strong chaos' spreading regimes [2010,\nEPL 91 30001], for which Anderson localization is destroyed. Based on the fact\nthat large variations of the fundamental frequencies denote strong chaotic\nbehavior, we show that in both regimes chaos is more intense at the central\nregions of the wave packet, where also the energy content is higher, while the\noscillators at the wave packet's edges exhibit regular motion up until the time\nthey gain enough energy to become part of the highly excited portion of the\nwave packet. Eventually, the percentage of chaotic oscillators remains\npractically constant, despite the fact that the number of excited sites grows\nas the wave packet spreads, but the portion of highly chaotic sites decreases\nin time. We show that the extent of the zones of regular motion at the edges of\nthe wave packet in the strong chaos regime is much smaller than in the weak\nchaos case. Furthermore, we find that in the strong chaos regime the chaotic\ncomponent of the wave packet is not only more extended than in the weak chaos\none, but in addition the fraction of strongly chaotic oscillators is much\nhigher. Another important difference between the weak and strong chaos regimes\nis that in the latter case a significantly larger number of frequencies is\nexcited, even from the first stages of the evolution.

For example, when playing table\ntennis, a robot should be capable of returning the ball in various ways while\nprecisely placing it at the desired location. A common approach to model such\nversatile behavior is to use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where each\nexpert is a contextual motion primitive. However, learning such MoEs is\nchallenging as most objectives force the model to cover the entire context\nspace, which prevents specialization of the primitives resulting in rather\nlow-quality components. Starting from maximum entropy reinforcement learning\n(RL), we decompose the objective into optimizing an individual lower bound per\nmixture component. Further, we introduce a curriculum by allowing the\ncomponents to focus on a local context region, enabling the model to learn\nhighly accurate skill representations. To this end, we use local context\ndistributions that are adapted jointly with the expert primitives. Our lower\nbound advocates an iterative addition of new components, where new components\nwill concentrate on local context regions not covered by the current MoE. This\nlocal and incremental learning results in a modular MoE model of high accuracy\nand versatility, where both properties can be scaled by adding more components\non the fly. We demonstrate this by an extensive ablation and on two challenging\nsimulated robot skill learning tasks. We compare our achieved performance to\nLaDiPS and HiREPS, a known hierarchical policy search method for learning\ndiverse skills.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 10:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 12:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

However,\na successful implementation of a scheme of QKD requires identity authentication\nas a prerequisite. A security loophole in the identity authentication scheme\nmay lead to the vulnerability of the entire secure communication scheme.\nConsequently, identity authentication is extremely important and in the last\nthree decades several schemes for identity authentication, using quantum\nresources have been proposed. The chronological development of these protocols,\nwhich are now referred to as quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols,\nare briefly reviewed here with specific attention to the causal connection\ninvolved in their development. The existing protocols are classified on the\nbasis of the required quantum resources and their relative merits and demerits\nare analyzed. Further, in the process of the classification of the protocols\nfor QIA, it's observed that the existing protocols can also be classified in a\nfew groups based on the inherent computational tasks used to design the\nprotocols. Realization of these symmetries has led to the possibility of\ndesigning a set of new protocols for quantum identity authentication, which are\nbased on the existing schemes of the secure computational and communication\ntasks. The security of such protocols is also critically analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 11:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

Unfortunately,\nthis has also given rise to cybercriminals and fraudsters who are constantly\nlooking for vulnerabilities in these systems by deploying increasingly\nsophisticated fraud attacks. A typical fraud detection system employs standard\nsupervised learning methods where the focus is on maximizing the fraud recall\nrate. However, we argue that such a formulation can lead to sub-optimal\nsolutions. The design requirements for these fraud models requires that they\nare robust to the high-class imbalance in the data, adaptive to changes in\nfraud patterns, maintain a balance between the fraud rate and the decline rate\nto maximize revenue, and be amenable to asynchronous feedback since usually\nthere is a significant lag between the transaction and the fraud realization.\nTo achieve this, we formulate fraud detection as a sequential decision-making\nproblem by including the utility maximization within the model in the form of\nthe reward function. The historical decline rate and fraud rate define the\nstate of the system with a binary action space composed of approving or\ndeclining the transaction. In this study, we primarily focus on utility\nmaximization and explore different reward functions to this end. The\nperformance of the proposed Reinforcement Learning system has been evaluated\nfor two publicly available fraud datasets using Deep Q-learning and compared\nwith different classifiers.

One intriguing observations concerns the insulating side of the\ntransition, which exhibits some unusual properties. Among them is its\ncurrent-voltage relation ($I-V$ curve), which includes (1) a conductance that\nchanges abruptly by several orders of magnitude with increasing voltage, (2)\nhysteretic behavior, and (3) multiple (sometimes more than a hundred) smaller\ncurrent jumps near the transition. Some models have been suggested before, but\nno model has been successful in accounting for the observed behavior in full.\nOne commonly used approach is to model the disordered sample as a\ntwo-dimensional array of conducting islands, where charge carriers tunnel from\none island to its neighbors. In those models, fast relaxation is assumed, and\nthe system is treated as always being in electrostatic and thermal equilibrium.\nThose models are successful in explaining some measurement results, including\nthe phase transition itself, but fail to reproduce hysteresis in their\npredicted $I-V$ curves. Here, we suggest incorporating finite relaxation time\ninto an array model. We show that, in the slow relaxation limit, our model can\nreproduce hysteresis and multiple jumps in the $I-V$ curve.

In this research, we present a fully automatic approach to\ndetecting feature correspondences between historical images taken at different\ntimes (i.e., inter-epoch), without auxiliary data required. Based on relative\norientations computed within the same epoch (i.e., intra-epoch), we obtain DSMs\n(Digital Surface Model) and incorporate them in a rough-to-precise matching.\nThe method consists of: (1) an inter-epoch DSMs matching to roughly co-register\nthe orientations and DSMs (i.e, the 3D Helmert transformation), followed by (2)\na precise inter-epoch feature matching using the original RGB images.

In this paper, we studied the efficiency problem of\nadapting widely used XGBoost model in real-world applications to vertical\nfederated learning setting. State-of-the-art vertical federated XGBoost\nframeworks requires large number of encryption operations and ciphertext\ntransmissions, which makes the model training much less efficient than training\nXGBoost models locally. To bridge this gap, we proposed a novel batch\nhomomorphic encryption method to cut the cost of encryption-related computation\nand transmission in nearly half.

Therefore, precisely estimating the\nvisibility under foggy weather can significantly benefit traffic management and\nsafety. To address this, most current methods use professional instruments\noutfitted at fixed locations on the roads to perform the visibility\nmeasurement; these methods are expensive and less flexible. In this paper, we\npropose an innovative end-to-end convolutional neural network framework to\nestimate the visibility leveraging Koschmieder's law exclusively using the\nimage data. The proposed method estimates the visibility by integrating the\nphysical model into the proposed framework, instead of directly predicting the\nvisibility value via the convolutional neural work. Moreover, we estimate the\nvisibility as a pixel-wise visibility map against those of previous visibility\nmeasurement methods which solely predict a single value for an entire image.\nThus, the estimated result of our method is more informative, particularly in\nuneven fog scenarios, which can benefit to developing a more precise early\nwarning system for foggy weather, thereby better protecting the intelligent\ntransportation infrastructure systems and promoting its development. To\nvalidate the proposed framework, a virtual dataset, FACI, containing 3,000\nfoggy images in different concentrations, is collected using the AirSim\nplatform.

But radar is also a\nparticularly challenging sensing modality due to the radar noises. Recent works\nhave made enormous progress in classifying free and occupied spaces in radar\nimages by leveraging lidar label supervision. However, there are still several\nunsolved issues. Firstly, the sensing distance of the results is limited by the\nsensing range of lidar. Secondly, the performance of the results is degenerated\nby lidar due to the physical sensing discrepancies between the two sensors. For\nexample, some objects visible to lidar are invisible to radar, and some objects\noccluded in lidar scans are visible in radar images because of the radar's\npenetrating capability. These sensing differences cause false positive and\npenetrating capability degeneration, respectively.\n  In this paper, we propose training data preprocessing and polar sliding\nwindow inference to solve the issues. The data preprocessing aims to reduce the\neffect caused by radar-invisible measurements in lidar scans. The polar sliding\nwindow inference aims to solve the limited sensing range issue by applying a\nnear-range trained network to the long-range region. Instead of using common\nCartesian representation, we propose to use polar representation to reduce the\nshape dissimilarity between long-range and near-range data. We find that\nextending a near-range trained network to long-range region inference in the\npolar space has 4.2 times better IoU than in Cartesian space.

Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD) is arguably the workhorse algorithm of ML. Distributed ML models trained\nby SGD involve large amounts of gradient communication, which limits the\nscalability of distributed ML. Thus, it is important to compress the gradients\nfor reducing communication. In this paper, we propose FastSGD, a Fast\ncompressed SGD framework for distributed ML. To achieve a high compression\nratio at a low cost, FastSGD represents the gradients as key-value pairs, and\ncompresses both the gradient keys and values in linear time complexity. For the\ngradient value compression, FastSGD first uses a reciprocal mapper to transform\noriginal values into reciprocal values, and then, it utilizes a logarithm\nquantization to further reduce reciprocal values to small integers. Finally,\nFastSGD filters reduced gradient integers by a given threshold. For the\ngradient key compression, FastSGD provides an adaptive fine-grained delta\nencoding method to store gradient keys with fewer bits. Extensive experiments\non practical ML models and datasets demonstrate that FastSGD achieves the\ncompression ratio up to 4 orders of magnitude, and accelerates the convergence\ntime up to 8x, compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 13:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

The\nstandard model of particle physics, delivering excellent results in many\naspects of particle physics but fails at calculating particle masses.\nTherefore, for this paper a Kaluza-Klein like model was developed based on the\nstructure of the Standard Model.

An excitation on a compactified dimension can\ninduce a mass in 4D spacetime; it is accompanied by an integer, the excitation\nnumber, and has a well-defined spin.

Typical models are equipped with the capability to\nreconstruct normal videos and evaluate the reconstruction errors on anomalous\nvideos to indicate the extent of abnormalities.

Firstly, they can only encode the movements of\neach identity independently, without considering the interactions among\nidentities which may also indicate anomalies.

High-level graph\nrepresentations encode the trajectories of people and the interactions among\nmultiple identities while low-level graph representations encode the local body\npostures of each person. Furthermore, we propose to weightedly combine multiple\nbranches that are better at different scenes. An improvement over single-level\ngraph representations is achieved in this way.

High-level graph representations are\nassigned higher weights to encode moving speed and directions of people in\nlow-resolution videos while low-level graph representations are assigned higher\nweights to encode human skeletons in high-resolution videos.

Our\nphysics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a\nProcrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix\nmanifold that respects the physical structure of the system.

We demonstrate piDMD on a range of challenging\nproblems in the physical sciences, including energy-preserving fluid flow,\ntravelling-wave systems, the Schr\\\"odinger equation, solute\nadvection-diffusion, a system with causal dynamics, and three-dimensional\ntransitional channel flow.

It turned out that SrBi2(Ta1-xNbx)2O9\nfilms consist of fine-grained spherical structures for x=0.1-0.4, while the\nformation of rod-like grains occurs for x=0.5 due to the stress-induced\ntransformation of the thin film perovskite structure. Moreover, it was revealed\nthat during Nb cationic substitution Aurivillius phase formation was enhanced\nand become dominated in SBTN thin films and fluorite/pyrochlore phase formation\nwas highly suppressed.

The\nstationary, time-periodic breather modes appear as the discrete breather\nlattice solutions whose period mismatches with a system size.

With residual\nconnection architecture, deeply stacked convolutional neural networks provide a\nsubstantial performance boost for SISR, but their huge parameters and\ncomputational loads are impractical for real-world applications. Thus,\ndesigning lightweight models with acceptable performance is one of the major\ntasks in current SISR research. The objective of lightweight network design is\nto balance a computational load and reconstruction performance. Most of the\nprevious methods have manually designed complex and predefined fixed\nstructures, which generally required a large number of experiments and lacked\nflexibility in the diversity of input image statistics. In this paper, we\npropose a dynamic residual self-attention network (DRSAN) for lightweight SISR,\nwhile focusing on the automated design of residual connections between building\nblocks.

We also propose a residual self-attention (RSA) module to\nfurther boost the performance, which produces 3-dimensional attention maps\nwithout additional parameters by cooperating with residual structures. The\nproposed dynamic scheme, exploiting the combination of DRA and RSA, shows an\nefficient trade-off between computational complexity and network performance.\nExperimental results show that the DRSAN performs better than or comparable to\nexisting state-of-the-art lightweight models for SISR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 06:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-02"}

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view DL approach for\nBI-RADS and density assessment of mammograms. The proposed approach first\ndeploys deep convolutional networks for feature extraction on each view\nseparately. The extracted features are then stacked and fed into a Light\nGradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier to predict BI-RADS and density\nscores. We conduct extensive experiments on both the internal mammography\ndataset and the public dataset Digital Database for Screening Mammography\n(DDSM). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms the single-view classification approach on two benchmark datasets\nby huge F1-score margins (+5% on the internal dataset and +10% on the DDSM\ndataset). These results highlight the vital role of combining multi-view\ninformation to improve the performance of breast cancer risk prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 10:59:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 04:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

They aggregate global information from input\nfeatures along entire spatial dimensions but behave differently during training\nand inference in image restoration tasks: they are based on different regions,\nnamely the cropped patches (from images) and the full-resolution images. This\npaper revisits global information aggregation and finds that the image-based\nfeatures during inference have a different distribution than the patch-based\nfeatures during training. This train-test inconsistency negatively impacts the\nperformance of models, which is severely overlooked by previous works. To\nreduce the inconsistency and improve test-time performance, we propose a simple\nmethod called Test-time Local Converter (TLC). Our TLC converts global\noperations to local ones only during inference so that they aggregate features\nwithin local spatial regions rather than the entire large images. The proposed\nmethod can be applied to various global modules (e.g., normalization, channel\nand spatial attention) with negligible costs. Without the need for any\nfine-tuning, TLC improves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration\ntasks, including single-image motion deblurring, video deblurring, defocus\ndeblurring, and image denoising. In particular, with TLC, our Restormer-Local\nimproves the state-of-the-art result in single image deblurring from 32.92 dB\nto 33.57 dB on GoPro dataset.

In this study, we proposed an unsupervised Binary Change\nGuided hyperspectral multiclass change detection Network (BCG-Net) for HMCD,\nwhich aims at boosting the multiclass change detection result and unmixing\nresult with the mature binary change detection approaches. In BCG-Net, a novel\npartial-siamese united-unmixing module is designed for multi-temporal spectral\nunmixing, and a groundbreaking temporal correlation constraint directed by the\npseudo-labels of binary change detection result is developed to guide the\nunmixing process from the perspective of change detection, encouraging the\nabundance of the unchanged pixels more coherent and that of the changed pixels\nmore accurate. Moreover, an innovative binary change detection rule is put\nforward to deal with the problem that traditional rule is susceptible to\nnumerical values. The iterative optimization of the spectral unmixing process\nand the change detection process is proposed to eliminate the accumulated\nerrors and bias from unmixing result to change detection result.

Often, these are modelled\nseparately through statistical models by decomposing the object's features into\na set of basis functions through principal geodesic analysis or principal\ncomponent analysis. This study presents a statistical modelling method for\nautomatic learning of shape, pose and intensity features in medical images\nwhich we call the Dynamic multi feature-class Gaussian process models\n(DMFC-GPM). A DMFC-GPM is a Gaussian process (GP)-based model with a shared\nlatent space that encodes linear and non-linear variation. Our method is\ndefined in a continuous domain with a principled way to represent shape, pose\nand intensity feature classes in a linear space, based on deformation fields. A\ndeformation field-based metric is adapted in the method for modelling shape and\nintensity feature variation as well as for comparing rigid transformations\n(pose). Moreover, DMFC-GPMs inherit properties intrinsic to GPs including\nmarginalisation and regression. Furthermore, they allow for adding additional\npose feature variability on top of those obtained from the image acquisition\nprocess; what we term as permutation modelling. For image analysis tasks using\nDMFC-GPMs, we adapt Metropolis-Hastings algorithms making the prediction of\nfeatures fully probabilistic. We validate the method using controlled synthetic\ndata and we perform experiments on bone structures from CT images of the\nshoulder to illustrate the efficacy of the model for pose and shape feature\nprediction. The model performance results suggest that this new modelling\nparadigm is robust, accurate, accessible, and has potential applications\nincluding the management of musculoskeletal disorders and clinical decision\nmaking\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 15:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

While there is a growing body of literature on fairness in analysis\nof fully observed data, there has been little theoretical work on investigating\nfairness in analysis of incomplete data. In practice, a popular analytical\napproach for dealing with missing data is to use only the set of complete\ncases, i.e., observations with all features fully observed to train a\nprediction algorithm. However, depending on the missing data mechanism, the\ndistribution of complete cases and the distribution of the complete data may be\nsubstantially different. When the goal is to develop a fair algorithm in the\ncomplete data domain where there are no missing values, an algorithm that is\nfair in the complete case domain may show disproportionate bias towards some\nmarginalized groups in the complete data domain. To fill this significant gap,\nwe study the problem of estimating fairness in the complete data domain for an\narbitrary model evaluated merely using complete cases. We provide upper and\nlower bounds on the fairness estimation error and conduct numerical experiments\nto assess our theoretical results. Our work provides the first known\ntheoretical results on fairness guarantee in analysis of incomplete data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 17:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

In this\nstudy, we performed a comparative study of an important material property, the\nsurface energy, of seven tholin samples produced in three independent\nlaboratories under a broad range of experimental conditions, and explored their\ncommonalities and differences. All seven tholin samples are found to have high\nsurface energies, and are therefore highly cohesive. Thus, if the surface\nsediments on Titan are similar to tholins, future missions such as Dragonfly\nwill likely encounter sticky sediments. We also identified a commonality\nbetween all the tholin samples: a high dispersive (non-polar) surface energy\ncomponent of at least 30 mJ/m2. This common property could be shared by the\nactual haze particles on Titan as well. Given that the most abundant species\ninteracting with the haze on Titan (methane, ethane, and nitrogen) are\nnon-polar in nature, the dispersive surface energy component of the haze\nparticles could be a determinant factor in condensate-haze and haze-lake\nliquids interactions on Titan. With this common trait of tholin samples, we\nconfirmed the findings of a previous study by Yu et al.

To capture such periodicity, existing\nstudies either fuse the periodic hidden states into channels for networks to\nlearn or apply extra periodic strategies to the network architecture. In this\npaper, we devise a novel periodic residual learning network (PRNet) for a\nbetter modeling of periodicity in crowd flow data. Unlike existing methods,\nPRNet frames the crowd flow forecasting as a periodic residual learning problem\nby modeling the variation between the inputs (the previous time period) and the\noutputs (the future time period). Compared to directly predicting crowd flows\nthat are highly dynamic, learning more stationary deviation is much easier,\nwhich thus facilitates the model training. Besides, the learned variation\nenables the network to produce the residual between future conditions and its\ncorresponding weekly observations at each time interval, and therefore\ncontributes to substantially more accurate multi-step ahead predictions.\nExtensive experiments show that PRNet can be easily integrated into existing\nmodels to enhance their predictive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 12:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 13:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Many existing studies rely on such\nsensory data for human activity recognition (HAR); however, one of the major\nbottlenecks is their reliance on pre-annotated or labeled data. Manual\nhuman-driven annotations are neither scalable nor efficient, whereas existing\nauto-annotation techniques heavily depend on video signatures. Still,\nvideo-based auto-annotation needs high computation resources and has privacy\nconcerns when the data from a personal space, like a smart-home, is transferred\nto the cloud.

We utilize acoustic-based\npre-trained HAR models for cross-modal labeling of the IMU data even when two\nindividuals perform simultaneous but different activities under the same\nenvironmental context. We observe that non-overlapping acoustic gaps exist with\na high probability during the simultaneous activities performed by two\nindividuals in the environment's acoustic context, which helps us resolve the\noverlapping activity signatures to label them individually.

Cross-domain recommendation as a\ndomain adaptation framework has been utilized to efficiently address these\nchallenging issues, by exploiting information from multiple domains. In this\nstudy, an item-level relevance cross-domain recommendation task is explored,\nwhere two related domains, that is, the source and the target domain contain\ncommon items without sharing sensitive information regarding the users'\nbehavior, and thus avoiding the leak of user privacy. In light of this\nscenario, two novel coupled autoencoder-based deep learning methods are\nproposed for cross-domain recommendation. The first method aims to\nsimultaneously learn a pair of autoencoders in order to reveal the intrinsic\nrepresentations of the items in the source and target domains, along with a\ncoupled mapping function to model the non-linear relationships between these\nrepresentations, thus transferring beneficial information from the source to\nthe target domain. The second method is derived based on a new joint\nregularized optimization problem, which employs two autoencoders to generate in\na deep and non-linear manner the user and item-latent factors, while at the\nsame time a data-driven function is learnt to map the item-latent factors\nacross domains. Extensive numerical experiments on two publicly available\nbenchmark datasets are conducted illustrating the superior performance of our\nproposed methods compared to several state-of-the-art cross-domain\nrecommendation frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 15:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 22:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 01:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 23:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Disambiguation\nof these acronyms will help researchers better understand the meaning of\nvocabulary in the documents.

To address the above issue, this paper proposes an new method\nfor acronym disambiguation, named as ADBCMM, which can significantly improve\nthe performance of low-resource languages by building counterfactuals and\nmultilingual mixing. Specifically, by balancing data bias in low-resource\nlangauge, ADBCMM will able to improve the test performance outside the data\nset.

For example, any\nmeteorological description of a weather condition and explanation of its\nevolution recurs to meteorological structures, such as convection and\ncirculation structures, cloud fields and rain fronts. All of these are\nspatiotemporal structures, defined by time-dependent patterns in the underlying\nfields. Typically, such a structure is defined by a verbal description that\ncorresponds to the more or less uniform, often somewhat vague mental images of\nthe experts.\n  However, a precise, formal definition of the structures or, more generally,\nconcepts is often desirable, e.g., to enable automated data analysis or the\ndevelopment of phenomenological models. Here, we present a systematic approach\nand an interactive tool to obtain formal definitions of spatiotemporal\nstructures. The tool enables experts to evaluate and compare different\nstructure definitions on the basis of data sets with time-dependent fields that\ncontain the respective structure. Since structure definitions are typically\nparameterized, an essential part is to identify parameter ranges that lead to\ndesired structures in all time steps. In addition, it is important to allow a\nquantitative assessment of the resulting structures simultaneously. We\ndemonstrate the use of the tool by applying it to two meteorological examples:\nfinding structure definitions for vortex cores and center lines of temporarily\nevolving tropical cyclones.\n  Ideally, structure definitions should be objective and applicable to as many\ndata sets as possible. However, finding such definitions, e.g., for the common\natmospheric structures in meteorology, can only be a long-term goal. The\nproposed procedure, together with the presented tool, is just a first approach\nto facilitate this long and arduous way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 16:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Describing the severity parameters of\ndust clouds is critical to the safety management and risk assessment of dust\nexplosions. These parameters are determined experimentally in a 20L spherical\nvessel, following the ASTM E1226 or UNE 14034 standards. Since their\nreproducibility depends on the levels of turbulence associated with the dust\ncloud, a computational model of the multi-phase (gas-solid) flow is used to\nsimulate the dispersion process with the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM. The\nmodel is successfully validated against experimental measurements from the\nliterature and numerical results of a commercial CFD code. In addition, this\nstudy considers the impact of particle size on the turbulence of the carrier\nphase, suggesting that particles attenuate its turbulence intensity. Moreover,\nthe model predicts well the formation of a two-vortex flow pattern, which has a\nnegative impact on the distribution of the particle-laden flows with d<=100 um,\nas most of the particles concentrate at the near-wall region. Contrarily, an\nimproved homogeneity of dust cloud is observed for a case fed with larger\nparticles (d=200 um), as the increased inertia of these particles allows them\nto enter into the re-circulation regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 08:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

This latitude\nis not withoutr estriction, and a specific biophysical constraint is explored.\nSpecifically, a nearly two- to five-fold discrepancy in backbone hydrogen\nbonding is observed between sub-molecules in Protein Data Bank files of the\nspike glycoprotein yielding two conclusions: mutagenic residues in the\nreceptor-binding subunit of the spike much more frequently do not participate\nin backbone hydrogen bonds; and a technique of viral escape is therefore to\nremove such bonds within physico-chemical and functional constraints.

Numerous research efforts\nare quantifying the impacts of CV applications, assuming instant and accurate\ncommunication among vehicles, devices, pedestrians, infrastructure, the\nnetwork, the cloud, and the grid, collectively known as V2X\n(vehicle-to-everything). The use of cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), to\nshare data is emerging as an efficient means to achieve this objective.
