To tackle that,\nwe propose an effective knowledge distillation framework for contrastive\nsentence embeddings, termed DistilCSE. It first applies knowledge distillation\non a large amount of unlabeled data, and then fine-tunes student models through\ncontrastive learning on limited labeled data. To achieve better distillation\nresults, we further propose Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (CKD).

In this work, a modified neuroevolution technique is presented\nwhich incorporates multi-level optimisation. The presented approach adapts\nevolution strategies for evolving an ensemble model based on the bagging\ntechnique, using genetic operators for optimising single anomaly detection\nmodels, reducing the training dataset to speedup the search process and perform\nnon-gradient fine tuning. Multivariate anomaly detection as an unsupervised\nlearning task is the case study upon which the presented approach is tested.\nSingle model optimisation is based on mutation and crossover operators and is\nfocused on finding optimal window sizes, the number of layers, layer depths,\nhyperparameters etc. to boost the anomaly detection scores of new and already\nknown models. The proposed framework and its protocol shows that it is possible\nto find architecture within a reasonable time frame which can boost all well\nknown multivariate anomaly detection deep learning architectures.

Motifs are small subgraphs that occur repeatedly in a\nnetwork, such as triangles or chains. Recent work has generalized motifs to\ntemporal and dynamic network data. However, existing techniques do not\ngeneralize to sequential or trajectory data, which represents entities moving\nthrough the nodes of a network, such as passengers moving through\ntransportation networks. The unit of observation in these data is fundamentally\ndifferent, since we analyze full observations of trajectories (e.g., a trip\nfrom airport A to airport C through airport B), rather than independent\nobservations of edges or snapshots of graphs over time. In this work, we define\nsequential motifs in trajectory data, which are small, directed, and\nedge-weighted subgraphs corresponding to patterns in observed sequences. We\ndraw a connection between counting and analysis of sequential motifs and\nHigher-Order Network (HON) models. We show that by mapping edges of a HON,\nspecifically a $k$th-order DeBruijn graph, to sequential motifs, we can count\nand evaluate their importance in observed data.

These masks affect the performance of previous face\nrecognition systems, as they hide important identity information. In this\npaper, we propose a mask-invariant face recognition solution (MaskInv) that\nutilizes template-level knowledge distillation within a training paradigm that\naims at producing embeddings of masked faces that are similar to those of\nnon-masked faces of the same identities. In addition to the distilled\nknowledge, the student network benefits from additional guidance by\nmargin-based identity classification loss, ElasticFace, using masked and\nnon-masked faces.

Our results are first derived under a general local Lipschitz\nassumption on the forward map. We then verify the assumption for two non-linear\ninverse problems arising from elliptic partial differential equations, the\nDarcy flow model from geophysics as well as a model for the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation appearing in tomography.

Quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been\nproposed to efficiently solve impurity models by preparing and evolving the\nground state under the impurity Hamiltonian on a quantum computer that is\nassumed to have the scalability and accuracy far beyond the current\nstate-of-the-art quantum hardware. As a proof of principle demonstration\ntargeting the Anderson impurity model we close the DMFT loop with current noisy\nhardware. With a highly optimized fast-forwarding quantum circuit and a noise\nresilient spectral analysis we observe a Mott phase transition. Based on a\nCartan decomposition, our algorithm gives a fixed depth, fast-forwarding,\nquantum circuit that can evolve the initial state over arbitrarily long times\nwithout time-discretization errors typical of other product decomposition\nformulas such as Trotter decomposition. By exploiting the structure of the\nfast-forwarding circuits we reduce the gate count (to 77 CNOTs after\noptimization), simulate the dynamics, and extract frequencies from the Anderson\nimpurity model on noisy quantum hardware. We then demonstrate the Mott\ntransition by mapping the full metal-insulator phase-diagram.

Studying causal effects between events goes beyond correlation\nanalysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However,\nincorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is\nchallenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic\nsocial environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect\nboth potential causes and outcomes.

We allocate a fixed parameter budget and compare pruning a\nsingle model with a multitask objective against the best ensemble of\nsingle-task models. We find that under two pruning strategies (element-wise and\nrank pruning), the approach with the multitask objective outperforms training\nmodels separately when averaged across all tasks, and it is competitive on each\nindividual one. Additional analysis finds that using a multitask objective\nduring pruning can also be an effective method for reducing model sizes for\nlow-resource tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 17:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

In\naddition, by tracing the azimuthal variation of the neutral fraction, we are\nable to see how our observing perspective affects this measurement. The high\ninclination of NGC 7331 allows us to glimpse the internal walls of the\nmolecular ring. There, young bright stars emit UV radiation causing more [CII]\nemission to be produced in the ionized gas. On the outer walls, opaque dust\nshrouds the rest of the ring, making the neutral medium the dominant source of\n[CII] emission. Through spatial analysis comparing the [CII] emission to\ntracers of gas heating, we are able to investigate how the photoelectric\nheating efficiency varies throughout NGC 7331 and extend global measurements of\nthe [CII] deficit to local environments. Since the origin of [CII] emission has\ntypically been studied in face-on galaxies, our results shed a new light on the\ninterpretation of [CII] emission especially when studying distant galaxies with\nunknown inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 17:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

A linear time algorithm for computing the longest letter-duplicated\nsubsequence (LLDS) of $S$ can be easily obtained. In this paper, we focus on\ntwo variants of this problem.

Here, we identify a set of robust, low-dimensional\nclusters that 1) summarize the timings and relative heights of four historical\nCOVID-19 \"wave opportunities\" accessible to all 50 U.S. states, 2) correlate\nwith geographical and intervention patterns associated with those groups of\nstates they encompass, and 3) predict aspects of the \"fifth wave\" of new\ninfections in the late Summer of 2021.

A KG is a curated set of\nfacts consisting of entities linked by relations. Certain facts include also\ntemporal information forming a Temporal KG (TKG). Although many natural\nquestions involve explicit or implicit time constraints, question answering\n(QA) over TKGs has been a relatively unexplored area. Existing solutions are\nmainly designed for simple temporal questions that can be answered directly by\na single TKG fact. This paper puts forth a comprehensive embedding-based\nframework for answering complex questions over TKGs. Our method termed temporal\nquestion reasoning (TempoQR) exploits TKG embeddings to ground the question to\nthe specific entities and time scope it refers to. It does so by augmenting the\nquestion embeddings with context, entity and time-aware information by\nemploying three specialized modules. The first computes a textual\nrepresentation of a given question, the second combines it with the entity\nembeddings for entities involved in the question, and the third generates\nquestion-specific time embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based encoder learns\nto fuse the generated temporal information with the question representation,\nwhich is used for answer predictions. Extensive experiments show that TempoQR\nimproves accuracy by 25--45 percentage points on complex temporal questions\nover state-of-the-art approaches and it generalizes better to unseen question\ntypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 23:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Spatial arrangement estimation is the\nprocess of identifying the areas which contain the desired objects in overhead\nimages. Traditional supervised object detection approaches can estimate\naccurate spatial arrangement but require large amounts of bounding box\nannotations. Recent semi-supervised clustering approaches can reduce manual\nlabeling but still require annotations for all object categories in the image.\nThis paper presents the target-guided generative model (TGGM), under the\nVariational Auto-encoder (VAE) framework, which uses Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMM) to estimate the distributions of both hidden and decoder variables in\nVAE. Modeling both hidden and decoder variables by GMM reduces the required\nmanual annotations significantly for spatial arrangement estimation. Unlike\nexisting approaches that the training process can only update the GMM as a\nwhole in the optimization iterations (e.g., a \"minibatch\"), TGGM allows the\nupdate of individual GMM components separately in the same optimization\niteration. Optimizing GMM components separately allows TGGM to exploit the\nsemantic relationships in spatial data and requires only a few labels to\ninitiate and guide the generative process. Our experiments shows that TGGM\nachieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and\noutperforms unsupervised methods by 10% based on the $F_{1}$ scores, while\nrequiring significantly fewer labeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 19:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

For\ninstance, if subjects know that one choice is much more likely than the other,\nthey can make that choice when evidence is weak. A common hypothesis for these\nkinds of tasks is that the prior is stored in neural activity. Here we propose\na different hypothesis: the prior is stored in synaptic strengths. We study the\nInternational Brain Laboratory task, in which a grating appears on either the\nright or left side of a screen, and a mouse has to move a wheel to bring the\ngrating to the center. The grating is often low in contrast which makes the\ntask relatively difficult, and the prior probability that the grating appears\non the right is either 80% or 20%, in (unsignaled) blocks of about 50 trials.\nWe model this as a reinforcement learning task, using a feedforward neural\nnetwork to map states to actions, and adjust the weights of the network to\nmaximize reward, learning via policy gradient. Our model uses an internal state\nthat stores an estimate of the grating and confidence, and follows Bayesian\nupdates, and can switch between engaged and disengaged states to mimic animal\nbehavior. This model reproduces the main experimental finding - that the\npsychometric curve with respect to contrast shifts after a block switch in\nabout 10 trials. Also, as seen in the experiments, in our model the difference\nin neuronal activity in the right and left blocks is small - it is virtually\nimpossible to decode block structure from activity on single trials if noise is\nabout 2%. The hypothesis that priors are stored in weights is difficult to\ntest, but the technology to do so should be available in the not so distant\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 20:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 00:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

However, confusions sometimes arise between the\ntwo types of SNRs. The first one is the output-referred SNR which measures the\nratio between the signal and the noise seen at the sensor's output. This SNR is\neasy to compute, and it is linear in the log-log scale for most image sensors.\nThe second SNR is the exposure-referred SNR, also known as the input-referred\nSNR. This SNR considers the noise at the input by including a derivative term\nto the output-referred SNR. The two SNRs have similar behaviors for sensors\nwith a large full-well capacity. However, for sensors with a small full-well\ncapacity, the exposure-referred SNR can capture some behaviors that the\noutput-referred SNR cannot.\n  While the exposure-referred SNR has been known and used by the industry for a\nlong time, a theoretically rigorous derivation from a signal processing\nperspective is lacking. In particular, while various equations can be found in\ndifferent sources of the literature, there is currently no paper that attempts\nto assemble, derive, and organize these equations in one place.

In complex disease where multiple phenotypes are\navailable and correlated, analyzing and interpreting associated genes for each\nphenotype respectively may decrease statistical power and lose intepretation\ndue to not considering the correlation between phenotypes. The typical\napproaches are many global testing methods, such as multivariate analysis of\nvariance (MANOVA), which tests the overall association between phenotypes and\neach gene, without considersing the heterogeneity among phenotypes. In this\npaper, we extend and evaluate two p-value combination methods, adaptive\nweighted Fisher's method (AFp) and adaptive Fisher's method (AFz), to tackle\nthis problem, where AFp stands out as our final proposed method, based on\nextensive simulations and a real application.

Secondly, AFp takes\nthe p-values from the test of association of each phenotype as input, thus can\naccommodate different types of phenotypes (continuous, binary and count).\nThirdly, we also apply bootstrapping to construct a variability index for the\nweight estimator of AFp and generate a co-membership matrix to categorize\n(cluster) genes based on their association-patterns for intuitive biological\ninvestigations. Through extensive simulations, AFp shows superior performance\nover global testing methods in terms of type I error control and statistical\npower, as well as higher accuracy of 0-1 weights estimation over AFz.

Thus, it is critical to optimize mitigation techniques\nto explicitly suit the target application as well as the noise characteristics\nof the target machine.\n  We propose VAQEM, which dynamically tailors existing error mitigation\ntechniques to the actual, dynamic noisy execution characteristics of VQAs on a\ntarget quantum machine. We do so by tuning specific features of these\nmitigation techniques similar to the traditional rotation angle parameters - by\ntargeting improvements towards a specific objective function which represents\nthe VQA problem at hand.

One common scalable dispatching paradigm is the\n``power-of-$d$,'' in which the dispatcher queries $d$ servers at random and\nassigns the job to a server based only on the state of the queried servers. The\nbulk of power-of-$d$ policies studied in the literature assume that the system\nis homogeneous, meaning that all servers have the same speed; meanwhile\nreal-world systems often exhibit server speed heterogeneity.\n  This paper introduces a general framework for describing and analyzing\nheterogeneity-aware power-of-$d$ policies. The key idea behind our framework is\nthat dispatching policies can make use of server speed information at two\ndecision points: when choosing which $d$ servers to query, and when assigning a\njob to one of those servers. Our framework explicitly separates the dispatching\npolicy into a querying rule and an assignment rule; we consider general\nfamilies of both rule types.\n  While the strongest assignment rules incorporate both detailed queue-length\ninformation and server speed information, these rules typically are difficult\nto analyze. We overcome this difficulty by focusing on heterogeneity-aware\nassignment rules that ignore queue length information beyond idleness status.\nIn this setting, we analyze mean response time and formulate novel optimization\nproblems for the joint optimization of querying and assignment. We build upon\nour optimized policies to develop heuristic queue length-aware dispatching\npolicies. Our heuristic policies perform well in simulation, relative to\npolicies that have appeared in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 20:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 03:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Analyzing compressed data\ndirectly (without decompressing it) can save space and time by orders of\nmagnitude. In this work, we focus on fundamental sequence comparison problems\nand try to quantify the gain in time complexity when the underlying data is\nhighly compressible. We consider grammar compression, which unifies many\npractically relevant compression schemes. For two strings of total length $N$\nand total compressed size $n$, it is known that the edit distance and a longest\ncommon subsequence (LCS) can be computed exactly in time $\\tilde{O}(nN)$, as\nopposed to $O(N^2)$ for the uncompressed setting. Many applications need to\nalign multiple sequences simultaneously, and the fastest known exact algorithms\nfor median edit distance and LCS of $k$ strings run in $O(N^k)$ time. This\nnaturally raises the question of whether compression can help to reduce the\nrunning time significantly for $k \\geq 3$, perhaps to $O(N^{k/2}n^{k/2})$ or\n$O(Nn^{k-1})$. Unfortunately, we show lower bounds that rule out any\nimprovement beyond $\\Omega(N^{k-1}n)$ time for any of these problems assuming\nthe Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.\n  At the same time, we show that approximation and compression together can be\nsurprisingly effective. We develop an $\\tilde{O}(N^{k/2}n^{k/2})$-time FPTAS\nfor the median edit distance of $k$ sequences. In comparison, no\n$O(N^{k-\\Omega(1)})$-time PTAS is known for the median edit distance problem in\nthe uncompressed setting. For two strings, we get an\n$\\tilde{O}(N^{2/3}n^{4/3})$-time FPTAS for both edit distance and LCS. In\ncontrast, for uncompressed strings, there is not even a subquadratic algorithm\nfor LCS that has less than a polynomial gap in the approximation factor.\nBuilding on the insight from our approximation algorithms, we also obtain\nresults for many distance measures including the edit, Hamming, and shift\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

We propose an adaptive\nvariant of the DW model in which the nodes of a network can (1) alter their\nopinions when they interact with neighboring nodes and (2) break connections\nwith neighbors based on an opinion tolerance threshold and then form new\nconnections following the principle of homophily. This opinion tolerance\nthreshold determines whether or not the opinions of adjacent nodes are\nsufficiently different to be viewed as `discordant'. Using numerical\nsimulations, we find that our adaptive DW model requires a larger confidence\nbound than a baseline DW model for the nodes of a network to achieve a\nconsensus opinion. In one region of parameter space, we observe\n`pseudo-consensus' steady states, in which there exist multiple subclusters of\nan opinion cluster with opinions that differ from each other by a small amount.\nIn our simulations, we also examine the importance of early-time dynamics and\nnodes with initially moderate opinions for achieving consensus.

A popular version of the LDs consists in computing the arc-length of\ntrajectories over a calibrated time-window. Herein we introduce and exploit an\nintrinsic geometrical parametrisation of LDs, free of the time variable, for 1\ndegree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems. The parametrisation depends solely on\nthe energy of the system and on the geometry of the associated level curve. We\ndiscuss applications of this framework on classical problems on the plane and\ncylinder, including the cat's eye, 8-shaped and fish-tail separatrices.

MANA-2.0 is an enhancement of previous work, the original MANA,\nwhich interposes MPI calls, and is a work in progress intended for production\ndeployment. MANA-2.0 implements a series of new algorithms and features that\nimprove MANA's scalability and reliability, enabling transparent\ncheckpoint-restart over thousands of MPI processes. MANA-2.0 is being tested on\ntoday's Cori supercomputer at NERSC using Cray MPICH library over the Cray GNI\nnetwork, but it is designed to work over any standard MPI running over an\narbitrary network. Two widely-used HPC applications were selected to\ndemonstrate the enhanced features of MANA-2.0: GROMACS, a molecular dynamics\nsimulation code with frequent point-to-point communication, and VASP, a\nmaterials science code with frequent MPI collective communication. Perhaps the\nmost important lesson to be learned from MANA-2.0 is a series of algorithms and\ndata structures for library-based transformations that enable MPI-based\ncomputations over MANA-2.0 to reliably survive the checkpoint-restart\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 22:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

The resulting dramatic\nincrease in spectral resolution enabled us to resolve the anisotropy of the\nelectric field gradient and to measure the magnetic and quadrupolar relaxation\nchannels separately. Perpendicular magnetic fields nominally do not couple to\nthe low energy degrees of freedom, but we find a significant nonlinear\ncontribution for sufficiently large fields that give rise to a rich phase\ndiagram. The in-plane magnetic field can act either as an effective transverse\nor longitudinal field to the Ising nematic order, depending on the orientation\nrelative to the principle axes of the quadrupole order, and leads to a marked\nin-plane anisotropy in both relaxation channels. We find that the small\nin-plane transverse fields initially enhance the ferroquadrupolar ordering\ntemperature but eventually suppress the long-range order.

To reduce the network-wide energy consumption\nand extend the standby time of IMDs and SBSs, under the proportional\ncomputation resource allocation and devices' latency constraints, we jointly\nperform the device association, computation offloading and resource allocation\nto minimize the network-wide energy consumption for ultra-dense multi-device\nand multi-task IoT networks. To further balance the network loads and fully\nutilize the computation resources, we take account of multi-step computation\noffloading.

One of the main open challenges is how to directly generate a desirable\nqudit state in the SPDC process. This problem can be addressed through advanced\ncomputational learning methods; however, due to difficulties in modeling the\nSPDC process by a fully differentiable algorithm that takes into account all\ninteraction effects, progress has been limited. Here, we overcome these\nlimitations and introduce a physically-constrained and differentiable model,\nvalidated against experimental results for shaped pump beams and structured\ncrystals, capable of learning every interaction parameter in the process. We\navoid any restrictions induced by the stochastic nature of our physical model\nand integrate the dynamic equations governing the evolution under the SPDC\nHamiltonian. We solve the inverse problem of designing a nonlinear quantum\noptical system that achieves the desired quantum state of down-converted photon\npairs. The desired states are defined using either the second-order\ncorrelations between different spatial modes or by specifying the required\ndensity matrix. By learning nonlinear volume holograms as well as different\npump shapes, we successfully show how to generate maximally entangled states.\nFurthermore, we simulate all-optical coherent control over the generated\nquantum state by actively changing the profile of the pump beam.

In addition, our\nmethod can be readily applied for controlling other degrees of freedom of light\nin the SPDC process, such as the spectral and temporal properties, and may even\nbe used in condensed-matter systems having a similar interaction Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 09:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Based on the stochastic Galerkin\nformulation, this paper addresses the idea and implementation of the first flux\nreconstruction scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws with random inputs.\nUnlike the finite volume method, the treatments in physical and random space\nare consistent, e.g., the modal representation of solutions based on an\northogonal polynomial basis and the nodal representation based on solution\ncollocation points. Therefore, the numerical behaviors of the scheme in the\nphase space can be designed and understood uniformly. A family of filters is\nextended to multi-dimensional cases to mitigate the well-known Gibbs phenomenon\narising from discontinuities in both physical and random space. The filter\nfunction is switched on and off by the dynamic detection of discontinuous\nsolutions, and a slope limiter is employed to preserve the positivity of\nphysically realizable solutions. As a result, the proposed method is able to\ncapture stochastic cross-scale flow evolution where resolved and unresolved\nregions coexist. Numerical experiments including wave propagation, Burgers'\nshock, one-dimensional Riemann problem, and two-dimensional shock-vortex\ninteraction problem are presented to validate the scheme.

Magnetoelectric multiferroics\nof type II possess intrinsic correlations among magnetic sublattices and\nelectric polarization (P) through spin-lattice coupling, enabling fundamentally\ncoupled dynamics between spins and lattice. Here we report on ultrafast\nmagnetization dynamics in a room-temperature multiferroic hexaferrite\npossessing ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic sublattices, revealed by\ntime-resolved resonant x-ray diffraction. A femtosecond above-bandgap\nexcitation triggers a coherent magnon in which the two magnetic sublattices\nentangle and give rise to a transient modulation of P. A novel microscopic\nmechanism for triggering the coherent magnon in this ferrimagnetic insulator\nbased on the spin-lattice coupling is proposed.

It is this\neffect which makes radiotherapy effective in cancer treatment. This stress\neffect can be explained in two ways: (a) more vulnerability in the growth\nphase, (b) improved protection capacity and repair mechanisms in the stationary\nphase. Although the two explanations do not exclude each other, they are very\ndifferent in the sense that (a) is a general mechanism whereas (b) is strain\nand stress-factor dependent. In this paper we explore major facets of (a).\nFirstly, we emphasize that (a) can account for known experimental stress-factor\nevidence. Secondly, we observe that (a) rightly predicts that slow exponential\ngrowth (meaning with a doubling time of several hours) results in a lower death\nrate than fast exponential growth (doubling time of a fraction of one hour), an\neffect that cannot be explained in the (b) framework because both organisms are\nin the same phase. Thirdly, we conjecture that the stress-factor effect can be\nextended to situations of chronic stress due to non-optimal environmental\nconditions. If correct, this conjecture would imply that even in normal culture\nconditions the natural death rate is lower in the stationary phase than in the\ngrowth phase.

In this work, we aim at studying the effects that such\nbursts may have on the spatial distribution of dust grain sizes and the\ncorresponding spectral index in protoplanetary disks. We use the numerical\nhydrodynamics code FEOSAD, which simulates the co-evolution of gas, dust, and\nvolatiles in a protoplanetary disk, taking dust growth and back reaction on gas\ninto account. The dependence of the maximum dust size on the water ice mantles\nis explicitly considered. The burst is initialized by increasing the luminosity\nof the central star to 100-300 L_sun for a time period of 100 yr. The water\nsnowline shifts during the burst to a larger distance, resulting in the drop of\nthe maximum dust size interior to the snowline position because of more\nefficient fragmentation of bare grains. After the burst, the water snowline\nshifts quickly back to its preburst location followed by renewed dust growth.\nThe timescale of dust regrowth after the burst depends on the radial distance\nso that the dust grains at smaller distances reach the preburst values faster\nthan the dust grains at larger distances. As a result, a broad peak in the\nradial distribution of the spectral index in the millimeter dust emission\ndevelops at \\approx 10 au, which shifts further out as the disk evolves and\ndust grains regrow to preburst values at progressively larger distances.

When\nthe number N of data items is large, SGD relies on constructing an unbiased\nestimator of the gradient of the empirical risk using a small subset of the\noriginal dataset, called a minibatch. Default minibatch construction involves\nuniformly sampling a subset of the desired size, but alternatives have been\nexplored for variance reduction. In particular, experimental evidence suggests\ndrawing minibatches from determinantal point processes (DPPs), distributions\nover minibatches that favour diversity among selected items. However, like in\nrecent work on DPPs for coresets, providing a systematic and principled\nunderstanding of how and why DPPs help has been difficult. In this work, we\ncontribute an orthogonal polynomial-based DPP paradigm for minibatch sampling\nin SGD. Our approach leverages the specific data distribution at hand, which\nendows it with greater sensitivity and power over existing data-agnostic\nmethods. We substantiate our method via a detailed theoretical analysis of its\nconvergence properties, interweaving between the discrete data set and the\nunderlying continuous domain. In particular, we show how specific DPPs and a\nstring of controlled approximations can lead to gradient estimators with a\nvariance that decays faster with the batchsize than under uniform sampling.\nCoupled with existing finite-time guarantees for SGD on convex objectives, this\nentails that, DPP minibatches lead to a smaller bound on the mean square\napproximation error than uniform minibatches. Moreover, our estimators are\namenable to a recent algorithm that directly samples linear statistics of DPPs\n(i.e., the gradient estimator) without sampling the underlying DPP (i.e., the\nminibatch), thereby reducing computational overhead.

The core of our method is a DNN selection module that learns user\nQoE patterns on-the-fly and identifies the best-fit DNN for on-thing inference\nwith the learned knowledge. It leverages a novel online learning algorithm,\nNeuralUCB, that has excellent generalization ability for handling various user\nQoE patterns. We also embed the knowledge transfer technique in NeuralUCB to\nexpedite the learning process. However, NeuralUCB frequently solicits QoE\nratings from users, which incurs non-negligible inconvenience. To address this\nproblem, we design feedback solicitation schemes to reduce the number of QoE\nsolicitations while maintaining the learning efficiency of NeuralUCB. A\npragmatic problem, aggregated QoE, is further investigated to improve the\npracticality of our framework. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world data. The results indicate that our method efficiently learns the\nuser QoE pattern with few solicitations and provides drastic QoE enhancement\nfor IoT devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 07:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The components\nof the vector are the key continuous attributes that determine the social\nbehavior of the agent. A simple mathematical force vector model is used to\npredict the effect of each agent on all other agents. The force law used is\nmotivated by gravitational force laws and electrical force laws for dipoles. It\nassumes that the force between two agents is proportional to the similarity of\nattributes, which is implemented mathematically as the dot product of the\nvectors representing the attributes of the agents, and the force goes as the\ninverse square of the difference in attributes, which is expressed as the\nEuclidean distance in attribute space between the two vectors. The force\nbetween the agents may be positive (attractive), zero, or negative (repulsive)\ndepending on whether the angle between the corresponding vectors is less than,\nequal to, or greater than 90 degrees. A positive force causes the attributes of\nthe agents to become more similar and the corresponding vectors to become more\nnearly parallel. Interaction between all agents is allowed unless the distance\nbetween the attributes representing the agents exceeds a confidence limit (the\nAttribute Influence Bound) set in the simulation. Agents with similar\nattributes tend to form groups. For small values of the Attribute Influence\nBound, numerous groups remain scattered throughout attribute space at the end\nof a simulation. As the Attribute Influence Bound is increased, and agents with\nincreasingly different attributes can communicate, fewer groups remain at the\nend, and the remaining groups have increasingly different characteristic\nattributes and approximately equal sizes. With a large Attribute Influence\nBound all agents are connected and extreme bi- or tri-polarization results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Braids have been used to detect coherent structures and mixing\nregions in oceanic flows, drive the design of industrial mixing machines,\ncontextualize the evolution of taffy pullers, and characterize the chaotic\nmotion of topological defects in active nematics. Mixing plays a central role\nin each of these examples, and the braids naturally associated with each system\ncome equipped with a useful measure of mixing efficiency, the topological\nentropy per operation (TEPO). This motivates the following questions. What is\nthe maximum mixing efficiency for braids, and what braids realize this? The\nanswer depends on how we define braids. For the standard Artin presentation,\nwell-known braids with mixing efficiencies related to the golden and silver\nratios have been proven to be maximal. However, it is fruitful to consider\nsurface braids, a natural generalization of braids, with presentations\nconstructed from Artin-like braid generators on embedded graphs. In this work,\nwe introduce an efficient and elegant algorithm for finding the topological\nentropy and TEPO of surface braids on any pairing of orientable surface and\nplanar embeddable graph. Of the myriad possible graphs and surfaces, graphs\nthat can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as a lattice are a simple, highly\nsymmetric choice, and the braids that result more naturally model the motion of\npoints on the plane. We extensively search for a maximum mixing efficiency\nbraid on planar lattice graphs and examine a novel candidate braid, which we\nconjecture to have this maximal property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which\nthe quantile processes satisfy first- and second-order stochastic dominance.\nThe introduced valuation principle relies on stochastic ordering so that the\nvaluation risk-loading, and thus risk premiums, generated by the measure\ndistortion is an ordered parametric family. The quantile processes are\ngenerated by a composite map consisting of a distribution and a quantile\nfunction. The distribution function accounts for model risk in relation to the\nempirical distribution of the risk process, while the quantile function models\nthe response to the risk source as perceived by, e.g., a market agent. This\ngives rise to a system of subjective probability measures that indexes a\nstochastic valuation principle susceptible to probability measure distortions.\nWe use the Tukey-$gh$ family of quantile processes driven by Brownian motion in\nan example that demonstrates stochastic ordering. We consider the conditional\nexpectation under the distorted measure as a member of the time-consistent\nclass of dynamic valuation principles, and extend it to the setting where the\ndriving risk process is multivariate. This requires the introduction of a\ncopula function in the composite map for the construction of quantile\nprocesses, which presents another new element in the risk quantification and\nmodelling framework based on probability measure distortions induced by\nquantile processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 23:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

Meanwhile, the\nimprovement of radiation due to the use of magnetic material is demonstrated by\na three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics and multiscale time-domain model. The\nsimulation results match the theoretical derivation, showing 25% radiation\nefficiency from a planar antenna backed by a FeGaB thin film with 2.56 um\nthickness. Furthermore, for conductive ferromagnetic materials, it is shown\nthat the eddy current loss can be well suppressed by laminating the thin film\ninto multiple layers. The radiation efficiency of the modeled antenna with a\nconductive ferromagnetic substrate is improved from 2.2% to 11.8% by dividing\nthe substrate into 10 layers, with a ferromagnetic material fill factor of 93%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 17:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Due to the\nrapid proliferation of malware, traditional analysis methods struggle with\nenormous samples.\n  In this paper, we propose four easy-to-extract and small-scale features,\nincluding sizes and permissions of Windows PE sections, content complexity, and\nimport libraries, to classify malware families, and use automatic machine\nlearning to search for the best model and hyper-parameters for each feature and\ntheir combinations. Compared with detailed behavior-related features like API\nsequences, proposed features provide macroscopic information about malware. The\nanalysis is based on static disassembly scripts and hexadecimal machine code.\nUnlike dynamic behavior analysis, static analysis is resource-efficient and\noffers complete code coverage, but is vulnerable to code obfuscation and\nencryption.\n  The results demonstrate that features which work well in dynamic analysis are\nnot necessarily effective when applied to static analysis. For instance, API\n4-grams only achieve 57.96% accuracy and involve a relatively high dimensional\nfeature set (5000 dimensions). In contrast, the novel proposed features\ntogether with a classical machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) presents\nvery good accuracy at 99.40% and the feature vector is of much smaller\ndimension (40 dimensions). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nthrough integration in IDA Pro, which also facilitates the collection of new\ntraining samples and subsequent model retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 18:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}
