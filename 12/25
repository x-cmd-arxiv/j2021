For the latter solution we adopt the standard Kraichnan\nmodel and derive asymptotic high-Schmidt limiting equations for the\nconcentration field, in which the thermal velocity fluctuations are exactly\nrepresented by a Gaussian random velocity which is white in time. We obtain the\nexact solution for the concentration spectrum in this high-Schmidt limiting\nmodel, showing that the Batchelor prediction in the viscous-convective range is\nunaltered. Thermal noise dramatically renormalizes the bare diffusivity in this\nrange, but the effect is the same as in laminar flow and thus hidden\nphenomenologically. However, in the viscous-diffusive range at scales below the\nBatchelor length (typically micron scales) the predictions based on\ndeterministic Navier-Stokes equations are drastically altered by thermal noise.\nWhereas the classical theories predict rapidly decaying spectra in the\nviscous-diffusive range, we obtain a $k^{-2}$ power-law spectrum starting just\nbelow the Batchelor length. This spectrum corresponds to non-equilibrium giant\nconcentration fluctuations, due to the imposed concentration variations\nadvected by thermal velocity fluctuations which are experimentally\nwell-observed in quiescent fluids. At higher wavenumbers, the concentration\nspectrum instead goes to a $k^2$ equipartition spectrum due to equilibrium\nmolecular fluctuations. We work out detailed predictions for water-glycerol and\nwater-fluorescein mixtures. Finally, we discuss broad implications for\nturbulent flows and novel applications of our methods to experimentally\naccessible laminar flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 17:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 15:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

To this end, we performed DFT calculations using\nmore accurate HSE06 functional and estimated the corresponding electronic\nproperties. From a comparative study of the band structures of C3N3, C3N4, and\nC3N5, we found that, the electronic band-gap decreases as 3.24 eV (C3N3) > 2.81\neV (C3N4) > 2.19 eV (C3N5) with increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in the\nunit cell of these graphitic carbon nitrides. Further, the strain dependency of\nthe band structure of 2D g-C3N5 under uniaxial and biaxial strain is performed\nusing the same HSE- 06 functional. We found a systematic decrease of band-gap\nas strain increases. Out of the two types of strain, the biaxial strain has\nbeen found to be more efficient in modulating the band-gap. The effect of\nstrain on the structure is also explored by analyzing the bond lengths and\nbond-angles as well as the charge density plots. Furthermore, we found that at\na biaxial strain of 20% strain an interesting structural rearrangement occurs\nin 2D g-C3N5, which reults in a finite magnetic moment arising from the loss of\nspin-degeneracy of electronic levels. Finally, by studying the evolution of\nband-gap, band-alignments and optical absorption as a function of strain we are\nable to predict that biaxially compressed C3N5 with strain in the range 12-14%\ncan be a promising photocatalyst in overall water-splitting with an excellent\noptical absorption in the visible light spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 19:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Weather model simulations are key to obtain such information when\nobservational data are scarce and sparse over a country as large and\ngeographically diverse as Saudi Arabia. However, output from such models is\nuncertain, as it depends on inputs such as the parametrization of the physical\nprocesses and the spatial resolution of the simulated domain. In such\nsituations, a sensitivity analysis must be performed and the input may have a\nspatially heterogeneous influence of wind. In this work, we propose a latent\nGaussian functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that relies on a\nnonstationary Gaussian Markov random field approximation of a continuous latent\nprocess. The proposed approach is able to capture the local sensitivity of\nGaussian and non-Gaussian wind characteristics such as speed and threshold\nexceedances over a large simulation domain, and a continuous underlying process\nalso allows us to assess the effect of different spatial resolutions. Our\nresults indicate that (1) the non-local planetary boundary layer scheme and\nhigh spatial resolution are both instrumental in capturing wind speed and\nenergy (especially over complex mountainous terrain), and (2) the impact of\nplanetary boundary layer scheme and resolution on Saudi Arabia's planned wind\nfarms is small (at most 1.4%).

These observations highlight our lack of\nunderstanding of what meta-learning algorithms are doing and when they work. In\nthis work, we provide empirical results that shed some light on how\nmeta-learned MAML representations function. In particular, we identify three\ninteresting properties: 1) In contrast to previous work, we show that it is\npossible to define a family of synthetic benchmarks that result in a low degree\nof feature re-use - suggesting that current few-shot learning benchmarks might\nnot have the properties needed for the success of meta-learning algorithms; 2)\nmeta-overfitting occurs when the number of classes (or concepts) are finite,\nand this issue disappears once the task has an unbounded number of concepts\n(e.g., online learning); 3) more adaptation at meta-test time with MAML does\nnot necessarily result in a significant representation change or even an\nimprovement in meta-test performance - even when training on our proposed\nsynthetic benchmarks. Finally, we suggest that to understand meta-learning\nalgorithms better, we must go beyond tracking only absolute performance and, in\naddition, formally quantify the degree of meta-learning and track both metrics\ntogether. Reporting results in future work this way will help us identify the\nsources of meta-overfitting more accurately and help us design more flexible\nmeta-learning algorithms that learn beyond fixed feature re-use.

Unfortunately, exact computations for both are NP-hard. To overcome\nthis computational bottleneck, neural approaches to learn and predict edit\ndistance in polynomial time have received much interest. While considerable\nprogress has been made, there exist limitations that need to be addressed.\nFirst, the efficacy of an approximate distance function lies not only in its\napproximation accuracy, but also in the preservation of its properties. To\nelaborate, although GED is a metric, its neural approximations do not provide\nsuch a guarantee. This prohibits their usage in higher order tasks that rely on\nmetric distance functions, such as clustering or indexing. Second, several\nexisting frameworks for GED do not extend to SED due to SED being asymmetric.\nIn this work, we design a novel siamese graph neural network called GREED,\nwhich through a carefully crafted inductive bias, learns GED and SED in a\nproperty-preserving manner. Through extensive experiments across 10 real graph\ndatasets containing up to 7 million edges, we establish that GREED is not only\nmore accurate than the state of the art, but also up to 3 orders of magnitude\nfaster.

False data injection attacks (FDIAs),\nspecifically, represent a major class of cyber threats to smart grids by\ntargeting the measurement data's integrity. Although various solutions have\nbeen proposed to detect those cyberattacks, the vast majority of the works have\nignored the inherent graph structure of the power grid measurements and\nvalidated their detectors only for small test systems with less than a few\nhundred buses. To better exploit the spatial correlations of smart grid\nmeasurements, this paper proposes a deep learning model for cyberattack\ndetection in large-scale AC power grids using Chebyshev Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (CGCN). By reducing the complexity of spectral graph filters and\nmaking them localized, CGCN provides a fast and efficient convolution operation\nto model the graph structural smart grid data. We numerically verify that the\nproposed CGCN based detector surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 7.86 in\ndetection rate and 9.67 in false alarm rate for a large-scale power grid with\n2848 buses.

In the free energy maps, we measure the spatial extension and\nthe time evolution of the mode-dependent, slow dynamical fluctuations, using\nthe string method and a Markov state model. The theory identifies the slow\ncollective variables in the rescaled LE4PD normal modes. Here, we compare the\ntICA modes' predictions with the collective LE4PD modes. We observe that the\ntwo methods consistently identify the nature and extension of the slowest\nfluctuation processes.

Waves of misery negatively affect the\nperformance of tree indexes in insertion-heavy workloads.Waves of misery have\nbeen first observed in the context of the B-tree, where these waves cause\nunpredictable index performance. In particular, the performance of search and\nindex-update operations deteriorate when a wave of misery takes place, but is\nmore predictable between the waves. This paper investigates the presence or\nlack of waves of misery in several R-tree variants, and studies the extent of\nwhich these waves impact the performance of each variant. Interestingly,\nalthough having poorer query performance, the Linear and Quadratic R-trees are\nfound to be more resilient to waves of misery than both the Hilbert and\nR*-trees. This paper presents several techniques to reduce the impact in\nperformance of the waves of misery for the Hilbert and R*-trees. One way to\neliminate waves of misery is to force node splits to take place at regular\ntimes before nodes become full to achieve deterministic performance. The other\nway is that upon splitting a node, do not split it evenly but rather at\ndifferent node utilization factors. This allows leaf nodes not to fill at the\nsame pace. We study the impact of two new techniques to mitigate waves of\nmisery after the tree index has been constructed, namely Regular Elective\nSplits (RES, for short) and Unequal Random Splits (URS, for short).

MTL is to determine the locations of potential multiple transmitters in\na field, based on readings from a distributed set of sensors. In contrast to\nthe widely studied single transmitter localization problem, the MTL problem has\nonly been studied recently in a few works. MTL is of great significance in many\napplications wherein intruders may be present. E.g., in shared spectrum\nsystems, detection of unauthorized transmitters and estimating their power are\nimperative to efficient utilization of the shared spectrum.\n  In this paper, we present DeepMTL, a novel deep-learning approach to address\nthe MTL problem. In particular, we frame MTL as a sequence of two steps, each\nof which is a computer vision problem: image-to-image translation and object\ndetection. The first step of mage-to-image translation essentially maps an\ninput image representing sensor readings to an image representing the\ndistribution of transmitter locations, and the second object detection step\nderives precise locations of transmitters from the image of transmitter\ndistributions. For the first step, we design our learning model Sen2Peak, while\nfor the second step, we customize a state-of-the-art object detection model\nYOLO-cust.

However, there is a group of instances with low accuracy in the\nhigh-confidence region, which are called mis-partitioned instances. To find\nthese mis-partitioned instances, this paper proposes a deep binning confidence\nscreening forest (DBC-Forest) model, which packs all instances into bins based\non their confidences. In this way, more accurate instances can be passed to the\nfinal stage, and the performance is improved. Experimental results show that\nDBC-Forest achieves highly accurate predictions for the same hyperparameters\nand is faster than other similar models to achieve the same accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 2021 04:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Typical\nregimens for fractionated external beam radiotherapy comprise a constant dose\nadministered on weekdays, and no radiation on weekends. However, every patient\nhas a tumor with distinct properties depending on intra-tumor heterogeneity,\naggressiveness, and interactive properties with other cells that may make it\nmore resistant or sensitive to radiation treatment. Accordingly, the concept of\npersonalized cancer treatment is emerging to specialize each patient treatment\ncase to the unique properties of the tumor. In this paper, we examine adaptive\nradiation treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors using a dynamical\nsystem model that consists of radiation-resistant and parental cell populations\nwith unique interactive properties. We study different adaptive dosage\nstrategies for PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. We show that stronger\ndoses of radiation given in longer time intervals, while keeping the overall\ndosage the same, reduce final tumor volume by more than half in PC3 cell lines,\nbut by only five percent in DU145 cell lines. In addition, we tested an\nadaptive dosing schedule by administering a stronger dosage on Friday to\ncompensate for the treatment-off period during the weekend, which was effective\nin decreasing the final tumor volume of both cell lines. This result creates\ninteresting possibilities for new radiotherapy strategies at clinics that\ncannot provide treatment on weekends. Finally, we propose a dosage plan\nincorporating our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 2021 06:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

It is crucial to conduct fairness testing before DNNs are reliably\ndeployed to such sensitive domains, i.e., generating as many instances as\npossible to uncover fairness violations. However, the existing testing methods\nare still limited from three aspects: interpretability, performance, and\ngeneralizability.

Extensive\nevaluations across 7 datasets and the corresponding DNNs demonstrate\nNeuronFair's superior performance.

We also show its\nequivalence with the kinematical action method, used in a previous work, in the\nhomogeneous setting. Then, we implement the proposed paradigm to describe the\ndynamics of a homogeneous free massless scalar field, living on an isotropic\nUniverse, in the presence of a cosmological constant. We completely solve the\ndynamics up to the first order correction in the Planckian parameter to the\nstandard quantum field theory. We determine the explicit form of the modified\nscalar field wave-function, due to quantum features of the cosmic scale factor\nevolution. Phenomenological considerations and discussions are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 2021 09:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 17:48:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 15:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

This covers two main issues: the use of publicly\naccessible information, and conducting active experimentation. The survey had\n224 respondents. The results indicate that open-source developers are largely\nopen to research, provided it is done transparently. In other words, many would\nagree to experiments on open-source projects if the subjects were notified and\nprovided informed consent, and in special cases also if only the project\nleaders agree.

Yet collaborating SLAM over\nmultiple robots still remains challenging due to performance contradiction\nbetween the intensive graphics computation of SLAM and the limited computing\ncapability of robots. While traditional solutions resort to the powerful cloud\nservers acting as an external computation provider, we show by real-world\nmeasurements that the significant communication overhead in data offloading\nprevents its practicability to real deployment. To tackle these challenges,\nthis paper promotes the emerging edge computing paradigm into multi-robot SLAM\nand proposes RecSLAM, a multi-robot laser SLAM system that focuses on\naccelerating map construction process under the robot-edge-cloud architecture.\nIn contrast to conventional multi-robot SLAM that generates graphic maps on\nrobots and completely merges them on the cloud, RecSLAM develops a hierarchical\nmap fusion technique that directs robots' raw data to edge servers for\nreal-time fusion and then sends to the cloud for global merging. To optimize\nthe overall pipeline, an efficient multi-robot SLAM collaborative processing\nframework is introduced to adaptively optimize robot-to-edge offloading\ntailored to heterogeneous edge resource conditions, meanwhile ensuring the\nworkload balancing among the edge servers.

In conventional 360-degree image compression, techniques such as\nregion-wise packing and tiled representation are introduced to alleviate the\nover-sampling problem, achieving limited success. In this paper, we make one of\nthe first attempts to learn deep neural networks for omnidirectional image\ncompression. We first describe parametric pseudocylindrical representation as a\ngeneralization of common pseudocylindrical map projections. A computationally\ntractable greedy method is presented to determine the (sub)-optimal\nconfiguration of the pseudocylindrical representation in terms of a novel proxy\nobjective for rate-distortion performance. We then propose pseudocylindrical\nconvolutions for 360-degree image compression. Under reasonable constraints on\nthe parametric representation, the pseudocylindrical convolution can be\nefficiently implemented by standard convolution with the so-called\npseudocylindrical padding. To demonstrate the feasibility of our idea, we\nimplement an end-to-end 360-degree image compression system, consisting of the\nlearned pseudocylindrical representation, an analysis transform, a non-uniform\nquantizer, a synthesis transform, and an entropy model. Experimental results on\n$19,790$ omnidirectional images show that our method achieves consistently\nbetter rate-distortion performance than the competing methods. Moreover, the\nvisual quality by our method is significantly improved for all images at all\nbitrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 2021 12:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

In\nthis paper, we study the novel problem of producing summaries of multi-relation\nnetworks, i.e., graphs where multiple edges of different types may exist\nbetween any pair of nodes. Multi-relation graphs are an expressive model of\nreal-world activities, in which a relation can be a topic in social networks,\nan interaction type in genetic networks, or a snapshot in temporal graphs. The\nfirst approach that we consider for multi-relation graph summarization is a\ntwo-step method based on summarizing each relation in isolation, and then\naggregating the resulting summaries in some clever way to produce a final\nunique summary. In doing this, as a side contribution, we provide the first\npolynomial-time approximation algorithm based on the k-Median clustering for\nthe classic problem of lossless single-relation graph summarization. Then, we\ndemonstrate the shortcomings of these two-step methods, and propose holistic\napproaches, both approximate and heuristic algorithms, to compute a summary\ndirectly for multi-relation graphs.

Stateful\nfuzzers tackle this challenge by leveraging state models to partition the state\nspace and assist the test generation process. Since not all states are equally\nimportant and fuzzing campaigns have time limits, fuzzers need effective state\nselection algorithms to prioritize progressive states over others. Several\nstate selection algorithms have been proposed but they were implemented and\nevaluated separately on different platforms, making it hard to achieve\nconclusive findings. In this work, we evaluate an extensive set of state\nselection algorithms on the same fuzzing platform that is AFLNet, a\nstate-of-the-art fuzzer for network servers. The algorithm set includes\nexisting ones supported by AFLNet and our novel and principled algorithm called\nAFLNetLegion. The experimental results on the ProFuzzBench benchmark show that\n(i) the existing state selection algorithms of AFLNet achieve very similar code\ncoverage, (ii) AFLNetLegion clearly outperforms these algorithms in selected\ncase studies, but (iii) the overall improvement appears insignificant. These\nare unexpected yet interesting findings. We identify problems and share\ninsights that could open opportunities for future research on this topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 21:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 06:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

The\nnonlocal multiscale behavior is captured via distributed order fractional\nconstitutive relations derived from a nonlocal thermodynamic formulation. The\ngoverning equations of the inhomogeneous continuum are obtained via the\nHamilton principle. As a generalization of the constant order fractional\ncontinuum theory, the distributed order theory can model complex media\ncharacterized by inhomogeneous nonlocality and multiscale effects. In order to\nunderstand the correspondence between microscopic effects and the properties of\nthe continuum, an equivalent mass-spring lattice model is also developed by\ndirect discretization of the distributed order elastic continuum. Detailed\ntheoretical arguments are provided to show the equivalence between the discrete\nand the continuum distributed order models in terms of internal nonlocal\nforces, potential energy distribution, and boundary conditions. These\ntheoretical arguments facilitate the physical interpretation of the role played\nby the distributed order framework within nonlocal elasticity theories. They\nalso highlight the outstanding potential and opportunities offered by this\nmethodology to account for multiscale nonlocal effects. The capabilities of the\nmethodology are also illustrated via a numerical study that highlights the\nexcellent agreement between the displacement profiles and the total potential\nenergy predicted by the two models under various order distributions.\nRemarkably, multiscale effects such as displacement distortion, material\nsoftening, and energy concentration are well captured at continuum level by the\ndistributed order theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 23:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}
