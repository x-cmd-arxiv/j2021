Electrochemical charging, electro-permeation\nand thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments are conducted. Firstly,\nthe relation between the charging current and the hydrogen concentration is\nestablished. Secondly, permeation experiments are conducted at 22, 40 and\n67{\\deg}C to quantify the diffusivity dependence on temperature. Finally, the\ndiffusivity is estimated by using two types of desorption experiments and\nFick's law: (i) a `rest time' method, by which we measure the hydrogen content\nof samples held at room temperature for different times, and (ii) isothermal\ndesorption experiments at temperatures ranging from 22 to 80{\\deg}C, fitting\nthe resulting desorption rate versus time curves. Good agreement is obtained\nbetween the isothermal desorption and permeation approaches, with observed\ndifferences discussed and rationalised. Moreover, measured diffusivity values\nfor cold-rolled pure iron are also found to be comparable to those reported in\nthe literature. This work demonstrates that isothermal desorption experiments\nare a convenient approach to determine hydrogen diffusivity over a wide range\nof temperatures, as facilitated by new TDS systems with fast heating rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

A LE\ninvolves a time-reversal procedure to assess the effect of perturbations in a\nquantum excitation dynamics. However, when addressing macroscopic systems one\nis repeatedly confronted with limitations that seem insurmountable. This led to\nformulate the \\textit{central hypothesis of irreversibility} stating that the\ntime-scale of decoherence, $T_3$, is proportional to the time-scale of the\nmany-body interactions we reversed, $T_2$. We test this by implementing two\nexperimental schemes based on Floquet Hamiltonians where the effective strength\nof the dipolar spin-spin coupling, i.e. $1/T_2$, is reduced by a variable scale\nfactor $k$. This extends the perturbations time scale, $T_\\Sigma$, in relation\nto $T_2$. Strikingly, we observe the superposition of the normalized Loschmidt\nechoes for the bigger values of $k$. This manifests the dominance of the\nintrinsic dynamics over the perturbation factors, even when the Loschmidt echo\nis devised to reverse that intrinsic dynamics. Thus, in the limit where the\nreversible interactions dominate over perturbations, the LE decays within a\ntime-scale, $T_3\\approx T_2/R$ with $R=(0.15 \\pm 0.01)$, confirming the\nemergence of a perturbation independent regime.

First, we make a survey of grounded\nintersection graph classes, summarizing all the known inclusions between these\nvarious classes.

Owing to the coupled dynamics in binary asteroid systems, the orbit\nand libration state of Dimorphos are intertwined. Thus, as the secondary\nlibrates, it also experiences fluctuations in its orbit period. These\nvariations in the orbit period are dependent on the magnitude of the impact\nperturbation, as well as the system's state at impact and the moments of\ninertia of the secondary.

These events and their smaller counterparts, coronal jets,\noriginate in narrow, sinuous filament channels. The key processes that form and\nevolve the channels operate on still smaller spatial scales and much longer\ntime scales, culminating in a vast separation of characteristic lengths and\ntimes that govern these explosive phenomena. In this article, we describe\nimplementation and tests of an efficient subgrid-scale model for generating\neruptive structures in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) coronal simulations. STITCH\n-- STatistical InjecTion of Condensed Helicity -- is a physics-based, reduced\nrepresentation of helicity condensation: a process wherein small-scale vortical\nsurface convection forms ubiquitous current sheets, and pervasive reconnection\nacross the sheets mediates an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity and free\nenergy, thereby forming the filament channels. STITCH abstracts these complex\nprocesses into a single new term, in the MHD Ohm's law and induction equation,\nwhich directly injects tangential magnetic flux into the low corona. We show\nthat this approach is in very good agreement with a full helicity-condensation\ncalculation that treats all of the dynamics explicitly, while enabling\nsubstantial reductions in temporal duration especially, but also in spatial\nresolution. In addition, we illustrate the flexibility of STITCH at forming\nlocalized filament channels and at energizing complex surface flux\ndistributions that have sinuous boundaries. STITCH is simple to implement and\ncomputationally efficient, making it a powerful new technique for event-based,\ndata-driven modeling of solar eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 16:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Combining the thermochemical code\nDALI with the analytical wind-driven disk evolution model presented in Tabone\net al. (2021a), we study the time evolution of the observed gas outer radius as\nmeasured from CO rotational emission ($R_{\\rm CO, 90\\%}$).

For a constant $\\alpha_{\\rm DW}$, an extension\nof the $\\alpha-$Shakura-Sunyaev parameter to wind-driven accretion, $R_{\\rm CO,\n90\\%}$ decreases linearly with time.

First, we take inspiration from a dimensionality reduction and a\nbiological gait classification scheme to generate cyclic patterns of body\ndeformation and foot lifting/lowering, which facilitate generation of arbitrary\nsubstrate contact patterns. Second, we use geometric mechanics methods to\nfacilitates identification of optimal phasing of these undulations to maximize\nspeed and/or stability. Our scheme allows the development of effective gaits in\nmulti-legged robots locomoting on flat frictional terrain with diverse number\nof limbs (4, 6, 16, and even 0 limbs) and body actuation capabilities\n(including sidewinding gaits on limbless devices).

Several estimators have been developed so\nfar, in which the proposed prior was individually tailored for each property of\ninterest; such is the case, for example, for the entropy, the amount of mutual\ninformation, or the correlation between pairs of variables. In this paper we\npropose a general framework to select priors, valid for arbitrary properties.\nWe first demonstrate that only certain aspects of the prior distribution\nactually affect the inference process.

Often the comparison\nmakes the most sense when performed separately for individuals who are similar\naccording to certain characteristics given by the values of covariates of\ninterest; the separate comparisons can also be aggregated in various ways to\ncompare across all values of the covariates. Separating, segmenting, or\nstratifying into those with similar values of the covariates is also known as\n\"conditioning on\" or \"controlling for\" those covariates; controlling for age or\nannual income is common.\n  Two standard methods of controlling for covariates are (1) binning and (2)\nregression modeling.

However, observational data suggests that the SNe could be not\nspherically-symmetric. Modern multi-dimensional simulations of SNe demonstrate\ndevelopment of hydrodynamical instabilities during the explosion phase. But the\nconfiguration of a star and inhomogeneities prior to explosion could strongly\naffect how the SNe develops. In a number of papers on numerical modeling of\npair-instability supernovae explosion (PISNe) considered the case when\nthermonuclear energy in the central region of a massive star is introduced by\nthe series of several hot spots. It leads to the appearance of many fragments\nof hot matter behind the divergence shock wave. An observable manifestation of\nthis may be the presence of peaks on light curves of gamma-ray burst associated\nwith explosions of massive stars.\n  The physical nature of such inhomogeneities is not evident and the number and\nsize of spots is a conjecture. In this work, we study the possibility of\nformation of these inhomogeneities at the stage of the core-collapse (CC) in a\nmassive star. To check this assumption, we chose analytic self-similar model of\nCC and investigated stability of solutions obtained from it with respect to\nsmall multidimensional perturbations. It shows there are no conditions where\nthe collapse of a very massive star may remain stable, although, for a less\nmassive star, it is possible. Using obtained relations, we found characteristic\nfeatures of developing instability, thereby making it possible to estimate the\namount and characteristic size of the inhomogeneities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 17:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

The brush is built by grafting the polymer\nchains of a side-chain molecular architecture, with the side chains terminated\nby a chromophore unit mimicking the azobenzene unit, to a substrate. When\nirradiated with ultraviolet light, the chromophores photoisomerize into a\nnon-mesogenic cis state and the whole system turns into an ordinary polymer\nbrush with no orientational order and two states: the collapsed and\nstraightened one, depending on the grafting density. When irradiated with\nvisible light, the chromophores photoisomerize into a mesogenic trans state,\nresulting in formation of a transient network between chains because of a\nstrong attraction between chromophores. Spontaneous self-assembly of the brush\nin these conditions results in an orientationally isotropic polydomain\nstructure. The desired uniaxial planar ordering of chromophores within a brush\ncan be achieved at certain temperature and grafting density intervals, as the\nresult of a two-stage preparation protocol. An external stimulus orients\nchromophores uniaxially at the first stage. The system is equilibrated at the\nsecond stage at a given temperature and with the external stimulus switched\noff. The preoriented chromophores either keep or loose their orientations\ndepending on the strength of the memory effect inherent to a transient network\nof chains that are formed during the first stage, similarly to the case of the\nliquid crystalline elastomers, where such effects are caused by the covalent\ncrosslinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 17:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 17:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Moreover, we investigate\nthe dependency of dwarf galaxy properties on their surrounding environment. The\nnew Hydra I dwarf catalog contains 317 galaxies with luminosity between\n-18.5<$M_r$<-11.5 mag, a semi-major axis larger than ~200 pc (a=0.84 arcsec),\nof which 202 are new detections, previously unknown dwarf galaxies in the Hydra\nI central region.

We\npresent hIPPYlib-MUQ, an extensible and scalable software framework that\ncontains implementations of state-of-the art algorithms aimed to overcome the\nchallenges of high-dimensional, PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems.\nThese algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling by exploiting the geometry and\nintrinsic low-dimensionality of parameter space via derivative information and\nlow rank approximation.

They\nare expected to reach a certain equilibrium where D cannot distinguish the\ngenerated images from the real ones. However, such an equilibrium is rarely\nachieved in practical GAN training, instead, D almost always surpasses G. We\nattribute one of its sources to the information asymmetry between D and G. We\nobserve that D learns its own visual attention when determining whether an\nimage is real or fake, but G has no explicit clue on which regions to focus on\nfor a particular synthesis. To alleviate the issue of D dominating the\ncompetition in GANs, we aim to raise the spatial awareness of G. Randomly\nsampled multi-level heatmaps are encoded into the intermediate layers of G as\nan inductive bias. Thus G can purposefully improve the synthesis of certain\nimage regions. We further propose to align the spatial awareness of G with the\nattention map induced from D. Through this way we effectively lessen the\ninformation gap between D and G. Extensive results show that our method pushes\nthe two-player game in GANs closer to the equilibrium, leading to a better\nsynthesis performance.

The fraction of field binaries on retrograde orbits about the Milky\nWay is significantly lower compared to its prograde counterpart. Chemical and\ndynamical evidence suggests that the retrograde stellar population originates\nfrom $\\omega$ Centauri, which is either the most massive globular cluster (GC)\nof the Milky Way or the putative core of a former dwarf galaxy. Aims. Star\nformation conditions required to produce the retrograde binary population are\nconstrained assuming that the retrograde stellar population originates from\n$\\omega$ Centauri's progenitor. Methods. We match the observed low binary\nfraction with dynamical population synthesis models, including a universal\ninitial binary population and dynamical processing in star clusters, making use\nof the publicly available binary population synthesis tool BiPoS1.

It\nis found that either the GC progenitor of $\\omega$ Centauri must have formed\nwith a stellar density of $\\approx 10^8 \\; M_{sun} \\; pc^{-3}$ or the $\\omega$\nCentauri dwarf galaxy's progenitor star cluster population must have formed in\nan extreme starburst with a star formation rate exceeding $1000 \\; M_{sun} \\;\nyr^{-1}$ and probably a top-heavy embedded-cluster mass function with\nsuppressed low-mass cluster formation.

Here, we use simulations to further\ninvestigate the relation between gas density and turbulent velocity\nfluctuations, with a focus on the effect of the stratification of the ICM. In\nthis work, we studied the turbulence driven by hierarchical accretion by\nanalysing a sample of galaxy clusters simulated with the cosmological code\nENZO.

In dynamically perturbed galaxy clusters, we found a relation\nbetween the root mean square of density and velocity fluctuations, albeit with\na different slope than previously reported. The Richardson number is a\nparameter that represents the ratio between turbulence and buoyancy, and we\nfound that this variable has a strong dependence on the filtering scale.\nHowever, we could not detect any strong relation between the Richardson number\nand the logarithmic density fluctuations, in contrast to results by recent and\nmore idealised simulations. In particular, we find a strong effect from radial\naccretion, which appears to be the main driver for the gas fluctuations. The\nubiquitous radial bias in the dynamics of the ICM suggests that homogeneity and\nisotropy are not always valid assumptions, even if the turbulent spectra follow\nKolmogorov's scaling.

One challenge in training such models is that they\nneed to jointly learn semantic concepts and their relationships across\ndifferent input representations. Capsule networks have been shown to perform\nwell in context of capturing the relation between low-level input features and\nhigher-level concepts. However, capsules have so far mainly been used only in\nsmall-scale fully supervised settings due to the resource demand of\nconventional routing algorithms. We present a new multimodal capsule network\nthat allows us to leverage the strength of capsules in the context of a\nmultimodal learning framework on large amounts of video data. To adapt the\ncapsules to large-scale input data, we propose a novel routing by\nself-attention mechanism that selects relevant capsules which are then used to\ngenerate a final joint multimodal feature representation. This allows not only\nfor robust training with noisy video data, but also to scale up the size of the\ncapsule network compared to traditional routing methods while still being\ncomputationally efficient. We evaluate the proposed architecture by pretraining\nit on a large-scale multimodal video dataset and applying it on four datasets\nin two challenging downstream tasks.

Planets are expected to migrate at a\nspeed proportional to their mass, and a slower rate makes resonant capture and\nsubsequent ejection more likely. Therefore, whilst large planets may be able to\nsuccessfully \"run the gauntlet\", small planets may be imperiled. This\nhypothesis is tested using N-body integrations of migration in a truncated and\nturbulent disc. We discover that surprisingly none of the known planets exist\ninterior to a fully unstable resonance. We demonstrate that resonant ejection\nof migrating planets may occur in nature, and that it does indeed\ndisproportionately affect small planets, but it requires a highly turbulent\ndisc and its efficiency is likely too low to fully explain a dearth of < 3\nEarth radii planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 19:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 18:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

We present ReIGNN, a novel learning-based register\nclassification methodology that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with\nstructural analysis to classify the registers in a circuit with high accuracy\nand generalize well across different designs. GNNs are particularly effective\nin processing circuit netlists in terms of graphs and leveraging properties of\nthe nodes and their neighborhoods to learn to efficiently discriminate between\ndifferent types of nodes. Structural analysis can further rectify any registers\nmisclassified as state registers by the GNN by analyzing strongly connected\ncomponents in the netlist graph. Numerical results on a set of benchmarks show\nthat ReIGNN can achieve, on average, 96.5% balanced accuracy and 97.7%\nsensitivity across different designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 19:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

When treatment strategies are\ndeterministic, estimators derived from the so-called efficient influence\nfunction (EIF) for the g-formula will be doubly robust to model\nmisspecification. In recent years, several practical applications have\nmotivated estimation of the g-formula under non-deterministic treatment\nstrategies where treatment assignment at each time point depends on the\nobserved treatment process. In this case, EIF-based estimators may or may not\nbe doubly robust. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure\nexistence of doubly robust estimators for intervention treatment distributions\nthat depend on the observed treatment process for point treatment\ninterventions, and give a class of intervention treatment distributions\ndependent on the observed treatment process that guarantee model doubly and\nmultiply robust estimators in longitudinal settings. Motivated by an\napplication to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation studies, we propose a\nnew treatment intervention dependent on the observed treatment process.

In this work, we consider two notions of fairness that each may be\nappropriate in different circumstances: \"egalitarian fairness\" (which aims to\nbound how dissimilar error rates can be) and \"proportional fairness\" (which\naims to reward players for contributing more data). We similarly consider two\ncommon methods of model aggregation, one where a single model is created for\nall agents (uniform), and one where an individualized model is created for each\nagent. For egalitarian fairness, we obtain a tight multiplicative bound on how\nwidely error rates can diverge between agents collaborating (which holds for\nboth aggregation methods). For proportional fairness, we show that the\nindividualized aggregation method always gives a small player error that is\nupper bounded by proportionality.

When mixed-model ANCOVA assumptions are violated, the validity and\nefficiency of the model-based inference for the average treatment effect are\ncurrently unclear. In this article, we prove that the mixed-model ANCOVA\nestimator for the average treatment effect is consistent and asymptotically\nnormal under arbitrary misspecification of its working model. Under equal\nrandomization, we further show that the model-based variance estimator for the\nmixed-model ANCOVA estimator remains consistent, clarifying that the confidence\ninterval given by standard software is asymptotically valid even under model\nmisspecification. Beyond robustness, we also provide a caveat that covariate\nadjustment via mixed-model ANCOVA may lead to precision loss compared to no\nadjustment when the covariance structure is misspecified, and describe when a\ncluster-level ANCOVA becomes more efficient. These results hold under both\nsimple and stratified randomization, and are further illustrated via\nsimulations as well as analyses of three cluster-randomized trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 21:19:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

With this\nmotivation, we propose a secretary problem where a candidate may or may not\naccept an offer according to a known probability $p$. Because we do not know\nthe top candidate willing to accept an offer, the goal is to maximize a robust\nobjective defined as the minimum over integers $k$ of the probability of\nchoosing one of the top $k$ candidates, given that one of these candidates will\naccept an offer. Using Markov decision process theory, we derive a linear\nprogram for this max-min objective whose solution encodes an optimal policy.\nThe derivation may be of independent interest, as it is generalizable and can\nbe used to obtain linear programs for many online selection models. We further\nrelax this linear program into an infinite counterpart, which we use to provide\nbounds for the objective and closed-form policies.

We find that\nranked preference modeling performs much better than imitation learning, and\noften scales more favorably with model size. In contrast, binary discrimination\ntypically performs and scales very similarly to imitation learning. Finally we\nstudy a `preference model pre-training' stage of training, with the goal of\nimproving sample efficiency when finetuning on human preferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 22:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 20:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 21:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

However, recent studies have shown\nthat the uncertainties on the optical potentials are too large for the theory\nto be useful. Purpose: The purpose of this work is to explore possible\nexperimental conditions that may reduced the uncertainties on elastic\nscattering and single-nucleon transfer cross sections that come from the\nfitting of the optical model parameters to experimental data. Method: Using\nBayesian methods, we explore the effect of the uncertainties of optical model\nparameters on the angular grid of the differential cross section, including\ncross section data at nearby energies, and changes in the experimental error\nbars. We also study the effect on the resulting uncertainty when other\nobservables are included in the fitting procedure, particularly the total\n(reaction) cross sections. Results: We study proton and neutron elastic\nscattering on 48Ca and 208Pb. We explore the parameter space with Markov- Chain\nMonte Carlo, produce posterior distributions for the optical model parameters,\nand construct the corresponding 95% confidence intervals on the\nelastic-scattering cross sections.

Conclusions: We find little sensitivity to the angular grid and an\nimprovement of up to a factor of 2 on the uncertainties by including data at a\nnearby energy.

Capitalizing on a random feature-based approximant of the\nGP prior, an online scalable (OS) approach, termed {OS-GPTD}, is developed to\nestimate the value function for a given policy by observing a sequence of\nstate-reward pairs. To benchmark the performance of OS-GPTD even in an\nadversarial setting, where the modeling assumptions are violated, complementary\nworst-case analyses are performed by upper-bounding the cumulative Bellman\nerror as well as the long-term reward prediction error, relative to their\ncounterparts from a fixed value function estimator with the entire state-reward\ntrajectory in hindsight.

For Einstein's GR, the expressions of these quantities are unanimously\naccepted. Of late, the van der Waals phase transition in black holes has been\nfound in modified theories of gravity as well, such as the $f(R)$ gravity and\nthe scalar-tensor gravity. However, in the case of these modified theories of\ngravity, the expression of pressure (and, hence, volume) is not uniquely\ndetermined. In addition, for these modified theories, the extended phase space\nthermodynamics has not been studied extensively, especially in a covariant way.\nSince both the scalar-tensor and the $f(R)$ gravity can be discussed in the two\nconformally connected frames (the Jordan and the Einstein frame respectively),\nthe arbitrariness in the expression of pressure, will act upon the equivalence\nof the thermodynamic parameters in the two frames. We highlight these issues in\nthe paper. Before that, in Einstein's gravity (GR), we obtain a general\nexpression of the equilibrium state version of first law and the Smarr-like\nformula from the Einstein's equation for a general static and spherically\nsymmetric (SSS) metric.

This paper studies the concept of weighted influences for solving\nMaxCon. In particular, we study endowing the Boolean cube with the Bernoulli\nmeasure and performing biased (as opposed to uniform) sampling. Theoretically,\nwe prove the weighted influences, under this measure, of points belonging to\nlarger structures are smaller than those of points belonging to smaller\nstructures in general.

It leverages\nknowledge from a labeled graph (i.e., source domain) to tackle the same task on\nanother unlabeled graph (i.e., target domain). Most existing UGDA methods\nheavily rely on the labeled graph in the source domain. They utilize labels\nfrom the source domain as the supervision signal and are jointly trained on\nboth the source graph and the target graph.

In this work, we synthesize populations of such planets\nand consider the number of transits per epoch they produce, forming integer\nsequences. For isotropic distributions, such sequences will appear foreign to\nconventional expectation, rarely (~1%) producing the signature double-transits\nwe have come to expect for circumbinaries, instead producing sparse sequences\ndominated by zero-transit epochs (~80%). Despite their strangeness, we\ndemonstrate that these sequences will be non-random and that the two preceding\nepochs predict the next to high accuracy. Additionally, we show that even when\nclustering the transits into grouped epochs, they often appear unphysical if\nerroneously assuming a single star, due to the missing epochs. Crucially,\nmissing epochs mean highly isotropic populations can trick the observer into\nassigning the wrong period in up to a quarter of cases, adding further\nconfusion. Finally, we show that the transit sequences encode the inclination\ndistribution and demonstrate a simple inference method that successfully\nmatches the injected truth. Our work highlights how the simple act of flagging\ntransits can be used to provide an initial, vetting-level analysis of\nmisaligned transiting circumbinary planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 03:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 19:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

To date, researchers have produced impressive\nstate-of-the-art performance in the age of deep learning. Most of these\nstate-of-the-art, however, requires large volume of annotated image-caption\npairs in order to train their models. When given an image dataset of interests,\npractitioner needs to annotate the caption for each image in the training set\nand this process needs to happen for each newly collected image dataset. In\nthis paper, we explore the task of unsupervised image captioning which utilizes\nunpaired images and texts to train the model so that the texts can come from\ndifferent sources than the images. A main school of research on this topic that\nhas been shown to be effective is to construct pairs from the images and texts\nin the training set according to their overlap of objects. Unlike in the\nsupervised setting, these constructed pairings are however not guaranteed to\nhave fully overlapping set of objects.

Most smart homes learn a uniform model to represent the thermal\npreferences of users, which generally fails when the pool of occupants includes\npeople with different sensitivities to temperature, for instance due to age and\nphysiological factors. Thus, a smart home with a single optimal policy may fail\nto provide comfort when a new user with a different preference is integrated\ninto the home. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Reinforcement learning\nframework that can approximate the current occupant state in a partially\nobservable smart home environment using its thermal preference, and then\nidentify the occupant as a new user or someone is already known to the system.\nOur proposed framework can be used to identify users based on the temperature\nand humidity preferences of the occupant when performing different activities\nto enable personalization and improve comfort. We then compare the proposed\nframework with a baseline long short-term memory learner that learns the\nthermal preference of the user from the sequence of actions which it takes. We\nperform these experiments with up to 5 simulated human models each based on\nhierarchical reinforcement learning.

Hence, the National Dengue Control\nUnit of Sri Lanka propose a national action plan to prevent and control the\ndengue incidence. To implement the necessary actions for short and long terms\nthe proposed plan operates under three levels:country-level, province-level,\nand district levels. In order to optimize resource allocation, the health\nofficers require the forecasts for country, province and district levels, which\npreserves the aggregate consistency associated with the district, province, and\ncountry levels as well as time correlations. Hence, the objective of this study\nis to forecast the dengue incidence in Sri Lanka using a hierarchical time\nseries forecasting approach based on spatial and temporal hierarchical\nstructures. Hierarchical forecasting involves two steps such as generating base\nforecasts and reconciliation of these base forecasts. In this study,\nExponential smoothing(ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average\n(ARIMA), NAIVE, Seasonal NAIVEapproaches and average method are used to\ngenerate base forecasts. Accuracy of forecasts is evaluated using Mean Absolute\nScale Error (MASE). We compare the accuracy of hierarchical time series\nforecasts with other benchmark approaches. The forecast accuracy reveals that\nthe best forecasting approaches for country, provinces and districts are not\nlimited to a single approach. Hence, we investigate reasons for the variations\nof performance in different forecasting approaches based on a time series\nfeature-based visualization approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 05:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

While the\nconceptual distinction is straightforward, a fair comparison of the approaches\nis difficult to achieve. Here, we carry out such a comparison by building a set\nof compartmental metapopulation models from an agent-based representation of a\nreal population. By adjusting the compartmental model to approximately match\nthe dynamics of the Agent-based model, we identify two key qualitative\nproperties of the individual-based dynamics which are lost upon aggregation\ninto metapopulations. These are (1) the local depletion of susceptibility to\ninfection, and (2) decoupling of different regional groups due to correlation\nbetween commuting behaviors and contact rates. The first of these effects is a\ngeneral consequence of aggregating small, closely connected groups (i.e.,\nfamilies) into larger homogeneous metapopulations. The second can be\ninterpreted as a consequence of aggregating two distinct types of individuals:\nschool children, who travel short distances but have many potentially\ninfectious contacts, and adults, who travel further but tend to have fewer\ncontacts capable of transmitting infection.

To counteract the influence of bias, existing\nmethods either exploit auxiliary information which is rarely obtainable in\npractice, or sift for bias-free samples in the training data, hoping for the\nsufficient existence of clean samples.

Motivated by our\nobservation that not only discriminative models, as previously known, but also\ngenerative models tend to focus on the bias when possible, CDvG uses a\ntranslation model to transform the bias in the sample to another mode of bias\nwhile preserving task-relevant information. Through contrastive learning, we\nset transformed biased views against another, learning bias-invariant\nrepresentations. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-arts, and\neffectively prevents the models from being biased even when bias-free samples\nare extremely scarce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 07:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Besides\nthe conventional layers, such as fully connected layers in DNN-HMM and memory\ncells in LSTM-HMM, the model uses two additional layers based on Mixture of\nExperts (MoE). The first MoE layer operating at the input is based on\npre-defined broad phonetic classes and the second layer operating at the\npenultimate layer is based on automatically learned acoustic classes. In\nnatural speech, overlap in distribution across different acoustic classes is\ninevitable, which leads to inter-class mis-classification. The ASR accuracy is\nexpected to improve if the conventional architecture of acoustic model is\nmodified to make them more suitable to account for such overlaps.

In this\nwork, we propose a simple yet effective Stacked Temporal Attention Module\n(STAM) to compute temporal attention based on the global knowledge across clips\nfor emphasizing the most discriminative features. We achieve this by stacking\nmultiple self-attention layers. Instead of naive stacking, which is\nexperimentally proven to be ineffective, we carefully design the input to each\nself-attention layer so that both the local and global context of the video is\nconsidered during generating the temporal attention weights. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed STAM can be built on top of most existing\nbackbones and boost the performance in various datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 08:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Due to the limited observation range, such\ndata sets can only reflect local information, which limits the quality of\ntrained models. In practice, the global information and local observations\nwould require a joint consideration for learning to make a reasonable policy.\nHowever, in horizontal FL, the central agency only acts as a model aggregator\nwithout utilizing its global observation to further improve the model. This\ncould significantly degrade the performance in some missions such as traffic\nflow prediction in network systems, where the global information may enhance\nthe accuracy. Meanwhile, the global feature may not be directly transmitted to\nagents for data security. How to utilize the global observation residing in the\ncentral agency while protecting its safety thus rises up as an important\nproblem in FL.

In this paper,\nwe explore this problem from a novel perspective of customizing video captions\nby imitating exemplar sentence syntaxes. Specifically, given a video and any\nsyntax-valid exemplar sentence, we introduce a new task of Syntax Customized\nVideo Captioning (SCVC) aiming to generate one caption which not only\nsemantically describes the video contents but also syntactically imitates the\ngiven exemplar sentence. To tackle the SCVC task, we propose a novel video\ncaptioning model, where a hierarchical sentence syntax encoder is firstly\ndesigned to extract the syntactic structure of the exemplar sentence, then a\nsyntax conditioned caption decoder is devised to generate the syntactically\nstructured caption expressing video semantics. As there is no available syntax\ncustomized groundtruth video captions, we tackle such a challenge by proposing\na new training strategy, which leverages the traditional pairwise video\ncaptioning data and our collected exemplar sentences to accomplish the model\nlearning. Extensive experiments, in terms of semantic, syntactic, fluency, and\ndiversity evaluations, clearly demonstrate our model capability to generate\nsyntax-varied and semantics-coherent video captions that well imitate different\nexemplar sentences with enriched diversities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 09:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

In order to\ntackle such an exemplar-based video captioning task, we propose a novel Syntax\nModulated Caption Generator (SMCG) incorporated in an\nencoder-decoder-reconstructor architecture. The proposed SMCG takes video\nsemantic representation as an input, and conditionally modulates the gates and\ncells of long short-term memory network with respect to the encoded syntactic\ninformation of the given exemplar sentence. Therefore, SMCG is able to control\nthe states for word prediction and achieve the syntax customized caption\ngeneration. We conduct experiments by collecting auxiliary exemplar sentences\nfor two public video captioning datasets. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on generating syntax controllable\nand semantic preserved video captions. By providing different exemplar\nsentences, our approach is capable of producing different captions with various\nsyntactic structures, thus indicating a promising way to strengthen the\ndiversity of video captioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 09:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Sulfur is an\nimportant species because its low ionization potential may possibly make it an\nimportant charge carrier. The observed sulfur-bearing species in the gas-phase\nof dense clouds represent only a minor fraction of the cosmic sulfur abundance,\nwhich has been interpreted as a signature of sulfur depletion into ices at the\nsurface of dust grains. However, atomic sulfur, which could be the main\ngas-phase carrier, cannot be observed directly in cold cores. We present\nmeasurements of the nitrogen sulfide (NS) radical toward four dense cores\nperformed with the IRAM-30m telescope. Analytical chemical considerations and\nchemical models over a wide parameter space show that the NS:N2H+ abundance\nratio provides a direct constraint on the abundance of gas-phase atomic sulfur.\nToward early-type cores, we find that $n(\\rm S)/n_{\\rm H}$ is close, or even\nequal, to the cosmic abundance of sulfur, 14$\\times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating\nthat sulfur is not depleted and is atomic, which is in agreement with chemical\nmodels.

By limiting the flowings of intentions through\ndirected edges, intention sharing via LFF (IS-LFF) can eliminate message\ndeceiving effectively and achieve better coordination. In addition, a twostage\nlearning algorithm is proposed to train the forest and the agent network.

While source localization\napplied to interictal spikes recorded on scalp is the classical method, it does\nnot provide unequivocal information regarding the seizure onset zone. Raw ictal\nactivity contains a mixture of signals originating from several regions of the\nbrain as well as EMG artifacts, hampering direct input to the source\nlocalization algorithms. We therefore introduce a methodology that disentangles\nthe various sources contributing to the scalp ictal activity using independent\ncomponent analysis and uses equivalent current dipole localization as putative\nlocus of ictal sources. We validated the results of our analysis pipeline by\nperforming long-term simultaneous scalp -- intracerebral (SEEG) recordings in\n14 patients and analyzing the wavelet coherence between the independent\ncomponent encoding the ictal discharge and the SEEG signals in 8 patients\npassing the inclusion criteria. Our results show that invasively recorded ictal\nonset patterns, including low-voltage fast activity, can be captured by the\nindependent component analysis of scalp EEG. The visibility of the ictal\nactivity strongly depends on the depth of the sources. The equivalent current\ndipole localization can point to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) with an accuracy\nthat can be as high as 10mm for superficially located sources, that gradually\ndecreases for deeper seizure generators, averaging at 47 mm in the 8 analyzed\npatients. Independent component analysis is therefore shown to have a promising\nSOZ localizing value, indicating whether the seizure onset zone is neocortical,\nand its approximate location, or located in mesial structures.

In the next step, we\ncalculate the excitation rate depending on the band structure by assuming\ndirection dependence of reduced mass. We find that although the ellipticity\ndecreases the excitation rate significantly in an isotropic system, the energy\noscillation of electrons due to the intra-band dynamics in the anisotropic band\nstructure increases the excitation rate with higher ellipticity. Our results\nindicate that we can control the excitation rate in dielectrics by varying the\nellipticity, depending on the band anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 10:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Existing GNN\nresearch designs various propagation schemes to guide the aggregation of\nneighbor information. Recently the field has advanced from local propagation\nschemes that focus on local neighbors towards extended propagation schemes that\ncan directly deal with extended neighbors consisting of both local and\nhigh-order neighbors. Despite the impressive performance, existing approaches\nare still insufficient to build an efficient and learnable extended propagation\nscheme that can adaptively adjust the influence of local and high-order\nneighbors. This paper proposes an efficient yet effective end-to-end framework,\nnamely Contrastive Adaptive Propagation Graph Neural Networks (CAPGNN), to\naddress these issues by combining Personalized PageRank and attention\ntechniques. CAPGNN models the learnable extended propagation scheme with a\npolynomial of a sparse local affinity matrix, where the polynomial relies on\nPersonalized PageRank to provide superior initial coefficients. In order to\nadaptively adjust the influence of both local and high-order neighbors, a\ncoefficient-attention model is introduced to learn to adjust the coefficients\nof the polynomial. In addition, we leverage self-supervised learning techniques\nand design a negative-free entropy-aware contrastive loss to explicitly take\nadvantage of unlabeled data for training. We implement CAPGNN as two different\nversions named CAPGCN and CAPGAT, which use static and dynamic sparse local\naffinity matrices, respectively. Experiments on graph benchmark datasets\nsuggest that CAPGNN can consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

Specifically, we divide\nthe open-set 3D object detection problem into two steps: (1) finding out the\nregions containing the unknown objects with high probability and (2) enclosing\nthe points of these regions with proper bounding boxes. The first step is\nsolved by the finding that unknown objects are often classified as known\nobjects with low confidence, and we show that the Euclidean distance sum based\non metric learning is a better confidence score than the naive softmax\nprobability to differentiate unknown objects from known objects. On this basis,\nunsupervised clustering is used to refine the bounding boxes of unknown\nobjects.

To develop a secure medical\nimage analysis (MIA) system, it is a must to study possible backdoor attacks\n(BAs), which can embed hidden malicious behaviors into the system. However,\ndesigning a unified BA method that can be applied to various MIA systems is\nchallenging due to the diversity of imaging modalities (e.g., X-Ray, CT, and\nMRI) and analysis tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation).\nMost existing BA methods are designed to attack natural image classification\nmodels, which apply spatial triggers to training images and inevitably corrupt\nthe semantics of poisoned pixels, leading to the failures of attacking dense\nprediction models. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nFrequency-Injection based Backdoor Attack method (FIBA) that is capable of\ndelivering attacks in various MIA tasks. Specifically, FIBA leverages a trigger\nfunction in the frequency domain that can inject the low-frequency information\nof a trigger image into the poisoned image by linearly combining the spectral\namplitude of both images. Since it preserves the semantics of the poisoned\nimage pixels, FIBA can perform attacks on both classification and dense\nprediction models. Experiments on three benchmarks in MIA (i.e., ISIC-2019 for\nskin lesion classification, KiTS-19 for kidney tumor segmentation, and EAD-2019\nfor endoscopic artifact detection), validate the effectiveness of FIBA and its\nsuperiority over state-of-the-art methods in attacking MIA models as well as\nbypassing backdoor defense.

For example, in E-commerce, a large portion of clicks do\nnot translate to purchases, and many purchases end up with negative reviews. As\nsuch, it is of importance to account for the inevitable noises in implicit\nfeedback. However, little work on recommendation has taken the noisy nature of\nimplicit feedback into consideration. In this work, we explore the central\ntheme of denoising implicit feedback for recommender learning, including\ntraining and inference. By observing the process of normal recommender\ntraining, we find that noisy feedback typically has large loss values in the\nearly stages. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new training strategy\nnamed Adaptive Denoising Training (ADT), which adaptively prunes the noisy\ninteractions by two paradigms (i.e., Truncated Loss and Reweighted Loss).\nFurthermore, we consider extra feedback (e.g., rating) as auxiliary signal and\npropose three strategies to incorporate extra feedback into ADT: finetuning,\nwarm-up training, and colliding inference. We instantiate the two paradigms on\nthe widely used binary cross-entropy loss and test them on three representative\nrecommender models. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that\nADT significantly improves the quality of recommendation over normal training\nwithout using extra feedback. Besides, the proposed three strategies for using\nextra feedback largely enhance the denoising ability of ADT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 12:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

One common practice in previous works is to generate link\nrepresentations by directly aggregating the representations of their incident\nnodes, which is not capable of capturing effective link features.

In\nthis work, we propose a simple yet effective module for video-text\nrepresentation learning, namely RegionLearner, which can take into account the\nstructure of objects during pre-training on large-scale video-text pairs. Given\na video, our module (1) first quantizes visual features into semantic clusters,\nthen (2) generates learnable masks and uses them to aggregate the features\nbelonging to the same semantic region, and finally (3) models the interactions\nbetween different aggregated regions. In contrast to using off-the-shelf object\ndetectors, our proposed module does not require explicit supervision and is\nmuch more computationally efficient. We pre-train the proposed approach on the\npublic WebVid2M and CC3M datasets. Extensive evaluations on four downstream\nvideo-text retrieval benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nRegionLearner. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/ruiyan1995/Region_Learner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 13:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 07:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

However, current methods\nalways hurt the informative hard samples due to the similar loss distribution\nbetween the hard samples and the noisy ones.

Our framework can\nsave more informative hard clean samples into the cleanly labeled set. Besides,\nour framework also promotes the quality of pseudo-labels during the\nsemi-supervised step by suppressing the noise in the current pseudo-labels\ngenerating scheme.

(RQ2) how the approach can be extended to automate\nlog statements' descriptions? and (RQ3) how effective the proposed methods are\nfor log location and description prediction? To pursue our RQs, we perform an\nexperimental study on seven open-source Java projects. We introduce an updated\nand improved log-aware code-clone detection method to predict the location of\nlogging statements (RQ1). Then, we incorporate natural language processing\n(NLP) and deep learning methods to automate the log statements' description\nprediction (RQ2). Our analysis shows that our hybrid NLP and code-clone\ndetection approach (NLP CC'd) outperforms conventional clone detectors in\nfinding log statement locations on average by 15.60% and achieves 40.86% higher\nperformance on BLEU and ROUGE scores for predicting the description of logging\nstatements when compared to prior research (RQ3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 14:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

For GCs with DM, we observe that this dark extra mass\ntriggers a tidal radius growth that allows the mini-halo to act as a protective\nshield against tidal stripping, being itself stripped beforehand the stars. We\ndemonstrate that this shielding effect becomes negligible when the tidal radius\nis smaller than the half-mass radius of the mini-halo. Contrary to previous\npredictions, we found that the inflation of outer stellar velocity dispersion\nprofiles is expected for GCs with and without a mini-halo, as a result of the\nhost's tidal field. Moreover, we observe that GCs with a DM mini-halo should\nhave, in general, relatively more radial outer velocity anisotropy profiles\nthroughout all their orbits, smaller degrees of internal rotation, and as a\nconsequence of the latter, smaller ellipticities for their stellar\ndistribution.

We propose a novel approach\nto recover the unknown source through measuring the wave fields after injecting\nsmall particles, enjoying a high contrast, into the medium. For this purpose,\nwe first derive the asymptotic expansion of the wave field, based on the\ntime-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The dominant term in the asymptotic\nexpansion is expressed as an infinite series in terms of the eigenvalues\n$\\{\\lambda_n\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of the Newtonian operator (for the pure\nLaplacian). Such expansions are useful under a certain scale between the size\nof the particles and their contrast. Second, we observe that the relevant\neigenvalues appearing in the expansion have non-zero averaged eigenfunctions.\nWe prove that the family $\\{\\sin(\\frac{c_1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_n}}\\, t),\\,\n\\cos(\\frac{c_1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_n}}\\, t)\\}$, for those relevant eigenvalues, with\n$c_1$ as the contrast of the small particle, defines a Riesz basis (contrary to\nthe family corresponding to the whole sequence of eigenvalues). Then, using the\nRiesz theory, we reconstruct the wave field, generated before injecting the\nparticles, on the center of the particles. Finally, from these (internal values\nof these) last fields, we reconstruct the source term (by numerical\ndifferentiation for instance). A significant advantage of our approach is that\nwe only need the measurements on $\\{x\\}\\times(0, T)$ for a single point $x$\naway from $\\Omega$, i.e., the support of the source, and large enough $T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 15:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

However, despite the necessity\narising from the presence of non-reciprocal coupling between states in a\nphotonic Floquet medium, a unified non-Hermitian band structure description\nremains elusive. Here, we experimentally reveal the unique Bloch-Floquet and\nnon-Bloch band structures of a photonic Floquet medium emulated in the\nmicrowave regime with a one-dimensional array of time-periodically driven\nresonators.

In this simulation, we\nhave established a near-equilibrium APG over a wide Reynolds-number range. In\nthis so-called region of interest (ROI), the Clauser--Rotta pressure-gradient\nparameter $\\beta$ exhibits an approximately constant value of around 1.4, and\nthe Reynolds number based on momentum thickness reaches $Re_{\\theta}=8700$. To\nthe authors' knowledge, this is to date the highest $Re_{\\theta}$ achieved for\na near-equilibrium APG TBL under an approximately constant moderate APG. We\nevaluated the self-similarity of the outer region using two scalings, namely\nthe Zagarola--Smits and an alternative one based on edge velocity and\ndisplacement thickness. Our results reveal that outer-layer similarity is\nachieved, and the viscous scaling collapses the near-wall region of the mean\nflow in agreement with classical theory. Spectral analysis reveals that the APG\ndisplaces some small-scale energy from the near-wall to the outer region, an\neffect observed for all the components of the Reynolds-stress tensor, which\nbecomes more evident at higher Reynolds numbers. Generally, the effects of the\nAPG are more noticeable at lower Reynolds numbers. For instance, the outer peak\nof turbulent-kinetic-energy (TKE) production is less prominent at higher $Re$.\nWhile the scale separation increases with $Re$ in zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG)\nTBLs, this effect becomes accentuated by the APG. Despite the reduction of the\nouter TKE production at higher Reynolds numbers, the mechanisms of energization\nof large scales are still present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 15:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 16:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

A\nfeedback to a query provides some information about the intersection between\nthe query and subset K. Several specific feedbacks have been studied in the\nliterature, often proving different formulas for the estimate of the query\ncomplexity of the problem, defined as the shortest length of queries' sequence\nsolving Group Testing problem with specific feedback. In this paper we study\nwhat are the properties of the feedback that influence the query complexity of\nGroup Testing and what is their measurable impact. We propose a generic\nframework that covers a vast majority of relevant settings considered in the\nliterature, which depends on two fundamental parameters of the feedback: input\ncapacity $\\alpha$ and output expressiveness $\\beta$. They upper bound the\nlogarithm of the size of the feedback function domain and image, respectively.\nTo justify the value of the framework, we prove upper bounds on query\ncomplexity of non adaptive, deterministic Group Testing under some \"efficient\"\nfeedbacks, for minimum, maximum and general expressiveness, and complement them\nwith a lower bound on all feedbacks with given parameters $\\alpha,\\beta$. Our\nupper bounds also hold if the feedback function could get an input twisted by a\nmalicious adversary, in case the intersection of a query and the hidden set is\nbigger than the feedback capacity $\\alpha$. We also show that slight change in\nthe feedback function may result in substantial worsening of the query\ncomplexity.

The motivation for the paper is the\nobservation [Nishikawa et al., J. Stat.

Beside analyses to determine the relaxation time for the whole system\nwe determine particle relaxation times which allow us to determine both\nhistograms of particle relaxation times and the average particle relaxation\ntimes - two quantities that are very useful for the analyses. The starting\nconfigurations for the relaxation simulations are of two different kinds:\ncompletely random or taken from steady shearing simulations, and we find that\nthe difference between these two cases are bigger than previously noted and\nthat the observed problems in the determination of the critical divergence\nobtained when starting from random configurations are not present when instead\nstarting the relaxations from shearing configurations.

We\naim to investigate the source of sunspot supersonic downflows (SSDs) in AR\n12740 using simultaneous spectroscopic and imaging observations. We identified\nSSD events from multiple raster scans of a sunspot by the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph, and calculated the electron densities, mass fluxes and\nvelocities of these SSDs. The EUV images provided by the AIA onboard the SDO\nand the EUVI onboard the STEREO were employed to investigate the origin of\nthese SSDs and their associated coronal rain. Almost all the identified SSDs\nappear at the footpoints of sunspot plumes and are temporally associated with\nappearance of chromospheric bright dots inside the sunspot umbra.\nDual-perspective EUV imaging observations reveal a large-scale closed magnetic\nloop system spanning the sunspot region and a remote region. We observed that\nthe SSDs are caused by repeated coronal rain that forms and flows along these\nclosed magnetic loops toward the sunspot. One episode of coronal rain clearly\nindicates that reconnection near a coronal X-shaped structure first leads to\nthe formation of a magnetic dip. Subsequently, hot coronal plasma\ncatastrophically cools from 2 MK in the dip region via thermal instability.\nThis results in the formation of a transient prominence in the dip, from which\nthe cool gas mostly slides into the sunspot along inclined magnetic fields\nunder the gravity. This drainage process manifests as a continuous rain flow,\nwhich lasts for around 2 hrs and concurrently results in a nearly steady SSD\nevent. Our results demonstrate that coronal condensation in magnetic dips can\nresult in the quasi-steady sunspot supersonic downflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 15:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Besides proposing more advanced model\narchitectures, constructing more reliable and trustworthy datasets also plays a\nhuge role in improving NLU systems, without which it would be impossible to\ntrain a decent NLU model. It's worth noting that the human ability of\nunderstanding natural language is flexible and robust.

A similar result holds if $[a,c]$ be replaced with $[c,b]$. Our study\nwill enable us to predict accurately where Newton-Raphson sequence converges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 18:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

A novel $\\mathcal{GP}$-based method is proposed for the\nground segmentation task in rough driving scenarios. A non-stationary\ncovariance function is utilized as the kernel for the $\\mathcal{GP}$. The\nground surface behavior is assumed to only demonstrate local-smoothness. Thus,\npoint estimates of the kernel's length-scales are obtained. Thus, two Gaussian\nprocesses are introduced to separately model the observation and local\ncharacteristics of the data. While, the \\textit{observation process} is used to\nmodel the ground, the \\textit{latent process} is put on length-scale values to\nestimate point values of length-scales at each input location. Input locations\nfor this latent process are chosen in a physically-motivated procedure to\nrepresent an intuition about ground condition. Furthermore, an intuitive guess\nof length-scale value is represented by assuming the existence of hypothetical\nsurfaces in the environment that every bunch of data points may be assumed to\nbe resulted from measurements from this surfaces. Bayesian inference is\nimplemented using \\textit{maximum a Posteriori} criterion. The log-marginal\nlikelihood function is assumed to be a multi-task objective function, to\nrepresent a whole-frame unbiased view of the ground at each frame. Simulation\nresults shows the effectiveness of the proposed method even in an uneven, rough\nscene which outperforms similar Gaussian process based ground segmentation\nmethods. While adjacent segments do not have similar ground structure in an\nuneven scene, the proposed method gives an efficient ground estimation based on\na whole-frame viewpoint instead of just estimating segment-wise probable ground\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 18:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}
