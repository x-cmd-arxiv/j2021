The data were analyzed to retrieve a calibrated proton spectrum\nand in particular we focus on the analysis of the most energetic portion (E >\n5.8 MeV) of the spectrum showing a procedure to deal with the intrinsic lower\nsensitivity of the detector in the mentioned spectral-range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Spiral spin liquids are a\nclass of classical spin liquids featuring sub-extensively degenerate ground\nstates. They are distinct from spin liquids on geometrically frustrated\nlattices, in which the ground state degeneracy is extensive and connected by\nlocal spin flips. Despite a handful of experimental realizations and many\ntheoretical studies, a concrete physical picture of their spin liquidity has\nnot been established so far. In this work, we study a 2D spiral spin liquid\nmodel to answer this question. We find that the local momentum vector field can\ncarry topological defects in the form of vortices, which, however, have very\ndifferent properties from the commonly known spin vortices. The fluctuations of\nsuch vortices lead the system into a liquid phase at intermediate temperatures.\nFurthermore, the effective low energy theory of such vortices indicates their\nequivalence to quadrupoles of fractons in a rank-2 U(1) gauge theory or,\nalternatively, to quadrupoles of disclinations in elasticity theory. At very\nlow temperatures, the system freezes into a glassy state in which these\nvortices form a rigid network with straight-line domain walls.

VX Sgr is a cool, evolved, and luminous red star whose stellar\nparameters are difficult to determine, which affects its classification. Aims.\nWe aim to spatially resolve the photospheric extent as well as the\ncircumstellar environment. Methods. We used interferometric observations\nobtained with the MATISSE instrument in the L (3 to 4 {\\mu}m), M (4.5 to 5\n{\\mu}m), and N (8 to 13 {\\mu}m) bands. We reconstructed monochromatic images\nusing the MIRA software. We used 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations\ncarried out with CO5BOLD and a uniform disc model to estimate the apparent\ndiameter and interpret the stellar surface structures. Moreover, we employed\nthe radiative transfer codes Optim3D and Radmc3D to compute the spectral energy\ndistribution for the L, M, and N bands, respectively. Results. MATISSE\nobservations unveil, for the first time, the morphology of VX Sgr across the L,\nM, and N bands. The reconstructed images show a complex morphology with\nbrighter areas whose characteristics depend on the wavelength probed. We\nmeasured the angular diameter as a function of the wavelength and showed that\nthe photospheric extent in the L and M bands depends on the opacity through the\natmosphere. In addition to this, we also concluded that the observed\nphotospheric inhomogeneities can be interpreted as convection-related surface\nstructures. The comparison in the N band yielded a qualitative agreement\nbetween the N band spectrum and simple dust radiative transfer simulations.\nHowever, it is not possible to firmly conclude on the interpretation of the\ncurrent data because of the difficulty in constraing the model parameters using\nthe limited accuracy of our absolute flux calibration. Conclusions. MATISSE\nobservations and the derived reconstructed images unveil the appearance of the\nstellar surface and circumstellar environment across a very large spectral\ndomain for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 17:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Understanding this\nphenomenon, also called quantum scrambling, is a prerequisite for employing\ninteracting systems for quantum information processing. The character and\ndirection dependence of quantum scrambling can be inferred from the\nout-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) containing information on correlation\nbuildup and entanglement spreading. Employing OTOC, we study and quantify the\ndirectionality of quantum information propagation in oxide-based helical spin\nsystems hosting a spin-driven ferroelectric order. In these systems,\nmagnetoelectricity permits the spin dynamics and associated information content\nto be controlled by an electric field coupled to the emergent ferroelectric\norder. We show that topologically nontrivial quantum phases, such as chiral or\nhelical spin ordering, allows for electric-field controlled anisotropic\nscrambling and a direction-dependent buildup of quantum correlations. Based on\ngeneral symmetry considerations, we find that starting from a pure state (e.g.,\nthe ground state) or a finite temperature state is essential for observing\ndirectional asymmetry in scrambling. In the systematic numerical studies of\nOTOC, we quantify the directional asymmetry of the scrambling and verify the\nconjectured form of the OTOC around the ballistic wavefront. The obtained\ndirection-dependent butterfly velocity $v_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathbf{n})$ provides\ninformation on the speed of the ballistic wavefront. In general, our\ncalculations show an early-time power-law behavior of OTOC, as expected from an\nanalytic expansion for small times. The long-time behavior of OTOC reveals the\nimportance of (non-)integrability of the underlying Hamiltonian as well as the\nimplications of conserved quantities such as the $z$-projection of the total\nspin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 17:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

In this work, we address\nthese issues and propose an optimization method for a full harvest season of\nlarge crop ensembles that complies with given constraints. By using an approach\nbased on an evolutionary algorithm combined with a novel hierarchical loss\nfunction and adaptive mutation rate, we transfer the multi-objective into a\npseudo-single-objective optimization problem and obtain faster convergence and\nbetter solutions than for conventional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 17:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

We compare the results to an MDD\npolygenic risk score (PRS) and environmental variables. Results: The upper\nbound of the effect sizes range from partial eta squared = .004 to .017,\ndistributions overlap between 89% and 95%, with classification accuracies\nranging between 54% and 55% across neuroimaging modalities. This pattern\nremains virtually unchanged when considering only acutely or chronically\ndepressed patients. Differences are comparable to those found for PRS, but\nsubstantially smaller than for environmental variables. Discussion: We provide\na large-scale, multimodal analysis of univariate biological differences between\nMDD patients and controls and show that even under near-ideal conditions and\nfor maximum biological differences, deviations are extremely small and\nsimilarity dominates. We sketch an agenda for a new focus of future research in\nbiological psychiatry facilitating quantitative, theory-driven research, an\nemphasis on computational psychiatry and multivariate machine learning\napproaches, as well as the utilization of ecologically valid phenotyping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 18:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Given a corpus of\nradiology reports, researchers are often interested in identifying a subset of\nreports describing a particular medical finding. Because the space of medical\nfindings in radiology reports is vast and potentially unlimited, recent studies\nproposed mapping free-text statements in radiology reports to semi-structured\nstrings of terms taken from a limited vocabulary. This paper aims to present an\napproach for the automatic generation of semi-structured representations of\nradiology reports. The approach consists of matching sentences from radiology\nreports to manually created semi-structured representations, followed by\nlearning a sequence-to-sequence neural model that maps matched sentences to\ntheir semi-structured representations.

The method is designed to work with samples, such\nas local photometric redshift catalogues, that do not have full spectroscopic\ncoverage, but for which some redshift or distance information is available. It\nconsists of identifying the galaxies most likely to be centrals, and using the\nclustering signal around them as a template to iteratively decompose the full\npopulation into satellite and central populations. In that sense it is similar\nto performing crowded-field photometry, after having first used isolated stars\nto determine the point spread function of the image. The method does not\nidentify individual satellites or centrals conclusively, but assigns a\nprobability to each galaxy of being one or the other. Averaged over a large\nsample, it provides a statistical estimate of satellite abundance, even in\ncrowded fields with large redshift uncertainties. We test the method using data\nfrom the COSMOS field, which includes a large set of local objects with\naccurate photometric redshifts. We measure satellite abundance as a function of\ncentral stellar or halo mass, as well as the satellite luminosity function, and\nfind results consistent with previous studies, but extending over a broader\nrange of central masses. We also consider a number of possible systematic\nuncertainties in the method, and show that they are generally smaller than our\nrandom errors. Having presented the method in this paper, we will use it to\nstudy the properties of the satellite populations in a forthcoming one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 18:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers\nto build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis.\nTo this end, we believe that local attention is crucial to strike the balance\nbetween computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed\ngenerator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve a\nlarger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously\nleverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved\ngeneration quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the\nabsolute position that has been lost in window-based transformers greatly\nbenefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high\nresolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the\nstrong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during\nhigh-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a\nblock-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we\nempirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a\nwavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively\nsuppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior\ntransformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., 1024x1024. The\nStyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excels over StyleGAN on\nCelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the\npromise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation.

RDI\nwith this PSF library results in a detection of PDS 70 b at a S/N of 5.3.\nAstrometry and photometry of PDS 70 b are calibrated using a forward-modeling\nmethod and injection-recovery tests, resulting in a separation of $186 \\pm 13$\nmas, a position angle of $142 \\pm 5^\\circ$, and an H$\\alpha$ flux of $(1.7 \\pm\n0.3)\\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Here, we introduce the concept of the Wannier\nfunction perturbation, which provides a localized representation of\nwavefunction perturbations. Wannier function perturbation theory allows\nefficient calculation of numerous quantities involving wavefunction\nperturbation, among which we provide three applications. First, we calculate\nthe temperature-dependent indirect optical absorption spectra of silicon near\nthe absorption edge nonadiabatically, i.e., differentiating phonon-absorption\nand phonon-emission processes, and without arbitrary temperature-dependent\nshifts in energy. Second, we establish a theory to calculate the shift spin\nconductivity without any band-truncation error. Unlike the shift charge\nconductivity, an exact calculation of the shift spin conductivity is not\npossible within the conventional Wannier function methods because it cannot be\nobtained from geometric quantities for low-energy bands. We apply the theory to\nmonolayer WTe$_2$. Third, we calculate the spin Hall conductivity of the same\nmaterial again without any band-truncation error. Wannier function perturbation\ntheory is a versatile method that can be readily applied to calculate a wide\nrange of quantities related to various kinds of perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

However, in some circumstances, Chandrasekhar's\nlocal and uniform approximations can break down severely. An astrophysically\nimportant example is the \"core stalling\" phenomenon seen in N-body simulations\nof massive perturber inspiralling into the near-harmonic potential of a stellar\nsystem's constant-density core (and possibly also in direct observations of\ndwarf galaxies with globular clusters). In this paper we use the linearized\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation to calculate the global response of a cored\ngalaxy to the presence of a massive perturber. We evaluate the density\ndeformation, or wake, due to the perturber and study its geometrical structure\nto better understand the phenomenon of core stalling. We also evaluate the\ndynamical friction torque acting on perturber from the Lynden-Bell--Kalnajs\n(LBK) formula. In agreement with past work, we find that the dynamical friction\nforce arising from corotating resonances is greatly weakened, relative to the\nChandrasekhar formula, inside a constant density core. In contrast to past\nwork, however, we find that a population of previously neglected high-order and\nnon-corotating resonances sustain a minimum level of frictional torque at ~10 %\nof the torque from Chandrasekhar formula. This suggests that complete core\nstalling likely requires phenomena beyond the LBK approach; we discuss several\npossible explanations. Additionally, to study core stalling for multiple\nperturbers, we investigate approximate secular dynamical interactions (akin to\nLidov-Kozai dynamics) between two perturbers orbiting a cored stellar system\nand derive a criterion for instability arising due to their close encounters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 19:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

However,\nstandard neural networks often fail to understand the concept of hierarchical\nstructures and dependencies among different classes for vision related tasks.\nHumans on the other hand, seem to intuitively learn categories conceptually,\nprogressively growing from understanding high-level concepts down to granular\nlevels of categories. One of the issues arising from the inability of neural\nnetworks to encode such dependencies within its learned structure is that of\nsubpopulation shift -- where models are queried with novel unseen classes taken\nfrom a shifted population of the training set categories. Since the neural\nnetwork treats each class as independent from all others, it struggles to\ncategorize shifting populations that are dependent at higher levels of the\nhierarchy. In this work, we study the aforementioned problems through the lens\nof a novel conditional supervised training framework. We tackle subpopulation\nshift by a structured learning procedure that incorporates hierarchical\ninformation conditionally through labels. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of\ngraphical distance to model the catastrophic effect of mispredictions. We show\nthat learning in this structured hierarchical manner results in networks that\nare more robust against subpopulation shifts, with an improvement up to 3\\% in\nterms of accuracy and up to 11\\% in terms of graphical distance over standard\nmodels on subpopulation shift benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 20:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 21:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

We\npropose a new hypothesis for the chemistry in the clouds that largely addresses\nall of the above anomalies. We include ammonia (NH3), a key component that has\nbeen tentatively detected both by the Venera 8 and Pioneer Venus probes. NH3\ndissolves in some of the sulfuric acid cloud droplets, effectively neutralizing\nthe acid and trapping dissolved SO2 as ammonium sulfite salts. This trapping of\nSO2 in the clouds together with the release of SO2 below the clouds as the\ndroplets settle out to higher temperatures, explains the vertical SO2 abundance\nanomaly. A consequence of the presence of NH3 is that some Venus cloud droplets\nmust be semi-solid ammonium salt slurries, with a pH~1, which matches Earth\nacidophile environments, rather than concentrated sulfuric acid. The source of\nNH3 is unknown, but could involve biological production; if so, then the most\nenergy-efficient NH3-producing reaction also creates O2, explaining the\ndetection of O2 in the cloud layers.

Computing a CP decomposition via an alternating least squares (ALS)\nmethod reduces the problem to several linear least squares problems. The\nstandard way to solve these linear least squares subproblems is to use the\nnormal equations, which inherit special tensor structure that can be exploited\nfor computational efficiency. However, the normal equations are sensitive to\nnumerical ill-conditioning, which can compromise the results of the\ndecomposition. In this paper, we develop versions of the CP-ALS algorithm using\nthe QR decomposition and the singular value decomposition (SVD), which are more\nnumerically stable than the normal equations, to solve the linear least squares\nproblems. Our algorithms utilize the tensor structure of the CP-ALS subproblems\nefficiently, have the same complexity as the standard CP-ALS algorithm when the\nrank is small, and are shown via examples to produce more stable results when\nill-conditioning is present. Our MATLAB implementation achieves the same\nrunning time as the standard algorithm for small ranks, and we show that the\nnew methods can obtain lower approximation error and more reliably recover\nlow-rank signals from data with known ground truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 20:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Our paper focuses on one important class of such\nmechanisms: the problem of adaptive incentive design, whereby a central planner\nintervenes on the payoffs of an agent population via incentives in order to\noptimize a system objective. To tackle this problem in high-dimensional\nenvironments whose dynamics may be unknown or too complex to model, we propose\na model-free meta-gradient method to learn an adaptive incentive function in\nthe context of multi-agent reinforcement learning.

This paper introduces a new approach, termed translational concept\nembedding, to solve these two difficulties in a unified framework. It models\nthe effect of applying an attribute to an object as adding a translational\nattribute feature to an object prototype. We explicitly take into account of\nthe contextual dependency between attributes and objects by generating\ntranslational attribute features conditionally dependent on the object\nprototypes. Furthermore, we design a ratio variance constraint loss to promote\nthe model's generalization ability on unseen concepts. It regularizes the\ndistances between concepts by utilizing knowledge from their pretrained word\nembeddings.

Because the S-matrix\nvertices are the amputated correlation functions of the fluctuating field, it\nhas been suggested that in the critical region the amputation of the long-range\ntails makes the S-matrix functional more localized and thus more amenable to\nthe local potential approximation (LPA) than the renormalized free energy\nfunctional used in Wilson's EFRGE. By means of a functional Legendre transform\nthe S-matrix EFRGE has been converted into an EFRGE for the effective action\n(EA). It has been found that the field-dependent part of EA predicted by the\nequation is the same as calculated within the known EA EFRGE approaches but in\naddition it is accurately accounts for the field-independent terms. These are\nindispensable in calculation of such important quantities as the the specific\nheat, the latent heat, etc. With the use of the derived EFRGE a closed\nexpression for the renormalization counterterm has been obtained which when\nsubtracted from the divergent solution of the Wetterich equation would lead to\na finite exact expression for the EA thus making two approaches formally\nequivalent. The S-matrix equation has been found to be simply connected with a\ngeneralized functional Burgers' equation which establishes a direct\ncorrespondence between the first order phase transitions and the shock wave\nsolutions of the RG equation.

These physics-based models are usually expensive and\nslow to run, thus not suitable for real-time prediction or parameter inversion.\nAn attractive alternative is surrogate model. This work introduces an\nefficient, accurate, and flexible surrogate model, NN-p2p, based on deep\nlearning and it can make point-to-point predictions on unstructured or\nirregular meshes. The new method was evaluated and compared against existing\nmethods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can only make\nimage-to-image predictions on structured or regular meshes. In NN-p2p, the\ninput includes both spatial coordinates and boundary features that can describe\nthe geometry of hydraulic structures, such as bridge piers. All surrogate\nmodels perform well in predicting flow around different types of piers in the\ntraining domain. However, only NN-p2p works well when spatial extrapolation is\nperformed. The limitations of CNN-based methods are rooted in their\nraster-image nature which cannot capture boundary geometry and flow features\nexactly, which are of paramount importance to fluid dynamics. NN-p2p also has\ngood performance in predicting flow around piers unseen by the neural network.\nThe NN-p2p model also respects conservation laws more strictly. The application\nof the proposed surrogate model was demonstrated by calculating the drag\ncoefficient $C_D$ for piers and a new linear relationship between $C_D$ and the\nlogarithmic transformation of pier's length/width ratio was discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 22:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In particular, this model allows for an elegant formulation of\nthe counterfactual regret minimization algorithm, called public-state CFR\n(PS-CFR), which naturally lends itself to an efficient implementation.\nEmpirically, solving a poker subgame with 10^7 states by public-state CFR takes\n3 minutes and 700 MB while a comparable version of vanilla CFR takes 5.5 hours\nand 20 GB. Additionally, the public-state formulation of CFR opens up the\npossibility for exploiting domain-specific assumptions, leading to a quadratic\nreduction in asymptotic complexity (and a further empirical speedup) over\nvanilla CFR in poker and other domains. Overall, this suggests that the ability\nto represent poker as a sequential Bayesian game played a key role in the\nsuccess of CFR-based methods.

Pruning, as a method to introduce zeros to\nmodel weights, has shown to be an effective method to provide good trade-offs\nbetween model accuracy and computation efficiency, and is a widely-used method\nto generate compressed models. However, the granularity of pruning makes\nimportant trade-offs. At the same sparsity level, a coarse-grained structured\nsparse pattern is more efficient on conventional hardware but results in worse\naccuracy, while a fine-grained unstructured sparse pattern can achieve better\naccuracy but is inefficient on existing hardware.\n  On the other hand, some modern processors are equipped with fast on-chip\nscratchpad memories and gather/scatter engines that perform indirect load and\nstore operations on such memories. In this work, we propose a set of novel\nsparse patterns, named gather-scatter (GS) patterns, to utilize the scratchpad\nmemories and gather/scatter engines to speed up neural network inferences.\nCorrespondingly, we present a compact sparse format. The proposed set of sparse\npatterns, along with a novel pruning methodology, address the load imbalance\nissue and result in models with quality close to unstructured sparse models and\ncomputation efficiency close to structured sparse models. Our experiments show\nthat GS patterns consistently make better trade-offs between accuracy and\ncomputation efficiency compared to conventional structured sparse patterns. GS\npatterns can reduce the runtime of the DNN components by two to three times at\nthe same accuracy levels.

Since a point cloud with a nonzero label\nassociated with each point gives rise to a persistent module of sheaf cochain\ncomplexes, the spectra of persistent sheaf Laplacians encodes both geometrical\nand non-geometrical information of the given point cloud. The theory of\npersistent sheaf Laplacians is an elegant method for combining different types\nof data and has huge potential for development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 23:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 23:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Finding cliques of size k (k-cliques) is one example\nof this NP-hard problem. Different algorithms for clique counting avoid\ncounting the same clique multiple times by pivoting or ordering the graph.\nOrdering-based algorithms include an ordering step to direct the edges in the\ninput graph, and a counting step, which is dominated by building node or\nedge-induced subgraphs. Of the ordering-based algorithms, kClist is the\nstate-of-the art algorithm designed to work on sparse real-world graphs.\nDespite its leading overall performance, kClist's vertex-parallel\nimplementation does not scale well in practice on graphs with a few million\nvertices.\n  We present CITRON (Clique counting with Traffic Reducing Optimizations) to\nimprove the parallel scalability and thus overall performance of clique\ncounting. We accelerate the ordering phase by abandoning kClist's sequential\ncore ordering and using a parallelized degree ordering. We accelerate the\ncounting phase with our reorganized subgraph data structures that reduce memory\ntraffic to improve scaling bottlenecks. Our sorted, compact neighbor lists\nimprove locality and communication efficiency which results in near-linear\nparallel scaling.

In such a circumstance, we can draw the following picture: A\nboundary layer between the out-flowing gas and the trapped gas arises around\nthe stagnation point at the back side of the BCG. Since the boundary\ntemperature is so low as to be X-ray dim, the boundary could be observed as the\ncold front in X-rays.

The spiraling flow turns the BCG on\nthe up stream side of the main flow from the far outside, and arises another\nboundary layer having contact discontinuity with the main hot gas flow.

To reduce the annotation\ncost, we propose a structured semantic transfer (SST) framework that enables\ntraining multi-label recognition models with partial labels, i.e., merely some\nlabels are known while other labels are missing (also called unknown labels)\nper image. The framework consists of two complementary transfer modules that\nexplore within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to transfer\nknowledge of known labels to generate pseudo labels for unknown labels.\nSpecifically, an intra-image semantic transfer module learns image-specific\nlabel co-occurrence matrix and maps the known labels to complement unknown\nlabels based on this matrix. Meanwhile, a cross-image transfer module learns\ncategory-specific feature similarities and helps complement unknown labels with\nhigh similarities. Finally, both known and generated labels are used to train\nthe multi-label recognition models. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft\nCOCO, Visual Genome and Pascal VOC datasets show that the proposed SST\nframework obtains superior performance over current state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

Moreover,\npractical scenarios in the industry, impose restrictions, based on logistics\nand preference, on the manner in which the experiments can be conducted. For\nexample, material supply may enable only a handful of experiments in a\nsingle-shot or in the case of computational models one may face significant\nwait-time based on shared computational resources. In such scenarios, one\nusually resorts to performing experiments in a manner that allows for\nmaximizing one's state-of-knowledge while satisfying the above mentioned\npractical constraints. Sequential design of experiments (SDOE) is a popular\nsuite of methods, that has yielded promising results in recent years across\ndifferent engineering and practical problems. A common strategy, that leverages\nBayesian formalism is the Bayesian SDOE, which usually works best in the\none-step-ahead or myopic scenario of selecting a single experiment at each step\nof a sequence of experiments.

As a type of\nlarge-capacity and energy-efficient HVAC system (up to 100 MW), district\ncooling system (DCS) is emerging in modern cities and has huge potential to be\nregulated as a flexible load. However, strategically controlling a DCS to\nprovide flexibility is challenging, because one DCS services multiple buildings\nwith complex thermal dynamics and uncertain cooling demands. Improper control\nmay lead to significant thermal discomfort and even deteriorate the power\nsystem's operation security. To address the above issues, we propose a\nmodel-free control strategy based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nwithout the requirement of accurate system model and uncertainty distribution.\nTo avoid damaging \"trial & error\" actions that may violate the system's\noperation security during the training process, we further propose a safe layer\ncombined to the DRL to guarantee the satisfaction of critical constraints,\nforming a safe-DRL scheme. Moreover, after providing operating reserve, DCS\nincreases power and tries to recover all the buildings' temperature back to set\nvalues, which may probably cause an instantaneous peak-power rebound and bring\na secondary impact on power systems. Therefore, we design a self-adaption\nreward function within the proposed safe-DRL scheme to constrain the peak-power\neffectively. Numerical studies based on a realistic DCS demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 02:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In the considered model, the\ntransmitter first learns a nonlinear analysis transform to map the source data\ninto latent space, then transmits the latent representation to the receiver via\ndeep joint source-channel coding. Our model incorporates the nonlinear\ntransform as a strong prior to effectively extract the source semantic features\nand provide side information for source-channel coding. Unlike existing\nconventional deep joint source-channel coding methods, the proposed NTSCC\nessentially learns both the source latent representation and an entropy model\nas the prior on the latent representation. Accordingly, novel adaptive rate\ntransmission and hyperprior-aided codec refinement mechanisms are developed to\nupgrade deep joint source-channel coding. The whole system design is formulated\nas an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the end-to-end\ntransmission rate-distortion performance under established perceptual quality\nmetrics.

Recent work\nleverages the sparsity of the assembly graph to find $r$-dominating sets which\nenable rapid approximate queries through a dominator-centric graph partition.\nIn this paper, we consider two problems related to reducing uncertainty and\nimproving scalability in this setting.\n  First, we observe that nodes with multiple closest dominators necessitate\narbitrary tie-breaking in the existing pipeline.

We prove minimizing congestion is NP-hard, and\ngive an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\Delta^r})$ approximation algorithm, where $\\Delta$\nis the max degree.\n  To improve scalability, the graph should be partitioned into uniformly sized\npieces, subject to placing vertices with a closest dominator. This leads to\n$\\textit{balanced neighborhood partitioning}$: given an $r$-dominating set,\nfind a partition into connected subgraphs with optimal uniformity so that each\nvertex is co-assigned with some closest dominator. Using variance of piece\nsizes to measure uniformity, we show this problem is NP-hard iff $r$ is greater\nthan $1$.

A technique called verbal autopsy (VA)\nis widely adopted to gather information on deaths in practice. A VA consists of\ninterviewing relatives of a deceased person about symptoms of the deceased in\nthe period leading to the death, often resulting in multivariate binary\nresponses. While statistical methods have been devised for estimating the\ncause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) for a study population, continued\nexpansion of VA to new populations (or \"domains\") necessitates approaches that\nrecognize between-domain differences while capitalizing on potential\nsimilarities. In this paper, we propose such a domain-adaptive method that\nintegrates external between-domain similarity information encoded by a\npre-specified rooted weighted tree.

The numerical\nmodel presented here is first validated against experimental data from the open\nliterature. After which, two cases are examined, in the first it is assumed\nthat the electric charge is uniformly distributed along the threads while in\nthe second, the electric charge is located at the thread tip. It is shown that\nthe normalized terminal ballooning velocity, i.e. the velocity at which the\nspiders balloon after they reach steady-state, decrease linearly with the\nnormalized lift force, especially for the tip located charge case. For the\nuniform electric charge case, this velocity shows a slightly weaker dependence\non the normalized lift force. Moreover, it is shown in both cases that the\nnormalized terminal ballooning velocity has no dependence on the normalized\nelastic bending stiffness of the threads and on the normalized viscous forces.\nFinally, the multi-thread bending process shows a three-dimensional conical\nsheet.

Quantifying the effect of such mitigation\nstrategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of\nnew daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nmodeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes\nthe spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19\nprogression.

The proposed model is applied to several U.S.\nstates and counties, and the results confirm the effect of \"stay-at-home\norders\" and some states' early \"re-openings\" by detecting break points close to\nsuch events. Further, the model provided satisfactory short-term forecasts of\nthe number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated\nspatio-temporal covariance structures.

One way of exploring this\nquestion is to study population dynamics using reaction-diffusion equations,\nwhere migration is usually represented as a linear diffusion term, and\nbirth-death is represented with a bistable source term. While linear diffusion\nis most commonly employed to study migration, there are several limitations of\nthis approach, such as the inability of linear diffusion-based models to\npredict a well-defined population front. One way to overcome this is to\ngeneralise the constant diffusivity, $D$, to a nonlinear diffusivity function\n$D(C)$, where $C>0$ is the density. While it has been formally established that\nthe choice of $D(C)$ affects long-term survival or extinction of a bistable\npopulation, working solely in a classical continuum framework makes it\ndifficult to understand precisely how the choice of $D(C)$ affects survival or\nextinction. Here, we address this question by working with a simple discrete\nsimulation model that is easy to interpret. The continuum limit of the discrete\nmodel is a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, where the flux involves a\nnonlinear diffusion term and the source term is given by the strong Allee\neffect bistable model. We study population extinction/survival using this very\nintuitive discrete framework together with numerical solutions of the\nreaction-diffusion continuum limit equation. This approach provides clear\ninsight into how the choice of $D(C)$ either encourages or suppresses\npopulation extinction relative to the classical linear diffusion model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 05:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 02:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Given the triplet training corpus $\\langle speech,\ntranscription, translation\\rangle$, the conventional high-quality E2E-ST system\nleverages the $\\langle speech, transcription\\rangle$ pair to pre-train the\nmodel and then utilizes the $\\langle speech, translation\\rangle$ pair to\noptimize it further. However, this process only involves two-tuple data at each\nstage, and this loose coupling fails to fully exploit the association between\ntriplet data. In this paper, we attempt to model the joint probability of\ntranscription and translation based on the speech input to directly leverage\nsuch triplet data. Based on that, we propose a novel regularization method for\nmodel training to improve the agreement of dual-path decomposition within\ntriplet data, which should be equal in theory. To achieve this goal, we\nintroduce two Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization terms into the model\ntraining objective to reduce the mismatch between output probabilities of\ndual-path. Then the well-trained model can be naturally transformed as the\nE2E-ST models by the pre-defined early stop tag. Experiments on the MuST-C\nbenchmark demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art E2E-ST baselines on all 8 language pairs, while achieving\nbetter performance in the automatic speech recognition task.

Thus, we attempt to effectively aggregate\nthe discriminative information of actions and interactions from both RGB videos\nand skeleton sequences by attentively fusing multi-modal features. Recently,\nsome nonlinear multi-modal fusion approaches are proposed by utilizing\nnonlinear attention mechanism that is extended from Squeeze-and-Excitation\nNetworks (SENet). Inspired by this, we propose a novel\nExpansion-Squeeze-Excitation Fusion Network (ESE-FN) to effectively address the\nproblem of elderly activity recognition, which learns modal and channel-wise\nExpansion-Squeeze-Excitation (ESE) attentions for attentively fusing the\nmulti-modal features in the modal and channel-wise ways. Furthermore, we design\na new Multi-modal Loss (ML) to keep the consistency between the single-modal\nfeatures and the fused multi-modal features by adding the penalty of difference\nbetween the minimum prediction losses on single modalities and the prediction\nloss on the fused modality. Finally, we conduct experiments on a largest-scale\nelderly activity dataset, i.e., ETRI-Activity3D (including 110,000+ videos, and\n50+ categories), to demonstrate that the proposed ESE-FN achieves the best\naccuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Machine learning tools are\ncommonly used to provide {\\it predictions} of survival outcomes, but the\nestimated effect of a selected predictor suffers from confirmation bias unless\nthe selection is taken into account. The new approach involves construction of\nsemi-parametrically efficient estimators of the linear association between the\npredictors and the survival outcome, which are used to build a test statistic\nfor detecting the presence of an association between any of the predictors and\nthe outcome. Further, a stabilization technique reminiscent of bagging allows a\nnormal calibration for the resulting test statistic, which enables the\nconstruction of confidence intervals for the maximal association between\npredictors and the outcome and also greatly reduces computational cost.\nTheoretical results show that this testing procedure is valid even when the\nnumber of predictors grows superpolynomially with sample size, and our\nsimulations support that this asymptotic guarantee is indicative the\nperformance of the test at moderate sample sizes.

With HL Tau, its polarization pattern at $\\sim\n1.3$mm shows a transition between the two patterns making it the first example\nto reveal such transition. We use the T-matrix method to model elongated dust\ngrains and properly treat scattering of aligned non-spherical grains with a\nplane-parallel slab model. We demonstrate that a change in optical depth can\nnaturally explain the polarization transition of HL Tau. At low optical depths,\nthe thermal polarization dominates, while at high optical depths, dichroic\nextinction effectively takes out the thermal polarization and scattering\npolarization dominates. Motivated by results from the plane-parallel slab, we\ndevelop a simple technique to disentangle thermal polarization of the aligned\ngrains $T_{0}$ and polarization due to scattering $S$ using the azimuthal\nvariation of the polarization fraction. We find that, with increasing\nwavelength, the fractional polarization spectrum of the scattering component\n$S$ decreases, while the thermal component $T_{0}$ increases, which is expected\nsince the optical depth decreases.

Our approach is based on the\nFokker--Planck equation for paraxial imaging, which is the diffusive\ngeneralization of the transport-of-intensity equation. Specifically, we utilize\nthe Fokker--Planck equation in the context of propagation-based phase-contrast\nimaging, where we show that two intensity images are sufficient for successful\nretrieval of the projected thickness and dark-field signals associated with the\nsample. We show the results of our algorithm using both a simulated dataset and\nan experimental dataset. These demonstrate that the x-ray dark-field signal can\nbe extracted from propagation-based images, and that x-ray phase can be\nretrieved with better spatial resolution when dark-field effects are taken into\naccount. We anticipate the proposed algorithm will be of benefit in biomedical\nimaging, industrial settings, and other non-invasive imaging applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 05:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 07:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

When the on-site interaction $U$ is much larger than\nthe hopping, the effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ describing the spin sector can\nbe found using a Floquet perturbation theory. To third order in the hopping,\n$H_{eff}$ is found to have the form of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with three\ndifferent nearest-neighbor couplings $(J_\\alpha,J_\\beta,J_\\gamma)$ on bonds\nlying along the different directions. Remarkably, when the periodic driving\ndoes not have time-reversal symmetry (TRS), $H_{eff}$ is also found to have a\nchiral three-spin interaction in each triangle, with the coefficient $C$ of the\ninteraction having opposite signs on up- and down-pointing triangles.

GFDM is a meshless method that can obtain\nthe difference schemes of spatial derivatives by using Taylor expansion in\nlocal node influence domains and the weighted least squares method. The\nfirst-order single-point upstream scheme in the FDM/FVM-based reservoir\nsimulator is introduced to GFDM to form the upwind GFDM, based on which, a\nsequential coupled discrete scheme of the pressure diffusion equation and the\nheat convection-conduction equation is solved to obtain pressure and\ntemperature profiles. This paper demonstrates that this method can be used to\nobtain the meshless solution of the convection-diffusion equation with a stable\nupwind effect.

As a breakthrough to\ncompensate for this insufficiency, the application of pseudo-haptic features\nwhich create the visuo-haptic illusion without actual physical haptic stimulus\ncan be explored.

While there is a\nnumber of supervised solutions proposed for this problem in the literature,\nmost of them assume that access to the ground truth (in form of class labels)\nis unlimited and such information can be instantly utilized when updating the\nlearning system. This is far from being realistic, as one must consider the\nunderlying cost of acquiring labels. Therefore, solutions that can reduce the\nrequirements for ground truth in streaming scenarios are required. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework for mining drifting data streams on a\nbudget, by combining information coming from active learning and self-labeling.\nWe introduce several strategies that can take advantage of both intelligent\ninstance selection and semi-supervised procedures, while taking into account\nthe potential presence of concept drift. Such a hybrid approach allows for\nefficient exploration and exploitation of streaming data structures within\nrealistic labeling budgets. Since our framework works as a wrapper, it may be\napplied with different learning algorithms. Experimental study, carried out on\na diverse set of real-world data streams with various types of concept drift,\nproves the usefulness of the proposed strategies when dealing with highly\nlimited access to class labels. The presented hybrid approach is especially\nfeasible when one cannot increase a budget for labeling or replace an\ninefficient classifier. We deliver a set of recommendations regarding areas of\napplicability for our strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 07:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In this paper, we propose a\nMulti-Preferences Model (MPM) to eliminate the effects of unexpected behaviors.\nMPM first extracts the users' instant preferences from their recent historical\ninteractions by a fine-grained preference module. Then an unexpected-behaviors\ndetector is trained to judge whether these instant preferences are biased by\nunexpected behaviors.

In SOIT, multiple queries are learned to directly reason a\nset of object embeddings of semantic category, bounding-box location, and\npixel-wise mask in parallel under the global image context. The class and\nbounding-box can be easily embedded by a fixed-length vector. The pixel-wise\nmask, especially, is embedded by a group of parameters to construct a\nlightweight instance-aware transformer. Afterward, a full-resolution mask is\nproduced by the instance-aware transformer without involving any RoI-based\noperation. Overall, SOIT introduces a simple single-stage instance segmentation\nframework that is both RoI- and NMS-free. Experimental results on the MS COCO\ndataset demonstrate that SOIT outperforms state-of-the-art instance\nsegmentation approaches significantly. Moreover, the joint learning of multiple\ntasks in a unified query embedding can also substantially improve the detection\nperformance.

Hence corresponding to each such R, we have a sound and\nrefutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-R. To handle arbitrary\nrepresentations for the strategies, we introduce consistency checking rules in\nMRes-R instead of isomorphism checking. As a result these proof systems are not\npolynomial time verifiable. Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps\nis too restrictive and can be replaced with arbitrary representations leading\nto several interesting proof systems.\n  Exploring proof theoretic properties of MRes-R, we show that\neFrege+$\\forall$red simulates all valid refutations from proof systems in\nMRes-R.

In multi-stage jobs,\neach job consists of multiple coflows and is represented by a Directed Acyclic\nGraph (DAG). Efficiently scheduling coflows is critical to improve the\ndata-parallel computing performance in data centers. Compared with hand-tuned\nscheduling heuristics, existing work DeepWeave [1] utilizes Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) framework to generate highly-efficient coflow scheduling policies\nautomatically. It employs a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the job\ninformation in a set of embedding vectors, and feeds a flat embedding vector\ncontaining the whole job information to the policy network. However, this\nmethod has poor scalability as it is unable to cope with jobs represented by\nDAGs of arbitrary sizes and shapes, which requires a large policy network for\nprocessing a high-dimensional embedding vector that is difficult to train. In\nthis paper, we first utilize a directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN) to\nprocess the input and propose a novel Pipelined-DAGNN, which can effectively\nspeed up the feature extraction process of the DAGNN. Next, we feed the\nembedding sequence composed of schedulable coflows instead of a flat embedding\nof all coflows to the policy network, and output a priority sequence, which\nmakes the size of the policy network depend on only the dimension of features\ninstead of the product of dimension and number of nodes in the job's\nDAG.Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the priority scheduling policy, we\nincorporate the Self-Attention Mechanism into a deep RL model to capture the\ninteraction between different parts of the embedding sequence to make the\noutput priority scores relevant. Based on this model, we then develop a coflow\nscheduling algorithm for online multi-stage jobs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 09:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In this paper, the authors propose an online\nrobot programming methodology that eliminates unnecessary steps traditionally\nperformed in robotic welding, so that the operator only performs three steps to\ncomplete the welding task. First, choose the piece to weld. Then, enter the\nwelding parameters. Finally, it sends the automatically generated program to\nthe robot.

The operating\ncomplexity of the system has been reduced as much as possible.

We demonstrate that the experimental\ndistributions and their dependence on beam parameters can be described\nquantitatively by a previously developed simulation model if dust particles are\nassumed to be attracted by the beam. The latter finding is consistent with\nrecent time profile studies and yields further evidence that dust particles\ncarry a negative charge when entering the beam. We also develop different\nhypotheses regarding the absence of higher-loss events in the measurements,\nalthough such events are theoretically not excluded by the simulation model.\nThe results provide grounds for predicting dust-induced beam losses in presence\nof higher-intensity beams in future runs of the High-Luminosity LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 09:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Here we report on a new type of volatile optical bistability\nin a resonant hybrid nano-optomechanical device, comprising of a pair of\nanchored nanowires decorated with plasmonic metamolecules. The nonlinearity\nresides in the mechanical properties of the nanowires and is transduced to its\noptical response by reconfiguring the plasmonic metamolecules. Such a system\ncan be driven to a bistable response by acoustic signals modulated at the\nnatural mechanical resonance of the nanowire. The memory of such a device is\nvolatile and can be erased by removing the acoustic signal but in its presence,\nit can be switched between bistable optical states with microwatts of optical\npower. We argue that the demonstration of hybrid nano-optomechanical\nbistability opens new opportunities to develop practical low-power bistable\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 10:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In\nthis paper, we propose EPNet++ for multi-modal 3D object detection by\nintroducing a novel Cascade Bi-directional Fusion~(CB-Fusion) module and a\nMulti-Modal Consistency~(MC) loss. More concretely, the proposed CB-Fusion\nmodule enhances point features with plentiful semantic information absorbed\nfrom the image features in a cascade bi-directional interaction fusion manner,\nleading to more powerful and discriminative feature representations. The MC\nloss explicitly guarantees the consistency between predicted scores from two\nmodalities to obtain more comprehensive and reliable confidence scores. The\nexperimental results on the KITTI, JRDB and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of EPNet++ over the state-of-the-art methods.

The link between the temperature dependence and the size\nof the scattering phase space is straightforward, but not the microscopic\nsource of dissipation.

This interpretation is challenged by a number of experimental\nobservations: the persistence of T-square resistivity in dilute metals (in\nwhich the two mechanisms are irrelevant), the successful extension of\nKadowaki-Woods scaling to dilute metals, and the observation of a\nsize-dependent T-square thermal resistivity ($T/\\kappa$) and its\nWiedemann-Franz (WF) correlation with T-square electrical resistivity.

In this paper, we aim to provide a basic underpinning of\nthe dry dynamics of general low mean molecular weight, temperate sub-Neptune\natmospheres. We use the ExoFMS GCM with an idealised grey gas radiation scheme\nto simulate planetary atmospheres with different levels of instellation and\nrotation rates, using the atmosphere of K2-18b as our control. We find that the\natmospheres of tidally-locked, temperate sub-Neptunes have weak horizontal\ntemperature gradients owing to their slow rotation rates and hydrogen-dominated\ncomposition. The zonal wind structure is dominated by high-latitude\ncyclostrophic jets driven by the conservation of angular momentum. At low\npressures we observe superrotating equatorial jets, which we propose are driven\nby a Rossby-Kelvin instability similar to the type seen in simulations of\nidealised atmospheres with axisymmetric forcing. By viewing the flow in\ntidally-locked coordinates, we find the predominant overturning circulation to\nbe between the dayside and nightside, and we derive scaling relations linking\nthe tidally-locked streamfunction and vertical velocities to instellation.\nComparing our results to the only other GCM study of K2-18b, we find\nsignificant qualitative differences in dynamics, highlighting the need for\nfurther collaboration and investigation into effects of different dynamical\ncores and physical parameterizations.

SAC is demonstrated to perform very well in a list of continous\ncontrol tasks with good stability and robustness. SAC learns a stochastic\nGaussian policy that can maximize a trade-off between total expected reward and\nthe policy entropy. To update the policy, SAC minimizes the KL-Divergence\nbetween the current policy density and the soft value function density.\nReparameterization trick is then used to obtain the approximate gradient of\nthis divergence. In this paper, we propose Soft Actor-Critic with Cross-Entropy\nPolicy Optimization (SAC-CEPO), which uses Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) to\noptimize the policy network of SAC. The initial idea is to use CEM to\niteratively sample the closest distribution towards the soft value function\ndensity and uses the resultant distribution as a target to update the policy\nnetwork. For the purpose of reducing the computational complexity, we also\nintroduce a decoupled policy structure that decouples the Gaussian policy into\none policy that learns the mean and one other policy that learns the deviation\nsuch that only the mean policy is trained by CEM.

Concretely, a spherical point cloud served as the template is\nprogressively deformed to fit the target shape in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nDuring the shape formation process, several checkpoints are inserted to\nfacilitate recording and investigating the intermediate stages.

The latent representations of both\namplitude and phase are studied in two decoders of the foundation autoencoder\n(FAE) with only a limited set of clean speech signals independently. Then, the\ndownstream autoencoder (DAE) learns a shared latent space between the clean\nspeech and mixture representations with a large number of unseen mixtures. A\ncomplex-cycle-consistent (CCC) mechanism is proposed to minimize the\nreconstruction loss between the amplitude and phase domains. Besides, it is\nnoticed that if the speech features are extracted as the multi-resolution\nspectra, the desired information distributed in spectra of different scales can\nbe studied to further boost the performance. The NOISEX and DAPS corpora are\nused to generate mixtures with different interferences to evaluate the efficacy\nof the proposed method. It is highlighted that the clean speech and mixtures\nfed in FAE and DAE are not paired. Both ablation and comparison experimental\nresults show that the proposed method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

For images with partially invisible limbs, PONet estimates the 3D\norientation of these limbs by taking advantage of the local image evidence to\nrecover the 3D pose.Moreover, PONet is competent to infer full 3D poses even\nfrom images with completely invisible limbs, by exploiting the orientation\ncorrelation between visible limbs to complement the estimated poses,further\nimproving the robustness of 3D pose estimation.We evaluate our method on\nmultiple datasets, including Human3.6M, MPII, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

To achieve this goal, we in\nthis paper propose a novel dual-normalization model by leveraging the augmented\nsource-similar and source-dissimilar images during our generalizable\nsegmentation. To be specific, given a single source domain, aiming to simulate\nthe possible appearance change in unseen target domains, we first utilize a\nnonlinear transformation to augment source-similar and source-dissimilar\nimages. Then, to sufficiently exploit these two types of augmentations, our\nproposed dual-normalization based model employs a shared backbone yet\nindependent batch normalization layer for separate normalization. Afterward, we\nput forward a style-based selection scheme to automatically choose the\nappropriate path in the test stage. Extensive experiments on three publicly\navailable datasets, i.e., BraTS, Cross-Modality Cardiac, and Abdominal\nMulti-Organ datasets, have demonstrated that our method outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art domain generalization methods.

This work focuses on the South China Sea (SCS) and quantifies the\ndynamical impacts of the Mekong River plume, which is bound to significantly\nchange in strength and seasonality in the next 20 years if the construction of\nover hundred dams moves ahead as planned. The dynamic impact of the freshwater\nfluxes on the SCS circulation are quantified by comparing submesoscale\npermitting and mesoscale resolving simulations with and without riverine input\nbetween 2011 and 2016. In the summer and early fall, when the Mekong discharge\nis at its peak, the greater stratification causes a residual mesoscale\ncirculation through enhanced baroclinic instability. The residual circulation\nis shaped as an eddy train of positive and negative vorticity. Submesoscale\nfronts are responsible for transporting the freshwater offshore, shifting\neastward the development of the residual mesoscale circulation, and further\nstrengthening the residual eddy train in the submesoscale permitting case.\nOverall, the northward transport near the surface is intensified in the\npresence of riverine input. The significance of the mesoscale-induced and\nsubmesoscale-induced transport associated with the river plume is especially\nimportant in in the second half of the summer monsoon season, when primary\nproductivity has a secondary maximum. Circulation changes, and therefore\nproductivity changes, should be anticipated if human activities modify the\nintensity and seasonality of the Mekong River plume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The introduced design is the first\ndifferential with three outputs to realise this outcome. The differential\naction between the three outputs is realised passively by a symmetric\narrangement of three two-output open differentials and three two-input open\ndifferentials. The resulting differential mechanism achieves the novel result\nof equivalent input to output angular velocity and torque relations for all its\nthree outputs.

The definition of the indicator is based on the\nanalysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of\nthe risk of accruing delay.

The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be\nestimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an\nindicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify\nareas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g.,\nresectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to\nconsider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In classical protocols the quantum Fisher information scales\nlinearly with time, while typical quantum-enhanced strategies achieve a\nquadratic (Heisenberg) or even higher-order polynomial scalings.

Existing\napproaches that rely on decoding a latent feature to recover the complete\nshape, often lead to the completed point cloud being over-smoothing, losing\ndetails, and noisy. Instead of decoding a whole shape, we propose to decode and\nrefine a low-resolution (low-res) point cloud first, and then performs a\npatch-wise noise-aware upsampling rather than interpolating the whole sparse\npoint cloud at once, which tends to lose details. Regarding the possibility of\nlacking details of the initially decoded low-res point cloud, we propose an\niterative refinement to recover the geometric details and a symmetrization\nprocess to preserve the trustworthy information from the input partial point\ncloud. After obtaining a sparse and complete point cloud, we propose a\npatch-wise upsampling strategy. Patch-based upsampling allows to better recover\nfine details unlike decoding a whole shape, however, the existing upsampling\nmethods are not applicable to completion task due to the data discrepancy\n(i.e., input sparse data here is not from ground-truth). Therefore, we propose\na patch extraction approach to generate training patch pairs between the sparse\nand ground-truth point clouds, and an outlier removal step to suppress the\nnoisy points from the sparse point cloud.

Fairness in human decisions is as important as,\nif not more important than, fairness in machine learning models since there are\nprocesses where humans make the final decisions and machine learning models can\ninherit bias from the human decisions they were trained on. As a result, this\nwork aims to detect unfairness in human decisions, the very first step of\nsolving the unfair human decision problem.\n  This paper proposes to utilize the existing machine learning fairness\ndetection mechanisms to detect unfairness in human decisions. The rationale\nbehind this is, while it is difficult to directly test whether a human makes\nunfair decisions, with current research on machine learning fairness, it is now\neasy to test, on a large scale at a low cost, whether a machine learning model\nis unfair. By synthesizing unfair labels on four general machine learning\nfairness datasets and one image processing dataset, this paper shows that the\nproposed approach is able to detect (1) whether or not unfair labels exist in\nthe training data and (2) the degree and direction of the unfairness. We\nbelieve that this work demonstrates the potential of utilizing machine learning\nfairness to detect human decision fairness.

A distinguishing feature is that\nthe asymmetry in the critical current depends sensitively on the magnitude and\ndirection of an applied magnetic field and achieves its maximum value of ~60%\nwhen the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current and is of the order of\njust 10 mT. Moreover the asymmetry changes sign several times with increasing\nfield. These characteristic features are accounted for in a theoretical model\nbased on finite-momentum Cooper pairing derived from spin-helical topological\nsurface states, in an otherwise centrosymmetric system. The finite pairing\nmomentum is further established, and its value determined, from the evolution\nof the interference pattern under an in-plane magnetic field. The observed\ngiant magnitude of the asymmetry in critical current and the clear exposition\nof its underlying mechanism paves the way to building novel superconducting\ncomputing devices using the Josephson diode effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Energy Peer-to-Peer (P2P)\nsystems have been shown to be beneficial for prosumers and consumers through\nreductions in energy cost while being attractive to grid or service provider.\nHowever, many practical challenges have to be overcome before all players could\ngain in having efficient and automated local energy communities, including the\ninherent complexity of matching together geographically distributed peers and\nthe significant computation required to calculate the local matching\npreferences. Hence dedicated algorithms are required to be able to perform a\ncost-efficient matching of thousands of peers in a computational-efficient\nfashion. We define and analyse in this work a precise mathematical modelling of\nthe geographical peer matching problem. We then propose and analyse dedicated\nalgorithms.

Anisotropy has not been earlier considered in the\nMotter-Lai model and is a real feature that may affect the cascading failures.\nThis could reflect the existence of a preferred direction in which a given\nattribute of the system manifests, such as power lines that follow a city built\nparallel to the coast. We show that the anisotropy causes a greater spread of\ndamage along the preferential direction of links. We also identify the critical\nlinear size, $l_c$, for a square shaped localized attack, which satisfies with\nhigh probability that above $l_c$ the cascading disrupts the giant component of\nfunctional nodes, while below $l_c$ the damage does not spread. We find that,\nfor networks with any characteristic link length, their robustness decreases\nwith the strength of the anisotropy. We show that the value of $l_c$ is finite\nand independent of the system size (for large systems), both for isotropic and\nanisotropic networks. Thus, in contrast to random attacks, where the critical\nfraction of nodes that survive the initial attack, $p_c$, is usually below 1,\nhere $p_c = 1$. Note that the analogy to $p_c = 1$ is also found for localized\nattacks in interdependent spatial networks. Finally, we measure the final\ndistribution of functional cluster sizes and find a power-law behavior, with\nexponents similar to regular percolation. This indicates that, after the\ncascade which destroys the giant component, the system is at a percolation\ncritical point. Additionally, we observe a crossover in the value of the\ndistribution exponent, from critical percolation in a two-dimensional lattice\nfor strong spatial embedding, to mean-field percolation for weak embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 15:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

However, \"How best to stir?\" remains a major\nchallenge. This study aims to contribute to existing solutions by the\ndevelopment of a dedicated flow-control strategy for the fast heating of a cold\nfluid via a hot boundary in a representative case study. Fluid deformation acts\nas the \"thermal actuator\" via which the flow affects heat transfer yet this may\nboth enhance and diminish heat exchange between fluid parcels and thus\nrestricts the beneficial impact of flow. Moreover, the impact of fluid\ndeformation on the global fluid heating is primarily confined to the proximity\nof the moving boundary that drives the flow. These insights make incorporation\nof thermal behaviour essential for effective flow-based enhancement strategies\nand expose fluid mixing, the conventional approach in industry, as potentially\nsub-optimal. The notion that global heating encompasses two concurrent\nprocesses, i.e. increasing energy content and thermal homogenisation, yields\nthe relevant metrics for the formulation of the control problem as the\nminimisation of a dedicated cost function. This facilitates step-wise\ndetermination of the \"best\" flow reorientation from predicted future evolutions\nof actual intermediate states and thereby paves the way to (real-time)\nregulation of scalar transport by flow control. Performance analyses reveal\nthat this \"adaptive flow reorientation\" significantly accelerates fluid heating\nand thus is superior to conventional periodic schemes (designed for efficient\nfluid mixing) both in consistency and effectiveness. The controller in fact\nnever selects these periodic schemes and achieves the same superior performance\nfor all flow conditions irrespective of whether said mixing occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

In existing works, the sample size for the\nconfidence interval is universally set and agnostic to the input for\nprediction. This Input-Agnostic Sampling (IAS) scheme may yield a poor Average\nCertified Radius (ACR)-runtime trade-off which calls for improvement. In this\npaper, we propose Input-Specific Sampling (ISS) acceleration to achieve the\ncost-effectiveness for robustness certification, in an adaptive way of reducing\nthe sampling size based on the input characteristic. Furthermore, our method\nuniversally controls the certified radius decline from the ISS sample size\nreduction. The empirical results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that ISS can\nspeed up the certification by more than three times at a limited cost of 0.05\ncertified radius. Meanwhile, ISS surpasses IAS on the average certified radius\nacross the extensive hyperparameter settings.

Inspired by testing\ntechniques for traditional software systems, researchers have proposed neuron\ncoverage criteria, as an analogy to source code coverage, to guide the testing\nof DNN models. Despite very active research on DNN coverage, several recent\nstudies have questioned the usefulness of such criteria in guiding DNN testing.\nFurther, from a practical standpoint, these criteria are white-box as they\nrequire access to the internals or training data of DNN models, which is in\nmany contexts not feasible or convenient. In this paper, we investigate\nblack-box input diversity metrics as an alternative to white-box coverage\ncriteria. To this end, we first select and adapt three diversity metrics and\nstudy, in a controlled manner, their capacity to measure actual diversity in\ninput sets. We then analyse their statistical association with fault detection\nusing four datasets and five DNN models. We further compare diversity with\nstate-of-the-art white-box coverage criteria.

Indeed, we found that one of our selected black-box diversity metrics far\noutperforms existing coverage criteria in terms of fault-revealing capability\nand computational time.

Transparent ML promises to advance human factors\nengineering goals of human-centered AI in the target users. From a\nhuman-centered design perspective, transparency is not a property of the ML\nmodel but an affordance, i.e. a relationship between algorithm and user; as a\nresult, iterative prototyping and evaluation with users is critical to\nattaining adequate solutions that afford transparency. However, following\nhuman-centered design principles in healthcare and medical image analysis is\nchallenging due to the limited availability of and access to end users. To\ninvestigate the state of transparent ML in medical image analysis, we conducted\na systematic review of the literature. Our review reveals multiple severe\nshortcomings in the design and validation of transparent ML for medical image\nanalysis applications. We find that most studies to date approach transparency\nas a property of the model itself, similar to task performance, without\nconsidering end users during neither development nor evaluation. Additionally,\nthe lack of user research, and the sporadic validation of transparency claims\nput contemporary research on transparent ML for medical image analysis at risk\nof being incomprehensible to users, and thus, clinically irrelevant.

The INTRPRT guideline suggests formative user research as the\nfirst step of transparent model design to understand user needs and domain\nrequirements. Following this process produces evidence to support design\nchoices, and ultimately, increases the likelihood that the algorithms afford\ntransparency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 05:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 19:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 20:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 19:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Existing methods first train a model\nto predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with\nhistorical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint using\ncounterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion\nprediction model is unbiased, i.e., it can give accurate predictions on any\nrandomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones.\nNevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the exposed\nadvertisements are recommended according to user preferences. This confounding\nbias of users would lead to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the\ncounterfactual prediction and cause concept drift in attribution. In this\npaper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to eliminate the\ninfluence of user preferences. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias\nfrom both static and dynamic preferences to learn the conversion prediction\nmodel using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove\nCausalMTA can learn an unbiased prediction model with sufficient data.\nExtensive experiments on both public datasets and the impression data in an\ne-commerce company show that CausalMTA not only achieves better prediction\nperformance than the state-of-the-art method but also generates meaningful\nattribution credits across different advertising channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 01:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 06:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different\ntasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake\nusers detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter\nposts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes\nit challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently.\nTweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to\nimprove automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this\ntask varies depending on the pooling method.\n  In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter,\nwhich groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users\nwho mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user\ninteraction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state\nof the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality,\ndocument retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning\nclassification score. Results show that our Community polling method\noutperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous\ndatasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing\nwith big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall,\nour findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent\ntopics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery\nof a topic decomposition model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 17:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

In particular, analyzing the games since the\nintroduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game's \"importance\"\n(as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the point\nof view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the\nalgorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson\nmodel proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form\nof the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive\ncapability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field\nadvantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but\nnotable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results\nwith the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling\nprinciple, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the\ncharacteristics of the football competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 21:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}
