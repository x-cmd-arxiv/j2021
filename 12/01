By probing the\nlow-energy cosmic rays, low-frequency radio observations are especially\ninteresting because they unveil emission powered by low-efficiency particle\nacceleration processes, which are believed to play a crucial role in the origin\nof diffuse radio emission. We investigate the origin of the radio mini-halo at\nthe center of the galaxy cluster 2A0335+096 and its connection to the central\ngalaxy and the sloshing cool core. We also study the properties of the\nhead-tail galaxy GB6 B0335+096 hosted in the cluster to explore the lifecycle\nof the relativistic electrons in its radio tails. We use new LOw Frequency\nARray (LOFAR) observations from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey at 144 MHz to\nmap the low-frequency emission with a high level of detail. The new data were\ncombined with archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Chandra observations\nto carry out a multi-wavelength study. We have made the first measurement of\nthe spectral index of the mini-halo ($\\alpha=-1.2\\pm0.1$ between 144 MHz and\n1.4 GHz) and the lobes of the central source ($\\alpha\\simeq-1.5\\pm0.1$ between\n144 and 610 MHz). Based on the low-frequency radio emission morphology with\nrespect to the thermal ICM, we propose that the origin of the diffuse radio\nemission is linked to the sloshing of the cool core. The new data revealed the\npresence of a Mpc-long radio tail associated with GB6 B0335+096. The observed\nprojected length is a factor 3 longer than the expected cooling length, with\nevidence of flattening in the spectral index trend along the tail. Therefore,\nwe suggest that the electrons toward the end of the tail are kept alive by the\nICM gentle re-acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Recently, the use of drones or helicopters for remote\nrecording is increasing in the industry, sparing the technicians this perilous\ntask. This, however, leaves the problem of analyzing big amounts of images,\nwhich has great potential for automation. This is a challenging task for\nseveral reasons.

Such galaxies contain half the mass in the\nlocal universe, and are analogs for the first galaxies, but observed at\ndistances that make them accessible to detailed study. Second, UVEX will\nexplore the dynamic universe through time-domain surveys and prompt\nspectroscopic followup capability will probe the environments, energetics, and\nemission processes in the early aftermaths of gravitational wave-discovered\ncompact object mergers, discover hot, fast UV transients, and diagnose the\nearly stages of stellar explosions.

Nevertheless, applying existing approaches to real-world scenarios\nremains an open challenge, due to an inherent trade-off between reconstruction\nand editability: latent space regions which can accurately represent real\nimages typically suffer from degraded semantic control. Recent work proposes to\nmitigate this trade-off by fine-tuning the generator to add the target image to\nwell-behaved, editable regions of the latent space. While promising, this\nfine-tuning scheme is impractical for prevalent use as it requires a lengthy\ntraining phase for each new image. In this work, we introduce this approach\ninto the realm of encoder-based inversion. We propose HyperStyle, a\nhypernetwork that learns to modulate StyleGAN's weights to faithfully express a\ngiven image in editable regions of the latent space. A naive modulation\napproach would require training a hypernetwork with over three billion\nparameters. Through careful network design, we reduce this to be in line with\nexisting encoders. HyperStyle yields reconstructions comparable to those of\noptimization techniques with the near real-time inference capabilities of\nencoders.

Therefore, the\nneutron lifetime can be determined separately for each of the subsets as the\ninverse frequency of its decay, which is to be averaged over the number of\nneutrons in this subset.

Sparse model training is a simple and promising\napproach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods\nstruggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in\nsparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a\nsparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and\nexpensive.

In this paper, we look at the extreme value statistics of this\nmodel and derive, for all $\\alpha$, the exact probability distributions of the\nmaximum spatial displacement $M(t)$ and arg-maximum $t_m(t)$ (i.e. the time at\nwhich this maximum is reached) till duration $t$. In the second part of our\npaper, we analyze the statistical properties of the residence time $t_r(t)$ and\nthe last-passage time $t_{\\ell}(t)$ and compute their distributions exactly for\nall values of $\\alpha$. Our study unravels that the heterogeneous version\n$(\\alpha \\neq 0)$ displays many rich and contrasting features compared to that\nof the standard Brownian motion (BM). For example, while for BM $(\\alpha =0)$,\nthe distributions of $t_m(t),~t_r(t)$ and $t_{\\ell}(t)$ are all identical\n(\\textit{\\'{a} la} \"arcsine laws\" due to L\\'{e}vy), they turn out to be\nsignificantly different for non-zero $\\alpha$. Another interesting property of\n$t_r(t)$ is the existence of a critical $\\alpha$ (which we denote by $\\alpha\n_c=-0.3182$) such that the distribution exhibits a local maximum at $t_r = t/2$\nfor $\\alpha < \\alpha _c$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 20:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 06:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Analysts maintain as much history as possible and\nwill trigger customized bulk deletions when necessary Despite a variety of\ndynamic graph processing systems and some canonical literature on theoretical\nsliding-window graph streaming, XStream is the first model explicitly designed\nto accommodate this usage model.

Yet, it does not\naccount for the possibility of nodes having oscillatory dynamics such as in\npower grids and brain networks. Here we consider a network of Kuramoto\noscillators upon which the BTW model is unfolding, enabling us to study how the\nfeedback between the oscillatory and cascading dynamics can lead to new\nemergent behaviors. We assume that the more out-of-sync a node is with its\nneighbors the more vulnerable it is and lower its load-carrying capacity\naccordingly. And when a node topples and sheds load, its oscillatory phase is\nreset at random. This leads to novel cyclic behavior at an emergent, long\ntimescale. The system spends the bulk of its time in a synchronized state where\nload builds up with minimal cascades. Yet, eventually the system reaches a\ntipping point where a large cascade triggers a \"cascade of larger cascades,\"\nwhich can be classified as a Dragon King event. The system then undergoes a\nshort transient back to the synchronous, build-up phase. The coupling between\ncapacity and synchronization gives rise to endogenous cascade seeds in addition\nto the standard exogenous ones, and we show their respective roles. We\nestablish the phenomena from numerical studies and develop the accompanying\nmean-field theory to locate the tipping point, calculate the load in the\nsystem, determine the frequency of the long-time oscillations and find the\ndistribution of cascade sizes during the build-up phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 21:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 21:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

In order\nto preserve more feasibility, the proposed algorithm uses a novel project-and\nconvexify procedure to successively convexify both state constraints and system\ndynamics, and thus a finite dimensional convex programming subproblem is solved\nat each succession. It also gets rid of the dependency on trust regions,\ngaining the ability to take larger steps and thus ultimately attaining faster\nconvergence.

In this work,\nwe study a sparsely connected attractor network where memories are learned\naccording to a Hebbian synaptic plasticity rule. After recapitulating known\nresults for the continuous, sparsely connected Hopfield model, we investigate a\nmodel in which new memories are learned continuously and old memories are\nforgotten, using an online synaptic plasticity rule. We show that for a\nforgetting time scale that optimizes storage capacity, the qualitative features\nof the network's memory retrieval dynamics are age-dependent: most recent\nmemories are retrieved as fixed-point attractors while older memories are\nretrieved as chaotic attractors characterized by strong heterogeneity and\ntemporal fluctuations. Therefore, fixed-point and chaotic attractors co-exist\nin the network phase space. The network presents a continuum of statistically\ndistinguishable memory states, where chaotic fluctuations appear abruptly above\na critical age and then increase gradually until the memory disappears. We\ndevelop a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to analyze the age-dependent\ndynamics and compare the theory with simulations of large networks.

The outer disk geometries were\nderived from Keplerian fits to the ALMA velocity maps and compared to the inner\ndisk constraints. We also predicted the locations of shadows for significantly\nmisaligned systems. Our analysis reveals six disks to exhibit significant\nmisalignments between their inner and outer disks. The predicted shadow\npositions agree well with the scattered light images of HD100453 and HD142527,\nand we find supporting evidence for a shadow in the disk around CQ Tau. In the\nother three targets for which we infer significantly misaligned disks, V1247\nOri, V1366 Ori, and RY Lup, we do not see any evident sign of shadows in the\nscattered light images.

Cryogenic\noperation offers a promising pathway towards continued improvement in computing\nspeed and energy efficiency without aggressive scaling. However, the memory\nwall bottleneck of the traditional von-Neumann architecture persists even at\ncryogenic temperature. That is where a compute-in-memory (CiM) architecture,\nthat embeds computing within the memory unit, comes into play. Computations\nwithin the memory unit help reduce the expensive data transfer between the\nmemory and the computing units. Therefore, CiM provides extreme energy\nefficiency that can enable lower cooling cost at cryogenic temperature.

Here, we investigate this entropy for rods with $k \\le 7$, by\ndefining and solving them on Husimi lattices built with diagonal and regular\nsquare lattice clusters of effective lateral size $L$, where $L$ defines the\nlevel of approximation to the square lattice. Due to an $L$-parity effect, by\nincreasing $L$ we obtain two systematic sequences of values for the entropies\n$s_L(k)$ for each type of cluster, whose extrapolations to $L \\rightarrow\n\\infty$ provide estimates of these entropies for the square lattice.

We address these shortcomings in a space-time\nGalerkin framework where the finite element interpolation also includes the\ntemporal direction. In this setting, we construct four-dimensional meshes that\nare locally refined towards the laser spot and allow for varying temporal\naccuracy depending on the position in space. By splitting the mesh into\nconforming time slabs, we recover a stepwise solution to solve the space-time\nproblem locally in time at this slab; additionally, we can choose time-slab\nsizes significantly larger than classical time-stepping schemes.

Three optimisation methods - Brute-Force,\nSimulated Annealing and Rule-Based - have been developed in order to generate\nvalid, high performance designs for a range of target platforms and CNN models.\nResults show that SAMO-optimised designs can achieve 4-20x better performance\ncompared to existing hand-tuned designs.

A major drawback of routine procedures is that there is no\nfinite sample size at which they are guaranteed to deliver exposure effect\nestimators and associated confidence intervals with adequate performance. In\nthis work, we will consider this problem when inferring conditional causal\nhazard ratios from observational studies under the assumption of no unmeasured\nconfounding. The major complication that we face with survival data is that the\nkey confounding variables may not be those that explain the censoring\nmechanism. In this paper, we overcome this problem using a novel and simple\nprocedure that can be implemented using off-the-shelf software for penalized\nCox regression. In particular, we will propose tests of the null hypothesis\nthat the exposure has no effect on the considered survival endpoint, which are\nuniformly valid under standard sparsity conditions.

Linear water wave scattering\nby a array of vertical, surface-piercing barriers is considered here, in which\nboth the submergence and spacing between the barriers are spatially graded. The\nrainbow reflection effect arises naturally as wave energy temporarily becomes\namplified at different locations depending on frequency. Band diagram\ncalculations are used to demonstrate that this is a consequence of the wave\ngradually slowing down throughout the array. The wave/barriers scattering\nproblem is then augmented by positioning heave-restricted, rectangular floating\nbodies equipped with a linear damping mechanism between each adjacent pair of\nbarrier. A solution to the resulting boundary-value problem is obtained using\nan integral equation/Galerkin method. Using constrained optimisation, passive\nrainbow absorbers are designed that achieve near-perfect absorption over (i) a\ndiscrete set of frequencies, and (ii) over an octave. This suggests potential\napplications of rainbow absorbers in the design of smart coastal technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 00:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

To this end, we propose a\nformal definition of what it means for a labelled data item to match an\nabstract scenario, encoded as a scenario program using the SCENIC probabilistic\nprogramming language. Using this definition, we develop a querying algorithm\nwhich, given a scenario program and a labelled dataset, finds the subset of\ndata matching the scenario. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is\naccurate and efficient on a variety of realistic traffic scenarios, and scales\nto a reasonable number of agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 01:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

For example, we can not measure the\nexact distance of a person to the camera from a single view image without\nadditional scene assumptions (e.g., known height). Existing learning based\napproaches circumvent this issue by reconstructing the 3D pose up to scale.\nHowever, there are many applications such as virtual telepresence, robotics,\nand augmented reality that require metric scale reconstruction. In this paper,\nwe show that audio signals recorded along with an image, provide complementary\ninformation to reconstruct the metric 3D pose of the person.\n  The key insight is that as the audio signals traverse across the 3D space,\ntheir interactions with the body provide metric information about the body's\npose. Based on this insight, we introduce a time-invariant transfer function\ncalled pose kernel -- the impulse response of audio signals induced by the body\npose. The main properties of the pose kernel are that (1) its envelope highly\ncorrelates with 3D pose, (2) the time response corresponds to arrival time,\nindicating the metric distance to the microphone, and (3) it is invariant to\nchanges in the scene geometry configurations. Therefore, it is readily\ngeneralizable to unseen scenes. We design a multi-stage 3D CNN that fuses audio\nand visual signals and learns to reconstruct 3D pose in a metric scale. We show\nthat our multi-modal method produces accurate metric reconstruction in real\nworld scenes, which is not possible with state-of-the-art lifting approaches\nincluding parametric mesh regression and depth regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 01:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 00:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

A feedforward neural\nnetwork with two individual loss groups are constructed to encode the initial\ncondition and state transitions governed by ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) in MSS. Next, we tackle the problem of high imbalance in the magnitude\nof the back-propagated gradients in PINN from a multi-task learning\nperspective.

The flow is confined between two horizontal plates which are\nmaintained at different constant temperature, salinity, and different velocity,\nthus setting up a shear across the flow. The lower plate is fixed at higher\ntemperature and salinity, while the overall (unperturbed) density gradient is\nstatically stable. For a wide range of control parameters, and for sufficiently\nstrong perturbation of the conductive initial state, we find that\nstaircase-like structures spontaneously develop, with relatively well-mixed\nlayers separated by sharp interfaces of enhanced scalar gradient. Such\nstaircases appear to be robust even in the presence of strong shear over very\nlong times, although we typically observe early time coarsening of the number\nof observed layers. For the same set of control parameters, different\nasymptotic layered states, with markedly different vertical scalar fluxes, can\narise for different initial perturbation structures. The imposed shear does\nsignificantly spatio-temporally modify the vertical transport of the various\nscalars. The flux ratio (i.e., the ratio between the density fluxes due to the\ntotal (convective and diffusive) salt flux and the total heat flux) is found,\nat steady state, to be essentially equal to the square root of the ratio of the\nsalt diffusivity to the thermal diffusivity, consistently with the physical\nmodel originally proposed by Linden and Shirtcliffe (1978) and the variational\narguments presented by Stern (1982) for unsheared double diffusive convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 01:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

However, most existing graph\nclassification problems with GNNs follow the protocol of balanced data\nsplitting, which misaligns with many real-world scenarios in which some classes\nhave much fewer labels than others. Directly training GNNs under this\nimbalanced scenario may lead to uninformative representations of graphs in\nminority classes, and compromise the overall classification performance, which\nsignifies the importance of developing effective GNNs towards handling\nimbalanced graph classification. Existing methods are either tailored for\nnon-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalanced node\nclassification while few focus on imbalanced graph classification. To this end,\nwe introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN),\nwhich alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision\nglobally from neighboring graphs and locally from stochastic augmentations of\ngraphs. Globally, we construct a graph of graphs (GoG) based on kernel\nsimilarity and perform GoG propagation to aggregate neighboring graph\nrepresentations. Locally, we employ topological augmentation via masking node\nfeatures or dropping edges with self-consistency regularization to generate\nstochastic augmentations of each graph that improve the model generalibility.\nExtensive graph classification experiments conducted on seven benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate our proposed G$^2$GNN outperforms numerous baselines by\nroughly 5\\% in both F1-macro and F1-micro scores.

However, most of existing methods either require\nspecialized hardware modification or suffer from poor imaging performance due\nto the fundamental limit of off-the-shelf commodity WiFi devices in spatial\nresolution. We observe that the recently developed reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS) could be a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Thus,\nin this paper, we propose a RIS-aided WiFi imaging framework to achieve\nhigh-resolution imaging with the off-the-shelf WiFi devices. Specifically, we\nfirst design a beamforming method to achieve the first-stage imaging by\nseparating the signals from different spatial locations with the aid of the\nRIS. Then, we propose an optimization-based super-resolution imaging algorithm\nby leveraging the low rank nature of the reconstructed object.

Simulation results demonstrate that our framework achieves median root\nmean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 and median structural similarity (SSIM) of\n0.52.

In addition, the spatial resolution\ndecreases severely with deeper depth, which is very detrimental to spatial edge\nfeature extraction. Therefore, this letter proposes a shallow model for HSIC,\nwhich is called depthwise over-parameterized convolutional neural network\n(DOCNN). To ensure the effective extraction of the shallow model, the depthwise\nover-parameterized convolution (DO-Conv) kernel is introduced to extract the\ndiscriminative features. The depthwise over-parameterized Convolution kernel is\ncomposed of a standard convolution kernel and a depthwise convolution kernel,\nwhich can extract the spatial feature of the different channels individually\nand fuse the spatial features of the whole channels simultaneously. Moreover,\nto further reduce the loss of spatial edge features due to the convolution\noperation, a dense residual connection (DRC) structure is proposed to apply to\nthe feature extraction part of the whole network. Experimental results obtained\nfrom three benchmark data sets show that the proposed method outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and computational\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 03:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Due to\nphoton recoil, atoms that are initially resonant with the single-frequency\nlaser get Doppler shifted out of resonance, which reduces the return flux.\nFrequency-chirped (also known as frequency-swept) continuous-wave lasers have\nthe potential to mitigate the effect of spectral hole burning and even increase\nthe laser guide star efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of a\nsingle-frequency laser. On-sky measurements of a frequency-chirped,\nsingle-frequency laser guide star are performed at the Roque de los Muchachos\nObservatory on La Palma. In the experiment, a 35-cm telescope and a fast photon\ncounting receiver system are employed to resolve the return flux response\nduring laser frequency sweeps gaining insights into the population dynamics of\nthe sodium layer. At a launched laser power of 16.5 W, we find a maximum gain\nin return flux of 22\\% compared to a fixed-frequency laser.

This encourages us to explore more\ninformation in the target domain rather than to overly elaborate training\nstrategies on the source domain as in many existing methods. Hence, we start\nfrom a generic representation pre-trained by a cross-entropy loss and a\nconventional distance-based classifier, along with an image retrieval view, to\nemploy a re-ranking process for calibrating a target distance matrix by\ndiscovering the reciprocal k-nearest neighbours within the task.

The calibrated distance in this target-aware non-linear\nsubspace is complementary to that in the pre-trained representation.

Because it is all too common\nthat online networks reproduce historical structural bias, members of\ndisadvantaged groups often benefit less from such referral opportunities. For\ninstance, one-hop referral programs that distribute rewards only among pairs of\nfriends or followers may offer less rewards and opportunities to minorities in\nnetworks where it was proved that their degrees is statistically smaller. Here,\nwe examine the fairness of general referral programs, increasingly popular\nforms of marketing in which an existing referrer is encouraged to initiate the\nrecruitment of new referred users over multiple hops. While this clearly\nexpands opportunities for rewards, it remains unclear whether it helps\naddressing fairness concerns, or make them worse. We show, from studying 4\nreal-world networks and performing theoretical analysis on networks created\nwith minority-majority affiliations and homophily, that the change of bias in\nmulti-hop referral programs highly depends on the network structures and the\nreferral strategies. Specifically, under three different constrained referral\nstrategies which limit the number of referrals each person can share to a fixed\nnumber, we show that even with no explicit intention to discriminate and\nwithout access to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, certain\nreferral strategies can still amplify the structural biases further when higher\nhops are allowed. Moreover, when there is no constraint on the number of\nreferrals each person can distribute and when the effect of referral strategies\nis removed, we prove a precise condition under which the bias in 1-hop referral\nprograms is amplified in higher-hop referral programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 04:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

If\nthe human input is a force applied through physical contact with the robot, it\nalso alters the robot's behavior to maintain safety. We address the safety\nissue of shared autonomy in real-time applications by proposing a two-layer\ncontrol framework. In the first layer, we use the history of human input\nmeasurements to infer what the human wants the robot to do and define the\nrobot's safety constraints according to that inference.

Using the controllers in\nthese barrier pairs, the robot is able to maintain its safe operation under the\nintervention from the human input.

Here, by in situ tunneling spectroscopy, we show the\nsignatures of superstructure-modulated correlated electron states in epitaxial\nbilayer graphene (BLG) on 6H-SiC(0001). As the carrier density is locally\nquasi-'tuned' by the superlattice potentials of a 6x6 interface reconstruction\nphase, the spectral-weight transfer occurs between the two broad peaks flanking\nthe charge-neutral point. Such detected non-rigid band shift beyond the\nsingle-particle band description implies the existence of correlation effects,\nprobably attributed to the modified interlayer coupling in epitaxial BLG by the\n6x6 reconstruction as in magic-angle BLG by the Moire potentials. Quantitative\nanalysis suggests the intrinsic interface reconstruction shows a high carrier\ntunability of around 1/2 filling range, equivalent to the back gating by a\nvoltage of around 70 V in a typical gated BLG/SiO2/Si device. The finding in\ninterface-modulated epitaxial BLG with reconstruction phase extends the BLG\nplatform with electron correlations beyond the magic-angle situation, and may\nstimulate further investigations on correlated states in graphene systems and\nother van der Waals materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 05:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

However, existing literature did not formally discuss if a\nVAE-based model can properly encode interaction into its latent space.

To be specific, we first construct a graph, where each action unit\nis represented as a node and their relations between two action units as an\nedge. Here, we use two types of relations, one for capturing the temporal\nconnections between different action units, and the other one for\ncharacterizing their semantic relationship.

Recently, important real-world applications, such as medical diagnosis\nand cybersecurity, have generated renewed interest in the Neyman-Pearson (NP)\nclassification paradigm, which constrains the more severe type of error (e.g.,\nthe type I error) under a preferred level while minimizing the other (e.g., the\ntype II error). However, there has been little research on the NP paradigm\nunder label noise. It is somewhat surprising that even when common NP\nclassifiers ignore the label noise in the training stage, they are still able\nto control the type I error with high probability. However, the price they pay\nis excessive conservativeness of the type I error and hence a significant drop\nin power (i.e., $1 - $ type II error).

To address this issue, this\npaper presents a camera motion agnostic approach for predicting 3D human pose\nand mesh defined in the world coordinate system. The core idea of the proposed\napproach is to estimate the difference between two adjacent global poses (i.e.,\nglobal motion) that is invariant to selecting the coordinate system, instead of\nthe global pose coupled to the camera motion. To this end, we propose a network\nbased on bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) that predicts the global\nmotion sequence from the local pose sequence consisting of relative rotations\nof joints called global motion regressor (GMR).

This paper proposes energy\nmanagement strategies for a novel multi-battery design that directly connects\nits strings to other DC components through a busbar matrix without the need for\ninterfacing power converters. Hence, the energy management system has two\ndegrees of control: (i) allocating strings to other DC microgrid components, in\nthis case a photovoltaic system, two EV fast chargers, and a grid-tie inverter,\nand (ii) managing the energy exchange with the local distribution grid. For the\ngrid exchange, a basic droop control is compared to an enhanced control\nincluding forecasts in the decision making.

Late-type stars are not fast rotators\nbecause their initial angular momenta have been quickly dispersed due to\nmagnetic braking. However, the mass limit below which stars have been\nmagnetically braked has not been well constrained by observation. In this\npaper, we present an analysis of the eMSTO of NGC 6819, an open cluster of an\nintermediate-age (~2.5 Gyr), believed to be comparable to the lifetime of stars\nnear the mass limit for magnetic braking. By comparing the observation with\nsynthetic CMDs, we find that NGC 6819 does not harbor an obvious eMSTO. The\nmorphology of its TO region can be readily explained by a simple stellar\npopulation considering the observational uncertainties as well as the\ndifferential reddening. In addition, the MSTO stars in NGC 6819 have very small\nvalues of average rotational velocity and dispersion, indicating that they have\nundergone significant magnetic braking. Combining with results in the\nliterature for clusters of younger ages, our current work suggests that the\ncritical age for the disappearance of eMSTO in star clusters must be shorter\nbut very close to the age of NGC 6819, and this, in turn, implies a critical\nstellar mass for magnetic braking at solar metallicity above but close to 1.54\n$M_{\\odot}$ based on the PARSEC model.

While the secret key agreement problem\nconsiders the generation of a maximum-rate secret key through public\ndiscussion, the secure omniscience problem is concerned with communication\nprotocols for omniscience that minimize the rate of information leakage to the\nwiretapper. The starting point of our work is a lower bound on the minimum\nleakage rate for omniscience, $R_{\\mathop{\\mathrm{L}}}$, in terms of the\nwiretap secret key capacity, $C_{\\mathop{\\mathrm{W}}}$. Our interest is in\nidentifying broad classes of sources for which this lower bound is met with\nequality, in which case we say that there is a duality between secure\nomniscience and secret key agreement. We show that this duality holds in the\ncase of certain finite linear source (FLS) models, such as two-terminal FLS\nmodels and pairwise independent network models on trees with a linear\nwiretapper. Duality also holds for any FLS model in which\n$C_{\\mathop{\\mathrm{W}}}$ is achieved by a perfect linear secret key agreement\nscheme.

On the negative side, we give an example of a (non-FLS) source model\nfor which duality does not hold if we limit ourselves to\ncommunication-for-omniscience protocols with at most two (interactive)\ncommunications.

Therefore, troll\naccounts controlled by the same actor often show similarities that can be\nleveraged for detection.

In this paper, the nonlinear evolution of a\nsingle-toroidal-number chirping mode is analysed by numerical particle\nsimulation.

This can be done\nadopting a coordinate system that includes two constants of motion. In our\nsimulations, we adopt as constants of motion, the magnetic momentum and the\ninitial particle coordinates. For each resonant structure, a density-flattening\nregion is formed around the respective resonance radius, with radial width that\nincreases as the mode amplitude grows. It is delimited by two large negative\ndensity gradients, drifting inward and outward. With constant mode frequency,\nthis density flattening would be responsible for the exhausting of the drive\nwhen large negative density gradients leave the resonance region. The frequency\nchirping, however, causes the resonance radius and the resonance region to\ndrift inward. This drift delays the moment in which the inner density gradient\nreaches the inner boundary of the resonance region. On the other side, the\nisland reconstitutes around the new resonance radius; as a consequence, the\nlarge negative density gradient further moves inward. This process continues as\nlong as it allows to keep the large gradient within the resonance region. When\nthis is no longer possible, the resonant structure ceases to be effective in\ndriving the mode.

It\naims to localize objects described in the sentence to visual regions in the\nvideo, which is a fundamental capability needed in pattern analysis and machine\nlearning. Despite the recent progress, existing methods all suffer from the\nsevere problem of spurious association, which will harm the grounding\nperformance. In this paper, we start from the definition of WSVOG and pinpoint\nthe spurious association from two aspects: (1) the association itself is not\nobject-relevant but extremely ambiguous due to weak supervision, and (2) the\nassociation is unavoidably confounded by the observational bias when taking the\nstatistics-based matching strategy in existing methods. With this in mind, we\ndesign a unified causal framework to learn the deconfounded object-relevant\nassociation for more accurate and robust video object grounding. Specifically,\nwe learn the object-relevant association by causal intervention from the\nperspective of video data generation process. To overcome the problems of\nlacking fine-grained supervision in terms of intervention, we propose a novel\nspatial-temporal adversarial contrastive learning paradigm. To further remove\nthe accompanying confounding effect within the object-relevant association, we\npursue the true causality by conducting causal intervention via backdoor\nadjustment. Finally, the deconfounded object-relevant association is learned\nand optimized under a unified causal framework in an end-to-end manner.\nExtensive experiments on both IID and OOD testing sets of three benchmarks\ndemonstrate its accurate and robust grounding performance against\nstate-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 13:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

Energy transfer to the water\nmolecules is characterized by a rapid $\\sim 10$ ps and a considerably slower\n$\\sim 1$ ns component. Within 50 ps a mostly uniform temperature increase of\nthe ASW across the entire surface is found. The results suggest that energy\ntransfer between a molecule formed on and within ASW is efficient and helps to\nstabilize the products generated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 13:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

Besides, difficulties in collecting and labeling foggy images\nhinder the progress of this field. Considering the success in semantic scene\nunderstanding under clear weather, we think it is reasonable to transfer\nknowledge learned from clear images to the foggy domain. As such, the problem\nbecomes to bridge the domain gap between clear images and foggy images. Unlike\nprevious methods that mainly focus on closing the domain gap caused by fog --\ndefogging the foggy images or fogging the clear images, we propose to alleviate\nthe domain gap by considering fog influence and style variation simultaneously.\nThe motivation is based on our finding that the style-related gap and the\nfog-related gap can be divided and closed respectively, by adding an\nintermediate domain. Thus, we propose a new pipeline to cumulatively adapt\nstyle, fog and the dual-factor (style and fog). Specifically, we devise a\nunified framework to disentangle the style factor and the fog factor\nseparately, and then the dual-factor from images in different domains.\nFurthermore, we collaborate the disentanglement of three factors with a novel\ncumulative loss to thoroughly disentangle these three factors.

Unlike the PCP, whose nature of phase transition is\nclearly classified into the directed percolation (DP) universality class, the\nmodel of PCPD has been controversially discussed since its infancy. To our best\nknowledge, there is so far no consensus on whether the phase transition of the\nPCPD falls into the unknown university classes or else conveys a new kind of\nnon-equilibrium phase transition. In this paper, both unsupervised and\nsupervised learning are employed to study the PCPD with scrutiny. Firstly, two\nunsupervised learning methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and\nautoencoder, are taken. Our results show that both methods can cluster the\noriginal configurations of the model and provide reasonable estimates of\nthresholds. Therefore, no matter whether the non-equilibrium lattice model is a\nrandom process of unitary (for instance the DP) or binary (for instance the\nPCP), or whether it contains the diffusion motion of particles, unsupervised\nleaning can capture the essential, hidden information.

For control-affine systems, by choosing a\ncontinuous piecewise affine (CPA) controller structure, the non-convex\noptimization is formulated as iterative semi-definite programming (SDP), which\ncan be solved efficiently using available software. The method has very general\nassumptions on the system's dynamics and constraints.

To extend the commonly accepted yet simplifying and approximate\npicture of transport effects taking place in systems with spatially varying\nmagnetization, it is important to understand the transport properties of\nbuilding blocks for spin textures $-$ the homochiral spin-spiral states. In\nthis work, by referring to phenomenological symmetry arguments based on the\ngradient expansion, and explicit calculations within the Kubo framework, we\nstudy the transport properties of various types of spin-spirals in a\ntwo-dimensional model with strong spin-orbit interaction. In particular, we\nfocus on the contributions to the magnetoconductivity, the planar Hall effect\nand the anomalous Hall effect, which are sensitive to the sense of chirality of\nthe spiral states. We analyze the emergence, symmetry, and microscopic\nproperties of the resulting chiral magnetoconductivity, chiral planar Hall\neffect, and chiral Hall effect in terms of spin-spiral propagation direction,\ncone angle, spiral pitch, and disorder strength. Our findings suggest that the\npresence of spin-spiral states in magnets can be readily detected in various\ntypes of magnetotransport setups. Moreover, the sizable magnitude of chiral\ncontributions to the conductivity of skyrmions estimated from homochiral\nspirals implies that chiral, as opposed to topological, magnetotransport can\nplay a prominent role for the detection of non-trivial spin textures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 14:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

Inspired by typical axion models, these symmetries can be\nspontaneously broken, and the global ones might also be anomalous. In this\ncontext, particular emphasis is laid on the derivative couplings of the\nGoldstone bosons to the fermions, as these lead to severe divergences and\nambiguities when building the EFT. We show how to precisely solve these\ndifficulties within the path integral formalism, by adapting the anomalous Ward\nidentities to the EFT context. Our results are very generic, and when applied\nto axion models, they reproduce the non-intuitive couplings between the massive\nSM gauge fields and the axion. Altogether, this provides an efficient\nformalism, paving the way for a systematic and consistent methodology to build\nentire EFTs involving anomalous symmetries, as required for axion or ALP\nsearches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 15:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 20:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

A crucial point is the identification of scale limits of\nfunctions $v_{\\epsilon}$ in subsets of function spaces characterized by uniform\na priori estimates with respect to $\\epsilon$, arising for solutions of\ndifferential equations in heterogeneous media with thin layers, e.g., of a\nNavier-Stokes system, models in linear elasticity, or problems with\nfluid-structure interaction.

These findings are further utilized for both designs of\nflood zoning insurance and flooding catastrophic bond: (1) Using the\nextrapolation approach in Extreme Value Theory (EVT), the estimated\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR) are given to determine the\ncross-regional insurance premium together with the Grey Relational Analysis\n(GRA) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution\n(TOPSIS).

To reflect both the\nmarket price of catastrophe risk and the low-correlated financial interest\nrisk, we utilize the pricing mechanism of Tang and Yuan (2021) to analyze the\npricing sensitivity against the tail risk of the flooding disaster and the\ndistortion magnitude and the market risk through the distortion magnitude\ninvolved in Wang's transform.

Existing face anti-spoofing datasets lack\ndiversity due to the insufficient identity and insignificant variance, which\nlimits the generalization ability of FAS model. In this paper, we propose Dual\nSpoof Disentanglement Generation (DSDG) framework to tackle this challenge by\n\"anti-spoofing via generation\". Depending on the interpretable factorized\nlatent disentanglement in Variational Autoencoder (VAE), DSDG learns a joint\ndistribution of the identity representation and the spoofing pattern\nrepresentation in the latent space. Then, large-scale paired live and spoofing\nimages can be generated from random noise to boost the diversity of the\ntraining set. However, some generated face images are partially distorted due\nto the inherent defect of VAE. Such noisy samples are hard to predict precise\ndepth values, thus may obstruct the widely-used depth supervised optimization.\nTo tackle this issue, we further introduce a lightweight Depth Uncertainty\nModule (DUM), which alleviates the adverse effects of noisy samples by depth\nuncertainty learning. DUM is developed without extra-dependency, thus can be\nflexibly integrated with any depth supervised network for face anti-spoofing.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on five popular benchmarks\nand achieve state-of-the-art results under both intra- and inter- test\nsettings.

Recently a new paradigm has emerged by generating a\nforeground prediction map (FPM) to achieve localization task. Existing\nFPM-based methods use cross-entropy (CE) to evaluate the foreground prediction\nmap and to guide the learning of generator. We argue for using activation value\nto achieve more efficient learning. It is based on the experimental observation\nthat, for a trained network, CE converges to zero when the foreground mask\ncovers only part of the object region. While activation value increases until\nthe mask expands to the object boundary, which indicates that more object areas\ncan be learned by using activation value. In this paper, we propose a\nBackground Activation Suppression (BAS) method.

As a result, forward modeling errors are inevitable. In\npractice, such model errors tend to be either completely ignored, which leads\nto biased and over-confident inversion results, or only partly taken into\naccount using restrictive Gaussian assumptions. Here, we rely on deep\ngenerative neural networks to learn problem-specific low-dimensional\nprobabilistic representations of the discrepancy between high-fidelity and\nlow-fidelity forward solvers. These representations are then used to\nprobabilistically invert for the model error jointly with the target\ngeophysical property field, using the computationally-cheap, low-fidelity\nforward solver. To this end, we combine a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)\ninversion algorithm with a trained convolutional neural network of the spatial\ngenerative adversarial network (SGAN) type, whereby at each MCMC step, the\nsimulated low-fidelity forward response is corrected using a proposed\nmodel-error realization.

The definition of an outlier event, however, is subjective and\ndepends on the application and the domain (Energy, Health, Wireless Network,\netc.). It is important to detect outlier events as carefully as possible to\navoid infrastructure failures because anomalous events can cause minor to\nsevere damage to infrastructure. For instance, an attack on a cyber-physical\nsystem such as a microgrid may initiate voltage or frequency instability,\nthereby damaging a smart inverter which involves very expensive repairing.\nUnusual activities in microgrids can be mechanical faults, behavior changes in\nthe system, human or instrument errors or a malicious attack.

For that, the fundamental concepts of each OD model are introduced\nvia multiple categories.

Given the fact\nthat low radiation dose may result in increased noise and artifacts, which\ngreatly affected the clinical diagnosis. To obtain high-quality Total-body\nLow-dose CT (LDCT) images, previous deep-learning-based research work has\nintroduced various network architectures. However, most of these methods only\nadopt Normal-dose CT (NDCT) images as ground truths to guide the training of\nthe denoising network. Such simple restriction leads the model to less\neffectiveness and makes the reconstructed images suffer from over-smoothing\neffects. In this paper, we propose a novel intra-task knowledge transfer method\nthat leverages the distilled knowledge from NDCT images to assist the training\nprocess on LDCT images. The derived architecture is referred to as the\nTeacher-Student Consistency Network (TSC-Net), which consists of the teacher\nnetwork and the student network with identical architecture. Through the\nsupervision between intermediate features, the student network is encouraged to\nimitate the teacher network and gain abundant texture details. Moreover, to\nfurther exploit the information contained in CT scans, a contrastive\nregularization mechanism (CRM) built upon contrastive learning is\nintroduced.CRM performs to pull the restored CT images closer to the NDCT\nsamples and push far away from the LDCT samples in the latent space. In\naddition, based on the attention and deformable convolution mechanism, we\ndesign a Dynamic Enhancement Module (DEM) to improve the network transformation\ncapability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 06:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 02:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

We found that the\nimage reconstruction process of GI is very similar to the Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RNN), which is one of the deep learning algorithm. In this paper, we\nproposed a novel method that effectively implements GI on the RNN architecture,\ncalled GI-RNN.

Typically these algorithms are trained for a\nspecific task, e.g., the classification of lesions or the prediction of a\nmammogram's pathology status. To obtain a comprehensive view of a patient,\nmodels which were all trained for the same task(s) are subsequently ensembled\nor combined. In this work, we propose a pipeline approach, where we first train\na set of individual, task-specific models and subsequently investigate the\nfusion thereof, which is in contrast to the standard model ensembling strategy.\nWe fuse model predictions and high-level features from deep learning models\nwith hybrid patient models to build stronger predictors on patient level. To\nthis end, we propose a multi-branch deep learning model which efficiently fuses\nfeatures across different tasks and mammograms to obtain a comprehensive\npatient-level prediction. We train and evaluate our full pipeline on public\nmammography data, i.e., DDSM and its curated version CBIS-DDSM, and report an\nAUC score of 0.962 for predicting the presence of any lesion and 0.791 for\npredicting the presence of malignant lesions on patient level. Overall, our\nfusion approaches improve AUC scores significantly by up to 0.04 compared to\nstandard model ensembling. Moreover, by providing not only global patient-level\npredictions but also task-specific model results that are related to\nradiological features, our pipeline aims to closely support the reading\nworkflow of radiologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 13:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

The conventional search method can hardly\nsatisfy the real-time demand during high dynamics air combat scenarios. The\nreinforcement learning (RL) method can significantly shorten the decision time\nvia using neural networks. However, the sparse reward problem limits its\nconvergence speed and the artificial prior experience reward can easily deviate\nits optimal convergent direction of the original task, which raises great\ndifficulties for the RL air combat application. In this paper, we propose a\nhomotopy-based soft actor-critic method (HSAC) which focuses on addressing\nthese problems via following the homotopy path between the original task with\nsparse reward and the auxiliary task with artificial prior experience reward.\nThe convergence and the feasibility of this method are also proved in this\npaper. To confirm our method feasibly, we construct a detailed 3D air combat\nsimulation environment for the RL-based methods training firstly, and we\nimplement our method in both the attack horizontal flight UCAV task and the\nself-play confrontation task. Experimental results show that our method\nperforms better than the methods only utilizing the sparse reward or the\nartificial prior experience reward.

The data used in this study were obtained for traffic\ncrashes on all interstates across the state of Texas from a period of six years\nbetween 2014 and 2019. The output of the proposed severity classification\napproach includes three classes for fatal and severe injury (KA) crashes,\nnon-severe and possible injury (BC) crashes, and property damage only (PDO)\ncrashes. While Granger Causality helped identify the most influential factors\naffecting crash severity, the learning-based models predicted the severity\nclasses with varying performance. The results of Granger causality analysis\nidentified the speed limit, surface and weather conditions, traffic volume,\npresence of workzones, workers in workzones, and high occupancy vehicle (HOV)\nlanes, among others, as the most important factors affecting crash severity.\nThe prediction performance of the classifiers yielded varying results across\nthe different classes. Specifically, while decision tree and random forest\nclassifiers provided the greatest performance for PDO and BC severities,\nrespectively, for the KA class, the rarest class in the data, deep neural net\nclassifier performed superior than all other algorithms, most likely due to its\ncapability of approximating nonlinear models. This study contributes to the\nlimited body of knowledge pertaining to causal analysis and classification\nprediction of traffic crash injury severity using non-parametric approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 20:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Stock price contains complex, incomplete, and fuzzy\ninformation which makes it an extremely difficult task to predict its\ndevelopment trend. Predicting and analysing financial data is a nonlinear,\ntime-dependent problem. With rapid development in machine learning and deep\nlearning, this task can be performed more effectively by a purposely designed\nnetwork. This paper aims to improve prediction accuracy and minimizing\nforecasting error loss through deep learning architecture by using Generative\nAdversarial Networks. It was proposed a generic model consisting of Phase-space\nReconstruction (PSR) method for reconstructing price series and Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) which is a combination of two neural networks which\nare Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as Generative model and Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) as Discriminative model for adversarial training to forecast the\nstock market. LSTM will generate new instances based on historical basic\nindicators information and then CNN will estimate whether the data is predicted\nby LSTM or is real. It was found that the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\nhas performed well on the enhanced root mean square error to LSTM, as it was\n4.35% more accurate in predicting the direction and reduced processing time and\nRMSE by 78 secs and 0.029, respectively.

In this study, we investigate how the pandemic has\ninfluenced people's emotions and psychological states compared to a\npre-pandemic period using real-world data from social media.\n  Method: We collected Reddit social media data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and\n2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight\nuniversities. We applied the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training\napproach (RoBERTa) to learn text embedding from the Reddit messages, and\nleveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph\nattention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. Finally, we applied model\nstacking to combine the prediction probabilities from RoBERTa and GAT to yield\nthe final classification on sentiment.

Today, individual\nmicroservices are autoscaled independently by adding VMs whenever\nper-microservice CPU or memory utilization crosses a configurable threshold.\nHowever, an application user's end-to-end latency consists of time spent on\nmultiple microservices and each microservice might need a different number of\nVMs to achieve an overall end-to-end latency.\n  We present COLA, an autoscaler for microservice-based applications, which\ncollectively allocates VMs to microservices with a global goal of minimizing\ndollar cost while keeping end-to-end application latency under a given target.\nUsing 5 open-source applications, we compared COLA to several utilization and\nmachine learning based autoscalers. We evaluate COLA across different compute\nsettings on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in which users manage compute\nresources, GKE standard, and a new mode of operation in which the cloud\nprovider manages compute infrastructure, GKE Autopilot. COLA meets a desired\nmedian or tail latency target on 53 of 63 workloads where it provides a cost\nreduction of 19.3%, on average, over the next cheapest autoscaler. COLA is the\nmost cost effective autoscaling policy for 48 of these 53 workloads. The cost\nsavings from managing a cluster with COLA result in COLA paying for its\ntraining cost in a few days. On smaller applications, for which we can\nexhaustively search microservice configurations, we find that COLA is optimal\nfor 90% of cases and near optimal otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 08:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 10:06:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 23:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}
