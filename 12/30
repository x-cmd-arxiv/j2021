The package accommodates summary level data or subject level data\nwith covariate information. It supports use of multiple historical datasets as\nwell as design without historical data. Supported distributions for responses\ninclude normal, binary (Bernoulli/binomial), Poisson and exponential. The power\nparameter $a_0$ can be fixed or modeled as random using a normalized power\nprior for each of these distributions. In addition, the package supports the\nuse of arbitrary sampling priors for computing Bayesian power and type I error\nrates, and has specific features for GLMs that semi-automatically generate\nsampling priors from historical data. Since sample size determination (SSD) for\nGLMs is computationally intensive, an approximation method based on asymptotic\ntheory has been implemented to support applications using the power prior. In\naddition to describing the statistical methodology and functions implemented in\nthe package to enable SSD, we also demonstrate the use of BayesPPD in two\ncomprehensive case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 16:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

Maps of the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse, in principle, have the raw statistical power to reach these targets,\nbut the complications of nonlinear evolution are thought to present serious, if\nnot insurmountable, obstacles to reaching these goals. In this paper, we will\nargue that the challenge presented by nonlinear structure formation has been\noverstated. The information encoded in primordial non-Gaussianity resides in\nnonlocal correlations of the density field at three or more points separated by\ncosmological distances. In contrast, nonlinear evolution only alters the\ndensity field locally and cannot create or destroy these long-range\ncorrelations. This locality property of the late-time non-Gaussianity is\nobscured in Fourier space and in the standard bispectrum searches for\nprimordial non-Gaussianity. We therefore propose to measure non-Gaussianity in\nthe position space maps of the large-scale structure. As a proof of concept, we\nstudy the case of equilateral non-Gaussianity, for which the degeneracy with\nlate-time nonlinearities is the most severe. We show that a map-level analysis\nis capable of breaking this degeneracy and thereby significantly improve the\nconstraining power over previous estimates. Our findings suggest that\n\"simulation-based inference\" involving the forward modeling of large-scale\nstructure maps has the potential to dramatically impact the search for\nprimordial non-Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 16:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Here we consider a global mobility\nnetwork of population flows between cities as a proxy for the communication\nbetween these regions, and analyze how these flows impact socioeconomic\nindicators that measure economic success. We use several measures of centrality\nto rank cities according to their importance in the mobility network, finding\nPageRank to be the most effective measure for reflecting these prosperity\nindicators. Our analysis reveals that the characterization of the welfare of\ncities based on mobility information hinges on their corresponding development\nstage. Namely, while network-based predictions of welfare correlate well with\neconomic indicators in mature cities, for developing urban areas additional\ninformation about the prosperity of their mobility neighborhood is needed. For\nthese developing cities, those that are connected to sets of mature cities show\nmarkedly better socio-economic indicators than those connected to less mature\ncities. We develop a simple generative model for the allocation of population\nflows out of a city that balances the costs and benefits of interaction with\nother cities that are successful, finding that it provides a strong fit to the\nflows observed in the global mobility network and highlights the differences in\nflow patterns between developed and developing urban regions.

In particular, it appears that a $T \\overline{T}$-deformed theory\nis a kind of new structure, which is neither a local quantum field theory nor a\nfull-fledged string theory, but which is nonetheless under some analytic\ncontrol. On the other hand, supersymmetry is a beautiful extension of\nPoincar\\'e symmetry which relates bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.

The nanoscale\nhydrodynamics of clay at elevated temperature is essential in developing a\nphysics-based multiscale model for clay under non-isothermal conditions. The\nnonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) is a useful tool to study the\nnanoscale hydrodyndamics of clay. This article presents an NEMD modeling of\nhydrodynamics of clay nanopores at elevated temperatures. Water flow confined\nin pyrophyllite and montmorillonite clay nanopores is investigated. The\nnonequilibrium state is maintained by uniformly exerting an external force on\neach water molecule. The NEMD simulations have provided a molecular-scale\nperspective of temperature effect on clay-water density, water flow velocity,\nshear viscosity, clay-water slip length, hydraulic conductivity, and clay-water\nfriction coefficient. The numerical results have shown a strong temperature\ndependence of fluid flow velocity, shear viscosity, clay-water slip length, and\nhydraulic conductivity at the nanoscale. We have validated the applicability of\ncubic law in determining hydraulic conductivity at the nanopore scale under at\nelevated temperature. It is found from our numerical results that slip\nclay-water boundary condition is an essential factor in properly determining\nnanoscale fluid flow velocity.

One seminal notion of\nclassicality of a quantum system is the existence of a non-contextual hidden\nvariable model as introduced in the early work by Bell, Kochen and Specker. In\nquantum optics, the non-negativity of the Wigner function is a ubiquitous\nnotion of classicality. In this work we establish an equivalence between these\ntwo concepts. In particular, we show that any non-contextual hidden variable\nmodel for Gaussian quantum optics has an alternative non-negative Wigner\nfunction description.

In\nparticular, both contextuality and Wigner negativity are necessary for a\ncomputational speed-up of quantum Gaussian optics.

Inspired by a more recent\nobservation that it is the data-specificity that makes the multi-head\nself-attention (MHSA) in the Transformer model so powerful, this paper proposes\nto extend the widely adopted light-weight Squeeze-Excitation (SE) module to be\nspatially-adaptive to reinforce its data specificity, as a convolutional\nalternative of the MHSA, while retaining the efficiency of SE and the inductive\nbasis of convolution. It presents two designs of spatially-adaptive\nsqueeze-excitation (SASE) modules for image synthesis and image recognition\nrespectively. For image synthesis tasks, the proposed SASE is tested in both\nlow-shot and one-shot learning tasks. It shows better performance than prior\narts. For image recognition tasks, the proposed SASE is used as a drop-in\nreplacement for convolution layers in ResNets and achieves much better accuracy\nthan the vanilla ResNets, and slightly better than the MHSA counterparts such\nas the Swin-Transformer and Pyramid-Transformer in the ImageNet-1000 dataset,\nwith significantly smaller models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 19:38:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 04:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 14:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time\nseries is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most\ncommon solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus\nremoving its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the\ntime at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the\ndynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by\ndeveloping a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on\nextracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is\ncollected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a\ntime series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or\ncomplements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In\nthe end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature\nengineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored.

Existing approaches for community detection\neither partition the graph in disjoint, non-overlapping, communities, or return\noverlapping communities.

It leverages recent\ndevelopments in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning. So\nfar, GNN methods for community detection provide competitive results in either\noverlapping or non-overlapping community detection tasks, but have had little\nsuccess in both. UCoDe overcomes these issues by introducing a new loss that\ncaptures node similarity on a macro-scale. We provide theoretical justification\nfor our approach's validity in the task of community detection and show that it\ncan be applied in both the overlapping and non-overlapping settings. As our\nexperiments demonstrate on several real benchmark graphs, UCoDe consistently\nprovides high quality results in both overlapping and non-overlapping settings\nin an easy to apply fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 20:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

For systems with orbital period $P>0.3 d$ the\neffect of intrinsic variability averaged over long time cancels each other out\nwith the Kepler Mission-like phase smearing. Further, we analyse 47 totally\neclipsing Kepler Mission contact binaries. We found a sharp cutoff of the\nintrinsic variability at P = 0.45 d. With the light curve numerical modeling\nand observational relations we derive physical parameters of the 47 systems. At\nleast 53% of binaries have a possible third companion. 21 binaries show the\nO`Connell effect in the averaged phase curve. 19 of them have a primary maximum\nlower than the secondary, suggesting a stationary dark region on the trailing\nside.

For polycrystalline Pt, nanoscale resolution photoemission\nthreshold mapping reveals a spatially varying $\\phi= 5.70\\pm 0.03$~eV over a\ndistribution of (111) textured vicinal grain surfaces prepared by sputter\ndeposition and annealing. With regard to field emission and related phenomena,\ne.g. vacuum arc initiation, a salient feature of the $\\phi$ distribution is\nthat it is skewed with a long tail to values down to 5.4 eV, i.e. far below the\nmean, which is exponentially impactful to field emission via the\nFowler-Nordheim relation. We show that the $\\phi$ spatial variation and\ndistribution can be explained by ensemble variations of granular tilts and\nsurface slopes via a Smoluchowski smoothing model wherein local $\\phi$\nvariations result from spatially varying densities of electric dipole moments,\nintrinsic to atomic steps, that locally modify $\\phi$. Atomic step-terrace\nstructure is confirmed with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at several\nlocations on our surfaces, and prior works showed STM evidence for atomic step\ndipoles at various metal surfaces. From our model, we find an atomic step edge\ndipole $\\mu=0.12$ D/edge atom, which is comparable to values reported in\nstudies that utilized other methods and materials. Our results elucidate a\nconnection between macroscopic $\\phi$ and nanostructure that may contribute to\nthe spread of reported $\\phi$ for Pt and other surfaces, and may be useful\ntoward more complete descriptions of polycrystalline metals in models of field\nemission and other related vacuum electronics phenomena, e.g. arc initiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 22:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Water input,\nduring rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water.\nThe redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the\nimpact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed.\nThese two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the\nfast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic\nreaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with\nsoil water and biomass. This pulsed precipitation model predicts that the\npreferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic\ndistance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into\nthe soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast\necohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation\npattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain\ninputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland\npattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical\nlow annual mean.

Using multi-pulse quantum\nsensing protocols with NV spin ensembles to improve sensitivity, we project new\nconstraints that are ~5 orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous\nconstraints at the micrometer scale. We also identify a spin-polarized test\nmass, based on hyperpolarized 13C nuclear spins in a thin diamond membrane,\nwhich offers a favorable combination of high spin density and low stray\nmagnetic fields. Our analysis is timely in light of a recent preprint\n(arXiv:2010.15667) reporting a surprising non-zero result of micrometer-scale\nspin-velocity interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 01:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

However,\nquantifying its value is difficult. Various types of exoskeleton robots have\nalready been developed and tested for upper limb rehabilitation but,\nevaluations are not standardized, particularly in pediatric rehabilitation.\nThis paper proposes a methodology for the quantitative evaluation of upper limb\nexoskeletons that, like a test bench, would serve for replicable testing. We\ndetermined the range of motion (ROM) and joint torques using both kinematic\nmodeling and experimental measurements (using sensors integrated into Dynamixel\nactuators). The proposed test bench can provide an accurate range of motion\n(ROM) and joint torques during the pronation-supination (PS) task. The range of\nmotion obtained with the physical prototype was approximately 156.26 +-\n4.71{\\deg} during the PS task, while it was approximately 146.84 +- 14.32{\\deg}\nfor the multibody model. The results show that the average range of\nexperimental torques (0.28 +- 0.06 N.m) was overestimated by 40% and just 3.4%,\nrespectively, when compared to the average range of simulated torques (0.2 +-\n0.05 N.m) and to the highest range of simulated torques (0.29 N.m). For the\nexperimental measurements, test-retest reliability was excellent (0.96-0.98)\nwithin sessions and excellent (0.93) or good (0.81-0.86) between sessions.\nFinally, the suggested approach provides a ROM close to the normal ROM\nnecessary during PS tasks. These results validate the measurements' accuracy\nand underline the proposed methodology's relevance. The proposed test bench\ncould become a reference standard for evaluating exoskeletons. This study also\naddresses a methodological aspect on the accurate assessment of joint torques\nthat can serve in applications such as the sizing of actuators in exoskeletons\nor the non-invasive evaluation of muscle forces in the human body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 01:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

These applications can often be cast\ninto standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn\nlow-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are\ncurrently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However,\nstandard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited\ndiscriminative power in distinguishing \\emph{high-order} graph structures as\nopposed to \\emph{low-order} structures. To capture high-order structures,\nresearchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However,\nexisting motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on\nhigh-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Motif\nGraph Neural Network (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order\nstructures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and\ninjective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations\nw.r.t. each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among\nmotifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features\nunique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node\nrepresentations by combining multiple representations from different motifs.

Spheroidal\ngalaxies have hotter CGMs than disc galaxies related to spheroids residing at\nhigher halos masses, which may be measurable through hardness ratios spanning\nthe $0.2-1.5$ keV band. While spheroids appear to have brighter CGMs than discs\nfor the selected fixed $M_\\star$ bin, this owes to spheroids having higher\nstellar and halo masses within that $M_\\star$ bin, and obscures the fact that\nboth simulated populations have similar total CGM luminosities at the exact\nsame $M_\\star$. Discs have brighter emission inside 20 kpc and more steeply\ndeclining profiles with radius than spheroids. We predict that the {\\it\neROSITA} 4-year all-sky survey should detect many of the signatures we predict\nhere, although targeted follow-up observations of highly inclined nearby discs\nafter the survey may be necessary to observe some of our azimuthally-dependent\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 04:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

This method is tailored\nto handle large datasets, including missing observations. Our approach relies\non a four-stage high-dimensional bivariate sparse spatial model for\nzero-inflated data, which is developed using stochastic partial differential\nequations(SPDE). In Stage 1, the observations are categorized in zero/nonzero\ncategories and are modeled using a two-layered hierarchical Bayesian sparse\nspatial model to estimate the probabilities of these two categories. In Stage\n2, before modeling the positive observations using spatially-varying\ncoefficients, smoothed parameter surfaces are obtained from empirical estimates\nusing fixed rank kriging. This approximate Bayesian method inference was\nemployed to avoid the high computational burden of large spatial data modeling\nusing spatially-varying coefficients. In Stage 3, the standardized\nlog-transformed positive observations from the second stage are further modeled\nusing a sparse bivariate spatial Gaussian process. The Gaussian distribution\nassumption for wildfire counts developed in the third stage is computationally\neffective but erroneous. Thus in Stage 4, the predicted values are rectified\nusing Random Forests. The posterior inference is drawn for Stages 1 and 3 using\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A cross-validation scheme is then\ncreated for the artificially generated gaps, and the EVA 2021 prediction scores\nof the proposed model are compared to those obtained using certain natural\ncompetitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 04:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The second problem\nasks for the characterization of all pairs $(f,a)$ such that $\\hat{H}_f(a)$ is\nalgebraic. In this paper, we solve the second problem and obtain significant\nprogress to the first problem in the case of polynomial dynamics. These are\nconsequences of our main result concerning the possible algebraic numbers that\ncan be expressed as a multiplicative combination of values of B\\\"ottcher\ncoordinates. The proof of our main result uses a construction of a certain\nauxiliary polynomial and the powerful Medvedev-Scanlon classification of\npreperiodic subvarieties of split polynomial maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 06:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

In AIA\nobservations, QFP wave trains are seen to consist of multiple coherent and\nconcentric wavefronts emanating successively near the epicenter of the\naccompanying flares; they propagate outwardly either along or across coronal\nloops at fast-mode magnetosonic speeds from several hundred to more than 2000\nkm/s, and their periods are in the range of tens of seconds to several minutes.\nBased on the distinct different properties of QFP wave trains, they might be\ndivided into two distinct categories including narrow and broad ones. For most\nQFP wave trains, some of their periods are similar to those of quasi-periodic\npulsations (QPPs) in the accompanying flares, indicating that they are probably\ndifferent manifestations of the same physical process. Currently, candidate\ngeneration mechanisms for QFP wave trains include two main categories: pulsed\nenergy excitation mechanism in association with magnetic reconnection and\ndispersion evolution mechanism related to the dispersive evolution of\nimpulsively generated broadband perturbations. In addition, the generation of\nsome QFP wave trains might be driven by the leakage of three and five minute\noscillations from the lower atmosphere. As one of the new discoveries of SDO,\nQFP wave trains provide a new tool for coronal seismology to probe the corona\nparameters, and they are also useful for diagnosing the generation of QPPs,\nflare processes including energy release and particle accelerations.

Here, we show that in all the variety of conditions occurring in\nnature only two distinct types of degassing exist. First, when a thin film of\ncalcareous solution comes in contact to cave air lower pCO2 value than that of\nthe aqueous CO2 in the water, molecular CO2 escapes by physical diffusion in\nseveral seconds. In a next step lasting several ten seconds, pH and DIC in the\nsolution achieve chemical equilibrium with respect to the CO2 in the cave\natmosphere. This solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcite.\nDuring precipitation for each unit CaCO3 deposited one molecule of CO2 is\ngenerated and escapes from the solution. This precipitation driven degassing is\nactive during precipitation only. We show that all variations of out gassing\nproposed in the literature are either diffusive outgassing or precipitation\ndriven degassing and that diffusive outgassing has no influence on the isotope\ncomposition of the HCO3 - pool and consequently on that of calcite. Its isotope\nimprint is determined solely by precipitation driven degassing in contrast to\nmost explanations in the literature. We present a theoretical model of d13C and\nd18O that explains the contributions of various parameters such as changes in\ntemperature, changes of pCO2 in the cave atmosphere, and changes in the drip\nintervals to the isotope composition of calcite precipitated to the apex of the\nstalagmite. We use this model to calculate quantitatively changes of d13C and\nd18O observed in field experiments (Carlson et al., 2020) in agreement to their\nexperimental data.

A quadrilateral mesh is assumed for their classical\ndefinition, and different types of grids are identified depending on the\nlocation of the discretized quantities.

In this work, we\npresent an unstructured CD-grid type formulation of the elastic-viscous-plastic\nrheology, where the velocity unknowns are located at the edges, rather than at\nthe vertices, as in the B-grid.

In addition to empirically validating our theoretical\nresults, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set\nconstruction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to\nbuild a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible\ndownstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of\nindependent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream\ntasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination\nof the features. Finally, we demonstrate how this policy set can be useful in a\nlifelong reinforcement learning setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 12:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 22:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 18:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Specifically, we consider\ntwo-time correlations for the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) Hamiltonian close to the\nso-called Kitaev critical point. Here, the model coincides with a phase\nboundary of two uncoupled instances of Kitaev's model for p-wave\nsuperconductors, together supporting a degenerate ground state characterized by\nmultiple Majorana modes. In this regime, the real-time dynamics of local spins\nreveal a set of strong zero modes, corresponding to a set of protruding\nfrequencies in the two-time correlation function. We derive perturbative\ninteractions that map the KH spin chain onto the topological regime of Kitaev's\nfermionic model, thus opening up a bulk gap whilst retaining almost degenerate\nmodes in the mesoscopic regime, i.e., for finite system sizes. This showcases\nthe emergence of Majorana modes in a chain of effective dimers. Here, the\nbinding energy within each unit cell competes with the inter-dimer coupling to\ngenerate a finite size energy gap, in analogy with local energy terms in the\ntransverse-field Ising model. These modes give rise to long coherence times of\nlocal spins located at the system edges. By breaking the local symmetry in each\ndimer, one can also observe a second class of Majorana modes in terms of a\nbeating frequency in the two-time correlations function of the edge spin.\nFurthermore, we develop a scenario for realizing these model predictions in\nion-trap quantum simulators with collective addressing of the ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 12:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Our study indicates that while jet quenching at\nhigh $p_\\mathrm{T}$ is dominated by perturbative QCD interactions,\nnon-perturbative interactions are indispensible for understanding heavy flavor\nquenching and flow at low and intermediate $p_\\mathrm{T}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 13:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

This requires\nreliable wireless communications to adjust the speeds of vehicles. Although\nthere is a dedicated frequency band for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunications, studies have shown that it is too congested to provide reliable\ntransmission for the platoons. Additional spectrum resources, i.e., secondary\nspectrum channels, can be utilized when these are not occupied by other users.\nCharacteristics of interference in these channels are usually\nlocation-dependent and can be stored in the so-called Radio Environment Maps\n(REMs). This paper aims to design REM, in order to support the selection of\nsecondary spectrum channel for intra-platoon communications. We propose to\nassess the channel's quality in terms of outage probability computed, with the\nuse of estimated interference distributions stored in REM. A frequency\nselection algorithm that minimizes the number of channel switches along the\nplanned platoon route is proposed. Additionally, the REM creation procedure is\nshown that reduces the number of database entries using (Density-Based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise) DBSCAN algorithm. The proposals are\ntested using real IQ samples captured on a real road. Application of the DBSCAN\nclustering to the constructed REM provided 7% reduction in its size.\nUtilization of the proposed channel selection algorithm resulted in a 35 times\nreduction of channel switches concerning channel assignment performed\nindependently in every location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

The throughput and the\ncapacity of storage subsystems have not evolved as fast as the computing power\nin extreme-scale supercomputers. As a result, the classical post-hoc analysis\nof simulation outputs became highly inefficient. In-situ workflows have then\nemerged as a solution in which simulation and data analytics are intertwined\nthrough shared computing resources, thus lower latencies. Determining the best\nallocation, i.e., how many resources to allocate to each component of an\nin-situ workflow; and mapping, i.e., where and at which frequency to run the\ndata analytics component, is a complex task whose performance assessment is\ncrucial to the efficient execution of in-situ workflows. However, such a\nperformance evaluation of different allocation and mapping strategies usually\nrelies either on directly running them on the targeted execution environments,\nwhich can rapidly become extremely time-and resource-consuming, or on resorting\nto the simulation of simplified models of the components of an in-situ\nworkflow, which can lack of realism. In both cases, the validity of the\nperformance evaluation is limited. To address this issue, we introduce\nSIM-SITU, a framework for the faithful simulation of in-situ workflows. This\nframework builds on the SimGrid toolkit and benefits of several important\nfeatures of this versatile simulation tool. We designed SIM-SITU to reflect the\ntypical structure of in-situ workflows and thanks to its modular design,\nSIM-SITU has the necessary flexibility to easily and faithfully evaluate the\nbehavior and performance of various allocation and mapping strategies for\nin-situ workflows. We illustrate the simulation capabilities of SIM-SITU on a\nMolecular Dynamics use case. We study the impact of different allocation and\nmapping strategies on performance and show how users can leverage SIM-SITU to\ndetermine interesting tradeoffs when designing their in-situ workflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

This problem is of great importance to many application\nfields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving.\nFirst, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB\nimage. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and\npredict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel\nof the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a\ndata-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of\nsymmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based\nfitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on\nseveral standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that\nslides a window over the input image and searches for a match against\ntemplates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different\norientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window\nlocation, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we\npropose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D\nobject models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield\nsubstantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered\non top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset\nfor 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of\nindustry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the\nstatus quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an\nevaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held\nat international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

While quantum\nchips are evolving rapidly, classical sampling algorithms are also getting\nbetter and better. The major challenge is to generate bitstrings exhibiting an\nXEB fidelity above that of the quantum chips. Here we present a classical\nsampling algorithm for producing the probability distribution of any given\nrandom quantum circuit, where the fidelity can be rigorously bounded.\nSpecifically, our algorithm performs rejection sampling after the introduced\nvery recently multi-tensor contraction algorithm. We show that the fidelity can\nbe controlled by partially contracting the dominant paths in the tensor network\nand by adjusting the number of batches used in the rejection sampling. As a\ndemonstration, we classically produced 1 million samples with the fidelity\nbounded by 0.2%, based on the 20-cycle circuit of the Sycamore 53-qubit quantum\nchip. Though this task was initially estimated to take 10,000 years on the\nSummit supercomputer, it took about 14.5 days using our algorithm on a\nrelatively small cluster with 32 GPUs (Tesla V100 16GB).

We consider an\noptically levitated nano-particle in a bichromatic cavity, in which two cavity\nmodes could be excited by the scattering photons of the dual-tweezers\nrespectively.

In addition, the original Transformer\nconsumes more resources by carrying the entire attention matrix during the\ntraining course. To overcome these challenges, ChunkFormer splits the long\nsequences into smaller sequence chunks for the attention calculation,\nprogressively applying different chunk sizes in each stage. In this way, the\nproposed model gradually learns both local and global information without\nchanging the total length of the input sequences.

These cytoplasmic motors\nare dimers made up of two linked identical monomeric globular proteins. Fueled\nby the free energy generated by ATP hydrolysis, the motors walk on polar tracks\n(microtubule or filamentous actin) processively, which means that only one head\ndetaches and executes a mechanical step while the other stays bound to the\ntrack. Thus, the one motor head must regulate chemical state of the other,\nreferred to as \"gating\", a concept that is not fully understood. Inspired by\nexperiments, showing that only a fraction of the energy from ATP hydrolysis is\nused to advance the kinesin motors against load, we demonstrate that additional\nenergy is used for coordinating the chemical cycles of the two heads in the\ndimer - a feature that characterizes gating. To this end, we develop a general\nframework based on information theory and stochastic thermodynamics, and\nestablish that gating could be quantified in terms of information flow between\nthe motor heads. Applications of the theory to kinesin-1 and Myosin V show that\ninformation flow occurs, with positive cooperativity, at external resistive\nloads that are less than a critical value, $F_c$. When force exceeds $F_c$,\neffective information flow ceases. Interestingly, $F_c$, which is independent\nof the input energy generated through ATP hydrolysis, coincides with force at\nwhich the probability of backward steps starts to increase.

They mostly follow the paradigm of learning to attend,\nwhich maximizes the mutual information between the attended graph and the\nground-truth label. However, this paradigm makes GNN classifiers recklessly\nabsorb all the statistical correlations between input features and labels in\nthe training data, without distinguishing the causal and noncausal effects of\nfeatures. Instead of underscoring the causal features, the attended graphs are\nprone to visit the noncausal features as the shortcut to predictions. Such\nshortcut features might easily change outside the training distribution,\nthereby making the GNN classifiers suffer from poor generalization. In this\nwork, we take a causal look at the GNN modeling for graph classification. With\nour causal assumption, the shortcut feature serves as a confounder between the\ncausal feature and prediction. It tricks the classifier to learn spurious\ncorrelations that facilitate the prediction in in-distribution (ID) test\nevaluation, while causing the performance drop in out-of-distribution (OOD)\ntest data. To endow the classifier with better interpretation and\ngeneralization, we propose the Causal Attention Learning (CAL) strategy, which\ndiscovers the causal patterns and mitigates the confounding effect of\nshortcuts. Specifically, we employ attention modules to estimate the causal and\nshortcut features of the input graph. We then parameterize the backdoor\nadjustment of causal theory -- combine each causal feature with various\nshortcut features. It encourages the stable relationships between the causal\nestimation and prediction, regardless of the changes in shortcut parts and\ndistributions.

For\nthe case of scalar dark matter we chose Inert Doublet Model, while for the case\nof fermion dark matter we suggest the new minimal fermion dark matter model\nwith only three parameters.

In particular we have demonstrated that in case of\nfermion DM, the masses can be measured with a few percent accuracy already at\n500 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. At the same time, the scalar DM model\nwhich has about an order of magnitude lower signal, requires about factor of 40\nhigher luminosity to reach the same accuracy in the mass measurement.

We hence introduce two techniques\nto incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of\ntranslation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and\nthrough a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we\npropose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly\nguiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the\nimage.

In this work, we theoretically investigate the moire band structures\nof the DTFLGs with diverse arrangements of MLG and BLG. We find that, depending\non the relative rotation direction of the two twist angles (alternate or chiral\ntwist) and the middle van der Waals (vdW) layer (MLG or BLG), a general\n(X+Y+Z)-DTFLG can be classified into four categories, i.e. (X+1+Z)-ATFLG,\n(X+2+Z)-ATFLG, (X+1+Z)-CTFLG and (X+2+Z)-CTFLG, each of which has its own\nunique band structure.

Interestingly, the (X+1+Z)-ATFLGs have a pair of perfect flat bands at the\nmagic angle about $1.54^\\circ$ coexisting with a pair of linear or parabolic\nbands, which is quite like the double twisted TLG. Meanwhile, when the twist\nangle is smaller than a \"magic angle\" $1.70^\\circ$, the (X+2+Z)-CTFLGs can have\ntwo isolated narrow bands at $E_f$ with band width less than 5 meV.

Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a\nsample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing\nweighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing\nonly either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with\ncorrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How\nto handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this\npaper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar\ntransient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,\nwhich could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by\nthis, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate\ntraining strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole\nbiased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each\nsample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the\nresulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named\nCurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper\nweights through meta-learning adaptively.

In this paper we discuss a field\ntheoretical treatment of the $2d$ $XY$ model with long-range couplings and we\ncompare it with results from the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Both\nthese methods lead to a rich phase diagram, where both power-law BKT scaling\nand spontaneous symmetry breaking appear for the same (intermediate) decay\nrates of long-range interactions. The method is also applied to the long-range\nquantum $XXZ$ spin chain at zero temperature. We discuss the relation between\nthe phase diagrams of the two models and we give predictions about the scaling\nof the order parameter of the quantum chain close to the transition.

Our\napplication is to HIV genetic linkage analysis that has been used to\ninvestigate HIV transmission dynamics. In this setting, two HIV sequences from\ndifferent persons with HIV (PWH) are said to be linked if the genetic distance\nbetween these sequences is less than a given threshold. Such linkage suggests\nthat that the nodes representing the two infected PWH, are close to each other\nin a transmission network; such proximity would imply that either one of the\ninfected people directly transmitted the virus to the other or indirectly\ntransmitted it through a small number of intermediaries. These viral genetic\nlinkage networks are dynamic in the sense that, over time, a group or cluster\nof genetically linked viral sequences may increase in size as new people are\ninfected by those in the cluster either directly or through intermediaries. Our\napproach makes use of a logistic model to describe homophily with regard to\ndemographic and behavioral characteristics that is we investigate whether\nsimilarities (or differences) between PWH in these characteristics impacts the\nprobability that their sequences are be linked.

Water-air interface area was measured numerically by the\nalpha shape method. The soil-water retention mechanism at the nanoscale was\nanalyzed by distinguishing adsorptive pressure and capillary pressure at\ndifferent mass water content (degree of saturation) and considering apparent\ncapillary interface area (water-air interface area per unit water volume).\nWater number density profile that distinguishes adsorptive water and capillary\nwater was used to quantify adsorption effect. Machine learning based curve\nfitting technique was utilized to construct function relationships among mass\nwater content, adsorptive pressure, capillary pressure and apparent soil-water\ninterface area. It has been demonstrated from the numerical results that the\nadsorption effect is dominated by van der Waals force between clay and water at\nthe nanoscale.

The recent emergence of topological materials\nopens a new avenue toward modulating elastic waves in solids.

Up to date,\ntopological materials, including insulators and semimetals, have been realized\nfor acoustic and electromagnetic waves. Although topological materials of\nelastic waves have also been reported, the topological edge modes observed all\nlie on the domain wall. A natural question can be asked: whether there exists\nan elastic metamaterial with the topological edge modes on its own boundary\nonly? Here, we report a 3D metal-printed bilayer metamaterial, insulating\ntopologically the elastic waves. By introducing the chiral interlayer\ncouplings, the spin-orbit couplings for elastic waves are induced, which give\nrise to nontrivial topological properties.
