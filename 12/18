As a\nconsequence, many inference methods have been generalized to the dynamic case\nwith the aim to model dynamic interactions. Particular interest has been\ndevoted to extend the stochastic block model and its variant, to capture\ncommunity structure as the network changes in time. While these models assume\nthat edge formation depends only on the community memberships, recent work for\nstatic networks show the importance to include additional parameters capturing\nstructural properties, as reciprocity for instance. Remarkably, these models\nare capable of generating more realistic network representations than those\nthat only consider community membership. To this aim, we present a\nprobabilistic generative model with hidden variables that integrates\nreciprocity and communities as structural information of networks that evolve\nin time.

It\nis probably fair to say that no fully satisfying solution has been found up to\ndate and it is not clear if the standard formulation even allows for a\nprincipled solution. Hence, rather than following the classical path of bounded\nperturbations, we consider a model similar to the quantum PAC-learning model\nintroduced by Bshouty and Jackson [1995]. Our first key contribution shows that\nin this model we can reduce adversarial robustness to the conjunction of two\nclassical learning theory problems, namely (Problem 1) the problem of finding\ngenerative models and (Problem 2) the problem of devising classifiers that are\nrobust with respect to distributional shifts. Our second key contribution is\nthat the considered framework does not rely on specific (and hence also\nsomewhat arbitrary) threat models like $\\ell_p$ bounded perturbations. Instead,\nour reduction guarantees that in order to solve the adversarial robustness\nproblem in our model it suffices to consider a single distance notion, i.e. the\nHellinger distance. From the technical perspective our protocols are heavily\nbased on the recent advances on delegation of quantum computation, e.g. Mahadev\n[2018].\n  Although the considered model is quantum and therefore not immediately\napplicable to ``real-world'' situations, one might hope that in the future\neither one can find a way to embed ``real-world'' problems into a quantum\nframework or that classical algorithms can be found that are capable of\nmimicking their powerful quantum counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 16:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

Recent\nself-supervised learning methods use contrastive loss to learn good global\nlevel representations from unlabeled images and achieve high performance in\nclassification tasks on popular natural image datasets like ImageNet. In\npixel-level prediction tasks such as segmentation, it is crucial to also learn\ngood local level representations along with global representations to achieve\nbetter accuracy. However, the impact of the existing local contrastive\nloss-based methods remains limited for learning good local representations\nbecause similar and dissimilar local regions are defined based on random\naugmentations and spatial proximity; not based on the semantic label of local\nregions due to lack of large-scale expert annotations in the\nsemi/self-supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a local contrastive\nloss to learn good pixel level features useful for segmentation by exploiting\nsemantic label information obtained from pseudo-labels of unlabeled images\nalongside limited annotated images.

In general, when\nmultiple targets are present, the response of a correlation interferometer is\ncorrupted by intermodulation distortion, making it difficult to estimate\nindividual target angular velocities. We present a distortion mitigation method\nthat works by decomposing the responses at each antenna element into the\nresponses from the individual targets. Data association is performed to match\nindividual target responses at each antenna such that cross-correlation is\nperformed only between associated targets. Thus, the intermodulation distortion\n(cross-terms) from correlating unlike targets are eliminated, and the result is\na frequency response whose individual frequencies are proportional to the\nangular velocities of the targets. We demonstrate the approach with a custom 40\nGHz interferometric radar, a high-accuracy motion capture system which provides\nground-truth position measurements, and two robotic platforms. The multitarget\nexperiments consist of three scenarios, designed to represent easy, medium, and\ndifficult cases for the distortion mitigation technique.

We focus here on some of the limitations of MoB and address them by\nstudying the Mellin-Barnes (MB) representation technique. There has been\nsignificant process recently in the study of the latter due to the development\nof a new computational approach based on conic hulls (see Phys. Rev. Lett. 127,\n151601 (2021)). The comparison between the two methods helps to understand the\nlimitations of the MoB, in particular when termwise divergent series appear. As\na consequence, the MB technique is found to be superior over MoB for two major\nreasons: 1. the selection of the sets of series that form a series\nrepresentation for a given integral follows, in the MB approach, from specific\nintersections of conic hulls, which, in contrast to MoB, does not need any\nconvergence analysis of the involved series, and 2. MB can be used to evaluate\nresonant (i.e. logarithmic) cases where MoB fails due to the appearance of\ntermwise divergent series. Furthermore, we show that the recently added Rule 5\nof MoB naturally emerges as a consequence of the residue theorem in the context\nof MB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 18:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

The MCTS's popularity is based on its extraordinary results\nin the challenging two-player based game Go, a game considered much harder than\nChess and that until very recently was considered infeasible for Artificial\nIntelligence methods. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is\nbuilt and the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One\nparticular selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the\nUpper Confidence Bounds for Trees, commonly referred as UCT. The UCT attempts\nto nicely balance exploration and exploitation by considering the values stored\nin the statistical tree of the MCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is\nnecessary for this to work well. In this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms\n(EAs) to evolve mathematical expressions with the goal to substitute the UCT\nmathematical expression. We compare our proposed approach, called Evolution\nStrategy in MCTS (ES-MCTS) against five variants of the MCTS UCT, three\nvariants of the star-minimax family of algorithms as well as a random\ncontroller in the Game of Carcassonne.

In\nparticular, by viewing MCC as to rank classes for an instance, we first argue\nthat ranking metrics, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, can be\nmore informative than the commonly used Top-$K$ metrics. We further demonstrate\nthat the dominant neural MCC recipe can be transformed to a neural ranking\nframework. Based on such generalization, we show that it is intuitive to\nleverage advanced techniques from the learning to rank literature to improve\nthe MCC performance out of the box. Extensive empirical results on both text\nand image classification tasks with diverse datasets and backbone neural models\nshow the value of our proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 19:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 16:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Given the inverse correlation\nbetween SN Ia brightness and PBH mass, an intriguing explanation is a\nspatially-inhomogeneous PBH mass function. If so, a strong mass segregation in\nthe DM density-dependent PBH mass scale is needed to explain the magnitude\nstep.

In undoped STO, ferroelectric order can in fact be\nstabilized by substituting $^{16}$O with its heavier isotope $^{18}$O.

The sixth generation (6G) networks,\nbeing in their early stages of research and standardization activities, open\nnew opportunities to opt for a design-driven approach when developing\nself-coordination capabilities. This can be achieved through the use of hybrid\nSON designs. A hybrid architecture combines the centralized and distributed\nmanagement and control.

In particular, the impact of deploying\ndifferent virtualization platforms, offered by the Cloud and Edge, on the\nusability of DL applications (in terms of the End-to-End (E2E) inference time)\nhas remained an open question. Importantly, resource elasticity (by means of\nscale-up), CPU pinning, and processor type (CPU vs GPU) configurations have\nshown to be influential on the virtualization overhead. Accordingly, the goal\nof this research is to study the impact of these potentially decisive\ndeployment options on the E2E performance, thus, usability of the DL\napplications. To that end, we measure the impact of four popular execution\nplatforms (namely, bare-metal, virtual machine (VM), container, and container\nin VM) on the E2E inference time of four types of DL applications, upon\nchanging processor configuration (scale-up, CPU pinning) and processor types.\nThis study reveals a set of interesting and sometimes counter-intuitive\nfindings that can be used as best practices by Cloud solution architects to\nefficiently deploy DL applications in various systems. The notable finding is\nthat the solution architects must be aware of the DL application\ncharacteristics, particularly, their pre- and post-processing requirements, to\nbe able to optimally choose and configure an execution platform, determine the\nuse of GPU, and decide the efficient scale-up range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 21:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

This might contribute to bias. Building on this\nintuition, we propose a novel distillation-based approach called Distill and\nDe-bias (D&D) to enforce a network to attend to similar face regions,\nirrespective of the attribute category. In D&D, we train a teacher network on\nimages from one category of an attribute; e.g. light skintone. Then distilling\ninformation from the teacher, we train a student network on images of the\nremaining category; e.g., dark skintone. A feature-level distillation loss\nconstrains the student network to generate teacher-like representations. This\nallows the student network to attend to similar face regions for all attribute\ncategories and enables it to reduce bias. We also propose a second distillation\nstep on top of D&D, called D&D++. Here, we distill the `un-biasedness' of the\nD&D network into a new student network, the D&D++ network, while training this\nnew network on all attribute categories; e.g., both light and dark skintones.\nThis helps us train a network that is less biased for an attribute, while\nobtaining higher face verification performance than D&D. We show that D&D++\noutperforms existing baselines in reducing gender and skintone bias on the\nIJB-C dataset, while obtaining higher face verification performance than\nexisting adversarial de-biasing methods.

It is a critical step in data\nmonitoring, behavior analysis and other applications, helping enable continual\nlearning in the field. Conventional methods of OOD detection perform\nmulti-variate analysis on an ensemble of data or features, and usually resort\nto the supervision with OOD data to improve the accuracy. In reality, such\nsupervision is impractical as one cannot anticipate the anomalous data. In this\npaper, we propose a novel, self-supervised approach that does not rely on any\npre-defined OOD data: (1) The new method evaluates the Mahalanobis distance of\nthe gradients between the in-distribution and OOD data. (2) It is assisted by a\nself-supervised binary classifier to guide the label selection to generate the\ngradients, and maximize the Mahalanobis distance. In the evaluation with\nmultiple datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and TinyImageNet, the\nproposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and\nunsupervised methods in the area under the receiver operating characteristic\n(AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) metrics.

On the one hand, traditional\nmodels are often interpretable to humans but they cannot achieve high\nprediction performances. At the opposite end of the spectrum, deep models can\nachieve state-of-the-art performances in many tasks. However, deep models'\npredictions are known to be uninterpretable to humans. In this paper we present\na framework that shortens the gap between the two aforementioned groups of\nmethods. Given an artificial neural network (ANN), our method finds a Gaussian\nprocess (GP) whose predictions almost match those of the ANN. As GPs are highly\ninterpretable, we use the trained GP to explain the ANN's decisions. We use our\nmethod to explain ANNs' decisions on may datasets. The explanations provide\nintriguing insights about the ANNs' decisions. With the best of our knowledge,\nour inference formulation for GPs is the first one in which an ANN and a\nsimilarly behaving Gaussian process naturally appear. Furthermore, we examine\nsome of the known theoretical conditions under which an ANN is interpretable by\nGPs. Some of those theoretical conditions are too restrictive for modern\narchitectures. However, we hypothesize that only a subset of those theoretical\nconditions are sufficient. Finally, we implement our framework as a publicly\navailable tool called GPEX.

Unfortunately, current deep\nnetworks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge\ndevices, but also too large for communicating updates over\nbandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and\nexperimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse\nTraining (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained\nwith substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and\nin-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that\nextracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this\nscheme, \"two birds are killed with one stone:\" instead of full models, each\nclient performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse\nnetworks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our\nresults reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly\naccommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse\nmasks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an \"in-time\nself-ensembling effect\" into the training dynamics and improves the FL\nperformance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d.\nFL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our\nexperiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it\ngains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same\nupload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2x the\nupload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

The trend of executing multiple DNNs simultaneously exacerbate\nthe existing limitations of meeting stringent latency/accuracy requirements on\nresource constrained mobile devices. The prior art sheds light on exploring the\naccuracy-resource tradeoff by scaling the model sizes in accordance to resource\ndynamics. However, such model scaling approaches face to imminent challenges:\n(i) large space exploration of model sizes, and (ii) prohibitively long\ntraining time for different model combinations. In this paper, we present\nLegoDNN, a lightweight, block-grained scaling solution for running multi-DNN\nworkloads in mobile vision systems. LegoDNN guarantees short model training\ntimes by only extracting and training a small number of common blocks (e.g. 5\nin VGG and 8 in ResNet) in a DNN. At run-time, LegoDNN optimally combines the\ndescendant models of these blocks to maximize accuracy under specific resources\nand latency constraints, while reducing switching overhead via smart\nblock-level scaling of the DNN. We implement LegoDNN in TensorFlow Lite and\nextensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques (FLOP scaling,\nknowledge distillation and model compression) using a set of 12 popular DNN\nmodels. Evaluation results show that LegoDNN provides 1,296x to 279,936x more\noptions in model sizes without increasing training time, thus achieving as much\nas 31.74% improvement in inference accuracy and 71.07% reduction in scaling\nenergy consumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 06:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Realizing these\napplications on an industrial scale requires scalable and mass-producible\nplasmonic cavities that provide ease of access and control for quantum\nemitters. Via a rational selection of substrates and the canonical gold bowtie\nnanoantenna, we propose a novel design strategy for multidimensional\nengineering of nanocavity antenna-mode hotspots, which facilitates their\nelevation to the top of the nanobowtie gap and provides a field enhancement of\n~500 fold (a 1.6-fold increase compared to a conventional nanobowtie-on-glass\ncavity at the bottom of the nanobowtie gap). We discuss the formation mechanism\nfor such antenna modes using different material substrates from the perspective\nof charge carrier motion, and analyze their sensitivity to the geometrical\nparameters of the device. The advantages of these antenna modes, particularly\nin view of their dominantly in-plane polarized near-fields, are further\nelaborated in a spatiotemporal study of plexcitonic strong coupling involving\nsingle emitters and layered ensembles thereof, which reveals ultrafast quantum\ndynamics dependent on both the substrate and nanobowtie geometry, as well as\nthe potential for applications related to 2D materials whose excitonic dipoles\nare typically oriented in-plane.

With the help of Dyson series and semiclassical\npropagator, we calculate the scattering amplitudes in the cylindrical\ncoordinate representation. In contrast to conventional recognitions that the\nphotoelectron holography is the interference of two branches of electron\ntrajectories, however, we find strikingly that infinite semiclassical\ntrajectories can be deflected by the combined Coulomb potential and laser field\ninto the same final momentum: The initial momenta are found to be distributed\non a ring-shape curve in the transverse momentum plane and the initial\npositions of these trajectories are perpendicular to their initial momentum\nvectors.

Our key observation is that semantic classification plays a\ncritical role in existing approaches, while the incorrectly classified pixels\nare easily regarded as anomalies.

To this end, we propose a novel Distillation Comparison Network\n(DiCNet). It comprises of a teacher branch which is a semantic segmentation\nnetwork that removed the semantic classification head, and a student branch\nthat is distilled from the teacher branch through a distribution distillation.\nWe show that the distillation guarantees the semantic features of the two\nbranches hold consistency in the known classes, while reflect inconsistency in\nthe unknown class. Therefore, we leverage the semantic feature discrepancy\nbetween the two branches to discover the anomalies.

The relative translation between point clouds in these applications is\nhigher than in traditional SLAM and odometry applications, which challenges the\nidentification of correspondences and a successful registration. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel registration method for partially overlapping point clouds\nwhere correspondences are learned using an efficient point-wise feature\nencoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention\nnetwork exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the\nmatching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose\ntransformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through\nsample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel\nsynthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of\nup to 30m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with\nstate-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods\nfor low overlapping point clouds.

However, a solution to the practical\nscenario of aligning sparsely and differently sampled observations in the\npresence of noise is still lacking. We approach registration in this scenario\nwith a fusion of the closed-form Universal Mani-fold Embedding (UME) method and\na deep neural network. The two are combined into a single unified framework,\nnamed DeepUME, trained end-to-end and in an unsupervised manner. To\nsuccessfully provide a global solution in the presence of large\ntransformations, we employ an SO(3)-invariant coordinate system to learn both a\njoint-resampling strategy of the point clouds and SO(3)-invariant features.\nThese features are then utilized by the geometric UME method for transformation\nestimation.

Recently, deep\nlearning methods, like multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are tried to increase\ngeneralization capabilities. However, MLP is not so suitable for\ngraph-structured data like networks. MLP treats IP addresses as isolated\ninstances and ignores the connection information, which limits geolocation\naccuracy. In this work, we research how to increase the generalization\ncapability with an emerging graph deep learning method -- Graph Neural Network\n(GNN). First, IP geolocation is re-formulated as an attributed graph node\nregression problem. Then, we propose a GNN-based IP geolocation framework named\nGNN-Geo. GNN-Geo consists of a preprocessor, an encoder, messaging passing (MP)\nlayers and a decoder. The preprocessor and encoder transform measurement data\ninto the initial node embeddings. MP layers refine the initial node embeddings\nby modeling the connection information. The decoder maps the refined embeddings\nto nodes' locations and relieves the convergence problem by considering prior\nknowledge. The experiments in 8 real-world IPv4/IPv6 networks in North America,\nEurope and Asia show the proposed GNN-Geo clearly outperforms the state-of-art\nrule-based and learning-based baselines.

This paper proposes a\nmodel-based safe RL algorithm for optimal control of nonlinear systems with\ntime-varying state and control constraints. In the proposed approach, we\nconstruct a novel barrier-based control policy structure that can guarantee\ncontrol safety.

This lack of prioritization is\nunderstandable: there is no inherent cost in breaking virtual objects. As a\nresult, \"well-trained\" agents frequently collide with objects before achieving\ntheir primary goals, a behavior that would be catastrophic in the real world.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of training agents to complete the task of\nvisual mobile manipulation in the ManipulaTHOR environment while avoiding\nunnecessary collision (disturbance) with objects. We formulate disturbance\navoidance as a penalty term in the reward function, but find that directly\ntraining with such penalized rewards often results in agents being unable to\nescape poor local optima. Instead, we propose a two-stage training curriculum\nwhere an agent is first allowed to freely explore and build basic competencies\nwithout penalization, after which a disturbance penalty is introduced to refine\nthe agent's behavior. Results on testing scenes show that our curriculum not\nonly avoids these poor local optima, but also leads to 10% absolute gains in\nsuccess rate without disturbance, compared to our state-of-the-art baselines.\nMoreover, our curriculum is significantly more performant than a safe RL\nalgorithm that casts collision avoidance as a constraint.

We tackle this challenge by\nintroducing a hierarchical matrix approach, named HMAT, which effectively\ndecomposes the matrix structure, in a recursive manner, into significantly\nsmaller matrices where a direct approach could be used for inversion. Our\nmatrix partitioning uses a particular aggregation strategy for data points,\nwhich promotes the low-rank structure of off-diagonal blocks in the\nhierarchical kernel matrix.
