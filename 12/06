Hence, there may exist several semantically\nsimilar malware samples in a family/dataset. Many researchers unaware about\nthese semantically similar apps and use their features in their ML models for\nevaluation. Hence, the performance measures might be seriously affected by\nthese similar kinds of apps. In this paper, we study the impact of semantically\nsimilar applications in the performance measures of ML based Android malware\ndetectors. For this, we propose a novel opcode subsequence based malware\nclustering algorithm to identify the semantically similar malware and goodware\napps. For studying the impact of semantically similar apps in the performance\nmeasures, we tested the performance of distinct ML models based on API call and\npermission features of malware and goodware application with/without\nsemantically similar apps. In our experimentation with Drebin dataset, we found\nthat, after removing the exact duplicate apps from the dataset (? = 0) the\nmalware detection rate (TPR) of API call based ML models is dropped from 0.95\nto 0.91 and permission based model is dropped from 0.94 to 0.90. In order to\novercome this issue, we advise the research community to use our clustering\nalgorithm to get rid of semantically similar apps before evaluating their\nmalware detection mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 16:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

We then study the pairing symmetry in this system\nby using large scale variational Monte Carlo approach. Our results yield the\nintraorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave singlet pairing as the leading pairing symmetry\nin the nickelates, which is analogous to the cuprates. However, there exist two\nimportant differences between the physical properties of the two families due\nto the fact that at the low Sr-doping regime, while the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$\norbitals remain half-filled and singly-occupied to form a Mott-insulating\nbackground, the Ni-$3d_{xy}$ orbitals accommodate nearly all the extra doped\nholes, which move freely on this background. The first difference lies in the\nsingle-particle aspect: while the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ degree of freedom remains Mott\ninsulating with spectra weight pinned down at zero at low dopings, the\n$3d_{xy}$ one behaves as Fermi liquid with spectra weight near 1. The second\ndifference lies in the pairing aspect: while the huge\nintra-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital pairing gap is actually a pseudo gap which has\nnothing to do with the SC, the small intra-$3d_{xy}$-orbital pairing gap serves\nas the true superconducting pairing gap, which is related to the $T_c$ via the\nBCS relation.

Recently, several practical tools to estimate\nuncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there\nhave not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools\nin the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies\nstate-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world\nsetting of air quality forecasts. Through extensive experiments, we describe\ntraining probabilistic models and evaluate their predictive uncertainties based\non empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical\napplicability. We also propose improving these models using \"free\" adversarial\ntraining and exploiting temporal and spatial correlation inherent in air\nquality data.

To study wormhole\ngeometries, we make assumption of spherical symmetric static spacetime and the\nexistence of conformal Killing symmetry to get more acceptable astrophysical\noutcomes. To do this, we choose the expression of $f(R,\\,T)$ as $f(R,T)= R+2\n\\gamma T$. Here we employ the phantom energy EoS relating to radial pressure\nand density given by $p_r=\\omega \\rho$ with $\\omega<-1$ to constrain our model.\nFollowing a discussion of wormhole geometry and behavior of shape function, the\nstudy moves on to the computation of proper radial distance, active mass\nfunction, the nature of total gravitational energy and a discussion on the\nviolation of energy conditions.

Layer Normalization (LN) is an\nessential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN\nmakes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes\nembeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture\ninductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle\nthis problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization\n(DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token)\nand across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it\nis built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing\nnormalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both\nintra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the\nglobal contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by\nsimply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision\ntransformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer.\nExtensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently\noutperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational\noverhead.

For the Mott insulating quantum materials with a large local Hilbert\nspace, the spin-only description with pairwise quadratic spin interactions is\noften insufficient to capture the interaction. In the situation with active\nlocal orbital degrees of freedom, the Kugel-Khomskii superexchange model was\nthen proposed. We here briefly review this historical model and discuss the\nmodern arenas and developments beyond the original orbital context where this\nmodel and the relevant physics emerge.

For the ultracold\natom contexts, we review the Mott insulators with the large-spin ultracold\nalkaline and alkaline-earth atoms on the optical lattices, where a large local\nHilbert space naturally emerges. Despite a large local Hilbert space from the\natomic hyperfine spin states, the system could realize a large symmetry group\nsuch as the Sp($N$) or the SU($N$) symmetry. These ultracold atomic systems\nactually lie in the large-$N$ regime of large symmetry groups and are\ncharacterized by strong quantum fluctuations. The Kugel-Khomskii physics and\nthe exotic quantum ground states with the \"bayone-like\" physics can appear in\nvarious limits. We conclude with our vision and outlook on this subject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 17:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

We model the noise as originating from an arbitrary but fixed unitary\nevolution, $U$, of some noisy qubits. The noise can occur with some probability\nin the interval between any pair of consecutive noiseless Grover evolutions.\nAlthough each run of the algorithm is a unitary process, the noise model leads\nto decoherence when all possible runs are considered. We derive a set of\nunitary $U$'s, called the 'good noises,' for which the success probability of\nthe algorithm at any given time remains unchanged with varying the non-trivial\ntotal number ($m$) of noisy qubits in the register. The result holds\nirrespective of the presence of any time-correlations in the noise. We show\nthat only when $U$ is either of the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$\n(which give rise to $m$-qubit bit-flip and phase-damping channels respectively\nin the time-correlation-less case), the algorithm's success probability stays\nunchanged when increasing or decreasing $m$. In contrast, when $U$ is the Pauli\nmatrix $\\sigma_y$ (giving rise to $m$-qubit bit-phase flip channel in the\ntime-correlation-less case), the success probability at all times stays\nunaltered as long as the parity (even or odd) of the total number $m$ remains\nthe same. This asymmetry between the Pauli operators stems from the inherent\nsymmetry-breaking existing within the Grover circuit. We further show that the\npositions of the noisy sites are irrelevant in case of any of the Pauli noises.\nThe results are illustrated in the cases of time-correlated and\ntime-correlation-less noise. We find that the former case leads to a better\nperformance of the noisy algorithm. We also discuss physical scenarios where\nour chosen noise model is of relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 18:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 15:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 20:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

One of the largest barriers to wider adoption of federated\nlearning is the communication cost of sending model updates from and to the\nclients, which is accentuated by the fact that many of these devices are\nbandwidth-constrained. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by\noptimizing networks within a subspace of their full parameter space, an idea\nknown as intrinsic dimension in the machine learning theory community. We use a\ncorrespondence between the notion of intrinsic dimension and gradient\ncompressibility to derive a family of low-bandwidth optimization algorithms,\nwhich we call intrinsic gradient compression algorithms. Specifically, we\npresent three algorithms in this family with different levels of upload and\ndownload bandwidth for use in various federated settings, along with\ntheoretical guarantees on their performance. Finally, in large-scale federated\nlearning experiments with models containing up to 100M parameters, we show that\nour algorithms perform extremely well compared to current state-of-the-art\ngradient compression methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 19:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The root cause of this strong trade-off relationship is high\nproduct demand variability. To mitigate the issue and reduce the cost of\noperating perishable inventory systems, some grocery stores utilize an opaque\nselling scheme: selling an anonymous product whose brand or exact specification\nis shielded from customers at the time of sale. The use of opaque products has\nnow become a popular means to reduce shortage/wastage at grocery stores.\nHowever, there has been little discussion of the effectiveness of opaque\nschemes applied to perishable inventory systems.\n  In this paper, we propose an opaque scheme based on the balancing policy on\ndemand, which tries to average out orders for products. We confirm both\nanalytically and numerically that this opaque scheme effectively reduces\nproduct demand variability, thereby reducing both shortage and wastage for\nperishable inventory systems under a base-stock policy. We also present an\nanalytical formula that reveals insights into the opaque scheme: The ratio\nbetween the opaque proportion and the coefficient of variation of product\ndemands plays a key role to determine the effectiveness of our opaque scheme.\nFurthermore, we provide a rule of thumb to find the threshold opaque scheme\nparameters needed to achieve the maximum total cost savings for perishable\ninventory systems. We hope that many retailers selling perishables (e.g., fresh\nproduce and baked goods) find the opaque scheme useful, implement it, and\ncontribute to the reduction of the food wastage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 19:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

ES extracts dynamically the main components of each individual TS and\nenables on-the-fly deseasonalization, which is particularly useful when\noperating on a relatively small data set. A multi-layer RNN is equipped with a\nnew type of dilated recurrent cell designed to efficiently model both short and\nlong-term dependencies in TS. To improve the internal TS representation and\nthus the model's performance, RNN learns simultaneously both the ES parameters\nand the main mapping function transforming inputs into forecasts.

In this\nwork, we study the dynamical evolution of ringed exomoons, dubbed \"cronomoons\"\nafter their similarity with Cronus (Greek for Saturn), and after Chronos (the\nepitome of time), following the Transit Timing Variations (TTV) and Transit\nDuration Variation (TDV) that they produce on their host planet.

We explore different possible\nscenarios that could lead to the formation of such circumsatellital rings, and\nthrough the study of the dynamical/thermodynamic stability and lifespan of\ntheir dust and ice ring particles, we found that an isolated cronomoon can\nsurvive for time-scales long enough to be detected and followed up. If these\nobjects exist, cronomoons' rings will exhibit gaps similar to Saturn's Cassini\nDivision and analogous to the asteroid belt's Kirkwood gaps, but instead raised\ndue to resonances induced by the host planet.

We analyze a modified\nErlang A model under the CBC scheme using a Markov chain decomposition method,\nderive non-asymptotic and asymptotic normal representations of performance\nindicators, and confirm that the CBC scheme makes large systems less sensitive\nthan the original Erlang A model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 22:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The anharmonicity\nhere suggests the importance of nonadiabatic behaviors of charge fluxes in\ncuprates. These charge fluxes will result in the dynamic charge transfer that\ncan be directly calculated by the charge difference induced by phonons in\ndensity functional theory simulations. However, retrieving the flux field from\nthe calculated charge transfer is nontrivial. In this article, a new method is\ndeveloped to solve these fluxes, which help identify anharmonically coupled\nphonons as the generator of nonlocal flux flows beyond local oscillations in\ncuprates, especially at high frequencies. A strength metric of such nonlocal\nfluxes shows a strong correlation to the maximum superconducting transition\ntemperature T_(c,max) of different cuprate families.

We explore the consequences of such variation when pairs of\nelectric and magnetic conductors (i.e. low and high impedance surfaces) are\nused as substrates on either side, showing that this continuous variation\nresults in changes in the sign of the force, leading to both stable and\nunstable conditions, which could find interesting potential applications in\nnanomechanics including nanoparticle tweezing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 23:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

A conceptual explanation for\nthe appearance of the Bethe Ansatz equations is provided by appropriate\n$G$-opers: $G$-connections on the projective line with extra structure. In\nfact, solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations are parameterized by an enhanced\nversion of opers called Miura opers; here, the opers appearing have only\nregular singularities. Feigin, Frenkel, Rybnikov, and Toledano Laredo have\nintroduced an inhomogeneous version of the Gaudin model; this model\nincorporates an additional twist factor, which is an element of the Lie algebra\nof $G$. They exhibited the Bethe Ansatz equations for this model and gave a\ngeometric interpretation of the spectra in terms of opers with an irregular\nsingularity. In this paper, we consider a new approach to the study of the\nspectra of the inhomogeneous Gaudin model in terms of a further enhancement of\nopers called twisted Miura-Pl\\\"ucker opers and a certain system of nonlinear\ndifferential equations called the $qq$-system.

However, it is a challenging\ntask to learn powerful representations for accurate delineation under limited\npixel (voxel)-wise annotations. Contrastive learning at pixel-level can\nalleviate the dependency on annotations by learning dense representations from\nunlabeled data. Recent studies in this direction design various contrastive\nlosses on the feature maps, to yield discriminative features for each pixel in\nthe map. However, pixels in the same map inevitably share semantics to be\ncloser than they actually are, which may affect the discrimination of pixels in\nthe same map and lead to the unfair comparison to pixels in other maps. To\naddress these issues, we propose a separated region-level contrastive learning\nscheme, namely SepaReg, the core of which is to separate each image into\nregions and encode each region separately. Specifically, SepaReg comprises two\ncomponents: a structure-aware image separation (SIS) module and an intra- and\ninter-organ distillation (IID) module. The SIS is proposed to operate on the\nimage set to rebuild a region set under the guidance of structural information.\nThe inter-organ representation will be learned from this set via typical\ncontrastive losses cross regions. On the other hand, the IID is proposed to\ntackle the quantity imbalance in the region set as tiny organs may produce\nfewer regions, by exploiting intra-organ representations.

However, strategic agents may possess\nboth the ability and the incentive to manipulate this observed feature vector\nin order to attain a more favorable outcome. We explore the impact that\nstrategic agent behavior could have on fair classifiers and derive conditions\nunder which this behavior leads to fair classifiers becoming less fair than\ntheir conventional counterparts under the same measure of fairness that the\nfair classifier takes into account. These conditions are related to the the way\nin which the fair classifier remedies unfairness on the original unmanipulated\ndata: fair classifiers which remedy unfairness by becoming more selective than\ntheir conventional counterparts are the ones that become less fair than their\ncounterparts when agents are strategic. We further demonstrate that both the\nincreased selectiveness of the fair classifier, and consequently the loss of\nfairness, arises when performing fair learning on domains in which the\nadvantaged group is overrepresented in the region near (and on the beneficial\nside of) the decision boundary of conventional classifiers. Finally, we observe\nexperimentally, using several datasets and learning methods, that this fairness\nreversal is common, and that our theoretical characterization of the fairness\nreversal conditions indeed holds in most such cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 02:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

This however commonly accepted in the literature, underlines a\nfundamental question interfacing AI and human -- what constitutes transferable\nknowledge for human to learn from AI? This paper sets out to answer this very\nquestion using FGVC as a test bed. Specifically, we envisage a scenario where a\ntrained FGVC model (the AI expert) functions as a knowledge provider in\nenabling average people (you and me) to become better domain experts ourselves,\ni.e. those capable in distinguishing between \"Whip-poor-will\" and \"Mallard\".\nFig. 1 lays out our approach in answering this question. Assuming an AI expert\ntrained using expert human labels, we ask (i) what is the best transferable\nknowledge we can extract from AI, and (ii) what is the most practical means to\nmeasure the gains in expertise given that knowledge? On the former, we propose\nto represent knowledge as highly discriminative visual regions that are\nexpert-exclusive. For that, we devise a multi-stage learning framework, which\nstarts with modelling visual attention of domain experts and novices before\ndiscriminatively distilling their differences to acquire the expert exclusive\nknowledge. For the latter, we simulate the evaluation process as book guide to\nbest accommodate the learning practice of what is accustomed to humans. A\ncomprehensive human study of 15,000 trials shows our method is able to\nconsistently improve people of divergent bird expertise to recognise once\nunrecognisable birds. Interestingly, our approach also leads to improved\nconventional FGVC performance when the extracted knowledge defined is utilised\nas means to achieve discriminative localisation.

However, their created videos often suffer\nunnatural mouth shapes and asynchronous lips because those methods struggle to\nlearn a consistent speech style from different speakers. We observe that it\nwould be much easier to learn a consistent speech style from a specific\nspeaker, which leads to authentic mouth movements. Hence, we propose a novel\none-shot talking face generation framework by exploring consistent correlations\nbetween audio and visual motions from a specific speaker and then transferring\naudio-driven motion fields to a reference image. Specifically, we develop an\nAudio-Visual Correlation Transformer (AVCT) that aims to infer talking motions\nrepresented by keypoint based dense motion fields from an input audio. In\nparticular, considering audio may come from different identities in deployment,\nwe incorporate phonemes to represent audio signals. In this manner, our AVCT\ncan inherently generalize to audio spoken by other identities. Moreover, as\nface keypoints are used to represent speakers, AVCT is agnostic against\nappearances of the training speaker, and thus allows us to manipulate face\nimages of different identities readily. Considering different face shapes lead\nto different motions, a motion field transfer module is exploited to reduce the\naudio-driven dense motion field gap between the training identity and the\none-shot reference. Once we obtained the dense motion field of the reference\nimage, we employ an image renderer to generate its talking face videos from an\naudio clip. Thanks to our learned consistent speaking style, our method\ngenerates authentic mouth shapes and vivid movements. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our synthesized videos outperform the state-of-the-art in\nterms of visual quality and lip-sync.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 02:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

However, such large-scale\nannotations are difficult and expensive to obtain in real-world applications,\nthus models that can generalize well from a small amount of labelled data are\ndesired. We investigate this problem of few-shot fashion landmark detection,\nwhere only a few labelled samples are available for an unseen task. This work\nproposes a novel framework named MetaCloth via meta-learning, which is able to\nlearn unseen tasks of dense fashion landmark detection with only a few\nannotated samples. Unlike previous meta-learning work that focus on solving\n\"N-way K-shot\" tasks, where each task predicts N number of classes by training\nwith K annotated samples for each class (N is fixed for all seen and unseen\ntasks), a task in MetaCloth detects N different landmarks for different\nclothing categories using K samples, where N varies across tasks, because\ndifferent clothing categories usually have various number of landmarks.\nTherefore, numbers of parameters are various for different seen and unseen\ntasks in MetaCloth. MetaCloth is carefully designed to dynamically generate\ndifferent numbers of parameters for different tasks, and learn a generalizable\nfeature extraction network from a few annotated samples with a set of good\ninitialization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MetaCloth\noutperforms its counterparts by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 03:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

The proposed method allows prediction of defect\nenergies with values that approximate those from the HSE functional at the\ncomputational cost of LDA (about 20x faster for the systems studied here).\nTests of selected point defects in In-V:Bi materials resulted in corrected LDA\nvalues having a mean absolute error (MAE)=0.175 eV for defect levels vs. HSE.\nThe method was further verified on an external database of defects and\nimpurities in CdX (X=S, Se, Te) systems, yielding a MAE=0.194 eV. These tests\ndemonstrate the correction to be sufficient for qualitative and\nsemi-quantitative predictions, and may suggest transferability to many\nsemiconductor systems without significant loss in accuracy. Properties of the\nremaining In-V:Bi defects and all Al-V:Bi defects were predicted with the use\nof the modified band alignment method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 06:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Low-Shot Object Detection (LSOD) is an emerging research\ntopic of detecting objects from a few or even no annotated samples, consisting\nof One-Shot Object Detection (OSOD), Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) and\nZero-Shot Object Detection (ZSD). This survey provides a comprehensive review\nof LSOD methods. First, we propose a thorough taxonomy of LSOD methods and\nanalyze them systematically, comprising some extensional topics of LSOD\n(semi-supervised LSOD, weakly-supervised LSOD and incremental LSOD). Then, we\nindicate the pros and cons of current LSOD methods with a comparison of their\nperformance. Finally, we discuss the challenges and promising directions of\nLSOD to provide guidance for future works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 06:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 07:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 10:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

To help developers thoroughly understand the impact of\nmodel compression, it is essential to test these models to find those deviated\nbehaviors before dissemination. However, this is a non-trivial task because the\narchitectures and gradients of compressed models are usually not available.\n  To this end, we propose DFLARE, a novel, search-based, black-box testing\ntechnique to automatically find triggering inputs that result in deviated\nbehaviors in image classification tasks. DFLARE iteratively applies a series of\nmutation operations to a given seed image, until a triggering input is found.\nFor better efficacy and efficiency, DFLARE models the search problem as Markov\nChains and leverages the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to guide the selection of\nmutation operators in each iteration. Further, DFLARE utilizes a novel fitness\nfunction to prioritize the mutated inputs that either cause large differences\nbetween two models' outputs, or trigger previously unobserved models'\nprobability vectors. We evaluated DFLARE on 21 compressed models for image\nclassification tasks with three datasets. The results show that DFLARE\noutperforms the baseline in terms of efficacy and efficiency.

This problem can be iteratively solved by using the proximal operator\nmethod, based on which we develop a unfolding neural network structure by\nparameterizing the algorithmic iterations. By further exploiting the coupling\nstructure among the training parameters as well as the analytical computation,\nwe develop two additional unfolding structures to reduce the training\ncomplexity. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves a linear convergence\nrate. Results show that our proposed three unfolding structures not only\nachieve a faster convergence rate but also obtain a higher estimation accuracy\nthan the baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 07:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

These advances\nhave been largely limited, however, to unconstrained optimization. For\nconstrained optimization, the few existing non-myopic BO methods require heavy\ncomputation. For instance, one existing non-myopic constrained BO method [Lam\nand Willcox, 2017] relies on computationally expensive unreliable brute-force\nderivative-free optimization of a Monte Carlo rollout acquisition function.\nMethods that use the reparameterization trick for more efficient\nderivative-based optimization of non-myopic acquisition functions in the\nunconstrained setting, like sample average approximation and infinitesimal\nperturbation analysis, do not extend: constraints introduce discontinuities in\nthe sampled acquisition function surface that hinder its optimization.\nMoreover, we argue here that being non-myopic is even more important in\nconstrained problems because fear of violating constraints pushes myopic\nmethods away from sampling the boundary between feasible and infeasible\nregions, slowing the discovery of optimal solutions with tight constraints.

For\nquality assessment, deep neural network (DNN) has shown compelling performance\non no-reference metric design. However, the most challenging issue for\nno-reference PCQA is that we lack large-scale subjective databases to drive\nrobust networks. Our motivation is that the human visual system (HVS) is the\ndecision-maker regardless of the type of media for quality assessment.\nLeveraging the rich subjective scores of the natural images, we can quest the\nevaluation criteria of human perception via DNN and transfer the capability of\nprediction to 3D point clouds. In particular, we treat natural images as the\nsource domain and point clouds as the target domain, and infer point cloud\nquality via unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation. To extract effective\nlatent features and minimize the domain discrepancy, we propose a hierarchical\nfeature encoder and a conditional-discriminative network.

This avoids overriding the effects of the reliable correction modulator\nby the propagation modulator. Although the reference frame with the ground\ntruth label provides reliable cues, it could be very different from the target\nframe and introduce uncertain or incomplete correlations.

In this paper, a\ncomparative evaluation of such CNN denoisers on SCI performance is carried out\non the public \"Dresden Image Database\". Our findings are two-fold. From one\naspect, both the PRNU extraction and image denoising separate noise from the\nimage content. Hence, SCI can benefit from the recent CNN denoisers if\ncarefully trained. From another aspect, the goals and the scenarios of PRNU\nextraction and image denoising are different since one optimizes the quality of\nnoise and the other optimizes the image quality. A carefully tailored training\nis needed when CNN denoisers are used for PRNU estimation. Alternative\nstrategies of training data preparation and loss function design are analyzed\ntheoretically and evaluated experimentally. We point out that feeding the CNNs\nwith image-PRNU pairs and training them with correlation-based loss function\nresult in the best PRNU estimation performance.

Non-conventional designs, such as\nclosed box-wing structures, have reduced induced drag, enabling a higher\npayload capacity, endurance, and aerodynamic efficiency. Current studies have\nwidely studied the applicability of box-wing for large commercial aircraft,\ngeneral aviation, and medium to large UAVs. Despite the increased work on\nnon-conventional wing aircraft, little has been studied about the applicability\nof box-wing design over a monoplane in the MAV scale and the choice of\nparameters that enable the box wing to be best suited. This work presents\nnumerical simulation results for box-wing configurations in contrast with the\nconventional monowing design, considering operations at lower Reynolds numbers\nand aspect ratios suitable for small UAV operations. We study the effects of\nlift, skin friction, and induced drag along with aerodynamic efficiency for six\nstructures. It is intuitive to expect that the decreased induced drag would\nprove the box-wing design outperformed the conventional design. However, the\nadditional parasitic drag generated makes the monowing model a slightly better\nchoice. The simulations reveal that the box-wing lowers induced drag by 2 to\n12% compared to a monowing aircraft but produces a lesser total lift to drag\nratio by 10% at equal lift requirement. Our analysis also addresses the effect\nof varying aspect ratios and Reynolds numbers on the simulation results for the\nbox-wing and monowing designs and discusses the suitability of choosing a\nparticular structure based on mission requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 08:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

In this work, we novelly take\npeople's social ties as a key factor in the modeling and designing of agents'\nincentives in crowdsourcing contests. We establish two contest mechanisms by\nwhich the principal can impel the agents to invite their neighbors to\ncontribute to the task. The first mechanism has a symmetric Bayesian Nash\nequilibrium, and it is very simple for agents to play and easy for the\nprincipal to predict the contest performance. The second mechanism has an\nasymmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and agents' behaviors in equilibrium show\na vast diversity which is strongly related to their social relations. The\nBayesian Nash equilibrium analysis of these new mechanisms reveals that,\nbesides agents' intrinsic abilities, the social relations among them also play\na central role in decision-making. Moreover, we design an effective algorithm\nto automatically compute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the invitation\ncrowdsourcing contest and further adapt it to a large graph dataset. Both\ntheoretical and empirical results show that the new invitation crowdsourcing\ncontests can substantially enlarge the number of participants, whereby the\nprincipal can obtain significantly better solutions without a large\nadvertisement expenditure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 09:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 12:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Furthermore, ambitious decarbonization\nplans may cause power to replace fossil fuels for heating in the Nordic region,\nat the same time as large wind power expansions are expected, resulting in even\ngreater exposure to weather risk. In this study, we quantify the increase in\nweather risk resulting from replacing fossil fuels with power for heating in\nthe Nordic region, at the same time as variable renewable generation expands.\nFirst, we calibrate statistical weather-driven power consumption models for\neach of the countries Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Then, we modify the\nweather sensitivity of the models to simulate different levels of heating\nelectrification, and use 300 simulated weather years to investigate how\ndiffering weather conditions impact power consumption at each electrification\nlevel. The results show that full replacement of fossil fuels by power for\nheating in 2040 leads to an increase in annual consumption of 155 TWh (30%)\ncompared to a business-as-usual scenario during an average weather year, but a\n178 TWh (34%) increase during a one-in-twenty weather year. However, the\nincrease in the peak consumption is greater: around 50% for a normal weather\nyear, and 70% for a one-in-twenty weather year. Furthermore, wind and solar\ngeneration contribute little during the consumption peaks. The increased\nweather sensitivity caused by heating electrification causes greater total\nload, but also causes a significant increase in inter-annual, seasonal, and\nintra-seasonal variations. We conclude that heating electrification must be\naccompanied by an increase in power system flexibility to ensure a stable and\nsecure power supply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 09:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

We analyze the SSH\nmodel for a continuous drive protocol using a Floquet perturbation theory which\nprovides analytical insight into the behavior of the correlation functions in\nterms of its Floquet Hamiltonian. This is supplemented by an exact numerical\nstudy of a similar behavior for the 1D Ising model driven by a square pulse\nprotocol. For both models, we find a crossover timescale $n_c$ which diverges\nat the transition. We also unravel a long-time oscillatory behavior of the\ncorrelators when the critical drive frequency, $\\omega_c$, is approached from\nbelow ($\\omega < \\omega_c$). We tie such behavior to the presence of multiple\nstationary points in the Floquet spectrum of these models and provide an\nanalytic expression for the time period of these oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 10:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

We suggest that flares could be the manifestation of prompt dissipation\nwithin the core of the jet, appearing to a misaligned observer in the X-ray\nband because of less favorable Doppler boosting. These flares appear during the\nafterglow phase because of core--observer light travel delays. In this picture,\nthe prompt emission recorded by this observer comes from material along their\nline of sight, in the lateral structure of the jet, outside the jet's core. We\nstart by laying down the basic analytical framework to determine the flares\ncharacteristics as a function of those of the gamma-ray pulse an aligned\nobserver would see. We show that there is viable parameter space to explain\nflares with typical observing times and luminosities. We then analytically\nexplore this model, showing that it naturally produces flares with small aspect\nratios, as observed. We perform fits of our model to two $Swift$/XRT flares\nrepresenting two different types of morphology, to show that our model can\ncapture both. The ejection time of the core jet material responsible of the\nflare is a critical parameter. While it always remains small compared to the\nobserved time of the flare, confirming that our model does not require very\nlate central engine activity, late ejection times are strongly favored,\nsometimes larger than the observed duration of the parent gamma-ray burst's\nprompt emission as measured by $T_{90}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 10:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 14:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Instead, these devices share\ngradients, parameters, or other model updates, with a central party (e.g., a\ncompany) coordinating the training. Because data never \"leaves\" personal\ndevices, FL is often presented as privacy-preserving. Yet, recently it was\nshown that this protection is but a thin facade, as even a passive,\nhonest-but-curious attacker observing gradients can reconstruct data of\nindividual users contributing to the protocol. In this work, we show a novel\ndata reconstruction attack which allows an active and dishonest central party\nto efficiently extract user data from the received gradients. While prior work\non data reconstruction in FL relies on solving computationally expensive\noptimization problems or on making easily detectable modifications to the\nshared model's architecture or parameters, in our attack the central party\nmakes inconspicuous changes to the shared model's weights before sending them\nout to the users. We call the modified weights of our attack trap weights. Our\nactive attacker is able to recover user data perfectly, i.e., with zero error,\neven when this data stems from the same class.

However, related\nworks typically sample train and test data from the same distribution ignoring\nthe presence of domain shift between data of different PV plants. Instead, we\nframe fault detection as more realistic unsupervised domain adaptation problem\nwhere we train on labelled data of one source PV plant and make predictions on\nanother target plant. We train a ResNet-34 convolutional neural network with a\nsupervised contrastive loss, on top of which we employ a k-nearest neighbor\nclassifier to detect anomalies. Our method achieves a satisfactory area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 73.3 % to 96.6 % on nine\ncombinations of four source and target datasets with 2.92 million IR images of\nwhich 8.5 % are anomalous.

Possible uses are in automatic PV plant inspection systems or to\nstreamline manual labelling of IR datasets by filtering out normal images.\nFurthermore, our work serves the community with a more realistic view on PV\nmodule fault detection using unsupervised domain adaptation to develop more\nperformant methods with favorable generalization capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 10:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The\nmain idea is to approximate the influential ability (influentiality) of a node\nwith the reachability of other nodes from that node in a set of random\nsub-graphs. To this end, several random sub-graphs are sampled from the\noriginal network and then a hyper-graph is created in which each sub-graph is\nrepresented with a hyper-edge. From a theoretical standpoint, one can argue\nthat a factor of the degree of nodes in the hyper-graph approximates\ninfluentiality.

In DANets, a special shortcut path is introduced to fetch\ninformation from raw tabular features, assisting feature interactions across\ndifferent levels. Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world tabular\ndatasets show that our AbstLay and DANets are effective for tabular data\nclassification and regression, and the computational complexity is superior to\ncompetitive methods.

In this paper, we proposed an adaptive\nship detector using full-polarization SAR images. First, by thoroughly\ninvestigating the scattering characteristics between ships and their\nbackground, and the wave polarization anisotropy, a novel ship detector is\nproposed by jointing the two characteristics, named Scattering-Anisotropy joint\n(joint-SA). Based on the theoretical analysis, we showed that the joint-SA is\nan effective physical quantity to show the difference between the ship and its\nbackground, and thus joint-SA can be used for ship detection of\nfull-polarization image data. Second, the generalized Gamma distribution was\nused to characterize the joint-SA statistics of sea clutter with a large range\nof homogeneity. As a result, an adaptive constant false alarm rate (CFAR)\nmethod was implemented based on the joint-SA. Finally, RADARSAT-2 and GF-3 data\nin C-band and ALOS data in L-band are used for verification. We tested on five\ndatasets, and the experimental results verify the correctness and superiority\nof the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method based on the joint-SA.

However, there is a\nmisconception that eccentric discs have higher surface densities at apocentre\nand thus necessarily exhibit apocentre glow at long wavelengths. This arises\nfrom the expectation that the slower velocities at apocentre lead to a \"pile\nup'\" of dust, which fails to account for the greater area over which dust is\nspread at apocentre. Instead we show with theory and by modelling three\ndifferent regimes that the morphology and surface brightness distributions of\nface-on debris discs are strongly dependent on their eccentricity profile (i.e.\nwhether this is constant, rising or falling with distance). We demonstrate that\nat shorter wavelengths the classical pericentre glow effect remains true,\nwhereas at longer wavelengths discs can either demonstrate apocentre glow or\npericentre glow. We additionally show that at long wavelengths the same disc\nmorphology can produce either apocentre glow or pericentre glow depending on\nthe observational resolution. Finally, we show that the classical approach of\ninterpreting eccentric debris discs using line densities is only valid under an\nextremely limited set of circumstances, which are unlikely to be met as debris\ndisc observations become increasingly better resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 12:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Recent studies,\nhowever, suggest that rules simpler than local averaging may be at play in real\norganisms; for example, fish stochastically align towards only one randomly\nchosen neighbour and yet the schools are highly polarised. Here, we ask -- how\ndo organisms maintain group cohesion? Using a spatially-explicit model,\ninspired from empirical investigations, we show that group cohesion can be\nachieved even when organisms randomly choose only one neighbour to interact\nwith. Cohesion is maintained even in the absence of local averaging that\nrequires interactions with many neighbours. Furthermore, we show that choosing\na neighbour randomly is a better way to achieve cohesion than interacting with\njust its closest neighbour. To understand how cohesion emerges from these\nrandom pairwise interactions, we turn to a graph-theoretic analysis of the\nunderlying dynamic interaction networks. We find that randomness in choosing a\nneighbour gives rise to well-connected networks that essentially cause the\ngroups to stay cohesive. We compare our findings with the canonical averaging\nmodels (analogous to the Vicsek model). In summary, we argue that randomness in\nthe choice of interacting neighbours plays a crucial role in collective motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 12:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

It is found that the spectral distributions of production and\npressure-strain are not profoundly affected by an increase of the velocity\ndefect, although the energy spectra drastically change in the inner layer of\nthe large defect APG TBL. In the latter, the signature of the inner layer\nstreaks is absent from the energy spectra.

Here we provide new constraints on neutrino masses using the recent and\ncomplementary CMB measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR4 and the\nSouth Polar Telescope SPT-3G experiments.

Although there have been some\ninteresting interpretation methods for vision-based RL, most of them cannot\nuncover temporal causal information, raising questions about their reliability.\nTo address this problem, we present a temporal-spatial causal interpretation\n(TSCI) model to understand the agent's long-term behavior, which is essential\nfor sequential decision-making.

Our\nexperiments on a range of standard benchmarks and three new challenging dynamic\nreinforcement learning environments show that our method is capable of\nsample-efficient learning where an existing state-of-the-art subgoal-based HRL\nmethod fails to learn stable solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 15:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

To solve the issue, the \"correction\n- prediction\" strategy is usually employed. In the method, one parameter is\nfixed and other parameters are revised by inverting spacecraft orbit data.\nHowever, based on a single spacecraft data, the strategy usually performs\npoorly as parameters in drag force calculation are coupled with each other,\nwhich result in convoluted errors. A gravity field recovery and atmospheric\ndensity detection satellite, Q-Sat, developed by xxxxx Lab at xxx University,\nis launched on August 6th, 2020. The satellite is designed to be spherical for\na constant drag coefficient regardless of its attitude. An orbit prediction\nmethod for low-earth orbit spacecraft with employment of Q-Sat data is proposed\nin present paper for decoupling atmospheric density and drag coefficient\nidentification. For the first step, by using a dynamic approach-based\ninversion, several empirical atmospheric density models are revised based on\nQ-Sat orbit data. Depending on the performs, one of the revised atmospheric\ndensity model would be selected for the next step in which the same inversion\nis employed for drag coefficient identification for a low-earth orbit operating\nspacecraft whose orbit needs to be predicted. Finally, orbit prediction is\nconducted by extrapolation with the dynamic parameters in the previous steps.\nTests are carried out with the proposed method by using a GOCE satellite 15-day\ncontinuous orbit data. Compared with legacy \"correction - prediction\" method in\nwhich only GOCE data is employed, the accuracy of the 24-hour orbit prediction\nis improved by about 171m the highest for the proposed method. 14-day averaged\n24-hour prediction precision is elevated by approximately 70m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 15:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Two numerical examples are\nimplemented to test the computational performances of the presented method.\nDetailed error analysis finds the two sources of the calculation error, roughly\nstudies the convergence order thus find that the low-order error of GFDM makes\nthe convergence order of GFDM lower than that of FDM when node spacing is\nsmall, and points out the significant effect of the symmetry or uniformity of\nthe node collocation in the node influence domain on the accuracy of\ngeneralized difference operators, and the radius of the node influence domain\nshould be small to achieve high calculation accuracy, which is a significant\ndifference between the studied hyperbolic two-phase porous flow problem and the\nelliptic problems when GFDM is applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 15:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 15:29:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 16:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 06:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 08:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

In the proposed approach, bi-directional long short-term\nmemory (BiLSTM) based autoencoder is used and finds the anomalous data point.\nIt calculates the reconstruction error through autoencoder with the\nnon-anomalous data, and the outliers to be classified as anomalies are\nseparated from the non-anomalous data by predefined threshold. Anomaly\ndetection method based on the BiLSTM autoencoder is tested with the metering\ndata corresponding to 4 types of energy sources electricity/water/heating/hot\nwater collected from 985 households.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 12:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

However, to overcome a few numerical difficulties, extra physical\napproximations are often employed to ease the evaluation.\n  In this work, a new numerical method, called convolutional discrete Fourier\ntransform, is proposed to perform Fourier transform of $\\exp[-f(t)]$. We have\napplied this method to compute the differential cross sections of light water\nup to 10eV. The obtained results, thoroughly benchmarked against experimental\ndata, showed a much higher dynamic range than conventional fast Fourier\ntransform. The calculated integral cross sections agree closely with the light\nwater data in the state-of-the-art nuclear data library. It is in evidence that\nthis numerical method can be used in the place of the extra physical\napproximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 08:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Although social network data has numerous semantic\nadulterations, and is not intended to be a source of geo-spatial information,\nin the text of posts we find pieces of important information about how people\nrelate to their environment, which can be used to identify interesting aspects\nof how human beings interact with portions of land based on their activities.\nThis research proposes a methodology for the identification of land uses using\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) from the contents of the popular social\nnetwork Twitter. It will be approached by identifying keywords with linguistic\npatterns from the text, and the geographical coordinates associated with the\npublication. Context-specific innovations are introduced to deal with data\nacross South America and, in particular, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. The\nobjective is to identify the five main land uses: residential, commercial,\ninstitutional-governmental, industrial-offices and unbuilt land. Within the\nframework of urban planning and sustainable urban management, the methodology\ncontributes to the optimization of the identification techniques applied for\nthe updating of land use cadastres, since the results achieved an accuracy of\nabout 90%, which motivates its application in the real context. In addition, it\nwould allow the identification of land use categories at a more detailed level,\nin situations such as a complex/mixed distribution building based on the amount\nof data collected. Finally, the methodology makes land use information\navailable in a more up-to-date fashion and, above all, avoids the high economic\ncost of the non-automatic production of land use maps for cities, mostly in\ndeveloping countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 22:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Aside from crafting questions itself, putting together\nrelevant problems to form a question sheet is also a time-consuming process. In\nthis work, we present a generic formulation of question assembly and a genetic\nalgorithm based method that can generate assessment tests from raw\nproblem-solving history. First, we estimate the learner-question knowledge\nmatrix (snapshot). Each matrix element stands for the probability that a\nlearner correctly answers a specific question. We formulate the task as a\ncombinatorial search over this snapshot. To ensure representative and\ndiscriminative diagnostic tests, questions are selected (1) that has a low root\nmean squared error against the whole question pool and (2) high standard\ndeviation among learner performances. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method outperforms greedy and random baseline by a large margin in one\nprivate dataset and four public datasets. We also performed qualitative\nanalysis on the generated assessment test for 9th graders, which enjoys good\nproblem scatterness across the whole 9th grader curriculum and decent\ndifficulty level distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 06:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

I\nalso argue in favour of the standard view that chances are countably additive.\nSince it is possible to randomly pick out a point on a continuum, for instance\nusing a roulette wheel or by flipping a countable infinity of fair coins, it\nfollows, given the axioms of ZFC, that there are many different cardinalities\nbetween countable infinity and the cardinality of the continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 15:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

From the strongly growing demand, a complete\ndependence on poorly diversified global market, a highly strategic importance\nof a possible domestic source can be derived. In particular, the study compares\nand evaluates different technologies for lithium extraction from thermal waters\nsuch as liquid-liquid extraction, inorganic sorbents, electrochemical methods,\nand membrane technologies in terms of their applicability in geothermal\nsystems.
