The\noptimality gap caused by the availability of limited data is bounded via a\ngeneralization analysis, and the sample complexity is shown to increase as the\ndesignated fraction of worst-case clients decreases. Considering this\ntheoretical result, meta-learning is introduced as a means to reduce sample\ncomplexity by leveraging data from previous deployments. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that LDM improves spectral efficiency even for small datasets;\nthat, for sufficiently large datasets, the proposed mirror-descent-based layer\noptimization scheme achieves a CVaR rate close to that achieved when the\ntransmitter knows the fading distribution; and that meta-learning can\nsignificantly reduce data requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 16:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Recently, Chen et al. [Nature Physics 16, 571 (2020)] demonstrated\nthe surprising result of chiral radiation from a linearly-polarized (LP) dipole\nemitter, and argued that this effect is caused by a decoupling with the\nunderlying eigenmodes of a non-Hermitian system, working at an exceptional\npoint (EP). Here we present a quasinormal mode (QNM) approach to model a\nsimilar index-modulated ring resonator working near an EP and show the same\nunusual chiral power flow properties from LP emitters, in direct agreement with\nthe experimental results. We explain these results quantitatively without\ninvoking the interpretation of a missing dimension (the Jordan vector) and a\ndecoupling from the cavity eigenmodes, since the correct eigenmodes are the\nQNMs which explain the chiral emission using only two cavity modes. By coupling\na LP emitter with the dominant two QNMs of the ring resonator, we show how the\nchiral emission depend on the position and orientation of the emitter, which is\nalso verified by the excellent agreement with respect to the power flow between\nthe QNM theory and full numerical dipole solutions. We also show how a normal\nmode solution will fail to capture the correct chirality since it does not take\ninto account the essential QNM phase. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can\nachieve frequency-dependent chiral emission, and replace lossy materials with\ngain materials in the index modulation to reverse the chirality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 16:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze\nprovide an opportunity for early identification of incidents. However,\ndetecting incidents from crowdsourced data streams is difficult due to the\nchallenges of noise and uncertainty associated with such data. Further, simply\noptimizing over detection accuracy can compromise spatial-temporal localization\nof the inference, thereby making such approaches infeasible for real-world\ndeployment. This paper presents a novel problem formulation and solution\napproach for practitioner-centered incident detection using crowdsourced data\nby using emergency response management as a case-study. The proposed approach\nCROME (Crowdsourced Multi-objective Event Detection) quantifies the\nrelationship between the performance metrics of incident classification (e.g.,\nF1 score) and the requirements of model practitioners (e.g., 1 km. radius for\nincident detection). First, we show how crowdsourced reports, ground-truth\nhistorical data, and other relevant determinants such as traffic and weather\ncan be used together in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for\nearly detection of emergency incidents. Then, we use a Pareto\noptimization-based approach to optimize the output of the CNN in tandem with\npractitioner-centric parameters to balance detection accuracy and\nspatial-temporal localization. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of\nthis approach using crowdsourced data from Waze and traffic accident reports\nfrom Nashville, TN, USA. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms existing approaches in incident detection while simultaneously\noptimizing the needs for real-world deployment and usability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 16:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Yet to date,\nLiNbO3 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have mostly been fabricated using\nnon-standard etching techniques that lack the reproducibility routinely\nachieved in silicon photonics. Widespread future application of thin-film\nLiNbO3 requires a reliable and scalable solution using standard processing and\nprecise lithographic control. Here we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated\nLiNbO3 photonic platform that overcomes the abovementioned challenges by\nemploying wafer-scale bonding of thin-film LiNbO3 to planarized low-loss\nsilicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits, a mature foundry-grade\nintegrated photonic platform. The resulting devices combine the substantial\nPockels effect of LiNbO3 with the scalability, high-yield, and complexity of\nthe underlying Si3N4 PICs. Importantly, the platform maintains the low\npropagation loss (<0.1 dB/cm) and efficient fiber-to-chip coupling (<2.5 dB per\nfacet) of the Si3N4 waveguides. We find that ten transitions between a mode\nconfined in the Si3N4 PIC and the hybrid LiNbO$_3$ mode produce less than 0.8\ndB additional loss, corresponding to a loss per transition not exceeding 0.1\ndB. These nearly lossless adiabatic transitions thus link the low-loss passive\nSi3N4 photonic structures with electro-optic components. We demonstrate high-Q\nmicroresonators, optical splitters, electrically tunable photonic dimers,\nelectro-optic frequency combs, and carrier-envelope phase detection of a\nfemtosecond laser on the same platform, thus providing a reliable and\nfoundry-ready solution to low-loss and complex LiNbO3 integrated photonic\ncircuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 17:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 13:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

In\nprior work of Li et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 126, issue 12, 2021, 124502),\nwe found that for drops of low viscosity, an oscillatory instability of the\nMarangoni flow is triggered once the Marangoni advection is too strong for\ndiffusion to restore the stratified concentration field around the drop. Here\nwe experimentally explore the parameter space of the concentration gradient and\ndrop radius for large oil viscosities and find a different and new mechanism\nfor triggering the oscillatory instability in which diffusion is no longer the\nlimiting factor. For such drops of higher viscosities, the instability is\ntriggered when the gravitational effect is too strong so that the viscous\nstress cannot maintain a stable Marangoni flow. This leads to a critical drop\nradius above which the equilibrium is always unstable. Subsequently, a unifying\nscaling theory that includes both the mechanisms for low and for high\nviscosities of the oil drops is developed. The transition between the two\nmechanisms is found to be controlled by two length scales: The drop radius $R$\nand the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ of the Marangoni flow around the\ndrop. The instability is dominated by diffusion for $\\delta<R$ and by viscosity\nfor $R<\\delta$. The experimental results for various drops of different\nviscosities can well be described with this unifying scaling theory. Our\ntheoretical description thus provides a unifying view of physicochemical\nhydrodynamic problems in which the Marangoni stress is competing with a stable\nstratification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 17:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Using representational\nsimilarity analysis, we find that the network trained with reinforcement\nlearning differs most from the other networks. Using metrics inspired by the\nneuroscience literature, we find that the model trained with reinforcement\nlearning has a sparse and high-dimensional representation wherein individual\nimages are represented with very different patterns of neural activity.

Topology\noptimization helps reduce the waste of raw material in the fabrication of 3D\nprinted parts, thus decreasing production costs associated with manufacturing\nlighter structures. Fiber orientation plays an important role in increasing the\nstiffness of a structure. This paper develops and tests a new method for\nhandling stress constraints in topology and fiber orientation optimization of\n3D printed orthotropic structures. The stress constraints are coupled with an\nobjective function that maximizes stiffness. This is accomplished by using the\nmodified solid isotropic material with penalization method with the method of\nmoving asymptotes as the mathematical optimizer. Each element has a fictitious\ndensity and an angle as the main design variables. To reduce the number of\nstress constraints and thus the computational cost, a new clustering strategy\nis employed in which the highest stresses in the principal material coordinates\nare grouped separately into two clusters using an adjusted $P$-norm. A detailed\ndescription of the formulation and sensitivity analysis is discussed. While we\npresent an analysis of 2D structures in the numerical examples section, the\nmethod can also be used for 3D structures, as the formulation is generic. Our\nresults show that this method can produce efficient structures suitable for 3D\nprinting while thresholding the stresses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 17:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

One promising strategy to obtain\nthe desired transport properties is to engineer particular spectral structures.\nIn this work we are interested in quasiperiodic disorder - incommensurate with\nthe underlying periodicity of the lattice - which induces fractality in the\nenergy spectrum. A well known example is the Fibonacci model which, despite\nbeing non-interacting, yields anomalous diffusion with a continuously varying\ndynamical exponent smoothly crossing over from superdiffusive to subdiffusive\nregime as a function of potential strength. We study the finite-temperature\nelectric and heat transport of this model in linear response in the absence and\nin the presence of dephasing noise due to inelastic scattering. The dephasing\ncauses both thermal and electric transport to become diffusive, thereby making\nthermal and electrical conductivities finite in the thermodynamic limit. Thus,\nin the subdiffusive regime it leads to enhancement of transport. We find that\nthe thermal and electric conductivities have multiple peaks as a function of\ndephasing strength. Remarkably, we observe that the thermal and electrical\nconductivities are not proportional to each other, a clear violation of\nWiedemann-Franz law, and the position of their maxima can differ. We argue that\nthis feature can be utilized to enhance performance of quantum thermal\nmachines.

Four degradation mechanisms are coupled in PyBaMM, an open\nsource modelling environment uniquely developed to allow new physics to be\nimplemented and explored quickly and easily. Crucially it is possible to see\n'inside' the model and observe the consequences of the different patterns of\ndegradation, such as loss of lithium inventory and loss of active material. For\nthe same cell, five different pathways that can result in end-of-life have\nalready been found, depending on how the cell is used. Such information would\nenable a product designer to either extend life or predict life based upon the\nusage pattern. However, parameterization of the degradation models remains as a\nmajor challenge, and requires the attention of the international battery\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 17:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 13:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Our goal is to construct the best\npossible sample of stars with which we can advance our understanding of the\nSgr-MW interaction, focusing on the characterisation of the bifurcations. We\nimprove on previous methods based on the use of the wavelet transform to\nsystematically search for the kinematic signature of the Sgr stream in the Gaia\ndata.

We present\nthe detailed proper motion distribution of the trailing arm as a function of\nLambda showing the presence of a sharp edge (on the side of the small proper\nmotions) beyond which there are no Sgr stars. We also characterise the\ncorrelation between kinematics and distance. The chemical analysis of our\nsample shows a significant difference between the faint and bright branches. We\nprovide analytical descriptions for the proper motion trends as well as for the\nsky distribution of the four branches of the stream. We interpret the\nbifurcations as the misaligned overlap of the material stripped at the\nantepenultimate pericentre (faint branches) with the stars ejected at the\npenultimate pericentre (bright branch). The source of this misalignment is\nstill unknown but we argue that models with some internal rotation in the\nprogenitor, at least during the time of stripping of the stars in the faint\nbranches, are worth exploring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

However, in a wide range of applications, such as communication over\nmillimeter wave and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the\nuse of high resolution ADCs is not feasible due to power budget limitations. In\nthe conventional fully digital receiver design, where each receiver antenna is\nconnected to a distinct ADC, reducing the ADC resolution leads to performance\nloss in terms of achievable rates. One proposed method to mitigate the\nrate-loss is to use analog linear combiners leading to design of hybrid\nreceivers.

We consider a network of agents that\nmust solve an online optimization problem from continual observation of\nstreaming data. The agents implement a distributed cooperative strategy where\neach agent is allowed to perform local exchange of information with its\nneighbors. In order to cope with communication constraints, the exchanged\ninformation must be unavoidably compressed. We propose a diffusion strategy\nnicknamed as ACTC (Adapt-Compress-Then-Combine), which relies on the following\nsteps: i) an adaptation step where each agent performs an individual\nstochastic-gradient update with constant step-size; ii) a compression step that\nleverages a recently introduced class of stochastic compression operators; and\niii) a combination step where each agent combines the compressed updates\nreceived from its neighbors. The distinguishing elements of this work are as\nfollows. First, we focus on adaptive strategies, where constant (as opposed to\ndiminishing) step-sizes are critical to respond in real time to nonstationary\nvariations. Second, we consider the general class of directed graphs and\nleft-stochastic combination policies, which allow us to enhance the interplay\nbetween topology and learning. Third, in contrast with related works that\nassume strong convexity for all individual agents' cost functions, we require\nstrong convexity only at a network level, a condition satisfied even if a\nsingle agent has a strongly-convex cost and the remaining agents have\nnon-convex costs. Fourth, we focus on a diffusion (as opposed to consensus)\nstrategy.

In the ISM, for CRs with energies\n~MeV-TeV, these fluctuations are usually attributed either to 'extrinsic\nturbulence' (ET) - a cascade from larger scales - or 'self-confinement' (SC) -\nself-generated fluctuations from CR streaming. Using simple analytic arguments\nand detailed live numerical CR transport calculations in galaxy simulations, we\nshow that both of these, in standard form, cannot explain even basic\nqualitative features of observed CR spectra. For ET, any spectrum that obeys\ncritical balance or features realistic anisotropy, or any spectrum that\naccounts for finite damping below the dissipation scale, predicts qualitatively\nincorrect spectral shapes and scalings of B/C and other species. Even if\nsomehow one ignored both anisotropy and damping, observationally-required\nscattering rates disagree with ET predictions by orders-of-magnitude. For SC,\nthe dependence of driving on CR energy density means that it is nearly\nimpossible to recover observed CR spectral shapes and scalings, and again there\nis an orders-of-magnitude normalization problem.

However, these algorithms been shown to be\ninefficient when sampling from posterior distributions that are\nhigh-dimensional or exhibit multi-modality and/or strong parameter\ncorrelations. In such contexts, the sequential Monte Carlo technique of\ntransitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) provides a more efficient\nalternative. Despite the recent applicability for Bayesian updating and model\nselection across a variety of disciplines, TMCMC may require a prohibitive\nnumber of tempering stages when the prior PDF is significantly different from\nthe target posterior. Furthermore, the need to start with an initial set of\nsamples from the prior distribution may present a challenge when dealing with\nimplicit priors, e.g. based on feasible regions. Finally, TMCMC can not be used\nfor inverse problems with improper prior PDFs that represent lack of prior\nknowledge on all or a subset of parameters. In this investigation, a\ngeneralization of TMCMC that alleviates such challenges and limitations is\nproposed, resulting in a tempering sampling strategy of enhanced robustness and\ncomputational efficiency. Convergence analysis of the proposed sequential Monte\nCarlo algorithm is presented, proving that the distance between the\nintermediate distributions and the target posterior distribution monotonically\ndecreases as the algorithm proceeds.

We analyzed the band-gap evolution as function of the deformation\npercentage, ranging from 1% to 8%. Results show that the system behaves as a\ndirect band-gap semiconductor, with the valence band maximum and conduction\nband minimum located at the K point (1/3, 1/3, 0) of the Brillouin zone. This\nbehavior is unchanged despite the strain application. The band gap\nunderestimation, as computed within the standard DFT, was corrected by applying\nthe G0W0 approach. Trends in the band-gap behavior are the same within both\napproaches: for low deformation percentages, the band-gap grows linearly with a\nsmall slope, and at higher values, it grows very slow with a tendency to\nachieve saturation. Therefore, the band-gap is less sensitive to tensile strain\nfor deformations near 8%. The origin of this band gap behavior is explained in\nterms of the projected density of states and charge densities, and it can be\nattributed to Coulomb interactions, and charge redistributions due to the\napplied tensile strain. To study the carrier mobility, we computed the electron\nand hole effective masses, finding high mobility for both carriers. Finally,\nthe stability analysis of each strained system includes the calculation of\nphonon spectra, to assure the dynamical stability, the computation of elastic\nconstants to evaluate the mechanical stability, and cohesive energies for\nexploring the thermodynamical stability.

To address this issue, we propose the Sphere Face Model(SFM), a\nnovel 3DMM for monocular face reconstruction, which can preserve both shape\nfidelity and identity consistency. The core of our SFM is the basis matrix\nwhich can be used to reconstruct 3D face shapes, and the basic matrix is\nlearned by adopting a two-stage training approach where 3D and 2D training data\nare used in the first and second stages, respectively. To resolve the\ndistribution mismatch, we design a novel loss to make the shape parameters have\na hyperspherical latent space.

Further,\nexisting manual or heuristic-based approaches for patch identification are\neither too expensive or too specific to be applied to all OSS vulnerabilities.\nTo address these problems, we first conduct an empirical study to understand\nthe quality and characteristics of patches for OSS vulnerabilities in two\nstate-of-the-art vulnerability databases.

It is at the cutting edge of dynamic game\ntheory and can be applied in many real-world scenarios, such as eBay auction,\nstock market, election, online games, crowdsourcing, etc. In this work, we\nnovelly identify a class of strategies for revision games which are called\nLimited Retaliation strategies. An limited retaliation strategy stipulates\nthat, (1) players first follow a recommended cooperative plan; (2) if anyone\ndeviates from the plan, the limited retaliation player retaliates by using the\ndefection action for a limited duration; (3) after the retaliation, the limited\nretaliation player returns to the cooperative plan. A limited retaliation\nstrategy has three key features. It is cooperative, sustaining a high level of\nsocial welfare. It is vengeful, deterring the opponent from betrayal by\nthreatening with a future retaliation. It is yet forgiving, since it resumes\ncooperation after a proper retaliation. The cooperativeness and vengefulness\nmake it constitute cooperative subgame perfect equilibrium, while the\nforgiveness makes it tolerate occasional mistakes. limited retaliation\nstrategies show significant advantages over Grim Trigger, which is currently\nthe only known strategy for revision games. Besides its contribution as a new\nrobust and welfare-optimizing equilibrium strategy, our results about limited\nretaliation strategy can also be used to explain how easy cooperation can\nhappen, and why forgiveness emerges in real-world multi-agent interactions.

Our approach makes one party\nobfuscate the channel to allow the legitimate party to obtain similar dynamic\nchannel parameters yet prevents a third party from inferring the obfuscation\ninformation. Our approach allows more random bits to be extracted from the\nobfuscated channel parameters by a joint design of the K-L transform and\nadaptive quantization. A testbed implementation shows that our approach,\ncompared to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in generating\nhigh entropy bits at a fast rate and a high-security level in slowly varying\nenvironments.

The\nrecent self-supervised learning (SSL) on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model,\nPT-GNN, pre-trains the GNN model to reconstruct the cold-start embeddings and\nhas shown great potential for cold-start recommendation. However, due to the\nover-smoothing problem, PT-GNN can only capture up to 3-order relation, which\ncan not provide much useful auxiliary information to depict the target\ncold-start user or item.

Moreover, unnecessary\ntask migrations can stress the system network, giving rise to the need for a\nsmart and parsimonious failure recovery scheme. Prior approaches often fail to\nadapt to highly volatile workloads or accurately detect and diagnose faults for\noptimal remediation. There is thus a need for a robust and proactive\nfault-tolerance mechanism to meet service level objectives. In this work, we\npropose PreGAN, a composite AI model using a Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) to predict preemptive migration decisions for proactive fault-tolerance\nin containerized edge deployments. PreGAN uses co-simulations in tandem with a\nGAN to learn a few-shot anomaly classifier and proactively predict migration\ndecisions for reliable computing. Extensive experiments on a Raspberry-Pi based\nedge environment show that PreGAN can outperform state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods in fault-detection, diagnosis and classification, thus achieving high\nquality of service.

Compared with conventional 3D morphable models\n(3DMM), MoFaNeRF shows superiority in directly synthesizing photo-realistic\nfacial details even for eyes, mouths, and beards. Also, continuous face\nmorphing can be easily achieved by interpolating the input shape, expression\nand appearance codes. By introducing identity-specific modulation and texture\nencoder, our model synthesizes accurate photometric details and shows strong\nrepresentation ability. Our model shows strong ability on multiple applications\nincluding image-based fitting, random generation, face rigging, face editing,\nand novel view synthesis. Experiments show that our method achieves higher\nrepresentation ability than previous parametric models, and achieves\ncompetitive performance in several applications. To the best of our knowledge,\nour work is the first facial parametric model built upon a neural radiance\nfield that can be used in fitting, generation and manipulation.

Electron-injection to TMDs has been proved to be a feasible way to\ndrive structural phase transition from the semiconducting H-phase to the\nsemimetal dT-phase. In this contribution, based on density-functional theory\n(DFT) calculations, firstly we demonstrate that hole-injection drives the\ntransition of the H-phase more efficiently to the metallic T-phase than to the\nsemimetallic dT-phase for group VI-B TMDs (MoS2, WS2, and MoSe2, etc.). The\norigin can be attributed to the smaller work function of the T-phase than that\nof the dT-phase. Our work function analysis can distinguish the T and dT phases\nquantitatively while it is challenging for the commonly used crystal field\nsplitting analysis. In addition, our analysis provides a unified understanding\nfor both hole- and electron-injection induced phase transitions for 2D\nmaterials beyond TMDs, such as the newly synthesized MoSi2N4 family. Moreover,\nthe hole-driven T-phase transition mechanism can explain the recent experiment\nof WS2 phase transition by hole-doping with yttrium (Y) atoms. Using 1/3\nY-doped WS2 and MoSe2 as examples, we show that the Mo and W valency increases\nto 5+.

The considered class of functions is very attractive\nfor at least two reasons. First, the classical NP-hardness issue associated\nwith sum-utility maximization is circumvented. Second, the considered class of\nfunctions encompasses well-known performance metrics used to analyze the\nproblems of pricing and energy-efficiency.

Recent deep learning-based MVS\nmethods typically densely sample depth hypotheses in the depth range, and then\nconstruct prohibitively memory-consuming 3D cost volumes for depth prediction.\nAlthough coarse-to-fine sampling strategies alleviate this overhead issue to a\ncertain extent, the efficiency of MVS is still an open challenge. In this work,\nwe propose a novel method for highly efficient MVS that remarkably decreases\nthe memory footprint, meanwhile clearly advancing state-of-the-art depth\nprediction performance. We investigate what a search strategy can be reasonably\noptimal for MVS taking into account of both efficiency and effectiveness. We\nfirst formulate MVS as a binary search problem, and accordingly propose a\ngeneralized binary search network for MVS. Specifically, in each step, the\ndepth range is split into 2 bins with extra 1 error tolerance bin on both\nsides. A classification is performed to identify which bin contains the true\ndepth. We also design three mechanisms to respectively handle classification\nerrors, deal with out-of-range samples and decrease the training memory. The\nnew formulation makes our method only sample a very small number of depth\nhypotheses in each step, which is highly memory efficient, and also greatly\nfacilitates quick training convergence. Experiments on competitive benchmarks\nshow that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much less memory.\nParticularly, our method obtains an overall score of 0.289 on DTU dataset and\ntops the first place on challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset among\nall the learning-based methods.

This is attributed to the\nfact that the learning capacity of a neural network will be reduced as it keeps\nmemorizing historical knowledge, and the fact that conceptual confusion may\noccur as it transfers irrelevant old knowledge to the current task.

A transfer cell is designed to connect\nthese two memory networks, enabling knowledge transfer from the long-term\nmemory network to the short-term memory network to mitigate the conceptual\nconfusion, and a memory consolidation mechanism is developed to integrate\nshort-term knowledge into the long-term memory network for knowledge\naccumulation.

In\nthis paper, we propose the learned optimization of such LUT-based topologies,\nresulting in higher-efficiency designs than via the direct use of\noff-the-shelf, hand-designed networks.

Furthermore, prior works\nsee LUT inputs connected randomly, which does not guarantee a good choice of\nnetwork topology. To address these issues, we propose logic shrinkage, a\nfine-grained netlist pruning methodology enabling K to be automatically learned\nfor every LUT in a neural network targeted for FPGA inference. By removing LUT\ninputs determined to be of low importance, our method increases the efficiency\nof the resultant accelerators.

In this paper, we propose Label Hierarchy Transition, a unified\nprobabilistic framework based on deep learning, to address hierarchical\nclassification.

We further propose a\nconfusion loss, which encourages the classification network to learn the\ncorrelation across different label hierarchies during training.

Crucially, TTA assumes no access to the source data or even\nany additional labeled/unlabeled samples from the target distribution to\nfinetune the source model. In this work, we consider TTA in a more pragmatic\nsetting which we refer to as SITA (Single Image Test-time Adaptation). Here,\nwhen making a prediction, the model has access only to the given single test\ninstance, rather than a batch of instances, as typically been considered in the\nliterature.

Such issues might be addressed by training\ndeep learning (DL) models to learn and predict blood flow characteristics using\na dataset generated by CFD simulations of simplified double stenosed artery\nmodels with different configurations. When blood flow patterns are compared\nthrough an actual double stenosed artery model, derived from IVUS imaging, it\nis revealed that the sinusoidal approximation of stenosed neck geometry, which\nhas been widely used in previous research works, fails to effectively represent\nthe effects of a real constriction. As a result, a novel geometric\nrepresentation of the constricted neck is proposed which, in terms of a\ngeneralized simplified model, outperforms the former assumption. The sequential\nchange in artery lumen diameter and flow parameters along the length of the\nvessel presented opportunities for the use of LSTM and GRU DL models.

LSTM, on the other hand, performs better for predicting flow\nproperties with large fluctuations, such as varying blood pressure over the\nlength of the vessels. Despite having good overall accuracies in training and\ntesting across all the properties for the vessels in the dataset, the GRU model\nunderperforms for an individual vessel flow prediction in all cases. The\nresults also point to the need of individually optimized hyperparameters for\neach property in any model rather than aiming to achieve overall good\nperformance across all outputs with a single set of hyperparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 11:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

The algorithm is inspired by Leptothorax ants and\nmimics the behavior of ants searching for positions to deposit grains while\nbuilding a new nest. Although the algorithm is inspired by the swarming\nbehavior of ants, it does not have any algorithmic similarity with the ant\ncolony optimization (ACO) algorithm. It is worth mentioning that ANA is\nconsidered a continuous algorithm that updates the search agent position by\nadding the rate of change (e.g., step or velocity). ANA computes the rate of\nchange differently as it uses previous, current solutions, fitness values\nduring the optimization process to generate weights by utilizing the\nPythagorean theorem. These weights drive the search agents during the\nexploration and exploitation phases. The ANA algorithm is benchmarked on 26\nwell-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study\nwith genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), dragonfly\nalgorithm (DA), five modified versions of PSO, whale optimization algorithm\n(WOA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and fitness dependent optimizer (FDO). ANA\noutperformances these prominent metaheuristic algorithms on several test cases\nand provides quite competitive results. Finally, the algorithm is employed for\noptimizing two well-known real-world engineering problems: antenna array design\nand frequency-modulated synthesis. The results on the engineering case studies\ndemonstrate the proposed algorithm's capability in optimizing real-world\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 08:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Therefore, the association of\neach measurement to multiple objects is a crucial task to perform in order to\ntrack multiple objects with birth and death. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel Bayesian nonparametric approach that models a scenario where each\nobservation may be drawn from an unknown number of objects for which it\nprovides a tractable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to sample from\nthe posterior distribution. The number of objects at each time step, itself, is\nalso assumed to be unknown. We, then, show through experiments the advantage of\nnonparametric modeling to scenarios with spawning events.
