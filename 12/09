At rest, automatic\ndetection of vital parameters is generally accurate. However, in conditions\nsuch as high-intensity exercise, sudden physiological changes occur to the\nsignals, compromising the robustness of standard algorithms. Methods: Our\nmethod, called BayeSlope, is based on unsupervised learning, Bayesian\nfiltering, and non-linear normalization to enhance and correctly detect the R\npeaks according to their expected positions in the ECG. Furthermore, as\nBayeSlope is computationally heavy and can drain the device battery quickly, we\npropose an online design that adapts its robustness to sudden physiological\nchanges, and its complexity to the heterogeneous resources of modern embedded\nplatforms. This method combines BayeSlope with a lightweight algorithm,\nexecuted in cores with different capabilities, to reduce the energy consumption\nwhile preserving the accuracy. Results: BayeSlope achieves an F1 score of 99.3%\nin experiments during intense cycling exercise with 20 subjects.

Recently,\nstochastic bounded confidence opinion dynamics were proposed as a general\nframework that incorporates both these dynamics as special cases and also\ncaptures the inherent stochasticity and noise (errors) in real-life social\nexchanges. Although these dynamics are quite general and realistic, their\nanalysis is particularly challenging compared to other opinion dynamics models.\nThis is because these dynamics are nonlinear and stochastic, and belong to the\nclass of Markov processes that have asymptotically zero drift and unbounded\njumps.

To resolve this security threat, in this work an opportunistic\nrelaying-based dual-hop wireless multicast framework is proposed in which the\nsource dispatches confidential information to a bunch of receivers via\nintermediate relays under the wiretapping attempts of multiple eavesdroppers.\nTwo scenarios, i.e. non-line of sight (NLOS) and line of sight (LOS)\ncommunications along with the multiplicative and LOS shadowing are considered\nwhere the first scenario assumes eta-mu and eta-mu/inverse Gamma (IG) composite\nfading channels and the latter one follows kappa-mu and kappa-mu/IG composite\nfading channels as the source to relay and relay to receiver's as well as\neavesdropper's links, respectively.

If the voltage $V$ across $N$ is finite, an electron injected into\nthe well undergoes multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) until it gains enough\nenergy to overcome the energy barrier. Because each reflection converts an\nelectron to a hole (or vice versa), while creating (or destroying) a Cooper\npair, the MAR process shuttles a stream of pairs across the junction. An\ninteresting question is, given a finite $V$, what percentage of the shuttled\npairs end up as a Josephson supercurrent? This fraction does not seem to have\nbeen measured. Here we show that, in high-transparency junctions based on the\ntype II Dirac semimetal MoTe$_2$, the MAR leads to a stair-case profile in the\ncurrent-voltage ($I$-$V$) response, corresponding to pairs shuttled\nincoherently by the $n^{th}$-order process.

The\nobserved linear increase in the amplitude of ${\\bf J}_{\\rm s}$ with $n$ (for\nsmall $n$) implies that ${\\bf J}_{\\rm s}$ originates from the population of\npairs that are coherently shuttled.

At large\n$V$, the coherent fraction is initially linear in $n$. However, as $V\\to 0$\n($n\\gg 1$), almost all the pairs end up as the observed Josephson supercurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 16:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

The goal of ATOMIUM is to\nunderstand the dynamics and the gas phase and dust formation chemistry in the\nwinds of evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars.\nA more general aim is to identify chemical processes applicable to other\nastrophysical environments. 17 oxygen-rich AGB and RSG stars spanning a range\nin (circum)stellar parameters and evolutionary phases were observed in a\nhomogeneous observing strategy allowing for an unambiguous comparison. Data\nwere obtained between 213.83 and 269.71 GHz at high (0.025-0.050 arcsec),\nmedium (0.13-0.24 arcsec), and low (about 1 arcsec) angular resolution. The\nsensitivity per 1.3 km/s channel was 1.5-5 mJy/beam. 13 molecules were\ndesignated as primary molecules in the survey: CO, SiO, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2,\nHCN, SO, SO2, SiS, CS, H2O, and NaCl.

Our analysis reveals a strong\ndependence of the hydrodynamics on the swimmer orientation and position. Given\nthe viscosities of the two fluid media, the interface properties and the\nswimmer type, a swimmer can either migrate towards or away from the interface\ndepending on its configurations. When the swimmer is oriented parallel to the\ninterface, a pusher-type swimmer is repelled from the interface at short times\nif it is swimming in the more viscous fluid. At long times however, pushers are\nalways attracted to the interface, and pullers are always repelled from it. On\nthe other hand, swimmers oriented orthogonal to the interface exhibit a\nmigration pattern opposite to the parallel swimmers. In consequence, a host of\ncomplex migration trajectories emerge for swimmers arbitrarily oriented to the\ninterface.

Current direct\nimaging instruments are limited by evolving non-common path aberrations\n(NCPAs). The NCPAs must be compensated for by using the science focal-plane\nimage. A promising sensor is the self-coherent camera (SCC). An SCC modifies\nthe Lyot stop in the coronagraph to introduce a probe electric field. However,\nthe SCC has a weak probe electric field due to the requirements on the pinhole\nseparation. A spectrally modulated self-coherent camera (SM-SCC) is proposed as\na solution to the throughput problem. The SM-SCC uses a pinhole with a spectral\nfilter and a dichroic beam splitter, which creates images with and without the\nprobe electric field. This allows the pinhole to be placed closer to the pupil\nedge and increases the throughput. Combining the SM-SCC with an integral field\nunit (IFU) can be used to apply more complex modulation patterns to the pinhole\nand the Lyot stop. A modulation scheme with at least three spectral channels\n(e.g. IFU) can be used to change the pinhole to an arbitrary aperture with\nhigher throughput. Numerical simulations show that the SM-SCC increases the\npinhole throughput by a factor of 32, which increases the wavefront sensor\nsensitivity by a factor of 5.7.

This property, known as\npiezoresistivity, has been extensively leveraged for conductivity-based damage\ndetection via electrical resistance change methods and tomographic imaging\ntechniques such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Although these\ntechniques are very effective at detecting the presence of damage, they suffer\nfrom an inability to provide precise information about damage shape, size, or\nmechanism. This is particularly detrimental for laminated composites which can\nsuffer from complex failure modes, such as delaminations, that are difficult to\ndetect. To that end, we herein propose a new technique for precisely\ndetermining damage shape and size in self-sensing composites. Our technique\nmakes use of a genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with realistic physics-based\ndamage models to recover precise damage shape from conductivity changes imaged\nvia EIT. We experimentally validate this technique on carbon nanofiber\n(CNF)-modified glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates by considering\ntwo specific damage mechanisms: through-holes and delaminations.

Analytical considerations point to the existence of\nsuch a fixed point in pure SU(2) Yang-Mills fields in 5D. This issue has\nalready been addressed, although inconclusively. We search for this putative\nfixed point using lattice Monte Carlo methods. An extended discussion can be\nfound in [1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 17:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

The mole requiring\nfriction on its hull to balance remaining recoil from its hammer mechanism did\nnot penetrate to the targeted depth. Instead, by precessing about a point\nmidway along its hull, it carved a 7 cm deep and 5-6 cm wide pit and reached a\ndepth of initially 31 cm. The root cause of the failure - as was determined\nthrough an extensive, almost two years long campaign - was a lack of friction\nin an unexpectedly thick cohesive duricrust. During the campaign -- described\nin detail in this paper -- the mole penetrated further aided by friction\napplied using the scoop at the end of the robotic Instrument Deployment Arm and\nby direct support by the latter. The mole finally reached a depth of 40 cm,\nbringing the mole body 1--2 cm below the surface. The penetration record of the\nmole and its thermal sensors were used to measure thermal and mechanical soil\nparameters such as the thermal conductivity and the penetration resistance of\nthe duricrust and its cohesion.

Through extensive experiments on 5 VL tasks\nand 5 robust VQA benchmarks, we find that: (i) Without pre-training, using MLPs\nfor multimodal fusion has a noticeable performance gap compared to\ntransformers; (ii) However, VL pre-training can help close the performance gap;\n(iii) Instead of heavy multi-head attention, adding tiny one-head attention to\nMLPs is sufficient to achieve comparable performance to transformers. Moreover,\nwe also find that the performance gap between MLPs and transformers is not\nwidened when being evaluated on the harder robust VQA benchmarks, suggesting\nusing MLPs for VL fusion can generalize roughly to a similar degree as using\ntransformers. These results hint that MLPs can effectively learn to align\nvision and text features extracted from lower-level encoders without heavy\nreliance on self-attention. Based on this, we ask an even bolder question: can\nwe have an all-MLP architecture for VL modeling, where both VL fusion and the\nvision encoder are replaced with MLPs? Our result shows that an all-MLP VL\nmodel is sub-optimal compared to state-of-the-art full-featured VL models when\nboth of them get pre-trained. However, pre-training an all-MLP can surprisingly\nachieve a better average score than full-featured transformer models without\npre-training. This indicates the potential of large-scale pre-training of\nMLP-like architectures for VL modeling and inspires the future research\ndirection on simplifying well-established VL modeling with less inductive\ndesign bias.

Combining these data with size\nmeasurements from Gaia, we determine the $M/L_{dyn}$ for all 57 luminous GCs.\nWe see a clear bimodality in the $M/L_{dyn}$ distribution, with a population of\nnormal GCs with mean $M/L_{dyn}=1.51\\pm0.31$, and a second population of\n$\\sim$20 GCs with elevated mean $M/L_{dyn}=2.68\\pm0.22$.

In this approach, some\nmodels allow a double-reionization scenario, although the number of confirmed\ndetections at very high $z$ is still too low to serve as observational proof.\nThe main goal of this project is studying whether we can search for\nLyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z \\sim 9$ using a narrow-band (NB) filter\nthat was specifically designed by our team and was built for this experiment.\nWe used the NB technique to select candidates by measuring the flux excess due\nto the Ly$\\alpha$ emission. The observations were taken with an NB filter (full\nwidth at half minimum of 11 nm and central wavelength $\\lambda_{c} = 1.257\n\\mu$m) and the CIRCE near-infrared camera for the GTC.

With any two bands,\nincluding NUV, a sample of early-types with greater than two-thirds purity\ncannot be constructed.

Relative survival analysis\nmay be used to estimate disease-specific survival when cause of death is either\nunknown or subject to misspecification and not reliable for practical usage.\nThis method is popular for population-based cancer survival studies using\nregistry data and does not require CoD information. The standard estimator is\nthe ratio of all-cause survival in the cancer cohort group to the known\nexpected survival from a general reference population. Disease-specific death\ncompetes with other causes of mortality, potentially creating dependence among\nthe CoD. The standard ratio estimate is only valid when death from disease and\ndeath from other causes are independent. To relax the independence assumption,\nwe formulate dependence using a copula-based model. Likelihood-based parametric\nmethod is used to fit the distribution of disease-specific death without CoD\ninformation, where the copula is assumed known and the distribution of other\ncause of mortality is derived from the reference population. We propose a\nsensitivity analysis, where the analysis is conducted across a range of assumed\ndependence structures.

CO adsorption correlates with volume density in cold cores, and, in\nnearby molecular clouds, the catastrophic CO freeze-out happens at volume\ndensities above 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The methanol production rate is maximized\nthere and its freeze-out rate does not overcome its production rate, while the\nmolecules are shielded from UV destruction by gas and dust. Thus, in cold\ncores, methanol abundance should generally correlate with visual extinction\nthat depends both on volume and column density. In this work, we test the most\nbasic model prediction that maximum methanol abundance is associated with a\nlocal $A_V\\simeq$4 mag in dense cores and constrain the model parameters with\nthe observational data.

There are several\ncompelling candidates for dark matter that have wavelike properties, including\naxions and dark photons. Wavelike dark matter can be detected using\nultra-sensitive microwave cavities. The ADMX experiment uses a cylindrical\ncavity operating at the fundamental mode to search for axions in the few\nmicro-eV mass range. However, the ADMX search technique becomes increasingly\nchallenging with increasing axion mass. This is because higher masses require\nsmaller-diameter cavities, and a smaller cavity volume reduces the signal\nstrength. Thus, there is interest in developing more sophisticated resonators\nto overcome this problem. The ADMX-Orpheus experiment uses a dielectric-loaded\nFabry-Perot cavity to search for axions and dark photons with masses\napproaching 100 micro-eV. Orpheus maintains a large volume by operating at a\nhigher-order mode, and the dielectrics shape the electric field so that the\nmode couples more strongly to the axion and dark photon.

For an approach lane at a traffic intersection, the conditional queue\nlengths given probe vehicle location, count, time, and analysis interval (e.g.,\nat the end of red signal phase) are represented by a Negative Hypergeometric\ndistribution. The estimators obtained are compared with parametric methods and\nsimple highway capacity manual methods using field test data involving probe\nvehicles. The analysis indicates that the nonparametric methods presented in\nthis paper match the accuracy of parametric methods used in the field test data\nfor estimating queue lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 19:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Specifically, parts fabricated\nthrough Laser Powder Bed Fusion are prone to defects such as warpage or\ncracking due to high residual stress values generated from the steep thermal\ngradients produced during the build process. Maturing the design for such parts\nand planning their fabrication can span months to years, often involving\nmultiple handoffs between design and manufacturing engineers. PATO is based on\nthe a priori discovery of crack-free designs, so that the optimized part can be\nbuilt defect-free at the outset. To ensure that the design is crack free during\noptimization, producibility is explicitly encoded within the standard\nformulation of TO, using a crack index. Multiple crack indices are explored and\nusing experimental validation, maximum shear strain index (MSSI) is shown to be\nan accurate crack index. Simulating the build process is a coupled,\nmulti-physics computation and incorporating it in the TO loop can be\ncomputationally prohibitive. We leverage the current advances in deep\nconvolutional neural networks and present a high-fidelity surrogate model based\non an Attention-based U-Net architecture to predict the MSSI values as a\nspatially varying field over the part's domain. Further, we employ automatic\ndifferentiation to directly compute the gradient of maximum MSSI with respect\nto the input design variables and augment it with the performance-based\nsensitivity field to optimize the design while considering the trade-off\nbetween weight, manufacturability, and functionality. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method through benchmark studies in 3D as well as\nexperimental validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 19:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Left unmanaged, uncoordinated\ncharging of electric vehicles (EVs) at increased levels of penetration will\namplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid's capacity to\nreliably meet demand. In this paper, we report findings from the OptimizEV\nProject - a real-world pilot study in Upstate New York exploring a novel\napproach to coordinated residential EV charging. The proposed coordination\nmechanism seeks to harness the latent flexibility in EV charging by offering EV\nowners monetary incentives to delay the time required to charge their EVs. Each\ntime an EV owner initiates a charging session, they specify how long they\nintend to leave their vehicle plugged in by selecting from a menu of deadlines\nthat offers lower electricity prices the longer they're willing to delay the\ntime required to charge their EV. Given a collection of active charging\nrequests, a smart charging system dynamically optimizes the power being drawn\nby each EV in real time to minimize strain on the grid, while ensuring that\neach customer's car is fully charged by its deadline. Under the proposed\nincentive mechanism, we find that customers are frequently willing to engage in\noptimized charging sessions, allowing the system to delay the completion of\ntheir charging requests by more than eight hours on average. Using the\nflexibility provided by customers, the smart charging system was shown to be\nhighly effective in shifting the majority of EV charging loads off-peak to fill\nthe night-time valley of the aggregate load curve. Customer opt-in rates\nremained stable over the span of the study, providing empirical evidence in\nsupport of the proposed coordination mechanism as a potentially viable\n\"non-wires alternative\" to meet the increased demand for electricity driven\ngrowing EV adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 20:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 19:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 23:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 21:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) are widely studied to formalize\nthis process. However, available methods in finding optimal DTRs often rely on\nassumptions that are violated in real-world applications (e.g., medical\ndecision-making or public policy), especially when (a) the existence of\nunobserved confounders cannot be ignored, and (b) the unobserved confounders\nare time-varying (e.g., affected by previous actions). When such assumptions\nare violated, one often faces ambiguity regarding the underlying causal model.\nThis ambiguity is inevitable, since the dynamics of unobserved confounders and\ntheir causal impact on the observed part of the data cannot be understood from\nthe observed data. Motivated by a case study of finding superior treatment\nregimes for patients who underwent transplantation in our partner hospital and\nfaced a medical condition known as New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation\n(NODAT), we extend DTRs to a new class termed Ambiguous Dynamic Treatment\nRegimes (ADTRs), in which the causal impact of treatment regimes is evaluated\nbased on a \"cloud\" of causal models. We then connect ADTRs to Ambiguous\nPartially Observable Mark Decision Processes (APOMDPs) and develop\nReinforcement Learning methods, which enable using the observed data to\nefficiently learn an optimal treatment regime. We establish theoretical results\nfor these learning methods, including (weak) consistency and asymptotic\nnormality. We further evaluate the performance of these learning methods both\nin our case study and in simulation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 20:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 19:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 17:49:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 16:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The layer-wise graph\nconvolution in GNNs is shown to be powerful at capturing graph topology. During\nthis process, GNNs are usually guided by pre-defined kernels such as Laplacian\nmatrix, adjacency matrix, or their variants. However, the adoptions of\npre-defined kernels may restrain the generalities to different graphs: mismatch\nbetween graph and kernel would entail sub-optimal performance. For example,\nGNNs that focus on low-frequency information may not achieve satisfactory\nperformance when high-frequency information is significant for the graphs, and\nvice versa. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel framework\n- i.e., namely Adaptive Kernel Graph Neural Network (AKGNN) - which learns to\nadapt to the optimal graph kernel in a unified manner at the first attempt. In\nthe proposed AKGNN, we first design a data-driven graph kernel learning\nmechanism, which adaptively modulates the balance between all-pass and low-pass\nfilters by modifying the maximal eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Through\nthis process, AKGNN learns the optimal threshold between high and low frequency\nsignals to relieve the generality problem.

We choose four\ndistributions to illustrate the method (Gamma law, beta law, Uniform law and\nFisher law) and completely describe the asymptotic laws of the moment\nestimators whenever possible. Simulations studies are performed to investigate\nfor each case the smallest sizes for which the obtained statistical tests are\nrecommendable. Generally, the omnibus chi-square test proposed here work fine\nwith sample sizes around fifty\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 20:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Recent progress in GANs have established them as an excellent choice\nfor such tasks. However, since they do not provide an inference model, image\nediting or downstream tasks such as classification can not be done on real\nimages using the GAN latent space. Despite numerous efforts to train an\ninference model or design an iterative method to invert a pre-trained\ngenerator, previous methods are dataset (e.g. human face images) and\narchitecture (e.g. StyleGAN) specific. These methods are nontrivial to extend\nto novel datasets or architectures. We propose a general framework that is\nagnostic to architecture and datasets.

Most of the existing methods that rely only on a global generator\nusually suffer from changing unwanted attributes along with the target\nattributes. Recently, hierarchical networks that consist of both a global\nnetwork dealing with the whole image and multiple local networks focusing on\nlocal parts are showing success. However, these methods extract local regions\nby bounding boxes centred around the sparse facial key points which are\nnon-differentiable, inaccurate and unrealistic. Hence, the solution becomes\nsub-optimal, introduces unwanted artefacts degrading the overall quality of the\nsynthetic images. Moreover, a recent study has shown strong correlation between\nfacial attributes and local semantic regions. To exploit this relationship, we\ndesigned a unified architecture of semantic segmentation and hierarchical GANs.\nA unique advantage of our framework is that on forward pass the semantic\nsegmentation network conditions the generative model, and on backward pass\ngradients from hierarchical GANs are propagated to the semantic segmentation\nnetwork, which makes our framework an end-to-end differentiable architecture.\nThis allows both architectures to benefit from each other.

These hypotheses are compared, including new\narguments, such as comparisons based on current understanding of Mars,\nEnceladus, and Pluto. An eruption model based on a solar-powered, solid-state\ngreenhouse effect was previously considered the leading hypothesis for Triton's\nplumes, in part due to the proximity of the plumes to the subsolar latitude\nduring the Voyager 2 flyby and the distribution of Triton's fans that are\nputatively deposits from former plumes. The other two eruption hypotheses are\npowered by internal heat, not solar insolation. Based on new analyses of the\nostensible relation between the latitude of the subsolar point on Triton and\nthe geographic locations of the plumes and fans, we argue that neither the\nlocations of the plumes nor fans are strong evidence in favor of the\nsolar-powered hypothesis.

We\nuse graph limits called graphons to define limit objects for graph filters and\nGNNs -- graphon filters and graphon neural networks (WNNs) -- which we\ninterpret as generative models for graph filters and GNNs. We then show that\ngraphon filters and WNNs can be approximated by graph filters and GNNs sampled\nfrom them on weighted and stochastic graphs. Because the error of these\napproximations can be upper bounded, by a triangle inequality argument we can\nfurther bound the error of transferring a graph filter or a GNN across graphs.\nOur results show that (i) the transference error decreases with the graph size,\nand (ii) that graph filters have a transferability-discriminability tradeoff\nthat in GNNs is alleviated by the scattering behavior of the nonlinearity.\nThese findings are demonstrated empirically in a movie recommendation problem\nand in a decentralized control task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 00:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 20:06:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Alternative to existing\nstudies that mainly develop advanced feature or embedding designs to tackle the\ntraining issue, we point out that the Region-of-Interest (RoI) based detection\nrefinement can easily help mitigate the difficulty of training for DETR\nmethods. Based on this, we introduce a novel REcurrent Glimpse-based decOder\n(REGO) in this paper. In particular, the REGO employs a multi-stage recurrent\nprocessing structure to help the attention of DETR gradually focus on\nforeground objects more accurately. In each processing stage, visual features\nare extracted as glimpse features from RoIs with enlarged bounding box areas of\ndetection results from the previous stage. Then, a glimpse-based decoder is\nintroduced to provide refined detection results based on both the glimpse\nfeatures and the attention modeling outputs of the previous stage. In practice,\nREGO can be easily embedded in representative DETR variants while maintaining\ntheir fully end-to-end training and inference pipelines. In particular, REGO\nhelps Deformable DETR achieve 44.8 AP on the MSCOCO dataset with only 36\ntraining epochs, compared with the first DETR and the Deformable DETR that\nrequire 500 and 50 epochs to achieve comparable performance, respectively.\nExperiments also show that REGO consistently boosts the performance of\ndifferent DETR detectors by up to 7% relative gain at the same setting of 50\ntraining epochs.

We analyze this equation at both low and high regularity, and\nare able to establish global well-posedness in $H^s$ when $s\\in [1,4\\sigma)$\nand $\\sigma \\in (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},1)$. Our result when $s=1$ is particularly\nrelevant because it corresponds to the regularity of the energy for this\nproblem.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first low regularity well-posedness result for\na quasilinear dispersive model where the nonlinearity is both rough and lacks\nthe decay necessary for global smoothing type estimates. These two features\npose considerable difficulty when trying to apply standard tools for closing\nlow-regularity estimates. While the tools developed in this article are used to\nstudy gDNLS, we believe that they should be applicable in the study of local\nwell-posedness for other dispersive equations of a similar character. It should\nalso be noted that the high regularity well-posedness presents a novel issue,\nas the roughness of the nonlinearity limits the potential regularity of\nsolutions. Our high regularity well-posedness threshold $s<4\\sigma$ is twice as\nhigh as one might na\\\"ively expect, given that the function $z\\mapsto\n|z|^{2\\sigma}$ is only $C^{1,2\\sigma-1}$ H\\\"older continuous.

This considerably improves the known local results, which had\nonly been established in either $H^2$ or in weighted Sobolev spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 01:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

To address this\nproblem, existing OSUDA methods usually integrate a style-transfer module to\nperform domain randomization based on the unlabeled target sample, with which\nmultiple domains around the target sample can be explored during training.\nHowever, such a style-transfer module relies on an additional set of images as\nstyle reference for pre-training and also increases the memory demand for\ndomain adaptation.

In this paper, we present a new transformer architecture termed\nDualFormer, which can efficiently perform space-time attention for video\nrecognition. Concretely, DualFormer stratifies the full space-time attention\ninto dual cascaded levels, i.e., to first learn fine-grained local interactions\namong nearby 3D tokens, and then to capture coarse-grained global dependencies\nbetween the query token and global pyramid contexts. Different from existing\nmethods that apply space-time factorization or restrict attention computations\nwithin local windows for improving efficiency, our local-global stratification\nstrategy can well capture both short- and long-range spatiotemporal\ndependencies, and meanwhile greatly reduces the number of keys and values in\nattention computation to boost efficiency. Experimental results verify the\nsuperiority of DualFormer on five video benchmarks against existing methods. In\nparticular, DualFormer achieves 82.9%/85.2% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600\nwith ~1000G inference FLOPs which is at least 3.2x fewer than existing methods\nwith similar performance.

To bridge\nthis gap, we aim to learn a spatial-aware visual representation that can\ndescribe the three-dimensional space and is more suitable and effective for\nthese tasks. To leverage point clouds, which are much more superior in\nproviding spatial information compared to images, we propose a simple yet\neffective 2D Image and 3D Point cloud Unsupervised pre-training strategy,\ncalled SimIPU. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal contrastive learning\nframework that consists of an intra-modal spatial perception module to learn a\nspatial-aware representation from point clouds and an inter-modal feature\ninteraction module to transfer the capability of perceiving spatial information\nfrom the point cloud encoder to the image encoder, respectively.

By optimizing for\nsocietal metrics of traffic such as increased throughput and reduced energy\nconsumption, such methods can derive maneuvers that, if adopted by even a small\nportion of vehicles, may significantly improve the state of traffic for all\nvehicles involved. These methods, however, are hindered in practice by the\ndifficulty of designing efficient and accurate models of traffic, as well as\nthe challenges associated with optimizing for the behaviors of dozens of\ninteracting agents. In response to these challenges, this paper tackles the\nproblem of learning generalizable traffic control strategies in simple\nrepresentations of vehicle driving dynamics. In particular, we look to\nmixed-autonomy ring roads as depictions of instabilities that result in the\nformation of congestion. Within this problem, we design a curriculum learning\nparadigm that exploits the natural extendability of the network to effectively\nlearn behaviors that reduce congestion over long horizons. Next, we study the\nimplications of modeling lane changing on the transferability of policies. Our\nfindings suggest that introducing lane change behaviors that even approximately\nmatch trends in more complex systems can significantly improve the\ngeneralizability of subsequent learned models to more accurate multi-lane\nmodels of traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 04:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 15:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

The promising\nexplainable AI (XAI) methods can mitigate such risks by enhancing the\ntransparency of the black-box AI decision-making process. This paper surveys\nthe application of XAI towards the upcoming 6G age in every aspect, including\n6G technologies (e.g., intelligent radio, zero-touch network management) and 6G\nuse cases (e.g., industry 5.0). Moreover, we summarised the lessons learned\nfrom the recent attempts and outlined important research challenges in applying\nXAI for 6G in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 04:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 09:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We back up these\nfindings empirically, showing that feature representations learned by a deep\nnetwork value function trained via bootstrapping can indeed become degenerate,\naliasing the representations for state-action pairs that appear on either side\nof the Bellman backup. To address this issue, we derive the form of this\nimplicit regularizer and, inspired by this derivation, propose a simple and\neffective explicit regularizer, called DR3, that counteracts the undesirable\neffects of this implicit regularizer. When combined with existing offline RL\nmethods, DR3 substantially improves performance and stability, alleviating\nunlearning in Atari 2600 games, D4RL domains and robotic manipulation from\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 06:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Experimental results on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our methods can correctly recover the low-rank\nstructure shared across tasks, and outperform related multi-task learning\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 07:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Local differential privacy (LDP), as an\nemerging standard that is suitable for PPDA, has been widely deployed into\nvarious real-world scenarios to analyze massive data while protecting against\nmany forms of privacy breach. In this study, we are mainly concerned with\npiecewise transformation technique (PTT) for analyzing numerical data under\nlocal differential privacy. We provide a principled framework for PTT in the\ncontext of LDP, based on which PTT is studied systematically. As a result, we\nshow that (1) many members in PTTs are asymptotically optimal when used to\nobtain an unbiased estimator for mean of numerical data, and (2) for a given\nprivacy budget, there is PTT that reaches the theoretical low bound with\nrespect to variance. Next, we prove by studying two classes of PTTs in detail\nthat (1) there do not exist optimal PTTs compared to the well-used technique,\ni.e., Duchi's scheme, in terms of the consistency noisy variance, (2) on the\nother hand, one has the ability to find a great number of PTTs that are\nconsistently more optimal than the latter with regard to the worst-case noisy\nvariance, which is never reported so far. When we are restricted to consider\nonly the high privacy level, enough PTTs turn out to be optimal than the\nwell-known Laplace mechanism. Lastly, we prove that for a family of PTTs, the\ncorrespondingly theoretical low bound of noisy variance follows\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ when considering the high privacy level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 08:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

However, most of their\nperformance largely lags behind noble metals such as benchmark platinum (Pt).\nIn this work, a Pd(20nm)/SnTe(70nm) heterostructure, fabricated by molecular\nbeam epitaxy and electron beam evaporation, is found to display much higher\nelectrocatalytic activity than that of a pure Pd(20nm) thin film and even\nhigher than that of a commercial Pt foil. This heterostructure adopts an\nextracted turnover frequency value more than two times higher than that of the\nPd(20nm) thin film at a potential of 0.2 V, indicating a much higher intrinsic\nactivity per Pd site. Density functional theory calculations show that the\nconventional d-band theory, which works well for many transition metal\nheterostructures, cannot explain the enhancement of electrocatalytic\nperformance. Instead, we found that the topological surface states (TSSs) of\nthe SnTe (001) underlayer play a key role; electrons transfer from both the Pd\nsurface and the adsorbed H atoms to the TSSs of SnTe (001), resulting in weaker\nPd-H binding strength and more favorable hydrogen adsorption free energies. Our\nwork demonstrates for the first time that a metal/topological quantum material\nheterostructure could be a prominent catalyst to enjoy HER activity\noutperforming that of a commercial Pt foil and offers a promising direction to\noptimize the performance of electrocatalysts based on topological quantum\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 08:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 07:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Detecting\nrisky (or bad) sellers on such a payment network is crucial to payment service\nproviders for risk management and legal compliance. In this research, we\nformulate this task as a node classification task. Specifically, we aim to\npredict a label for each seller in a payment network, by analysing its\nproperties and/or interactions. Nodes residing in different parts of a payment\nnetwork can have similar local topology structures. Such local topology\nstructures reveal sellers' business roles, eg., supplier, drop-shipper, or\nretailer. We note that many existing solutions for graph-based node\nclassification only consider node connectivity but not the similarity between\nnode's local topology structure. Motivated by business need, we present a\ndual-path graph convolution network, named DP-GCN, for node classification.\nDP-GCN considers both node connectivity and topology structure similarity. The\nproposed model consists of three main modules: (i) a C-GCN module to capture\nconnectivity relationships between nodes, (ii) a T-GCN module to capture\ntopology structure similarities between nodes, and (iii) a multi-head\nself-attention module to align both properties. We evaluate DP-GCN on seven\nbenchmark datasets against diverse baselines.

To\ntackle the diversity and complicated semantics of event boundaries, we make\nthree notable improvements. First, we construct a feature bank to store\nmulti-level features of space and time, prepared for difference calculation at\nmultiple scales. Second, to alleviate inadequate temporal modeling of previous\nmethods, we present dense difference maps (DDM) to comprehensively characterize\nthe motion pattern. Finally, we exploit progressive attention on multi-level\nDDM to jointly aggregate appearance and motion clues.

Since the studied\ntechniques are applicable to any trapped charged particle and allow spatial\nseparation between the target ion and the cooling species, they enable a\nvariety of precision measurements based on trapped charged particles to be\nperformed at improved sampling rates and with reduced systematic uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 10:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In the first part of the paper, we investigate the fluid\nversion: Fluid arrives at the two queues as two independent flows with\ndeterministic rate. There is a single server that serves both queues at\nconstant speeds. The server spends an exponentially distributed amount of time\nin each queue. After the completion of such a visit time to one queue, the\nserver instantly switches to the other queue, i.e., there is no switchover\ntime.\n  For this model, we first derive the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the\nstationary marginal fluid content/workload at each queue. Subsequently, we\nderive a functional equation for the LST of the two-dimensional workload\ndistribution that leads to a Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem (BVP).\nAfter taking a heavy-traffic limit, and restricting ourselves to the symmetric\ncase, the boundary value problem simplifies and can be solved explicitly.\n  In the second part of the paper, allowing for more general (L\\'evy) input\nprocesses and server switching policies, we investigate the transient\nprocess-limit of the joint workload in heavy traffic. Again solving a BVP, we\ndetermine the stationary distribution of the limiting process. We show that, in\nthe symmetric case, this distribution coincides with our earlier solution of\nthe BVP, implying that in this case the two limits (stationarity and heavy\ntraffic) commute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 10:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

We avoid limiting the deployment of our tools to certain FIQA\nmethods by basing our analyses on the behavior of FR models when processing\nsamples with different FIQA decisions. This leads to explainability tools that\ncan be applied for any FIQA method with any CNN-based FR solution using\nactivation mapping to exhibit the network's activation derived from the face\nembedding. To avoid the low discrimination between the general spatial\nactivation mapping of low and high-quality images in FR models, we build our\nexplainability tools in a higher derivative space by analyzing the variation of\nthe FR activation maps of image sets with different quality decisions. We\ndemonstrate our tools and analyze the findings on four FIQA methods, by\npresenting inter and intra-FIQA method analyses.

An improved understanding of the formation process can be\nachieved by studying it across the full parameter space, particularly toward\nthe extremes. Earlier studies of planets in close-in orbits around high-mass\nstars have revealed an increase in giant planet frequency with increasing\nstellar mass until a turnover point at 1.9 solar masses, above which the\nfrequency rapidly decreases. This could potentially imply that planet formation\nis impeded around more massive stars, and that giant planets around stars\nexceeding 3 solar masses may be rare or non-existent. However, the methods used\nto detect planets in small orbits are insensitive to planets in wide orbits.\nHere we demonstrate the existence of a planet at 560 times the Sun-Earth\ndistance from the 6-10 solar mass binary b Centauri through direct imaging. The\nplanet-to-star mass ratio of 0.10-0.17% is similar to the Jupiter-Sun ratio,\nbut the separation of the detected planet is ~100 times wider than that of\nJupiter. Our results show that planets can reside in much more massive stellar\nsystems than what would be expected from extrapolation of previous results. The\nplanet is unlikely to have formed in-situ through the conventional core\naccretion mechanism, but might have formed elsewhere and arrived to its present\nlocation through dynamical interactions, or might have formed via gravitational\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 11:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Compared with image\nclassification, object detection is a more complex task, and designing specific\nKD methods for object detection is non-trivial. In this work, we elaborately\nstudy the behaviour difference between the teacher and student detection\nmodels, and obtain two intriguing observations: First, the teacher and student\nrank their detected candidate boxes quite differently, which results in their\nprecision discrepancy. Second, there is a considerable gap between the feature\nresponse differences and prediction differences between teacher and student,\nindicating that equally imitating all the feature maps of the teacher is the\nsub-optimal choice for improving the student's accuracy. Based on the two\nobservations, we propose Rank Mimicking (RM) and Prediction-guided Feature\nImitation (PFI) for distilling one-stage detectors, respectively. RM takes the\nrank of candidate boxes from teachers as a new form of knowledge to distill,\nwhich consistently outperforms the traditional soft label distillation. PFI\nattempts to correlate feature differences with prediction differences, making\nfeature imitation directly help to improve the student's accuracy.

In this\npaper, based on the idea of introducing intimate information interaction\nbetween the two information sources, we propose our Siamese Attribute-missing\nGraph Auto-encoder (SAGA).

The edit-distance is an\neffective metric to quantitatively compare time series segments of unequal\nlength by computing the cost of transforming one segment into the other. We\nshow that transformation costs generally exhibit a non-trivial relationship\nwith local sampling rate. If the sampling resolution undergoes strong\nvariations, this effect impedes unbiased comparison between different time\nepisodes. We study the impact of this effect on recurrence quantification\nanalysis, a framework that is well-suited for identifying regime shifts in\nnonlinear time series. A constrained randomization approach is put forward to\ncorrect for the biased recurrence quantification measures.

The 2D SnS crystals exhibit anisotropic response along the in-plane\narmchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) crystallographic directions, offering an\nadditional degree of freedom in manipulating their behavior. Therefore,\ncalculating the AC/ZZ directions is important in characterizing the 2D SnS\ncrystals. In this work, we take advantage of the lack of inversion symmetry of\nthe 2D SnS crystal, that produces second harmonic generation (SHG), to perform\npolarization-resolved SHG (P-SHG) nonlinear imaging of the in-plane anisotropy.\nWe fit the P-SHG experimental data with a nonlinear optics model, that allows\nus to calculate the AC/ZZ orientation from every point of the 2D crystal and to\nmap with high-resolution the AC/ZZ direction of several 2D SnS flakes belonging\nin the same field of view. It is found that the P-SHG intensity polar patterns\nare associated with the crystallographic axes of the flakes and with the\nrelative strength of the second order nonlinear susceptibility tensor in\ndifferent directions. Therefore, our method provides quantitative information\nof the optical in-plane anisotropy of orthorhombic 2D crystals, offering great\npromise for performance characterization during device operation in the\nemerging optoelectronic applications of such crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 11:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

To extract such spectral information from the Navier-Stokes\nequations, Doering and Gibbon (2002) introduced the idea of forming a set of\ndynamic wave-numbers $\\kappa_n(t)$ from ratios of norms of solutions. The time\naverages of the $\\kappa_n(t)$ can be interpreted as the 2$n$th-moments of the\nenergy spectrum.

Observations of such events in clusters can provide insights on the\nastrophysical processes that characterise the properties of the intra-cluster\nmedium, as well as the gravitational processes that contribute to their\nassembly. It is therefore of prime interest to devise a fast and reliable way\nof detecting such perturbed systems. We present a novel approach to identifying\nand timing major mergers in clusters characterised by large values of halo\nsparsity. Using halo catalogues from the MultiDark-Planck2 simulation, we show\nthat major merger events disrupt the radial mass distribution of haloes, thus\nleaving a distinct universal imprint on the evolution of halo sparsity over a\nperiod not exceeding two dynamical times. We exploit this feature using\nnumerically calibrated distributions to test whether an observed galaxy cluster\nwith given sparsity measurements has undergone a recent major merger and to\neventually estimate when such an event occurred. We implement these statistical\ntools in a specifically developed public python library \\textsc{lammas}, which\nwe apply to the analysis of Abell 383 and Abell 2345 as test cases.

Among them are\nalgebras and coalgebras, two notions which are in some sense dual to each\nother. As a combination of these notions we obtain bialgebras, and as a special\ncase of them then Hopf algebras, which play a central role in this thesis.\nAfter further algebraic preliminaries, we give the examples of Hopf algebras we\nare interested in. Among them is the example of the polynomial Hopf algebra,\nwhose product is nothing but the usual multiplication of polynomials and whose\ncoproduct can be expressed very simply with the help of a binomial coefficient.\nWe then use the dual pair of tensor Hopf algebras to introduce weakly geometric\nrough paths, which correspond to notions of Stieltjes integrals satisfying the\nusual integration by parts rule. For cases like It\\^o-integration where we need\nto give up integration by parts, we look at Gubinelli's branched rough paths\nbased on the dual pair of Hopf algebras on trees and forests. Finally, we give\nsome basic concepts of Hairer's theory of regularity structures and use them\nfor a different approach to branched and weakly geometric rough paths.

However, most of these methods take a\nunidirectional extraction framework that first extracts all subjects and then\nextracts objects and relations simultaneously based on the subjects extracted.\nThis framework has an obvious deficiency that it is too sensitive to the\nextraction results of subjects. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a\nbidirectional extraction framework based method that extracts triples based on\nthe entity pairs extracted from two complementary directions. Concretely, we\nfirst extract all possible subject-object pairs from two paralleled directions.\nThese two extraction directions are connected by a shared encoder component,\nthus the extraction features from one direction can flow to another direction\nand vice versa. By this way, the extractions of two directions can boost and\ncomplement each other. Next, we assign all possible relations for each entity\npair by a biaffine model. During training, we observe that the share structure\nwill lead to a convergence rate inconsistency issue which is harmful to\nperformance. So we propose a share-aware learning mechanism to address it. We\nevaluate the proposed model on multiple benchmark datasets. Extensive\nexperimental results show that the proposed model is very effective and it\nachieves state-of-the-art results on all of these datasets. Moreover,\nexperiments show that both the proposed bidirectional extraction framework and\nthe share-aware learning mechanism have good adaptability and can be used to\nimprove the performance of other tagging based methods.

Such attacks usually rely on\nthe principle of transferability, where an adversarial example crafted on a\nsurrogate classifier tends to mislead the target classifier trained on the same\ndataset even if both classifiers have quite different architecture. Ensemble\nmethods against adversarial attacks demonstrate that an adversarial example is\nless likely to mislead multiple classifiers in an ensemble having diverse\ndecision boundaries. However, recent ensemble methods have either been shown to\nbe vulnerable to stronger adversaries or shown to lack an end-to-end\nevaluation. This paper attempts to develop a new ensemble methodology that\nconstructs multiple diverse classifiers using a Pairwise Adversarially Robust\nLoss (PARL) function during the training procedure. PARL utilizes gradients of\neach layer with respect to input in every classifier within the ensemble\nsimultaneously.

The\ncentrifugal force induced by rotation deforms the planetary shape and partially\ncounteracts the gravitational force. Thus, rotation will affect the critical\ncore mass of the exoplanet. Once the atmospheric mass becomes comparable to the\ncritical core mass, the planet will enter the runaway accretion phase and\nbecomes a gas giant. We have confirmed that the critical core masses of\nrotating planets depend on the stiffness of the polytrope, the outer boundary\nconditions, and the thickness of the isothermal layer. The critical core mass\nwith Bondi boundary condition is determined by the surface properties. The\ncritical core mass of a rotating planet will increase with the core gravity\n(i.e., the innermost density). For the Hill boundary condition, the soft\npolytrope shares the same properties as planets with Bondi boundary condition.\nSince the total mass for planets with Hill boundary condition increases with\nthe decrease of the polytropic index, higher core gravity is required for\nrotating planets. As a result, the critical core mass in the stiff Hill model\nsharply increases. The rotation effects become more important when the\nradiative and convective regions coexist.

Lastly, a highly related auxiliary task, self-supervised\nocclusion-aware reconstruction is presented to narrow the gaps in output space.\nWe perform intensive ablation studies and break-down comparisons to validate\nthe effectiveness of each proposed module.

Finally, we demonstrate that our method is robust to various\ndomain adaptation settings, and can be easily integrated into quick adaptation\napplication scenarios and real-world deployments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 15:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Using extremely high resolution arepo simulations of isolated dwarf\ngalaxies, we independently vary the metallicity and UV-field to between 1% and\n10% solar neighbourhood values. We include a non-equilibrium, time-dependant\nchemical network to model the molecular composition of the ISM, and include the\neffects of gas shielding from an ambient UV field. Crucially our simulations\ndirectly model the gravitational collapse of gas into star-forming clumps and\ncores and their subsequent accretion using sink particles. In this first\npublication we find that reducing the metallicity and UV-field by a factor of\n10 has no effect on star formation, and minimal effect on the cold, dense star\nforming gas. The cold gas depletion times are almost an order of magnitude\nlonger than the molecular gas depletion time due to the presence of star\nformation in HI dominated cold gas. We study the H2 Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelationship that arises naturally within the simulations and find a near\nlinear power law index of N = 1.09 +/- 0.014 in our fiducial 10% solar\nmetallicity model. As the metallicity and UV-field are reduced this becomes\nmoderately steeper, with a slope of N = 1.24 +/- 0.022 for our 1% solar\nmetallicity and 1% solar UV field model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 15:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 12:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Numerous studies\nhave been presented for identifying frog species, although the majority of\nrecorded species are thought to be monotypic. The purpose of this study is to\ndemonstrate a method for classifying various frog species using an audio\nrecording. To be more exact, continuous frog recordings are cut into audio\nsnippets first (10 seconds). Then, for each ten-second recording, several\ntime-frequency representations are constructed. Following that, rather than\nusing manually created features, Machine Learning methods are employed to\nclassify the frog species. Data reduction techniques; Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are used to extract the\nmost important features before classification. Finally, to validate our\nclassification accuracy, cross validation and prediction accuracy are used.\nExperimental results show that PCA extracted features that achieved better\nclassification accuracy both with cross validation and prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 07:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

To address this, here we present a novel\ndiffusion-model-based image registration method, called DiffuseMorph.\nDiffuseMorph not only generates synthetic deformed images through reverse\ndiffusion but also allows image registration by deformation fields.\nSpecifically, the deformation fields are generated by the conditional score\nfunction of the deformation between the moving and fixed images, so that the\nregistration can be performed from continuous deformation by simply scaling the\nlatent feature of the score.

However, due to the influence of the blur effect,\nestimating the alignment information from the blurry adjacent frames is not a\ntrivial task. Inaccurate estimations will interfere the following frame\nrestoration. Instead of estimating alignment information, we propose a simple\nand effective deep Recurrent Neural Network with Multi-scale Bi-directional\nPropagation (RNN-MBP) to effectively propagate and gather the information from\nunaligned neighboring frames for better video deblurring. Specifically, we\nbuild a Multi-scale Bi-directional Propagation~(MBP) module with two U-Net RNN\ncells which can directly exploit the inter-frame information from unaligned\nneighboring hidden states by integrating them in different scales.

In this\nwork, we propose a new adaptive optimisation method by extending AdamW in two\naspects with the purpose to relax the requirement on small learning rate for\nlocal stability, which we refer to as Aida. Firstly, we consider tracking the\n2nd moment r_t of the pth power of the gradient-magnitudes. r_t reduces to v_t\nof AdamW when p=2. Suppose {m_t} is the first moment of AdamW. It is known that\nthe update direction m_{t+1}/(v_{t+1}+epsilon)^0.5 (or\nm_{t+1}/(v_{t+1}^0.5+epsilon) of AdamW (or Adam) can be decomposed as the sign\nvector sign(m_{t+1}) multiplied elementwise by a vector of magnitudes\n|m_{t+1}|/(v_{t+1}+epsilon)^0.5 (or |m_{t+1}|/(v_{t+1}^0.5+epsilon)).

However, many value\ndecomposition methods ignore the coordination among different agents, leading\nto the notorious \"lazy agents\" problem. To enhance the coordination in MAS,\nthis paper proposes HyperGraph CoNvolution MIX (HGCN-MIX), a method that\nincorporates hypergraph convolution with value decomposition. HGCN-MIX models\nagents as well as their relationships as a hypergraph, where agents are nodes\nand hyperedges among nodes indicate that the corresponding agents can\ncoordinate to achieve larger rewards. Then, it trains a hypergraph that can\ncapture the collaborative relationships among agents. Leveraging the learned\nhypergraph to consider how other agents' observations and actions affect their\ndecisions, the agents in a MAS can better coordinate. We evaluate HGCN-MIX in\nthe StarCraft II multi-agent challenge benchmark. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that HGCN-MIX can train joint policies that outperform or achieve a\nsimilar level of performance as the current state-of-the-art techniques. We\nalso observe that HGCN-MIX has an even more significant improvement of\nperformance in the scenarios with a large amount of agents. Besides, we conduct\nadditional analysis to emphasize that when the hypergraph learns more\nrelationships, HGCN-MIX can train stronger joint policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 08:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 13:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

In this Thesis, we aim to provide the network\ndesigner with a simple view of the network robustness to traffic matrix\nchanges. We first present the Traffic Load Distribution Plots, or T-Plots, a\nclass of plots illustrating the percentage of traffic matrices that can be\nserviced as a function of the capacity over-provisioning. For instance, from a\nsimple look at their T- Plots, network designers can guarantee that their\nnetwork services all admissible traffic matrices, or 99% of permutation traffic\nmatrices, or all traffic matrices with ingress/egress load at most half the\nmaximum. We further show that, unfortunately, in the general case plotting\nT-Plots is #P-Complete, i.e., that it is impossible to plot a T-plot in a\npolynomial time by the noon tools. However, we show that T-Plots can sometimes\nbe closely modeled as Gaussian, thus only using two values (mean and variance)\nto quantify the robustness of a capacity allocation to traffic matrix changes.\nWe further utilize these Gaussian T-Plots to provide a more robust capacity\nallocation. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of using T-Plots by showing\nresults of extensive Monte Carlo simulations in a real backbone network. This\nThesis was submitted in 2007.
