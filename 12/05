A Girsanov theorem for Markov chains is\nimplemented for the change of coefficients, including the diffusion coefficient\nwhich cannot be changed by the usual Girsanov theorem for Brownian motion. The\nprice of a European type asset is then determined using an Esscher transform\nand a system of partial differential equations. A dynamic programming principle\nand a maximum/minimum principle associated with the stochastic control problem\nare then derived to model bid and ask prices. These prices are not quotes of\ntraders or market makers but represent estimates in our model on which\nreasonable quantities could be traded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 16:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The data are replicated across\nservers because a single server often cannot handle the request load.\nReplication is also necessary to guarantee that a server or link failure does\nnot render a portion of the dataset inaccessible. A replication protocol is\nresponsible for ensuring strong consistency between the replicas of a\ndatastore, even when faults occur, by determining the actions necessary to\naccess and manipulate the data. Consequently, a replication protocol also\ndrives the datastore's performance.\n  Existing strongly consistent replication protocols deliver fault tolerance\nbut fall short in terms of performance. Meanwhile, the opposite occurs in the\nworld of multiprocessors, where data are replicated across the private caches\nof different cores. The multiprocessor regime uses invalidations to afford\nstrongly consistent replication with high performance but neglects fault\ntolerance.\n  Although handling failures in the datacenter is critical for data\navailability, we observe that the common operation is fault-free and far\nexceeds the operation during faults. In other words, the common operating\nenvironment inside a datacenter closely resembles that of a multiprocessor.\nBased on this insight, we draw inspiration from the multiprocessor for\nhigh-performance, strongly consistent replication in the datacenter. The\nprimary contribution of this thesis is in adapting invalidating protocols to\nthe nuances of replicated datastores, which include skewed data accesses, fault\ntolerance, and distributed transactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 19:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

It\nmeans that popular items called short heads appear in the recommendation lists\nmore than others since they have many ratings. However, unpopular items called\nlong-tail items are used less than popular ones as they reduce accuracy. Other\nstudies that solve the long-tail problem consider users' interests constant\nwhile their preferences change over time. We suggest that users' dynamic\npreferences should be taken into account to prevent the loss of accuracy when\nwe use long-tail items in recommendation lists. This study shows that the two\nreasons lie in the following: 1) Users rate for different proportions of\npopular and unpopular items over time. 2) Users of all ages have various\ninterests in popular and unpopular items. As a result, recommendation lists can\nbe created over time with a different portion of long-tail and short-head\nitems. Besides, we predict the age of users based on item ratings to use more\nlong-tail items. The results show that by considering these two reasons, the\naccuracy of recommendation lists reaches 91%. At the same time, the long tail\nproblem is better improved than other related research and provides better\ndiversity in recommendation lists in the long run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 19:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposing\nPointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3D\ncategory texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it into\nmulti-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot\nprediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, we\ndesign an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and\nadaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in\n2D. By just fine-tuning the lightweight adapter in the few-shot settings, the\nperformance of PointCLIP could be largely improved.

The most\nchallenging step, in this setup, is to evaluate functions involving density\nexplicitly, such as entropy, in terms of samples. This paper builds on the\nrecent works with a slight but crucial difference: we propose to utilize a\nvariational formulation of the objective function formulated as maximization\nover a parametric class of functions. Theoretically, the proposed variational\nformulation allows the construction of gradient flows directly for empirical\ndistributions with a well-defined and meaningful objective function.\nComputationally, this approach replaces the computationally expensive step in\nexisting methods, to handle objective functions involving density, with inner\nloop updates that only require a small batch of samples and scale well with the\ndimension.

The project presented\nhere aims to develop a beam position and intensity monitor, to cover a wide\nintensity range from a few Hz up to GHz rates, as used in clinical settings.\nSilicon carbide (SiC) is an attractive detector material for this application\nbecause it combines potential high radiation hardness with high thermal\nconductivity to avoid cooling.

We extend this to $NA$ elastic scattering.\n  Methods: With the spectator expansion of multiple scattering theory and the\nno-core shell model, we use a chiral interaction from the LENPIC collaboration\nto consistently calculate the leading order effective $NA$ interaction up to\nthird chiral order (N2LO) and extract elastic scattering observables. We\nquantify the chiral truncation error using pointwise and correlated methods.\n  Results: We analyze proton-$^{16}$O and neutron-$^{12}$C elastic scattering\nobservables between 65 and 185 MeV projectile kinetic energy. We find\nqualitatively similar results for the chiral truncation uncertainties as in\nfew-body systems, which we assess using similar diagnostic tools. The\norder-by-order convergence of the scattering observables for $^{16}$O and\n$^{12}$C is reasonable near 100 MeV, but for higher energies the expansion\nparameter becomes too large to converge.

Due to the importance of\nthese tasks, people turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the de facto\nmethod for learning on graphs. GNNs have become widely applied due to their\nconvincing performance. Unfortunately, one major barrier to using GNNs is that\nGNNs require substantial time and resources to train. Recently, a new method\nfor learning on graph data is Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) [Du, Hou,\nSalakhutdinov, Poczos, Wang and Xu 19]. GNTK is an application of Neural\nTangent Kernel (NTK) [Jacot, Gabriel and Hongler 18] (a kernel method) on graph\ndata, and solving NTK regression is equivalent to using gradient descent to\ntrain an infinite-wide neural network. The key benefit of using GNTK is that,\nsimilar to any kernel method, GNTK's parameters can be solved directly in a\nsingle step. This can avoid time-consuming gradient descent. Meanwhile,\nsketching has become increasingly used in speeding up various optimization\nproblems, including solving kernel regression. Given a kernel matrix of $n$\ngraphs, using sketching in solving kernel regression can reduce the running\ntime to $o(n^3)$. But unfortunately such methods usually require extensive\nknowledge about the kernel matrix beforehand, while in the case of GNTK we find\nthat the construction of the kernel matrix is already $O(n^2N^4)$, assuming\neach graph has $N$ nodes. The kernel matrix construction time can be a major\nperformance bottleneck when the size of graphs $N$ increases. A natural\nquestion to ask is thus whether we can speed up the kernel matrix construction\nto improve GNTK regression's end-to-end running time. This paper provides the\nfirst algorithm to construct the kernel matrix in $o(n^2N^3)$ running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 23:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

However, explanations of anomalies (e.g. dark matter) rely on further\nsymmetry breaking calling for an undiscovered axial Higgs mode. In condensed\nmatter the Higgs was seen in magnetic, superconducting and charge density\nwave(CDW) systems. Uncovering a low energy mode's vector properties is\nchallenging, requiring going beyond typical spectroscopic or scattering\ntechniques. Here, we discover an axial Higgs mode in the CDW system RTe3 using\nthe interference of quantum pathways. In RTe3 (R=La,Gd), the electronic\nordering couples bands of equal or different angular momenta. As such, the\nRaman scattering tensor associated to the Higgs mode contains both symmetric\nand antisymmetric components, which can be excited via two distinct, but\ndegenerate pathways. This leads to constructive or destructive interference of\nthese pathways, depending on the choice of the incident and Raman scattered\nlight polarization. The qualitative behavior of the Raman spectra is\nwell-captured by an appropriate tight-binding model including an axial Higgs\nmode. The elucidation of the antisymmetric component provides direct evidence\nthat the Higgs mode contains an axial vector representation (i.e. a\npseudo-angular momentum) and hints the CDW in RTe3 is unconventional. Thus we\nprovide a means for measuring collective modes quantum properties without\nresorting to extreme experimental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 01:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Previous methods\nmainly rely on the position relationship of pedestrians to model social\ninteraction, which is obviously not enough to represent the complex cases in\nreal situations. In addition, most of existing work usually introduce the scene\ninteraction module as an independent branch and embed the social interaction\nfeatures in the process of trajectory generation, rather than simultaneously\ncarrying out the social interaction and scene interaction, which may undermine\nthe rationality of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we propose one new\nprediction model named Social Soft Attention Graph Convolution Network (SSAGCN)\nwhich aims to simultaneously handle social interactions among pedestrians and\nscene interactions between pedestrians and environments. In detail, when\nmodeling social interaction, we propose a new \\emph{social soft attention\nfunction}, which fully considers various interaction factors among pedestrians.\nAnd it can distinguish the influence of pedestrians around the agent based on\ndifferent factors under various situations. For the physical interaction, we\npropose one new \\emph{sequential scene sharing mechanism}. The influence of the\nscene on one agent at each moment can be shared with other neighbors through\nsocial soft attention, therefore the influence of the scene is expanded both in\nspatial and temporal dimension. With the help of these improvements, we\nsuccessfully obtain socially and physically acceptable predicted trajectories.\nThe experiments on public available datasets prove the effectiveness of SSAGCN\nand have achieved state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 01:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

It has very\nlong been considered that in $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity a negative term of\nscalar potential can be given only by the gravitino-mass term (i.e. $-3e^{G}$)\nfrom the F-term potential, while such negative term is absent in global\nsupersymmetry (SUSY). In this letter, however, we firstly discover a new\nnegative-definite contribution to the scalar potential in $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nsupergravity and even global SUSY. In the end, this allows us to have a general\nscalar potential. To achieve this, we start with detection of a ``no-go''\ntheorem for the higher order corrections in minimal supergravity models of\ninflation, which was investigated by Ferrara, Kallosh, Linde, and Porrati\n(FKLP). Based on the no-go theorem, we establish a superconformal action of a\ncertain higher order correction for generating the new negative term. Then, we\nidentify essential constraints on the new negative term by inspecting the\nsuppression of the nonrenormalizable terms. We find that relaxed supergravity\nhas a cutoff equal to SUSY breaking scale $M_S$. This signals that\nsupersymmetry may be broken at high scale according to the cutoff leaving the\nnaturalness issue aside. We suggest that relaxed supergravity can be a\nuniversal framework for building supergravity models of various phenomenologies\nunder broken SUSY from particle physics to cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 03:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Some existing pose-guided methods solve this problem by\naligning body parts according to graph matching, but these graph-based methods\nare not intuitive and complicated. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based\nPose-guided Feature Disentangling (PFD) method by utilizing pose information to\nclearly disentangle semantic components (e.g. human body or joint parts) and\nselectively match non-occluded parts correspondingly. First, Vision Transformer\n(ViT) is used to extract the patch features with its strong capability. Second,\nto preliminarily disentangle the pose information from patch information, the\nmatching and distributing mechanism is leveraged in Pose-guided Feature\nAggregation (PFA) module. Third, a set of learnable semantic views are\nintroduced in transformer decoder to implicitly enhance the disentangled body\npart features. However, those semantic views are not guaranteed to be related\nto the body without additional supervision. Therefore, Pose-View Matching (PVM)\nmodule is proposed to explicitly match visible body parts and automatically\nseparate occlusion features. Fourth, to better prevent the interference of\nocclusions, we design a Pose-guided Push Loss to emphasize the features of\nvisible body parts. Extensive experiments over five challenging datasets for\ntwo tasks (occluded and holistic Re-ID) demonstrate that our proposed PFD is\nsuperior promising, which performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.\nCode is available at https://github.com/WangTaoAs/PFD_Net\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 03:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 08:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

In recent years, using deep-learning for camera-based\nlocalization has become a popular research direction. However, they lack\nrobustness to large domain shifts, which can be caused by seasonal or\nillumination changes between training and testing data sets. Data augmentation\nis an attractive approach to tackle this problem, as it does not require\nadditional data to be provided. However, existing augmentation methods blindly\nperturb all pixels and therefore cannot achieve satisfactory performance. To\novercome this issue, we proposed RADA, a system whose aim is to concentrate on\nperturbing the geometrically informative parts of the image. As a result, it\nlearns to generate minimal image perturbations that are still capable of\nperplexing the network. We show that when these examples are utilized as\naugmentation, it greatly improves robustness.

We find that the networks are highly\nsensitive to color, the simulated PSF used in training, and occlusion of light\nfrom a lensed source, but are insensitive to Einstein radius, and performance\ndegrades smoothly with source and lens magnitudes. From this we identify\nweaknesses in the training sets used to constrain the networks, particularly\nthe over-sensitivity to PSF, and constrain the selection function of the\nlens-finder as a function of galaxy photometric magnitudes, with accuracy\ndecreasing significantly where the g-band magnitude of the lens source is\ngreater than 21.5 and the r-band magnitude of the lens is less than 19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 05:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

While the performance of HHJ depends largely\non accurate statistics and information about the input relations, it may not\nalways be practical or possible for a system to have such information\navailable.\n  The design of HHJ depends on many details to perform well. This paper is an\nexperimental and analytical study of the trade-offs in designing a robust and\ndynamic HHJ operator. We revisit the design and optimization techniques\nsuggested by previous studies through extensive experiments, comparing them\nwith other algorithms designed by us or used in related studies.\n  We explore the impact of the number of partitions on the performance of HHJ\nand propose a lower bound and a default value for the number of partitions. We\ncontinue by designing and evaluating different partition insertion techniques\nto maximize memory utilization with the least CPU cost. In addition, we\nconsider a comprehensive set of algorithms for dynamically selecting a\npartition to spill and compare the results against previously published\nstudies. We then present two alternative growth policies for spilled partitions\nand study their effectiveness using experimental and model-based analyses.\n  These algorithms have been implemented in the context of Apache AsterixDB and\nevaluated under different scenarios such as variable record sizes, different\ndistributions of join attributes, and different storage types, including HDD,\nSSD, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 05:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

A Cartesian representation of the\nunit-cell orientation is incorporated into homogenization-based optimization to\ndesign the angles.

To mitigate this high energy\ncost, many works propose bufferless router designs that utilize deflection\nrouting to resolve port contention. While this approach is able to maintain\nhigh performance relative to its buffered counterparts at low network traffic,\nthe bufferless router design suffers performance degradation under high network\nload.\n  In order to maintain high performance and energy efficiency under both low\nand high network loads, this chapter discusses critical drawbacks of\ntraditional bufferless designs and describes recent research works focusing on\ntwo major modifications to improve the overall performance of the traditional\nbufferless network-on-chip design. The first modification is a\nminimally-buffered design that introduces limited buffering inside critical\nparts of the on-chip network in order to reduce the number of deflections.

However, measuring the importance of each\nneuron is an NP-hard problem. Previous works have proposed to trim by\nconsidering the statistics of a single layer or a plurality of successive\nlayers of neurons. These works cannot eliminate the influence of different data\non the model in the reconstruction error, and currently, there is no work to\nprove that the absolute values of the parameters can be directly used as the\nbasis for judging the importance of the weights. A more reasonable approach is\nto eliminate the difference between batch data that accurately measures the\nweight of influence. In this paper, we propose to use ensemble learning to\ntrain a model for different batches of data and use the influence function (a\nclassic technique from robust statistics) to learn the algorithm to track the\nmodel's prediction and return its training parameter gradient, so that we can\ndetermine the responsibility for each parameter, which we call \"influence\", in\nthe prediction process. In addition, we theoretically prove that the\nback-propagation of the deep network is a first-order Taylor approximation of\nthe influence function of the weights. We perform extensive experiments to\nprove that pruning based on the influence function using the idea of ensemble\nlearning will be much more effective than just focusing on error\nreconstruction.

Services like\nKindle, Youtube, and Netflix depend heavily on the performance of their\nrecommender systems to ensure that their users have a good experience and to\nincrease revenues. Despite their popularity, it has been shown that recommender\nsystems reproduce and amplify the bias present in the real world. The resulting\nfeedback creates a self-perpetuating loop that deteriorates the user experience\nand results in homogenizing recommendations over time. Further, biased\nrecommendations can also reinforce stereotypes based on gender or ethnicity,\nthus reinforcing the filter bubbles that we live in. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of gender bias in recommender systems with explicit feedback. We\npropose a model to quantify the gender bias present in book rating datasets and\nin the recommendations produced by the recommender systems. Our main\ncontribution is to provide a principled approach to mitigate the bias being\nproduced in the recommendations. We theoretically show that the proposed\napproach provides unbiased recommendations despite biased data. Through\nempirical evaluation on publicly available book rating datasets, we further\nshow that the proposed model can significantly reduce bias without significant\nimpact on accuracy.

Our proposed system utilizes a\nfeature extractor model composed of factorized convolutional neural networks\nand subsequently deploys domain adversarial training to reconcile the domain\nmismatch by extracting domain invariant features.

In particular, we focus on the contribution of the vertical gravity in\ndetermining the position of the shock front. For steady horizontal flows, the\nexistence of normal shocks with the position of the shock front being arbitrary\nin the nozzle can be easily established. This paper will try to determine the\nposition of the shock front as the state of the flow at the entrance of the\nnozzle and the pressure at the exit are slightly perturbed. To this end, this\npaper proposes a free boundary problem of the linearized Euler system with\nvertical gravity, whose solution could be an initial approximation for the\nshock solution with the free boundary being the approximation for the shock\nfront. Due to the existence of the vertical gravity, difficulties arise in\nsolving the boundary value problem in the approximate subsonic domain behind\nthe shock front. The linearized Euler system is elliptic-hyperbolic composite\nfor subsonic flows, and the elliptic part and the hyperbolic part are coupled\nin the $0$-order terms depending on the acceleration of gravity $g$. Moreover,\nthe coefficients are not constants since the unperturbed shock solution depends\non the vertical variable. New ideas and techniques are developed to deal with\nthese difficulties and, under certain sufficient conditions on the\nperturbation, the existence of the solution to the proposed free boundary\nproblem is established as the acceleration of gravity $g>0$ and the\nperturbation are sufficiently small. Then, with the obtained initial\napproximation of the shock solution, a nonlinear iteration scheme can be\nconstructed which leads to a transonic shock solution with the position of the\nshock front being close to the initial approximating position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 12:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we\nalso propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies\nAlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D\nproblems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D\nbook while a previous program solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the\napproach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other\ngoal-achieving problems for board games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 13:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

This\npre-inflationary bounce avoids the cosmic singularity, and for the eras before\nand after the quasi-de Sitter inflationary stage, approximately satisfies the\nstring theory motivated scale factor duality $a(t)=a^{-1}(-t)$.

Because of the complexity of surgical\nprocedures, the variation of operation styles, and the fast development of new\nsurgical skills, the surgical skill assessment remains a challenging problem.\nThis work presents a novel Gaussian Process Learning-based heuristic automatic\nobjective surgical skill assessment method for ESSBSs. Different with classical\nsurgical skill assessment algorithms, the proposed method 1) utilizes the\nkinematic features in surgical instrument relative movements, instead of using\nspecific surgical tasks or the statistics to assess skills in real-time; 2)\nprovide informative feedback, instead of a summative scores; 3) has the ability\nto incrementally learn from new data, instead of depending on a fixed dataset.\nThe proposed method projects the instrument movements into the endoscope\ncoordinate to reduce the data dimensionality. It then extracts the kinematic\nfeatures of the projected data and learns the relationship between surgical\nskill levels and the features with the Gaussian Process learning technique.

Although several reasearch works have calculated the\ncorrelation between different modality data via learning a common subspace\nrepresentation, the encoder's ability to extract features from multi-modal\ninformation is not satisfactory. In this paper, we present a novel variational\nautoencoder (VAE) architecture for audio-visual cross-modal retrieval, by\nlearning paired audio-visual correlation embedding and category correlation\nembedding as constraints to reinforce the mutuality of audio-visual\ninformation. On the one hand, audio encoder and visual encoder separately\nencode audio data and visual data into two different latent spaces. Further,\ntwo mutual latent spaces are respectively constructed by canonical correlation\nanalysis (CCA). On the other hand, probabilistic modeling methods is used to\ndeal with possible noise and missing information in the data. Additionally, in\nthis way, the cross-modal discrepancy from intra-modal and inter-modal\ninformation are simultaneously eliminated in the joint embedding subspace.

Here, we reveal that Tweedie distributions also play key roles\nin modern deep learning era, leading to a distribution independent\nself-supervised image denoising formula without clean reference images.\nSpecifically, by combining with the recent Noise2Score self-supervised image\ndenoising approach and the saddle point approximation of Tweedie distribution,\nwe can provide a general closed-form denoising formula that can be used for\nlarge classes of noise distributions without ever knowing the underlying noise\ndistribution. Similar to the original Noise2Score, the new approach is composed\nof two successive steps: score matching using perturbed noisy images, followed\nby a closed form image denoising formula via distribution-independent Tweedie's\nformula. This also suggests a systematic algorithm to estimate the noise model\nand noise parameters for a given noisy image data set. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate\nnoise models and parameters, and provide the state-of-the-art self-supervised\nimage denoising performance in the benchmark dataset and real-world dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 04:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

This paper aims to solve the question, \"Given a function with its\nparameters and metadata, how to select the executor in a distributed manner and\nobtain the result in NDN?\" To answer it, we design R2 that involves the\nfollowing stages. First, we design a name structure including data, function\nnames, and other function parameters. Second, we develop a 2-phase mechanism,\nwhere in the first phase, the function request from a client-first reaches the\ndata source and retrieves the metadata, then the best node is selected while\nthe metadata is responding to the client. In the second phase, the chosen node\ndirectly retrieves the data, executes the function, and provides the result to\nthe client. Furthermore, we propose a stop condition to intelligently reduce\nthe processing time of the first phase and provide a simple proof and range\nanalysis. Simulations confirm that R2 outperforms the current solutions in\nterms of resource allocation, especially when the data volume and the function\ncomplexity are high. In the experiments, when the data size is 100 KiB and the\nfunction complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, the speedup ratio is 4.61. To\nfurther evaluate R2, we also implement a general intermediate data processing\nlogic named ``Bolt'' implemented on an app-level in ndnSIM.

One key challenge in the task is the efficiency of point-wise\npredictive distribution establishment. The widely-used MC dropout establishes\nthe distribution by computing the standard deviation of samples using multiple\nstochastic forward propagations, which is time-consuming for tasks based on\npoint clouds containing massive points. Hence, a framework embedded with NSA-MC\ndropout, a variant of MC dropout, is proposed to establish distributions in\njust one forward pass. Specifically, the NSA-MC dropout samples the model many\ntimes through a space-dependent way, outputting point-wise distribution by\naggregating stochastic inference results of neighbors. Based on this, aleatoric\nand predictive uncertainties acquire from the predictive distribution. The\naleatoric uncertainty is integrated into the loss function to penalize noisy\npoints, avoiding the over-fitting of the model to some degree. Besides, the\npredictive uncertainty quantifies the confidence degree of predictions.\nExperimental results show that our framework obtains better segmentation\nresults of real-world point clouds and efficiently quantifies the credibility\nof results. Our NSA-MC dropout is several times faster than MC dropout, and the\ninference time does not establish a coupling relation with the sampling times.\nThe code will be available if the paper is accepted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 02:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}
