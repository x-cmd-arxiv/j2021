We integrate our algorithm with the IPC contact\nsolver, and evaluate its impact on challenging simulation scenarios.\n  We release the dataset with analytic ground truth, the implementation of all\nthe algorithms tested, our testing framework, and a reference CPU and GPU\nimplementation of our algorithm as an open source project to foster adoption\nand development of linear CCD algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 18:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 00:45:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 21:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

The approach is based, in part, on the novel\nInterpolated Factored Green Function acceleration method (IFGF) that, without\nrecourse to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), evaluates the action of Green\nfunction-based integral operators for an $N$-point surface discretization at a\ncomplexity of $\\Ord(N\\log N)$ operations instead of the $\\Ord(N^2)$ cost\nassociated with nonaccelerated methods. The IFGF algorithm exploits the slow\nvariations of factored Green functions to enable the fast evaluation of fields\ngenerated by groups of sources on the basis of a recursive interpolation\nscheme. In the proposed approach, the IFGF method is used to account for the\nvast majority of the computations, while, for the relatively few singular,\nnearly-singular and neighboring non-singular integral operator evaluations, a\nhigh-order rectangular-polar quadrature approach is employed instead.

For $k \\geq 3$,\nChou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21, arXiv:2102.12351] proved a general\ndichotomy theorem for $\\sqrt n$-space sketching algorithms: For every $f$,\nthere exists $\\alpha(f)\\in (0,1]$ such that for every $\\epsilon>0$,\nMax-CSP($f$) is $(\\alpha(f)-\\epsilon)$-approximable by an $O(\\log n)$-space\nlinear sketching algorithm, but $(\\alpha(f)+\\epsilon)$-approximation sketching\nalgorithms require $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space.\n  In this work, we give closed-form expressions for the sketching approximation\nratios of multiple families of symmetric Boolean functions. Letting $\\alpha'_k\n= 2^{-(k-1)} (1-k^{-2})^{(k-1)/2}$, we show that for odd $k \\geq 3$,\n$\\alpha(k$AND$) = \\alpha'_k$, and for even $k \\geq 2$, $\\alpha(k$AND$) =\n2\\alpha'_{k+1}$. We also resolve the ratio for the \"at-least-$(k-1)$-$1$'s\"\nfunction for all even $k$; the \"exactly-$\\frac{k+1}2$-$1$'s\" function for odd\n$k \\in \\{3,\\ldots,51\\}$; and fifteen other functions. We stress here that for\ngeneral $f$, according to [CGSV21], closed-form expressions for $\\alpha(f)$\nneed not have existed a priori.\n  Separately, for all threshold functions, we give optimal \"bias-based\"\napproximation algorithms generalizing [CGV20] while simplifying [CGSV21].\nFinally, we investigate the $\\sqrt n$-space streaming lower bounds in [CGSV21],\nand show that they are incomplete for $3$AND.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 20:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 18:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 13:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

In this paper, to address this issue, we propose\na new learning paradigm by making full use of both normal and abnormal videos\nfor video anomaly detection. In particular, we formulate a new learning task:\ncross-domain few-shot anomaly detection, which can transfer knowledge learned\nfrom numerous videos in the source domain to help solve few-shot abnormality\ndetection in the target domain. Concretely, we leverage self-supervised\ntraining on the target normal videos to reduce the domain gap and devise a meta\ncontext perception module to explore the video context of the event in the\nfew-shot setting.

However, models trained with AT sacrifice\nstandard accuracy and do not generalize well to novel attacks. Recent works\nshow generalization improvement with adversarial samples under novel threat\nmodels such as on-manifold threat model or neural perceptual threat model.\nHowever, the former requires exact manifold information while the latter\nrequires algorithm relaxation. Motivated by these considerations, we exploit\nthe underlying manifold information with Normalizing Flow, ensuring that exact\nmanifold assumption holds. Moreover, we propose a novel threat model called\nJoint Space Threat Model (JSTM), which can serve as a special case of the\nneural perceptual threat model that does not require additional relaxation to\ncraft the corresponding adversarial attacks. Under JSTM, we develop novel\nadversarial attacks and defenses. The mixup strategy improves the standard\naccuracy of neural networks but sacrifices robustness when combined with AT. To\ntackle this issue, we propose the Robust Mixup strategy in which we maximize\nthe adversity of the interpolated images and gain robustness and prevent\noverfitting. Our experiments show that Interpolated Joint Space Adversarial\nTraining (IJSAT) achieves good performance in standard accuracy, robustness,\nand generalization in CIFAR-10/100, OM-ImageNet, and CIFAR-10-C datasets.

This study finds answers to such open\nquestions in an analysis and interpretation of available mass (MBH) and age (t)\ndata of SMBHs at z>5.7. Their distribution reveals that a significant number\n(36) spread over 300 million years (Myr) of cosmic time have markedly similar\nmasses (within a factor of 2) even though MBH depends on age. Besides age, MBH\ndepends upon seed mass Ms, origin time ts, and a variable dubbed accretion\nratio AR. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the 36 SMBHs had\nsimilar-size seeds that formed essentially concurrently and that AR is\ninversely proportional to t. Consequently, we get 36 equations with 1 variable\n(t) and 3 parameters. Solving these equations using the SANN method, the\noptimum values of the parameters define AR as a function of age t, and MBH as a\nfunction of Ms and t. These relationships are tested and applied to thousands\nof SMBHs.

We study the convergence and the valid range of the hopping\nparameter expansion in the determination of the critical point (critical quark\nmass) of QCD with heavy quarks at finite temperature and density. On lattices\nwith sufficiently large spatial extent, the terms in the hopping parameter\nexpansion are classified into Wilson loop terms and Polyakov-type loop terms.\nWe first study the case of the worst convergence in which all the gauge link\nvariables are unit matrices and thus the Wilson loops and the Polyakov-type\nloops get their maximum values.

In the present article,\nboth the energy stored on the horizon and its thermodynamic fluctuations are\nexamined through the holographic equipartition law. First, it is confirmed that\na flat Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universe approaches a de Sitter universe,\nusing a cosmological model close to lambda cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM)\nmodels. Then, based on the holographic equipartition law, the energy density of\nthe Hubble volume is calculated from the energy on the Hubble horizon of a de\nSitter universe. The energy density for a de Sitter universe is constant and\nthe order of the energy density is consistent with the order of that for the\nobserved cosmological constant. Second, thermodynamic fluctuations of energy on\nthe horizon are examined, assuming stable fluctuations around thermal\nequilibrium states. A standard formulation of the fluctuations for a canonical\nensemble is applied to the Hubble horizon of a de Sitter universe. The\nthermodynamic fluctuations of the energy are found to be a universal constant\ncorresponding to the Planck energy, regardless of the Hubble parameter. In\ncontrast, the relative fluctuations of the energy can be characterized by the\nratio of the one-degree-of-freedom energy to the Planck energy. At the present\ntime, the order of the relative fluctuations should be within the range of a\ndiscrepancy derived from a discussion of the cosmological constant problem,\nnamely a range approximately from $10^{-60}$ to $10^{-123}$. The present\nresults may imply that the energy stored on the Hubble horizon is related to a\nkind of effective dark energy, whereas the energy that can be `maximally'\nstored on the horizon may behave as if it were a kind of effective vacuum-like\nenergy in an extended holographic equipartition law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 04:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

We further include two more auxiliary tasks: court\nview generation and article content prediction, showing they can not only\nimprove the prediction accuracy, but also provide interpretable explanations\nfor model outputs even when an error is made.

By taking\naccount of collective modes from this ordered state, we calculate the\ncoefficient of the thermopolarization based on the linear response theory. The\nantisymmetric component is nonzero in the presence of the electric-toroidal\ndipole order. We clarify that fluctuations in the $p$ orbitals are crucial in\nenhancing the antisymmetric thermopolarization. We discuss the appearance\nconditions based on the symmetry argument and the relevance to real materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 02:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

To deal with\nthis issue, the present paper analyzes the performance of CMDF with finite\nconsensus fusion operations.

Unfortunately, sustaining deep\ncomputations with FHE requires a periodic noise reduction step known as\nbootstrapping. The cost of the bootstrapping operation is one of the primary\nbarriers to the wide-spread adoption of FHE. In this paper, we present an\nin-depth architectural analysis of the bootstrapping step in FHE. First, we\nobserve that secure implementations of bootstrapping exhibit a low arithmetic\nintensity (<1 Op/byte), require large caches (>100 MB), and are heavily bound\nby the main memory bandwidth. Consequently, we demonstrate that existing\nworkloads observe marginal performance gains from the design of bespoke\nhigh-throughput arithmetic units tailored to FHE. Second, we propose several\ncache-friendly algorithmic optimizations that improve the throughput in FHE\nbootstrapping by enabling up to 3.2x higher arithmetic intensity and 4.6x lower\nmemory bandwidth. Our optimizations apply to a wide range of structurally\nsimilar computations such as private evaluation and training of machine\nlearning models. Finally, we incorporate these optimizations into an\narchitectural tool which, given a cache size, memory subsystem, the number of\nfunctional units and a desired security level, selects optimal cryptosystem\nparameters to maximize the bootstrapping throughput. Our optimized\nbootstrapping implementation represents a best-case scenario for compute\nacceleration of FHE. We show that despite these optimizations, bootstrapping\ncontinues to be bottlenecked by main memory bandwidth. We propose new research\ndirections to address the underlying memory bottleneck.

Traditionally, the local-to-regional-scale views of settlement\npatterns are produced through systematic pedestrian surveys. Recently,\nsystematic manual survey of satellite and aerial imagery has enabled continuous\ndistributional views of archaeological phenomena at interregional scales.\nHowever, such 'brute force' manual imagery survey methods are both time- and\nlabor-intensive, as well as prone to inter-observer differences in sensitivity\nand specificity. The development of self-supervised learning methods offers a\nscalable learning scheme for locating archaeological features using unlabeled\nsatellite and historical aerial images.

The results show that the classically enhanced scheme can be\nremarkably robust against noise in image formation, which is comparable to the\nquantum scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 06:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Although an adversarial example and the\noriginal benign wave are indistinguishable to humans, the former is transcribed\nas a malicious target sentence by ASR systems. Several methods have been\nproposed to generate audio adversarial examples and feed them directly into the\nASR system (over-line). Furthermore, many researchers have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of robust physical audio adversarial examples(over-air). To defend\nagainst the attacks, several studies have been proposed. However, deploying\nthem in a real-world situation is difficult because of accuracy drop or time\noverhead. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect audio adversarial\nexamples by adding noise to the logits before feeding them into the decoder of\nthe ASR. We show that carefully selected noise can significantly impact the\ntranscription results of the audio adversarial examples, whereas it has minimal\nimpact on the transcription results of benign audio waves. Based on this\ncharacteristic, we detect audio adversarial examples by comparing the\ntranscription altered by logit noising with its original transcription. The\nproposed method can be easily applied to ASR systems without any structural\nchanges or additional training. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod is robust to over-line audio adversarial examples as well as over-air\naudio adversarial examples compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 06:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Existing methods usually tackle\nthese challenges through learning more discriminative features or re-weighting\nsamples.

Second, noisy as well as underrepresented examples can\nbe distinguished by virtue of previously learned knowledge. Thus, we resort to\na gradual learning strategy -- self-paced learning (SPL).

Recently, data\naugmentation with pseudo-prior items generated by Transformers has drawn\nconsiderable attention. These methods can generate pseudo-prior items\nsequentially in reverse chronological order to extend the original sequences.\nNevertheless, the performance may still dramatically degrade in very short\nsequences; most notably, the generation of pseudo-prior items does not take\ninto account the forward direction (from the past to the future), and so the\nunderlying temporal correlations are not preserved in terms of conditional\nprobabilities. Motivated by this, we propose a Bidirectional Chronological\nAugmentation of Transformer (BiCAT) that uses a forward learning constraint in\nthe reverse generative process to capture contextual information more\neffectively. Then, self-knowledge distillation is adopted in augmented and\noriginal sequences to bridge the gap between data augmentation and model\nrepresentation, which enhances the robustness of sequence encoder. Moreover, an\ninformative positive and negative sampling strategy is proposed to accelerate\noptimization and prevent overfitting. Extensive experiments on two popular\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method on very short\nsequences (L < 3) and long sequences (20 < L < 50) as well, our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art models by an average of 35.04% and 8.76%\nrespectively, in terms of Recall@5.

In this study, we investigate the robustness of\nsuperconducting states in HEA-type metal telluride (MTe; M = Ag, In, Sn, Pb,\nBi) under high pressure. PbTe exhibits a structural transition from a NaCl-type\nto an orthorhombic Pnma structure at low pressures, and further transitions to\na CsCl-type structure at high pressures. When the superconductivity of the\nCsCl-type PbTe is observed, it is found that its superconducting transition\ntemperature (Tc) decreases with pressure.

Most of the work utilizes image information through region-level\nvisual representations obtained from a pretrained object detector and relies on\nan attention mechanism to model the interactions between image and text\nrepresentations. However, it is difficult to model such interactions as image\nand text representations are trained separately on the data of their respective\nmodality and are not aligned in the same space. As text representations take\nthe most important role in MNER, in this paper, we propose {\\bf I}mage-{\\bf\nt}ext {\\bf A}lignments (ITA) to align image features into the textual space, so\nthat the attention mechanism in transformer-based pretrained textual embeddings\ncan be better utilized. ITA first aligns the image into regional object tags,\nimage-level captions and optical characters as visual contexts, concatenates\nthem with the input texts as a new cross-modal input, and then feeds it into a\npretrained textual embedding model. This makes it easier for the attention\nmodule of a pretrained textual embedding model to model the interaction between\nthe two modalities since they are both represented in the textual space. ITA\nfurther aligns the output distributions predicted from the cross-modal input\nand textual input views so that the MNER model can be more practical in dealing\nwith text-only inputs and robust to noises from images.

The prevalence of a hot wind from LLAGNs is a\ngeneric prediction by theories and numerical simulations of black hole\naccretion and is recently becoming a crucial ingredient of AGN kinetic feedback\nin cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution. However, direct observational\nevidence for this hot wind is still scarce. In this work, we identify\nsignificant Fe XXVI Ly$\\alpha$ and Fe XXV K$\\alpha$ emission lines from\nhigh-resolution Chandra grating spectra of the LLAGN in NGC\\,7213, a nearby Sa\ngalaxy hosting a $\\sim10^8\\rm~M_\\odot$ SMBH, confirming previous work.

By confronting these spectral features\nwith synthetic X-ray spectra based on our custom magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations, we find that the high-velocity, hot plasma is naturally explained\nby the putative hot wind driven by the hot accretion flow powering this LLAGN.\nAlternative plausible origins of this hot plasma, including stellar activities,\nAGN photoionization and the hot accretion flow itself, are quantitatively\ndisfavored. The inferred kinetic energy and momentum carried by the wind can\nserve as strong feedback to the environment.

Here, we\nstudy the stability of solitary states in Kuramoto networks of identical\ntwo-dimensional phase oscillators with inertia and a phase-lagged coupling. The\npresence of inertia can induce rotatory dynamics of the phase difference\nbetween the solitary oscillator and the coherent cluster. We derive asymptotic\nstability conditions for such a solitary state as a function of inertia,\nnetwork size, and phase lag that may yield either attractive or repulsive\ncoupling. Counterintuitively, our analysis demonstrates that (i) increasing the\nsize of the coherent cluster can promote the stability of the solitary state in\nthe attractive coupling case and (ii) the solitary state can be stable in\nsmall-size networks with all repulsive coupling.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is one of\nthose techniques that artificially rearrange and optimize the propagation\nenvironment of electromagnetic waves to improve both spectrum and energy\nefficiency of wireless networks. Besides, in underwater communication,\nunderwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is a better\nalternative/replacement for conventional acoustic and radio frequency (RF)\ntechnologies. Hence, mixed RIS-aided RF-UOWC can be treated as a promising\ntechnology for future wireless networks. This work focuses on the secrecy\nperformance of mixed dual-hop RIS-aided RF-UOWC networks under the intercepting\neffort of a probable eavesdropper. The RF link operates under generalized Gamma\nfading distribution; likewise, the UOWC link experiences the mixture\nexponential generalized Gamma distribution. The secrecy analysis subsumes the\nderivations of closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity, exact and\nlower bound of secrecy outage probability, and strictly positive secrecy\ncapacity, all in terms of Meijer G functions. Capitalizing on these\nderivations, the effects of heterodyne and intensity modulation/direct\ndetection systems, underwater turbulence resulting from air bubble levels,\ntemperature gradients, and salinity gradients, are measured. Unlike\nconventional models that merely deal with thermally uniform scenarios, this\nproposed model is likely to be unique in terms of dealing with secrecy analysis\nof a temperature gradient RIS-aided RF-UOWC network.

However, to achieve this theoretical level of sensitivity in\nthe science data products we need to address the much more pernicious\nsystematic effects, which are the true limitation. These become all the more\nsignificant when we consider that much of the time used by survey instruments,\nsuch as the SKA, will be dedicated to deep surveys.\n  CHILES is a deep HI survey of the COSMOS field, with 1,000 hours of VLA time.\nWe present our approach for creating the image cubes from the first Epoch, with\ndiscussions of the methods and quantification of the data quality from 946 to\n1420MHz -- a redshift range of 0.5 to 0. We layout the problems we had to solve\nand describe how we tackled them. These are of importance as CHILES is the\nfirst deep wideband multi-epoch HI survey and it has relevance for ongoing and\nfuture surveys.\n  We focus on the accumulated systematic errors in the imaging, as the goal is\nto deliver a high-fidelity image that is only limited by the random thermal\nerrors. To understand and correct these systematic effects we ideally manage\nthem in the domain in which they arise, and that is predominately the\nvisibility domain. CHILES is a perfect test bed for many of the issues we can\nexpect for deep imaging with the SKA or ngVLA and we discuss the lessons we\nhave learned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

We proposed a novel method, dubbed Cross-Modal Info-Max\nHashing (CMIMH). First, to learn informative representations that can preserve\nboth intra- and inter-modal similarities, we leverage the recent advances in\nestimating variational lower-bound of MI to maximize the MI between the binary\nrepresentations and input features and between binary representations of\ndifferent modalities. By jointly maximizing these MIs under the assumption that\nthe binary representations are modelled by multivariate Bernoulli\ndistributions, we can learn binary representations, which can preserve both\nintra- and inter-modal similarities, effectively in a mini-batch manner with\ngradient descent. Furthermore, we find out that trying to minimize the modality\ngap by learning similar binary representations for the same instance from\ndifferent modalities could result in less informative representations. Hence,\nbalancing between reducing the modality gap and losing modality-private\ninformation is important for the cross-modal retrieval tasks. Quantitative\nevaluations on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

We begin by\nsummarizing the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument and the Bell\ncorrelations that cannot be explained by local hidden variable theories. It was\noriginally an open question as to whether (and how) such quantum correlations\ncould occur on a macroscopic scale, since this would seem to counter the\ncorrespondence principle. The purpose of this review is to examine how this\nquestion has been answered over the decades since the original papers of EPR\nand Bell. We first review work relating to higher spin measurements which\nrevealed that macroscopic quantum states could exhibit Bell correlations. This\ncovers higher dimensional, multi-particle and continuous-variable EPR and Bell\nstates where measurements on a single system give a spectrum of outcomes, and\nalso multipartite states where measurements are made at multiple separated\nsites. It appeared that the macroscopic quantum observations were for an\nincreasingly limited span of measurement settings and required a fine\nresolution of outcomes. Motivated by this, we next review correlations for\nmacroscopic superposition states, and examine predictions for the violation of\nLeggett-Garg inequalities for dynamical quantum systems. These results reveal\nBell correlations for coarse-grained measurements which need only distinguish\nbetween macroscopically distinct states, thus bringing into question the\nvalidity of certain forms of macroscopic realism. Finally, we review progress\nfor massive systems, including Bose-Einstein condensates and optomechanical\noscillators, where EPR-type correlations have been observed between massive\nsystems.

Taking a\nutility-based approach, we assume that each player's utility can be modelled\nwith a utility function that maps a vector to a scalar utility. In the case of\na mixed strategy, it is meaningful to apply such a scalarisation both before\ncalculating the expectation of the payoff vector as well as after. This\ndistinction leads to two optimisation criteria. With the first criterion,\nplayers aim to optimise the expected value of their utility function applied to\nthe payoff vectors obtained in the game. With the second criterion, players aim\nto optimise the utility of expected payoff vectors given a joint strategy.\nUnder this latter criterion, it was shown that Nash equilibria need not exist.\nOur first contribution is to provide a sufficient condition under which Nash\nequilibria are guaranteed to exist. Secondly, we show that when Nash equilibria\ndo exist under both criteria, no equilibrium needs to be shared between the two\ncriteria, and even the number of equilibria can differ. Thirdly, we contribute\na study of pure strategy Nash equilibria under both criteria. We show that when\nassuming quasiconvex utility functions for players, the sets of pure strategy\nNash equilibria under both optimisation criteria are equivalent.

Aerosols are therefore\nsubjected to an effective turbulent diffusion at large length scales.

All these complementary\ntechniques find no evidence of long-range magnetic order down to their\nrespective base temperatures. Instead, specific heat, muSR and NMR measurements\nsuggest the coexistence of quasi-static and dynamic spins in NaYbSe2. The\nscattering from these quasi-static spins may cause the absence of magnetic\nthermal conductivity. Thus, we propose a scenario of fluctuating ferrimagnetic\ndroplets immersed in a sea of QSL. This may be quite common on the way pursuing\nan ideal QSL, and provides a brand-new platform to study how a QSL state\nsurvives impurities and coexists with other magnetically ordered states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 09:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

We first show numerically that the\noptimal lockdown policy exhibits a phase transition from suppression to\nmitigation as the time horizon grows, i.e., if the horizon is short the optimal\nstrategy is to impose severe lockdown to avoid diffusion of the infection,\nwhereas if the horizon is long the optimal control steers the system to herd\nimmunity to reduce economic loss.

We compute analytically the performance of these two\nfeedback policies and compare them to the optimal control. Interestingly, we\nshow that in the limit of infinite horizon stabilizing the number of infected\nis preferable to controlling the reproduction number, and in fact yields close\nto optimal performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 10:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

The metallicity gradients of individual galaxies can\nevolve from strong to weak and vice-versa, since mostly low-metallicity gas\naccretes onto the galaxy, resulting in enhanced star formation and ejection of\nmetal enriched gas by energy feedback. Such episodes of enhanced accretion,\nmainly dominated by major mergers, are more common at higher z, and hence\ncontribute to increasing the diversity of gradients.

The highest quality reverberation\nmapping, however, supports the predictions that Fe II comes from twice the\nradius of H$\\beta$. We suggest that lower quality reverberation mapping of Fe\nII is biased to give too small lags. We conclude that, in agreement with the\nGKN model, the region emitting Fe II is the outermost part of the BLR just\ninside the surrounding dust. The model naturally gives the Doppler broadening\nrequire by models of Fe II emission. Optical Fe II emission implies typical\nreddenings of E(B-V) ~ 0.20. This helps explain the ratio of UV to optical Fe\nII emission. Simulations show that the amplitude of Fe II variability is\nconsistent with being the same as for H$\\beta$ variability. The FeII/H$\\beta$\nratio is a good proxy for the Eddington ratio. The ratio might be driven in\npart by the strong soft X-ray excess because the X-rays destroy grains and\nrelease iron into the gas phase. We propose that the correlation of Fe II\nstrength with radio and host galaxy properties is a result of AGN downsizing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 11:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

We derive the occurrence probability and mean size of large\noutbreaks, epidemic threshold, and average epidemic size for the mask model in\nan assortatively mixed random network that follows an arbitrary degree\ndistribution. Applying our analysis to the Poisson random networks, we find\nthat the assortative (disassortative) mixing by mask-wearing decreases\n(increases) the epidemic threshold. Assortative mixing, the tendency for\n(non-)mask wearers to prefer to connect with (non-)mask wearers, is not\neffective in containing epidemics in that the transmissibility required for\nlarge outbreaks to occur is small. On the other hand, in high-transmissibility\ncases, mask use is most effective in decreasing the occurrence probability and\nmean size of large outbreaks, as well as the average epidemic size, when the\nmixing pattern is strongly assortative. Strongly assortative mixing, resulting\nin the separation of mask wearers and non-mask wearers, reduces the probability\nand degree of a large outbreak in high-transmissibility cases, although it\nallows a large outbreak to occur even in low-transmissibility cases. In\nscale-free networks, mask use is most effective when the mixing pattern is\nstrongly assortative and when it is maximally disassortative, provided that the\nmask coverage is not low.

Face image quality assessment (FIQA)\nestimates the utility of the captured image in achieving reliable and accurate\nrecognition performance.

We formulate the max-min fairness problem that maximizes the minimum\nachievable rate among all users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming\nat active APs and the phase shifts at passive RISs, subject to power\nconstraints at the APs. To address such a challenging problem, we first study\nthe special single-user scenario and propose an algorithm that can transform\nthe optimization problem into semidefinite program (SDP) or integer linear\nprogram (ILP) for the cases of continuous and discrete phase shifts,\nrespectively. By solving the resulting SDP and ILP, we first obtain the optimal\nphase shifts, and then design the optimal transmit beamforming accordingly. To\nsolve the optimization problem for the multi-user scenario and continuous phase\nshifts at RISs, we extend the single-user algorithm and propose an alternating\noptimization algorithm, which can first decompose the max-min fairness problem\ninto two subproblems related to transmit beamforming and phase shifts, and then\ntransform the two subproblems into second-order-cone program and SDP,\nrespectively. For the multi-user scenario and discrete phase shifts, the\nmax-min fairness problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program\n(MINLP). To tackle it, we design a ZF-based successive refinement algorithm,\nwhich can find a suboptimal transmit beamforming and phase shifts by means of\nalternating optimization. Numerical results show that compared with benchmark\nschemes of random phase shifts and without using RISs, the proposed algorithms\ncan significantly increase the minimum achievable rate among all users,\nespecially when the number of reflecting elements at each RIS is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 12:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

However, the rather poor\nelectrical conductivity of pristine BiCuSeO hinders its potential. Further\nenhancement of the thermoelectric performance by single doping at Bi site is\nlimited mainly due to dramatic decrease of carrier mobility. Thus, new\nstrategies, such as dual doping or doping with variable-valence elements seem\nto be promising.

In this article we study the relationship between software\nengineers' personality traits and their need for cognition. Through a\nlarge-scale sample study of 483 respondents we collected data to capture the\nsix 'bright' personality traits of the HEXACO model of personality, and three\n`dark' personality traits. Data were analyzed using several methods including a\nmultiple Bayesian linear regression analysis. The results indicate that ca. 33%\nof variation in developers' need for cognition can be explained by personality\ntraits. The Bayesian analysis suggests four traits to be of particular interest\nin predicting need for cognition: openness to experience, conscientiousness,\nhonesty-humility, and emotionality. Further, we also find that need for\ncognition of software engineers is, on average, higher than in the general\npopulation, based on a comparison with prior studies. Given the importance of\nhuman factors for software engineers' performance in general, and problem\nsolving skills in particular, our findings suggest several implications for\nrecruitment, working behavior, and teaming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 12:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Nevertheless, previous studies often simply compared if CDR3beta\nsequences were equal, while network theory studies were usually limited to\nseveral thousand sequences due to the high computational effort of constructing\nthe network. To overcome that hurdle, we introduce the GPU-based algorithm\nTCR-NET to construct large-scale CDR3beta similarity networks using\nmodel-generated and empirical sequence data with up to 800,000 CDR3beta\nsequences on a normal computer for the first time.

Moreover, we analyze the networks of antigen-specific\nTCRs for different antigen families and find differing clustering coefficients\nand assortativities. TCR-NET offers better access to assess large-scale TCR\nrepertoire networks, opening the possibility to quantify their structure and\nquantitatively distinguish their ability to react to antigens, which we\nanticipate to become a useful tool in a time of increasingly large amounts of\nrepertoire sequencing data becoming available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 12:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

This study is conducted in the frame of Contact\nBinaries Towards Merging (CoBiToM) Project and presents the results from light\ncurve and orbital analysis of 30 ultra-short orbital period contact binaries,\nwith the aim to investigate the possibility of them being red nova progenitors,\neventually producing merger events. Approximately half of the systems exhibit\norbital period modulations, as a result of mass transfer or mass loss\nprocesses.

The present study investigates the orbital stability\nof these systems and examines their physical and orbital parameters in\ncomparison to those of the entire sample of known and well-studied contact\nbinaries, based on combined spectroscopic and photometric analysis. It is found\nthat ultra-short orbital period contact binaries have very stable orbits, while\nvery often additional components are gravitationally bound in wide orbits\naround the central binary system.

Our\nnew method allows for a generalised non-linear mapping between the target\ntransit light curves and the time series used to detrend them.

This is often not\ndesirable for many applications with the inherent label ambiguity even in human\nannotations. This challenge has been addressed by leveraging multiple\nannotations per image and the segmentation uncertainty. However, multiple\nper-image annotations are often not available in a real-world application and\nthe uncertainty does not provide full control on segmentation results to users.\nIn this paper, we propose novel methods to improve the segmentation probability\nestimation without sacrificing performance in a real-world scenario that we\nhave only one ambiguous annotation per image.

Such\nuni-directionality introduces accuracy concerns when there is a sensing\ncapability gap between the uni-directional BFMs for the AP and STA. Thus, this\nreport experimentally evaluates the sensing ability disparity between the\nuni-directional BFMs, and shows that the BFMs transmitted for an AP achieve\nhigher sensing accuracy compared to the BFMs transmitted from the STA when the\nsensing target values are estimated depending on the angle of departure of the\nAP. Secondly, to complement the sensing gap, this paper proposes a\nbi-directional sensing framework, which simultaneously leverages the BFMs\ntransmitted from the AP and STA.

The\nidea of MMUT framework is to split the Encoder into two parts including\nacoustic feature sequences to phoneme-level representation (AF-to-PLR) and\nphoneme-level representation to word-piece-level representation (PLR-to-WPLR).\nIt allows AF-to-PLR to be optimized by an intermediate phoneme-based CTC loss\nto learn the rich phoneme-level context information brought by PMT.\nExperimental results on Uyghur ASR show that the proposed approaches outperform\nobviously the pure PMT. We also conduct experiments on the 960-hour Librispeech\nbenchmark using ESPnet1, which achieves about 10% relative WER reduction on all\nthe test set without LM fusion comparing with the latest official ESPnet1\npre-trained model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 09:57:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 01:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

One might wonder if a system can synchronize with the\nexternal drive when they are not coupled directly. In this paper, we examine\nthis case by considering a composite system consisting of two coupled two-level\nquantum systems, one of which is driven by an external field, while another\ncouples to the driven one. Due to the decoherence caused by environments, the\ncomposite system would stay in a mixed state, and an effective limit cycle is\nformed, so phase locking could occur. We find the phase locking phenomenon in\nthe phase diagram characterized by Husimi $Q$ function, and the synchronization\ncan be generated consequently that we will refer to indirect synchronization.\nThe $S$ function defined in the earlier study can also be used to measure the\nstrength of synchronization. We claim that indirect synchronization is\npossible.

However, they often ignore the\nretrieved exemplars while generating responses or produce responses over-fitted\nto the retrieved exemplars. In this paper, we argue that these drawbacks are\nderived from the one-to-many problem of the open-domain conversation. When the\nretrieved exemplar is relevant to the given context yet significantly different\nfrom the gold response, the exemplar-based generative models are trained to\nignore the exemplar since the exemplar is not helpful for generating the gold\nresponse. On the other hand, when the retrieved exemplar is lexically similar\nto the gold response, the generative models are trained to rely on the exemplar\nhighly. Therefore, we propose a training method selecting exemplars that are\nsemantically relevant to the gold response but lexically distanced from the\ngold response to mitigate the above disadvantages. In the training phase, our\nproposed training method first uses the gold response instead of dialogue\ncontext as a query to select exemplars that are semantically relevant to the\ngold response. And then, it eliminates the exemplars that lexically resemble\nthe gold responses to alleviate the dependency of the generative models on that\nexemplars. The remaining exemplars could be irrelevant to the given context\nsince they are searched depending on the gold response. Thus, our proposed\ntraining method further utilizes the relevance scores between the given context\nand the exemplars to penalize the irrelevant exemplars. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed training method alleviates the drawbacks of the\nexisting exemplar-based generative models and significantly improves the\nperformance in terms of appropriateness and informativeness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Younger Class 0/I objects have enough dust in their embedded\ndisk, which begs the questions: can the first steps of planet formation occur\nin these younger systems? The first step is building the first planetesimals,\ngenerally believed to be the product of the streaming instability. Hence the\nquestion can be restated: are the physical conditions of embedded disks\nconducive to the growth of the streaming instability? Here we model the\ncollapse of a `dusty' proto-stellar cloud to show that if there is sufficient\ndrift between the falling gas and dust, regions of the embedded disk can become\nsufficiently enhanced in dust to drive the streaming instability. We include\nfour models, three with different dust grain sizes and one with a different\ninitial cloud angular momentum to test a variety of collapse trajectories. We\nfind a `sweet spot' for planetesimal formation for grain sizes of a few 10s of\nmicron since they fall sufficiently fast relative to the gas to build a high\ndust-to-gas ratio along the disk midplane, but have slow enough radial drift\nspeeds in the embedded disk to maintain the high dust-to-gas ratio. Unlike the\ngas, which is held in hydrostatic equilibrium for a time due to gas pressure,\nthe dust can begin collapsing from all radii at a much earlier time. The\nstreaming instability can produce at least between 7-35 M$_\\oplus$ of\nplanetesimals in the Class 0/I phase of our smooth embedded disks, depending on\nthe size of the falling dust grains. This first generation of planetesimals\ncould represent the first step in planet formation, and occurs earlier in the\nlifetime of the young star than is traditionally thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Most existing machine learning models typically rely on massive\namounts of labeled training data to achieve high performance. Unfortunately,\nsuch a requirement cannot be met in real-world applications. The number of\nlabels is limited and manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming.\nIt is often necessary to transfer knowledge from an existing labeled domain to\na new domain. However, model performance degrades because of the differences\nbetween domains (domain shift or dataset bias). To overcome the burden of\nannotation, Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to mitigate the domain shift problem\nwhen transferring knowledge from one domain into another similar but different\ndomain. Unsupervised DA (UDA) deals with a labeled source domain and an\nunlabeled target domain. The principal objective of UDA is to reduce the domain\ndiscrepancy between the labeled source data and unlabeled target data and to\nlearn domain-invariant representations across the two domains during training.\nIn this paper, we first define UDA problem. Secondly, we overview the\nstate-of-the-art methods for different categories of UDA from both traditional\nmethods and deep learning based methods. Finally, we collect frequently used\nbenchmark datasets and report results of the state-of-the-art methods of UDA on\nvisual recognition problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

A key open\nsub-problem in CIS that remains unaddressed in the literature is generating\nInformation Seeking Questions (ISQs) based on a short initial query from the\nend-user. To address this open problem, we propose Information SEEking Question\ngenerator (ISEEQ), a novel approach for generating ISQs from just a short user\nquery, given a large text corpus relevant to the user query. Firstly, ISEEQ\nuses a knowledge graph to enrich the user query. Secondly, ISEEQ uses the\nknowledge-enriched query to retrieve relevant context passages to ask coherent\nISQs adhering to a conceptual flow. Thirdly, ISEEQ introduces a new deep\ngenerative-adversarial reinforcement learning-based approach for generating\nISQs. We show that ISEEQ can generate high-quality ISQs to promote the\ndevelopment of CIS agents. ISEEQ significantly outperforms comparable baselines\non five ISQ evaluation metrics across four datasets having user queries from\ndiverse domains. Further, we argue that ISEEQ is transferable across domains\nfor generating ISQs, as it shows the acceptable performance when trained and\ntested on different pairs of domains.

However, the recognition of\nlow-resolution scene text images remains a challenge. Even though some\nsuper-resolution methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they\nusually treat text images as general images while ignoring the fact that the\nvisual quality of strokes (the atomic unit of text) plays an essential role for\ntext recognition. According to Gestalt Psychology, humans are capable of\ncomposing parts of details into the most similar objects guided by prior\nknowledge. Likewise, when humans observe a low-resolution text image, they will\ninherently use partial stroke-level details to recover the appearance of\nholistic characters. Inspired by Gestalt Psychology, we put forward a\nStroke-Aware Scene Text Image Super-Resolution method containing a\nStroke-Focused Module (SFM) to concentrate on stroke-level internal structures\nof characters in text images. Specifically, we attempt to design rules for\ndecomposing English characters and digits at stroke-level, then pre-train a\ntext recognizer to provide stroke-level attention maps as positional clues with\nthe purpose of controlling the consistency between the generated\nsuper-resolution image and high-resolution ground truth. The extensive\nexperimental results validate that the proposed method can indeed generate more\ndistinguishable images on TextZoom and manually constructed Chinese character\ndataset Degraded-IC13. Furthermore, since the proposed SFM is only used to\nprovide stroke-level guidance when training, it will not bring any time\noverhead during the test phase.

The D2D pair bids a price bandwidth\ndemand curve and the SPs offer a price-demand supply curve. Since each player\nis not aware of the strategy of other players in practical scenarios, the game\nis assumed to be an incomplete information repeated one. A best response based\nlearning method is proposed for the decision making procedure of all players,\nthe D2D pair and SPs. It is shown that the proposed method converges to the\nNash equilibrium (NE) point of the game more rapidly than the state-of-the-art\nmethods when the game is played repeatedly. The sensitivity of the proposed\nmethod to the learning rate variable is also less than the state-of-the-art\nmethods and hence can be considered as a robust one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 13:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Since distributed methods can be more\npractical compared to complex centralized schemes, we propose a low-complexity\ndistributed pricing-based resource allocation algorithm to allocate power to\ncellular user equipments (CUEs) and D2D pairs constrained to the minimum\nquality-of-service (QoS) requirements of CUEs and D2D pairs in two phases. The\nprice of each link is set by the base station (BS). CUEs and D2D pairs maximize\ntheir rate-and-interference-dependent utility function by adjusting their power\nin the first phase, while the price of each link is updated at the BS based on\nthe minimum QoS requirements of CUEs and D2D pairs in the second phase. The\nproposed utility function controls D2D admission, hence it is suitable for\ndense scenarios. The proposed method is fast due to the closed-form solution\nfor the first phase power allocation. Numerical results verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method for practical dense beyond 5G scenarios by\nallocating resources to multiple D2D pairs and taking advantage of the spatial\nreuse gain of D2D pairs. Furthermore, the utility function definition is\ndiscussed to illustrate its effectiveness for SE maximization. Finally, the SE\nof the proposed method is compared to other centralized and distributed\nalgorithms to demonstrate the higher sum-rate performance of the proposed\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 14:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Although treating this as a\nregression problem seems straightforward, incorporating various contextual\ninformation such as the semantic category information of each Place-of-Interest\n(POI) is a necessary step, and often the bottleneck, in designing an effective\nmobility prediction model. As opposed to the typical approach, we treat\nforecasting as a translation problem and propose a novel forecasting through a\nlanguage generation pipeline. The paper aims to address the human mobility\nforecasting problem as a language translation task in a sequence-to-sequence\nmanner. A mobility-to-language template is first introduced to describe the\nnumerical mobility data as natural language sentences. The core intuition of\nthe human mobility forecasting translation task is to convert the input\nmobility description sentences into a future mobility description from which\nthe prediction target can be obtained. Under this pipeline, a two-branch\nnetwork, SHIFT (Translating Human Mobility Forecasting), is designed.\nSpecifically, it consists of one main branch for language generation and one\nauxiliary branch to directly learn mobility patterns. During the training, we\ndevelop a momentum mode for better connecting and training the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed SHIFT is effective and presents a new revolutionary approach to\nforecasting human mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 09:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

The well-known backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm\nproposed to train SNNs suffers from large memory footprint and prohibits\nbackward and update unlocking, making it impossible to exploit the potential of\nlocally-supervised training methods. This work proposes an efficient and direct\ntraining algorithm for SNNs that integrates a locally-supervised training\nmethod with a temporally-truncated BPTT algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nexplores both temporal and spatial locality in BPTT and contributes to\nsignificant reduction in computational cost including GPU memory utilization,\nmain memory access and arithmetic operations. We thoroughly explore the design\nspace concerning temporal truncation length and local training block size and\nbenchmark their impact on classification accuracy of different networks running\ndifferent types of tasks. The results reveal that temporal truncation has a\nnegative effect on the accuracy of classifying frame-based datasets, but leads\nto improvement in accuracy on dynamic-vision-sensor (DVS) recorded datasets. In\nspite of resulting information loss, local training is capable of alleviating\noverfitting. The combined effect of temporal truncation and local training can\nlead to the slowdown of accuracy drop and even improvement in accuracy. In\naddition, training deep SNNs models such as AlexNet classifying CIFAR10-DVS\ndataset leads to 7.26% increase in accuracy, 89.94% reduction in GPU memory,\n10.79% reduction in memory access, and 99.64% reduction in MAC operations\ncompared to the standard end-to-end BPTT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 07:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}
