In the case of labeled data and supervised learning, machine training\nconsists in minimizing the loss function subject to different constraints. In\nan abstract setting, it can be formulated as a multiple criteria optimization\nmodel in which each criterion measures the distance between the output\nassociated with a specific input and its label. Therefore, the fitting term is\na vector function and its minimization is intended in the Pareto sense. We\nprovide stability results of the efficient solutions with respect to\nperturbations of input and output data. We then extend the same approach to the\ncase of learning with multiple datasets. The multiple dataset environment is\nrelevant when reducing the bias due to the choice of a specific training set.\nWe propose a scalarization approach to implement this model and numerical\nexperiments in digit classification using MNIST data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 16:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

While many studies have investigated essential\nnetwork members, less attention has been paid to the bipartite graphs. On the\nother hand, one of the most critical aspects of network analysis is the\ndetection and extraction of communities that arise in the structure of\nnetworks. For these reasons, we have introduced a measure called H.H to\nidentify influential nodes in community formation in the one-mode projection of\na bipartite graph. The three main parameters that influence this measure are\nthe size of the formed community, the effect of each node in the formation of\nthat community, and the number of communities in which the node had an impact.\nThe results of this paper show the differences of this measure with other\ncentralities (eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness\ncentrality, and degree centrality) and how this measure takes into account\naspects that other centralities do not. Through H.H score, we can find\nessential nodes that have been effective in forming a community, and by\nremoving these nodes, communities can be eliminated. Any of the existing\ncentralities has not addressed this issue, and this measure has sufficient\nindependence to represent the important nodes in the formation of the\ncommunities. Experimental validation of the proposed measure is carried out on\ntwo real-world datasets: Southern Women Network and Person-Crime Network.

In\nsuch cases, characterization of the feature space dimensionality, geometry and\ntopology can provide guidance for effective model design. The objective of this\nstudy is to compare and contrast two approaches for identifying feature space\nbasis vectors via dimensionality reduction. These approaches can be combined to\nrender a joint characterization that reveals spectral properties not apparent\nusing either approach alone. We use a diverse collection of AVIRIS-NG\nreflectance spectra of the snow-firn-ice continuum to illustrate the utility of\njoint characterization and identify physical properties inferred from the\nspectra. Spectral feature spaces combining principal components (PCs) and\nt-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings (t-SNEs) provide physically\ninterpretable dimensions representing the global (PC) structure of cryospheric\nreflectance properties and local (t-SNE) manifold structures revealing\nclustering not resolved in the global continuum.

In this\nwork, we address an open aspect of automatic crack segmentation problem, that\nof generalizing and improving the performance of segmentation across a variety\nof scenarios, by modeling the problem differently. We carefully study and\nabstract the sub-problems involved and solve them in a broader context, making\nour solution generic. On a variety of datasets related to surveillance of\ndifferent infrastructures, under varying conditions, our model consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin, without\nany bells-and-whistles. This performance advantage easily carried over in two\ndeployments of our model, tested against industry-provided datasets. Even\nfurther, we could establish our model's performance for two manufacturing\nquality inspection scenarios as well, where the defect types are not just crack\nequivalents, but much more and different. Hence we hope that our model is\nindeed a truly generic defect segmentation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 17:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

The dimensionality of spacetime can be defined in various contexts. The\nspectral dimension of spacetime is defined in the context of diffusion\nprocesses on a manifold. We show that a spacetime with zero-point length has\nspectral dimension $3.5$ when the characteristic diffusion time has the size of\nthe zero-point length. The spectral dimension (negatively) diverges for an even\nshorter diffusion time, thus preventing any reliable physical interpretation in\nthe deep ultraviolet regime. The thermodynamic dimension is defined by\nrealizing that the free energy $F(\\beta)$ of a free field or ideal gas at\nfinite temperature ($\\beta^{-1}$) in $D$ dimensions scales as $F\\sim\n\\beta^{-D}$. Using Schwinger's proper time formalism at finite temperature, we\nshow that for spacetime incorporating a zero-point length, the thermodynamic\ndimension reduces to $1.5$ near the Planck scale and then to $1$ in the deep\nultraviolet regime. This signifies a \"phase-transition\" in which a (massless)\nbosonic ideal gas in four dimensions essentially behaves like radiation\n($w=1/3$) at low energies, whereas near the Planck scale, it behaves\nequivalently to having an equation of state parameter $w=2$. Furthermore,\ndimension can be deduced from the potential $V_D(r)$ of interaction between two\npoint-like sources separated at a distance $r$ as its scaling depends on $D$.\nComparing with the scaling behavior of conventional Yukawa-like potentials at\nshort distances, we show that the zero-point length spacetime's ultraviolet\ndimension appears to be either $2$ or $3$ depending on the use of massive or\nmassless force carriers as probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 17:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 10:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 04:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SSGD) 1 is the de facto\nDDL optimization method. Using a sufficiently large batch size is critical to\nachieving DDL runtime speedup. In a large batch setting, the learning rate must\nbe increased to compensate for the reduced number of parameter updates.\nHowever, a large learning rate may harm convergence in SSGD and training could\neasily diverge. Recently, Decentralized Parallel SGD (DPSGD) has been proposed\nto improve distributed training speed. In this paper, we find that DPSGD not\nonly has a system-wise run-time benefit but also a significant convergence\nbenefit over SSGD in the large batch setting. Based on a detailed analysis of\nthe DPSGD learning dynamics, we find that DPSGD introduces additional\nlandscape-dependent noise that automatically adjusts the effective learning\nrate to improve convergence. In addition, we theoretically show that this noise\nsmoothes the loss landscape, hence allowing a larger learning rate. We conduct\nextensive studies over 18 state-of-the-art DL models/tasks and demonstrate that\nDPSGD often converges in cases where SSGD diverges for large learning rates in\nthe large batch setting.

We\nrecently proposed the Constraining and Restoring iterative Algorithm for\nFaraday Tomography (CRAFT; Cooray et al. 2021), a new flexible algorithm that\nshowed significant improvements over the popular methods such as Rotation\nMeasure Synthesis. In this work, we introduce CRAFT+WS, a new version of CRAFT\nincorporating the ideas of wavelets and sparsity. CRAFT+WS exhibit significant\nimprovements over the original CRAFT when tested for a complex FDF of realistic\nGalactic model. Reconstructions of FDFs demonstrate super-resolution in Faraday\ndepth, uncovering previously unseen Faraday complexities in observations. The\nproposed approach will be necessary for effective cosmic magnetism studies\nusing the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 17:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 07:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Our\nmodelling of a semi-flexible filament with a small but finite width is based on\nthe Cosserat theory of elastic rods, which allows for six degrees of freedom at\nevery point on the filament's backbone. In the variational models presented in\nthis paper, a small and discrete set of parameters is used to describe a smooth\nfilament shape having all degrees of freedom allowed in the Cosserat theory.\nTwo main approaches are introduced: one where polynomial spline functions\ndescribe the filament's configuration, and one in which geodesic curves in the\nspace of the configurational degrees of freedom are used.

Since the\nradio emission properties of air showers are well understood, and the\npolarization of the radio signal can be predicted from the arrival direction,\ncosmic rays can be used as a proxy to assess the reconstruction capabilities of\nthe ARIANNA neutrino detector. We report on dedicated efforts of reconstructing\nthe polarization of cosmic-ray radio pulses. After correcting for difference in\nhardware, the two stations used in this study showed similar performance in\nterms of event rate and agreed with simulation. Subselecting high quality\ncosmic rays, the polarizations of these cosmic rays were reconstructed with a\nresolution of $2.5^{\\circ}$ (68% containment), which agrees with the expected\nvalue obtained from simulation. A large fraction of this resolution originates\nfrom uncertainties in the predicted polarization because of the contribution of\nthe subdominant Askaryan effect in addition to the dominant geomagnetic\nemission. Subselecting events with a zenith angle greater than $70^{\\circ}$\nremoves most influence of the Askaryan emission, and, with limited statistics,\nwe found the polarization uncertainty is reduced to $1.3^{\\circ}$ (68%\ncontainment).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 18:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 23:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 02:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 20:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

One reason such complexities arise is because\nstandard visual imitation frameworks try to solve two coupled problems at once:\nlearning a succinct but good representation from the diverse visual data, while\nsimultaneously learning to associate the demonstrated actions with such\nrepresentations. Such joint learning causes an interdependence between these\ntwo problems, which often results in needing large amounts of demonstrations\nfor learning.

By further using the contextual information from the image to prompt\nthe language model, we are able to facilitate our model to better exploit the\npre-trained knowledge. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to\narbitrary dense prediction systems and various pre-trained visual backbones\nincluding both CLIP models and ImageNet pre-trained models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of our methods on semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

The latter cannot be created\nby finite-depth circuits, underscoring the nonlocal nature of Schr\\\"odinger cat\nstates, topological order, and quantum criticality. Remarkably, examples are\nknown where LRE is obtained by performing single-site measurements on SRE, such\nas the toric code from measuring a sublattice of a 2D cluster state. However, a\nsystematic understanding of when and how measurements of SRE give rise to LRE\nis still lacking. Here we establish that LRE appears upon performing\nmeasurements on symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- of which the\ncluster state is one example. For instance, we show how to implement the\nKramers-Wannier transformation, by adding a cluster SPT to an input state\nfollowed by measurement. This transformation naturally relates states with SRE\nand LRE. An application is the realization of double-semion order when the\ninput state is the $\\mathbb Z_2$ Levin-Gu SPT. Similarly, the addition of\nfermionic SPTs and measurement leads to an implementation of the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation of a general state. More generally, we argue that a large class\nof SPT phases protected by $G \\times H$ symmetry gives rise to anomalous LRE\nupon measuring $G$-charges. This introduces a new practical tool for using SPT\nphases as resources for creating LRE, and uncovers the classification result\nthat all states related by sequentially gauging Abelian groups or by\nJordan-Wigner transformation are in the same equivalence class, once we augment\nfinite-depth circuits with single-site measurements. In particular, any\ntopological or fracton order with a solvable finite gauge group can be obtained\nfrom a product state in this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 18:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 17:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

ReLabel, a recently proposed solution,\nsuggests creating a label map for the entire image. During training, it\nreceives the cropped region-level label by RoI aligning on a pre-generated\nentire label map, allowing for efficient supervision generation without having\nto pass through the teachers many times. However, as the KD teachers are from\nconventional multi-crop training, there are various mismatches between the\nglobal label-map and region-level label in this technique, resulting in\nperformance deterioration. In this study, we present a Fast Knowledge\nDistillation (FKD) framework that replicates the distillation training phase\nand generates soft labels using the multi-crop KD approach, while training\nfaster than ReLabel since no post-processes such as RoI align and softmax\noperations are used.

The low velocity dispersion suggests either a dark halo mass\nmuch lower than the minimum expected from hydrogen cooling limit arguments, or\none that is in the late stages of extreme tidal stripping. The tidal\ninterpretation has been favoured in recent work and is supported by the small\npericentric distances consistent with available kinematic estimates. We use\nN-body simulations to examine this interpretation in detail, assuming a\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for Crater II's progenitor halo. Our main\nfinding is that, although the low velocity dispersion can indeed result from\nthe effect of tides, the large size of Crater II is inconsistent with this\nhypothesis. This is because galaxies stripped to match the observed velocity\ndispersion are also reduced to sizes much smaller than the observed half-light\nradius of Crater II. Unless its size has been substantially overestimated,\nreconciling this system with LCDM requires that either (i) it is not bound and\nnear equilibrium (unlikely, given its crossing time is shorter than the time\nelapsed since pericentre), or that (ii) its progenitor halo deviates from the\nassumed NFW profile. The latter alternative may signal that baryons can affect\nthe inner halo cusp even in extremely faint dwarfs or, more intriguingly, may\nsignal effects associated with the intimate nature of the dark matter, such as\nfinite self-interactions, or other such deviations from the canonical LCDM\nparadigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 17:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Rapidly accreting sBHs launch winds and/or jets via\nthe Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which produce high-pressure shocks and cocoons.\nSuch a shock and cocoon can spread laterally in the plane of the disk, eject\nthe outer regions of a circum-sBH disk (CsBD) and puncture a hole in the AGN\ndisk with horizontal size comparable to the disk scale-height.

The S\\'ersic profile is a widely-used model to describe the surface\nbrightness distribution of galaxies. Spiral galaxies, however, are\nqualitatively different from a S\\'ersic model.\n  Aims. The goal of this study is to assess how accurately the total flux and\nhalf-light radius of a galaxy with spiral arms can be recovered when fitted\nwith a S\\'ersic profile.\n  Methods. I selected a sample of bulge-dominated galaxies with spiral arms.\nUsing photometric data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, I estimated the\ncontribution of the spiral arms to their total flux. Then I generated simulated\nimages of galaxies with similar characteristics, fitted them with a S\\'ersic\nmodel, and quantified the error on the determination of the total flux and\nhalf-light radius.\n  Results. Spiral arms can introduce biases on the photometry of galaxies in a\nway that depends on the underlying smooth surface brightness profile, the\nlocation of the arms, and the depth of the photometric data. A set of spiral\narms accounting for 10% of the flux of a bulge-dominated galaxy typically\ncauses the total flux and the half-light radius to be overestimated by 15% and\n30%, respectively. This bias, however, is much smaller if the galaxy is\ndisk-dominated.\n  Conclusions. Galaxies with a prominent bulge and a non-zero contribution from\nspiral arms are the most susceptible to biases in the total flux and half-light\nradius, when fitted with a S\\'ersic profile.

The utility of a sample is a scalar\nmultiple of its accuracy minus the response time (difference of the departure\nslot and the arrival slot), where the departure slot is also decided by the\nalgorithm. Since each classifier can label at most one sample per slot, there\nis a tradeoff between obtaining a larger set of labels for a particular sample\nto improve its accuracy, and its response time. The problem of maximizing the\nsum of the utilities of all samples is considered, where learning the confusion\nmatrices, sample-classifier matching assignment, and sample departure slot\ndecisions depend on each other.

We investigated whether these features can be explained in terms of\neither gas stream overflow or penetration within the frameworks of the\ndisk-instability (DIM) and the mass-transfer instability (MTIM) models of\noutbursting disks. Gas stream overflow is not possible because the vertical\nscaleheight of the stream is significantly lower than that of the outer disk\nand because there is no combination of parameters which enables stream overflow\non a larger disk while preventing it on a smaller disk. Stream penetration\nrequires the gas stream to be denser than the outer disk regions. This\nrequirement cannot be met by a low-viscosity DIM disk because its density is\nsignificantly larger than that of the gas stream over the whole range of mass\ntransfer rates where the thermal-viscous instability occurs. On the other hand,\nthe high-viscosity MTIM disk has much lower densities which decrease with\nincreasing radius, easily allowing for gas stream penetration during outbursts\n(when mass transfer rate and stream density increase) as well as in large\nquiescent disks. The observed features are not consistent with DIM, but can be\nplausibly explained by MTIM. These results suggest that the outbursts of YZ LMi\nare the response of a high-viscosity disk to bursts of enhanced mass transfer\nrate. In this case, the outburst decline timescale of (2-3) d implies a\nviscosity parameter in the range alpha=3-4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 19:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Unlike documenting\nfeature updates and bug fixes, little is known about how developers document\ntheir refactoring activities. Developers can perform multiple refactoring\noperations, including moving methods, extracting classes, for various reasons.\nYet, there is no systematic study that analyzes the extent to which the\ndocumentation of refactoring accurately describes the refactoring operations\nperformed at the source code level. Therefore, this paper challenges the\nability of refactoring documentation to adequately predict the refactoring\ntypes, performed at the commit level. Our analysis relies on the text mining of\ncommit messages to extract the corresponding features that better represent\neach class. The extraction of text patterns, specific to each refactoring\nallows the design of a model that verifies the consistency of these patterns\nwith their corresponding refactoring.

Gaia19bld was discovered by the Gaia satellite and was\nsubsequently intensively followed up with a network of ground-based\nobservatories and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We collected multiple\nhigh-resolution spectra with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-Shooter to\ncharacterise the source star. The event was also observed with VLT\nInterferometer (VLTI)/PIONIER during the peak.

We find the best-fitting solution\nwith parallax and finite source effects. We derived the limit on the luminosity\nof the lens based on the blended light model and spectroscopic distance.

Our results are consistent with interferometric\nmeasurements of the angular Einstein radius, emphasising that interferometry\ncan be a new channel for determining the masses of objects that would otherwise\nremain undetectable, including stellar-mass black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 21:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Most prior works focus on vulnerability techniques that use an\napproximation of attack surfaces and there has not been many attempt to create\na comprehensive list of attack surface components. Although limited number of\nstudies have focused on attack surface analysis, they defined attack surface\ncomponents based on project specific hypotheses to evaluate security risk of\nspecific types of software applications. In this study, we leverage a\nqualitative analysis approach to empirically identify an extensive list of\nattack surface components. To this end, we conduct a Grounded Theory (GT)\nanalysis on 1444 previously published vulnerability reports and weaknesses with\na team of three software developers and security experts. We extract\nvulnerability information from two publicly available repositories: 1) Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures, and 2) Common Weakness Enumeration. We ask three\nkey questions: where the attacks come from, what they target, and how they\nemerge, and to help answer these questions we define three core categories for\nattack surface components: Entry points, Targets, and Mechanisms. We extract\nattack surface concepts related to each category from collected vulnerability\ninformation using the GT analysis and provide a comprehensive categorization\nthat represents attack surface components of software systems from various\nperspectives. The comparison of the proposed attack surface model with the\nliterature shows in the best case previous works cover only 50% of the attack\nsurface components at network level and only 6.7% of the components at code\nlevel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 23:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 15:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

However, FL-based frameworks are constrained by\ncomputational resources at clients due to the exploding growth of model\nparameters (eg. billion parameter model). Split learning (SL), a recent\nframework, reduces client compute load by splitting the model training between\nclient and server. This flexibility is extremely useful for low-compute setups\nbut is often achieved at cost of increase in bandwidth consumption and may\nresult in sub-optimal convergence, especially when client data is\nheterogeneous. In this work, we introduce AdaSplit which enables efficiently\nscaling SL to low resource scenarios by reducing bandwidth consumption and\nimproving performance across heterogeneous clients. To capture and benchmark\nthis multi-dimensional nature of distributed deep learning, we also introduce\nC3-Score, a metric to evaluate performance under resource budgets. We validate\nthe effectiveness of AdaSplit under limited resources through extensive\nexperimental comparison with strong federated and split learning baselines.

The\nlinearized Euler equations are Fourier transformed to give the Pridmore-Brown\nequation, for which the Greens function is constructed using Frobenius series.\nInverting the spatial Fourier transform, the critical layer contribution is\ngiven as the non-modal contribution from integrating around the continuous\nspectrum branch cut.

Overall, the contribution from the critical layer is found to\ngive a neutrally stable non-modal wave with a phase velocity equal to the mean\nflow velocity at the source when the source is located within the sheared-flow\nregion, and to decay algebraically along the duct as $O(x^{-5/2})$ for a source\nlocated with the uniform flow region.

Next, we investigate a variant of continual\nlearning which supposes the same target function in multiple tasks. Even for\nthe same target, the trained model shows some transfer and forgetting depending\non the sample size of each task. We can guarantee that the generalization error\nmonotonically decreases from task to task for equal sample sizes while\nunbalanced sample sizes deteriorate the generalization. We respectively refer\nto these improvement and deterioration as self-knowledge transfer and\nforgetting, and empirically confirm them in realistic training of deep neural\nnetworks as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 00:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 01:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution\nassociated with a class of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. It has\nbeen suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear\nCross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a\n\"benign\" setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is\nassumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the\nfidelity. Second, in an \"adversarial\" setting where all possible classical\nalgorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively\nhigh XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We\npresent an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields\nhigh XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying\nand exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values\nwithout full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features\nbetter scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly\nstudied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our\nalgorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in\nwhich the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We\nillustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits\nin various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of\nnoise. Our results show that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on\nseveral conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be\nassumed in the adversarial setting.

PCM has asymmetric access energy; writes dominate reads. MLC asymmetry\ncan vary by an order of magnitude. Many schemes have been developed to take\nadvantage of the asymmetric patterns of 0s and 1s in the data to reduce write\nenergy. Because the memory is non-volatile, data can be recovered via physical\nattack or across system reboot cycles. To protect information stored in PCM\nagainst these attacks requires encryption. Unfortunately, most encryption\nalgorithms scramble 0s and 1s in the data, effectively removing any patterns\nand negatively impacting schemes that leverage data bias and similarity to\nreduce write energy. In this paper, we introduce Virtual Coset Coding (VCC) as\na workload-independent approach that reduces costly symbol transitions for\nstoring encrypted data. VCC is based on two ideas. First, using coset encoding\nwith random coset candidates, it is possible to effectively reduce the\nfrequency of costly bit/symbol transitions when writing encrypted data. Second,\na small set of random substrings can be used to achieve the same encoding\nefficiency as a large number of random coset candidates, but at a much lower\nencoding/decoding cost. Additionally, we demonstrate how VCC can be leveraged\nfor energy reduction in combination with fault-mitigation and fault-tolerance\nto dramatically increase the lifetimes of endurance-limited NVMs, such as PCM.\nWe evaluate the design of VCC and demonstrate that it can be implemented\non-chip with only a nominal area overhead. VCC reduces dynamic energy by 22-28%\nwhile maintaining the same performance. Using our multi-objective optimization\napproach achieves at least a 36% improvement in lifetime over the\nstate-of-the-art and at least a 50% improvement in lifetime vs. an unencoded\nmemory, while maintaining its energy savings and system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 00:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Accordingly, this project looks into developing models for evaluating\npower curve tables for Darrieus turbines and synthesizing wind speed scenarios.\nAnalytical and numerical models for Darrieus turbines have been presented, and\nthe ability to evaluate power curve tables from both models has been\ndemonstrated. Double-Multiple Streamtube model was implemented for the\nanalytical modelling, and 2-D CFD simulations on OpenFOAM were developed for\nthe numerical modelling. The analytical model was found to fail for small-sized\nturbines, likely due to poor lift and drag coefficient values at high local\nangles of attack, but matched sufficiently with experimental results for\nlarge-sized turbines. Numerical simulations for Darrieus turbines were of two\ntypes - torque evaluation at constant wind speed and angular velocity, and\nstarting characteristics for constant wind speed. Auto-regressive moving\naverage models were implemented to characterize historical wind speed\nmeasurements, thus synthesizing wind speed scenarios. For this, the wind speeds\nor wind speed residuals (following detrending) were first normalized using the\ncumulative distribution functions, following which an ARMA model was fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 00:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Motivated by the proverb \"A picture is worth a\nthousand words\" we aim to accelerate the ViT model by making a long image\nshort. To this end, we propose a novel approach to assign token length\nadaptively during inference. Specifically, we first train a ViT model, called\nResizable-ViT (ReViT), that can process any given input with diverse token\nlengths. Then, we retrieve the \"token-length label\" from ReViT and use it to\ntrain a lightweight Token-Length Assigner (TLA). The token-length labels are\nthe smallest number of tokens to split an image that the ReViT can make the\ncorrect prediction, and TLA is learned to allocate the optimal token length\nbased on these labels. The TLA enables the ReViT to process the image with the\nminimum sufficient number of tokens during inference. Thus, the inference speed\nis boosted by reducing the token numbers in the ViT model. Our approach is\ngeneral and compatible with modern vision transformer architectures and can\nsignificantly reduce computational expanse.

We report the performance, over temperatures\nfrom 140 - 240 K, of a radiation hardened SRI 4Kx2K back-side illuminated CMOS\nimage sensor with surface treatments that make it highly sensitive in blue and\nUV bands. After suppressing emission from glow sites resulting from defects in\nthe engineering grade device examined in this work, a 0.077 me-/s dark current\nfloor is reached at 160 K, rising to 1 me$^-$/s at 184 K, rivaling that of the\nbest CCDs.

A known challenge with\nmulti-label classification is the long-tailed distribution of labels. Many\nstudies focus on improving the overall predictions of the model and thus do not\nprioritise tail-end labels. Improving the tail-end label predictions in\nmulti-label classifications of medical text enables the potential to understand\npatients better and improve care. The knowledge gained by one or more\ninfrequent labels can impact the cause of medical decisions and treatment\nplans. This research presents variations of concatenated domain-specific\nlanguage models, including multi-BioMed-Transformers, to achieve two primary\ngoals. First, to improve F1 scores of infrequent labels across multi-label\nproblems, especially with long-tail labels; second, to handle long medical text\nand multi-sourced electronic health records (EHRs), a challenging task for\nstandard transformers designed to work on short input sequences. A vital\ncontribution of this research is new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results obtained\nusing TransformerXL for predicting medical codes. A variety of experiments are\nperformed on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)\ndatabase.

A principal way of\nachieving few-shot learning is to realize an embedding where samples from\ndifferent classes are distinctive. Recent studies suggest that embedding via\nhyperbolic geometry enjoys low distortion for hierarchical and structured data,\nmaking it suitable for few-shot learning. In this paper, we propose to learn a\ncontext-aware hyperbolic metric to characterize the distance between a point\nand a set associated with a learned set to set distance. To this end, we\nformulate the metric as a weighted sum on the tangent bundle of the hyperbolic\nspace and develop a mechanism to obtain the weights adaptively and based on the\nconstellation of the points. This not only makes the metric local but also\ndependent on the task in hand, meaning that the metric will adapt depending on\nthe samples that it compares.

However, their sensitivity to\nadversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating\nsuch adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the\nresistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given\nrise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware\nexample Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware\nvariants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within\nAMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box\nmethods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with\nthe malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most\nmalware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating\nnon-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice\ndue to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal\nlanguage model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to\nmalware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte\nsequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). Our proposed\nmethod, MalGPT, significantly outperformed the leading benchmark methods on a\nreal-world malware dataset obtained from VirusTotal, achieving over 24.51\\%\nevasion rate. MalGPT enables cybersecurity researchers to develop advanced\ndefense capabilities by emulating large-scale realistic AMG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 05:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Blazars have very complex\nvariability properties. Flares, namely flux variations around the mean value\nwith a well-defined shape and duration, are one of the identifying properties\nof the blazar phenomenon. Blazars are known to exhibit multi-wavelength flares,\nbut also \"orphan\" flares, namely flux changes that appear only in a specific\nenergy range. Various models, sometimes at odds with each other, have been\nproposed to explain specific flares even for a single source, and cannot be\nsynthesized into a coherent picture. In this paper, we propose a unified model\nfor explaining orphan and multi-wavelength flares from blazars in a common\nframework. We assume that the blazar emission during a flare consists of two\ncomponents: (i) a quasi-stable component that arises from the superposition of\nnumerous but comparatively weak dissipation zones along the jet, forming the\nbackground (low-state) emission of the blazar, and (ii) a transient component,\nwhich is responsible for the sudden enhancement of the blazar flux, forming at\na random distance along the jet by a strong energy dissipation event. Whether a\nmulti-wavelength or orphan flare is emitted depends on the distance from the\nbase of the jet where the dissipation occurs. Generally speaking, if the\ndissipation occurs at a small/large distance from the supermassive black hole,\nthe inverse Compton/synchrotron radiation dominates and an orphan\ngamma-ray/optical flare tends to appear. On the other hand, we may expect a\nmulti-wavelength flare if the dissipation occurs at an intermediate distance.\nWe show that the model can successfully describe the spectral energy\ndistribution of different flares from the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 and\nthe BL Lac object PKS 2155-304.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 06:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Our architectures are built of standard (backbone)\narchitectures with the appropriate frame averaging to make them equivariant.\nTesting our framework on both rigid shapes dataset using implicit neural\nrepresentations, and articulated shape datasets using mesh-based neural\nnetworks show state-of-the-art generalization to unseen test shapes, improving\nrelevant baselines by a large margin. In particular, our method demonstrates\nsignificant improvement in generalizing to unseen articulated poses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 06:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 19:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Recently, unsupervised approaches have been explored to eliminate\nthe reliance on paired training data. However, they perform erratically in\ndiverse real-world scenarios due to the absence of priors. To address this\nissue, we propose an unsupervised low-light image enhancement method based on\nan effective prior termed histogram equalization prior (HEP). Our work is\ninspired by the interesting observation that the feature maps of histogram\nequalization enhanced image and the ground truth are similar. Specifically, we\nformulate the HEP to provide abundant texture and luminance information.\nEmbedded into a Light Up Module (LUM), it helps to decompose the low-light\nimages into illumination and reflectance maps, and the reflectance maps can be\nregarded as restored images. However, the derivation based on Retinex theory\nreveals that the reflectance maps are contaminated by noise. We introduce a\nNoise Disentanglement Module (NDM) to disentangle the noise and content in the\nreflectance maps with the reliable aid of unpaired clean images. Guided by the\nhistogram equalization prior and noise disentanglement, our method can recover\nfiner details and is more capable to suppress noise in real-world low-light\nscenarios.

However, in regard to HSI\nclassification, a large number of labeled samples is generally difficult to\nacquire due to the difficulty and time-consuming nature of manual labeling.\nTherefore, many research works focus on building a deep learning model for HSI\nclassification with few labeled samples. In this article, we concentrate on\nthis topic and provide a systematic review of the relevant literature.\nSpecifically, the contributions of this paper are twofold.

To address this Sim2Real gap, we propose a\nnovel texture generation network that maps the simulated images into\nphotorealistic tactile images that resemble a real sensor contacting a real\nimperfect object. Each simulated tactile image is first divided into two types\nof regions: areas that are in contact with the object and areas that are not.\nThe former is applied with generated textures learned from real textures in the\nreal tactile images, whereas the latter maintains its appearance as when the\nsensor is not in contact with any object.

Understanding the\nproperties of these materials when integrated with the more traditional\nthree-dimensional (3D) semiconductors is an important challenge for the\nimplementation of ultra-thin electronic devices. Recent observations have shown\nthat by combining MoS$_2$ with GaAs it is possible to develop high quality\nphotodetectors and solar cells. Here, we present a study of the effects of\nintrinsic GaAs, p-doped GaAs, and n-doped GaAs substrates on the\nphotoluminescence of monolayer MoS$_2$. We observe a decrease of an order of\nmagnitude in the emission intensity of MoS$_2$ in all MoS$_2$/GaAs\nheterojunctions, when compared to a control sample consisting of a MoS$_2$\nmonolayer isolated from GaAs by a few layers of hexagonal boron nitride. We\nalso see a dependence of the trion to A-exciton emission ratio in the\nphotoluminescence spectra on the type of substrate, a dependence that we relate\nto the static charge exchange between MoS$_2$ and the substrates when the\njunction is formed. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy measurements of the\nheterojunctions suggest type-I band alignments, so that excitons generated on\nthe MoS$_2$ monolayer will be transferred to the GaAs substrate.

The two phase flow is simulated by two coupled flow solvers, i.e.,\nthe gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for the gas phase and unified gas-kinetic\nwave-particle method (UGKWP) for the particle phase. The GKS is a second-order\nNavier-Stokes flow solver for the continuum flow. The UGKWP is a multiscale\nmethod for all flow regimes. The wave and particle decomposition in UGKWP\ndepends on the cell's Knudsen number (Kn). At a small Kn number, the high\nconcentrated solid particle phase will be modeled by the Eulerian hydrodynamic\nwave due to the intensive particle-particle collisions. At a large Kn number,\nthe dilute solid particle will be sampled and followed by the Lagrangian\nparticle formulation to capture the non-equilibrium transport. In the\ntransition regime, the distribution and evolution of particle and wave in UGKWP\nare controlled by the local Kn number with a smooth transition between the\nabove limits.

While cameras, Lidars and other remote sensors\ncan assess a scene globally and instantly, tactile sensors can reduce their\nmeasurement uncertainties and gain information about the local physical\ninteractions between the in-contact objects and the robot, that are often not\naccessible via remote sensing. Tactile sensors can be grouped into two main\ncategories: electronic tactile skins and camera based optical tactile sensors.\nThe former are slim and can be fitted to different body parts, whereas the\nlatter assume a more prismatic shape and have much higher sensing resolutions,\noffering a good advantage for being used as robotic fingers or fingertips. One\nof such optical tactile sensors is our GelTip sensor that is shaped as a finger\nand can sense contacts on any location of its surface. As such, the GelTip\nsensor is able to detect contacts from all the directions, like a human finger.\nTo capture these contacts, it uses a camera installed at its base to track the\ndeformations of the opaque elastomer that covers its hollow, rigid and\ntransparent body. Thanks to this design, a gripper equipped with GelTip sensors\nis capable of simultaneously monitoring contacts happening inside and outside\nits grasp closure.

One way to handle\nthis problem is lifting the 2-dimensional time-frequency representation to a\n3-dimensional representation, called time-frequency-chirp rate (TFC)\nrepresentation, by adding one extra chirp rate parameter so that crossover\nfrequencies are disentangled in higher dimension. The chirplet transform is an\nalgorithm for this lifting idea, which leads to a TFC representation. However,\nin practice, we found that it has a strong ``blurring'' effect in the chirp\nrate axis, which limits its application in real-world data. Moreover, to our\nknowledge, we have limited mathematical understanding of the chirplet transform\nin the literature. Motivated by the need for the real-world data analysis, in\nthis paper, we propose the synchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT) that\nenhances the TFC representation given by the chirplet transform. The resulting\nconcentrated TFC representation has high contrast so that one can better\ndistinguish different modes with crossover instantaneous frequencies. The basic\nidea is to use the phase information in the chirplet transform to determine a\nreassignment rule that sharpens the TFC representation determined by the\nchirplet transform. We also analyze the chirplet transform and provide\ntheoretical guarantees of SCT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 11:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 21:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In these studies, acquisition of the VSC's PSS\nconditions is a necessary precondition for proper linearization and stability\nanalysis, and the efficiency of this process is particularly important for\nparametric studies.

Surprisingly, here we find that\nboth the particle-hole symmetry and the dispersive nature of nonreciprocal\nphotonic materials may lead to situations where the usual topological methods\nbreak-down and the Chern topology becomes ill-defined. It is shown that due to\nthe divergence of the density of photonic states in plasmonic systems the gap\nChern numbers can be non-integer notwithstanding that the relevant parametric\nspace is compact. In order that the topology of a dispersive photonic crystal\nis well defined, it is essential to take into account the nonlocal effects in\nthe bulk-materials. We propose two different regularization methods to fix the\nencountered problems. Our results highlight that the regularized topologies may\ndepend critically on the response of the bulk materials for large k.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 12:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The idea of edge computing also makes intelligent services sink\nlocally. But in actual scenarios like dynamic edge computing networks (DECN),\ndue to fluctuations in available computing resources of intermediate servers\nand changes in bandwidth during data transmission, service reliability becomes\ndifficult to guarantee. Coupled with changes in the amount of data in a\nservice, the above three problems all make the existing reliability evaluation\nmethods no longer accurate. To study the effect of distributed service\ndeployment strategies under such a background, this paper proposes a\nreliability evaluation method (REMR) based on lower boundary rule under time\nconstraint to study the degree of the rationality of a service deployment plan\ncombined with DECN.

However, we discover that current image rain and noise\nremoval methods result in low utilization of images. To alleviate the reliance\nof deep models on large labeled datasets, we propose the task-driven image rain\nand noise removal (TRNR) based on a patch analysis strategy. The patch analysis\nstrategy samples image patches with various spatial and statistical properties\nfor training and can increase image utilization. Furthermore, the patch\nanalysis strategy encourages us to introduce the N-frequency-K-shot learning\ntask for the task-driven approach TRNR. TRNR allows neural networks to learn\nfrom numerous N-frequency-K-shot learning tasks, rather than from a large\namount of data.

To\nprescribe routes that incorporate this tacit knowledge, a data-driven model is\nproposed that aligns well with the hierarchical structure of delivery data\nwherein each stop belongs to a zone - a geographical area. First, on the global\nlevel, a zone sequence is established as a result of a minimization over a cost\nmatrix which is a weighted combination of historical information and distances\n(travel times) between zones. Subsequently, within zones, sequences of stops\nare determined, such that, integrated with the predetermined zone sequence, a\nfull solution is obtained.\n  The methodology is particularly promising as it propels itself within the\ntop-tier of submissions to the Last-Mile Routing Research Challenge, while it\nmaintains an elegant decomposition that ensures a feasible implementation into\npractice. The concurrence between prescribed and realized routes underpins the\nadequateness of a hierarchical breakdown of the problem and the fact that\ndrivers make a series of locally optimal decisions when navigating.\nFurthermore, experimenting with the balance between historical information and\ndistance exposes that historic information is pivotal in deciding a starting\nzone of a route. The experiments also reveal that at the end of a route,\nhistorical information can best be discarded, making the time it takes to\nreturn to the station the primary concern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 14:38:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 08:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

However, there remain unexplored problems about pseudo-label\ninaccuracy incurred by wrong category predictions on target domain, and\ndistribution deviation caused by overfitting on source domain. In this paper,\nwe propose a model-agnostic two-stage learning framework, which greatly reduces\nflawed model predictions using soft pseudo-label strategy and avoids\noverfitting on source domain with a curriculum learning strategy.\nTheoretically, it successfully decreases the combined risk in the upper bound\nof expected error on the target domain. At the first stage, we train a model\nwith distribution alignment-based UDA method to obtain soft semantic label on\ntarget domain with rather high confidence. To avoid overfitting on source\ndomain, at the second stage, we propose a curriculum learning strategy to\nadaptively control the weighting between losses from the two domains so that\nthe focus of the training stage is gradually shifted from source distribution\nto target distribution with prediction confidence boosted on the target domain.\nExtensive experiments on two well-known benchmark datasets validate the\nuniversal effectiveness of our proposed framework on promoting the performance\nof the top-ranked UDA algorithms and demonstrate its consistent superior\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 14:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

The coverage is characterized\nvia neurons having certain outputs, or the discrepancy between neuron outputs.\nNevertheless, recent research indicates that neuron coverage criteria show\nlittle correlation with test suite quality.\n  In general, DNNs approximate distributions, by incorporating hierarchical\nlayers, to make predictions for inputs. Thus, we champion to deduce DNN\nbehaviors based on its approximated distributions from a layer perspective. A\ntest suite should be assessed using its induced layer output distributions.\nAccordingly, to fully examine DNN behaviors, input mutation should be directed\ntoward diversifying the approximated distributions.\n  This paper summarizes eight design requirements for DNN coverage criteria,\ntaking into account distribution properties and practical concerns.

NLC treats a single DNN layer as the basic computational unit\n(rather than a single neuron) and captures four critical properties of neuron\noutput distributions. Thus, NLC accurately describes how DNNs comprehend inputs\nvia approximated distributions.

Claude Shannon, as the father of the\ninformation age, gave us a theory of communications that quantified an \"amount\nof information,\" but, as he pointed out, \"no concept of information itself was\ndefined.\" Logical entropy provides that definition. Logical entropy is the\nnatural measure of the notion of information based on distinctions,\ndifferences, distinguishability, and diversity. It is the (normalized)\nquantitative measure of the distinctions of a partition on a set--just as the\nBoole-Laplace logical probability is the normalized quantitative measure of the\nelements of a subset of a set. And partitions and subsets are mathematically\ndual concepts--so the logic of partitions is dual in that sense to the usual\nBoolean logic of subsets, and hence the name \"logical entropy.\" The logical\nentropy of a partition has a simple interpretation as the probability that a\ndistinction or dit (elements in different blocks) is obtained in two\nindependent draws from the underlying set. The Shannon entropy is shown to also\nbe based on this notion of information-as-distinctions; it is the average\nminimum number of binary partitions (bits) that need to be joined to make all\nthe same distinctions of the given partition. Hence all the concepts of simple,\njoint, conditional, and mutual logical entropy can be transformed into the\ncorresponding concepts of Shannon entropy by a uniform non-linear dit-bit\ntransform. And finally logical entropy linearizes naturally to the\ncorresponding quantum concept. The quantum logical entropy of an observable\napplied to a state is the probability that two different eigenvalues are\nobtained in two independent projective measurements of that observable on that\nstate.\n  Keywords: logical entropy, Shannon entropy, partitions, MaxEntropy, quantum\nlogical entropy, von Neumann entropy\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 15:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Due to occurring metal artifacts, the\nquality of this evaluation heavily depends on the performance of so-called\nMetal Artifact Reduction methods (MAR). The majority of these MAR methods\nrequire prior segmentation of the inserted metal objects. Therefore, typically\na rather simple thresholding-based segmentation method in the reconstructed 3D\nvolume is applied, despite some major disadvantages. With this publication, the\npotential of shifting the segmentation task to a learning-based,\nview-consistent 2D projection-based method on the downstream MAR's outcome is\ninvestigated. For segmenting the present metal, a rather simple learning-based\n2D projection-wise segmentation network that is trained using real data\nacquired during cadaver studies, is examined. To overcome the disadvantages\nthat come along with a 2D projection-wise segmentation, a Consistency Filter is\nproposed. The influence of the shifted segmentation domain is investigated by\ncomparing the results of the standard fsMAR with a modified fsMAR version using\nthe new segmentation masks. With a quantitative and qualitative evaluation on\nreal cadaver data, the investigated approach showed an increased MAR\nperformance and a high insensitivity against metal artifacts. For cases with\nmetal outside the reconstruction's FoV or cases with vanishing metal, a\nsignificant reduction in artifacts could be shown. Thus, increases of up to\nroughly 3 dB w.r.t. the mean PSNR metric over all slices and up to 9 dB for\nsingle slices were achieved. The shown results reveal a beneficial influence of\nthe shift to a 2D-based segmentation method on real data for downstream use\nwith a MAR method, like the fsMAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 15:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The\nchallenge in developing these networks lies in the nonlinearity of the\nembedding space namely, the Hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space is a homogeneous\nRiemannian manifold of the Lorentz group. Most existing methods (with some\nexceptions) use local linearization to define a variety of operations\nparalleling those used in traditional deep neural networks in Euclidean spaces.\nIn this paper, we present a novel fully hyperbolic neural network which uses\nthe concept of projections (embeddings) followed by an intrinsic aggregation\nand a nonlinearity all within the hyperbolic space. The novelty here lies in\nthe projection which is designed to project data on to a lower-dimensional\nembedded hyperbolic space and hence leads to a nested hyperbolic space\nrepresentation independently useful for dimensionality reduction. The main\ntheoretical contribution is that the proposed embedding is proved to be\nisometric and equivariant under the Lorentz transformations. This projection is\ncomputationally efficient since it can be expressed by simple linear\noperations, and, due to the aforementioned equivariance property, it allows for\nweight sharing. The nested hyperbolic space representation is the core\ncomponent of our network and therefore, we first compare this ensuing nested\nhyperbolic space representation with other dimensionality reduction methods\nsuch as tangent PCA, principal geodesic analysis (PGA) and HoroPCA. Based on\nthis equivariant embedding, we develop a novel fully hyperbolic graph\nconvolutional neural network architecture to learn the parameters of the\nprojection.

The method works as a pre-processing step in which the continuous\nvalues of the variable to be regressed are discretized into a set of intervals\nwhich are then used to define value thresholds. Then classifiers are trained to\npredict whether the value to be regressed is less than or equal to each of\nthese thresholds. The different outputs of the classifiers are then\nconcatenated in the form of an additional vector of variables that enriches the\ninitial vector of the regression problem. The implemented system can thus be\nconsidered as a generic pre-processing tool. We tested the proposed enrichment\nmethod with 5 types of regressors and evaluated it in 33 regression datasets.\nOur experimental results confirm the interest of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 10:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 11:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

The existing system needs improvement in solving\nreal-time network traffic issues along with feature engineering. Our proposed\nwork overcomes these challenges by giving promising results using deep-stacked\nautoencoders in two stages.

This easily shows that the 1.5 order formalism is flawed\nfor all theories. The 1.5 algebra naively appears to close. However, when it is\nanalyzed in detail, in a simple model, where easy calculations are available,\nthe 1.5 formalism always generates an invalid BRS operator, which is not even\nnilpotent. This clearly is also the case for supergravity. It follows that a\nrevised and completed set of nilpotent first order supergravity transformations\nis needed to properly understand 3+1 dimensional supergravity.
