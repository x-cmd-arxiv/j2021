This sample has previously been found to exhibit spectral\npeaks at observed-frame frequencies above $\\sim$1 GHz. We also present upgraded\nGiant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) band-2 (200 MHz), band-3 (400 MHz), and\nband-4 (650 MHz) radio continuum observations toward eight radio-loud quasars\nat $z>5$, selected from our previous GMRT survey, in order to sample their\nlow-frequency synchrotron emission. Combined with archival radio continuum\nobservations, all ten targets show evidence for spectral turnover. The turnover\nfrequencies are $\\sim$1--50 GHz in the rest frame, making these targets\ngigahertz-peaked-spectrum (GPS) or high-frequency-peaker (HFP) candidates. For\nthe nine well-constrained targets with observations on both sides of the\nspectral turnover, we fit the entire radio spectrum with absorption models\nassociated with synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption (FFA). Our\nresults show that FFA in an external inhomogeneous medium can accurately\ndescribe the observed spectra for all nine targets, which may indicate an FFA\norigin for the radio spectral turnover in our sample. As for the complex\nspectrum of J114657.79+403708.6 at $z=5.00$ with two spectral peaks, it may be\ncaused by multiple components (i.e., core-jet) and FFA by the high-density\nmedium in the nuclear region. However, we cannot rule out the spectral turnover\norigin of variability. Based on our radio spectral modeling, we calculate the\nradio loudness $R_{2500\\rm\\, \\AA}$ for our sample, which ranges from\n12$^{+1}_{-1}$ to 674$^{+61}_{-51}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 16:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

To this end, we follow the prototypical model\nand format the variables of concern as a probability vector. Leveraging on the\nproposed probability vector representation, the information measurement such as\nmutual information and entropy, can be effectively evaluated with simple closed\nforms. We discuss the choice of common embedding space and distance function\nwhen using the prototypical model. Then We propose three information-theoretic\nloss functions for deterministic GZSL model: a mutual information loss to\nbridge seen data and target classes; an uncertainty-aware entropy constraint\nloss to prevent overfitting when using seen data to learn the embedding of\ntarget classes; a semantic preserving cross entropy loss to preserve the\nsemantic relation when mapping the semantic representations to the common\nspace.

The\nknown results for the well-posedness theory of mean field games with control on\nthe acceleration assume either that the running and final costs are\nregularizing functionals of the density variable, or the presence of noise,\ni.e. a second-order system. In this article we construct global in time weak\nsolutions to a first order mean field games system involving kinetic transport\noperators, where the costs are local (hence non-regularizing) functions of the\ndensity variable with polynomial growth. We show the uniqueness of these\nsolutions on the support of the agent density.

However, these methods are notorious for the enormous\namount of required training data which is prohibitively expensive to collect on\nreal robots. A highly popular alternative is to learn from simulations,\nallowing to generate the data much faster, safer, and cheaper. Since all\nsimulators are mere models of reality, there are inevitable differences between\nthe simulated and the real data, often referenced as the 'reality gap'. To\nbridge this gap, many approaches learn one policy from a distribution over\nsimulators. In this paper, we propose to combine reinforcement learning from\nrandomized physics simulations with policy distillation. Our algorithm, called\nDistilled Domain Randomization (DiDoR), distills so-called teacher policies,\nwhich are experts on domains that have been sampled initially, into a student\npolicy that is later deployed. This way, DiDoR learns controllers which\ntransfer directly from simulation to reality, i.e., without requiring data from\nthe target domain. We compare DiDoR against three baselines in three sim-to-sim\nas well as two sim-to-real experiments. Our results show that the target domain\nperformance of policies trained with DiDoR is en par or better than the\nbaselines'.

Our method takes as input the image-level labels of the\nclass categories present in the image; they can be obtained automatically or\nmanually.

Infectious disease modeling often\nstarts with a homogeneous mixing assumption, postulating that the rate of\ndisease transmission is proportional to a product of the numbers of susceptible\nand infectious individuals. One popular way to relax this assumption proceeds\nby raising the number of susceptible and/or infectious individuals to some\npositive powers.

It has been argued that holography itself\nmay be explained through this role of the gauge symmetry and constraints, at\nthe nonperturbative level, but there are also subtleties in constructing a\nholographic map in this approach. There are also claims that holography is\nimplied even by perturbative solution of the constraints. This short note\nprovides further examination of these questions, and in particular investigates\nto what extent perturbative or nonperturbative solution of the constraints\nimplies that information naively thought to be localized can be recovered by\nasymptotic measurements, and the relevance of this in defining subsystems. In\nthe leading perturbative case, the relevant effects are seen to be\nexponentially suppressed. These questions are, for example, important in\nsharply characterizing the unitarity problem for black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 18:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Although various\nexplanations for the differences between Venus and Earth have been proposed,\nthe currently available data are insufficient to discriminate among the\ndifferent solutions. Here we investigate the possible range of Venus structure\nmodels. We assume that core segregation happened as a single-stage event. The\nmantle composition is inferred from the core composition using a prescription\nfor metal-silicate partitioning. We consider three different cases for the\ncomposition of Venus defined via the bulk Si and Mg content, and the core's S\ncontent. Permissible ranges for the core size, mantle and core composition as\nwell as the normalized moment of inertia (MoI) are presented for these\ncompositions. A solid inner core could exist for all compositions. We estimate\nthat Venus' MoI is 0.317-0.351 and its core size 2930-4350 km for all assumed\ncompositions. Higher MoI values correspond to more oxidizing conditions during\ncore segregation. A determination of the abundance of FeO in Venus' mantle by\nfuture missions could further constrain its composition and internal structure.\nThis can reveal important information on Venus' formation and evolution, and\npossibly, the reasons for the differences between Venus and our home planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 18:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 14:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

The package was\ndesigned to use a small penetrator -- nicknamed the mole -- to implement a\nstring of temperature sensors in the soil to a depth of 5m. The mole itself is\nequipped with sensors to measure a thermal conductivity as it proceeds to\ndepth. The heat flow would be calculated from the product of the temperature\ngradient and the thermal conductivity. To avoid the perturbation caused by\nannual surface temperature variations, the measurements would be taken at a\ndepth between 3 m and 5 m. The mole was designed to penetrate cohesionless soil\nsimilar to Quartz sand which was expected to provide a good analogue material\nfor Martian sand. The sand would provide friction to the buried mole hull to\nbalance the remaining recoil of the mole hammer mechanism that drives the mole\nforward. Unfortunately, the mole did not penetrate more than a mole length of\n40 cm. The failure to penetrate deeper was largely due to a few tens of\ncentimeter thick cohesive duricrust that failed to provide the required\nfriction. Although a suppressor mass and spring in the hammer mechanism\nabsorbed much of the recoil, the available mass did not allow a system that\nwould have eliminated the recoil. The mole penetrated to 40 cm depth benefiting\nfrom friction provided by springs in the support structure from which it was\ndeployed. It was found in addition that the Martian soil provided unexpected\nlevels of penetration resistance that would have motivated to designing a more\npowerful mole. It is concluded that more mass would have allowed to design a\nmore robust system with little or no recoil, more energy of the mole hammer\nmechanism and a more massive support structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 18:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Many cellular functions result in these non-covalent `bonds' being\nmechanically strained, and this can be integral to proper cellular function.\nBroadly, two classes of force dependence have been observed -- slip bonds,\nwhere unbinding rate increases, and catch bonds where unbinding rate decreases.\nDespite much theoretical work, we cannot we predict for which protein-ligand\npairs, pulling coordinates, and forces a particular rate dependence will\nappear. Here, we assess the ability of MD simulations combined with enhanced\nsampling techniques to probe the force dependence of unbinding rates.

In this paper, we resolve this open problem and show\nthat the active time scheduling problem is indeed NP-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 18:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The analysis in the VSH method\nshows, on one hand, that it is arduous to separate the scalar-type from the\nvector-type polarizations of the electric sector of the Proca field, and on the\nother hand, it displays clearly the electric and the magnetic mode sectors. The\nanalysis in the FKKS method is performed by taking the nonrotating limit of the\nKerr-AdS spacetime, and shows that the ansatz decouples the polarizations in\nthe electric mode sector even in the nonrotating limit. On the other hand, it\ncaptures only two of the three possible polarizations, the magnetic mode sector\nis missing. The reason for the absence of this polarization is related to the\ndegeneracy of the principal tensor in static spherical symmetric spacetimes.\nThe degrees of freedom and quasinormal modes in both separation methods of the\nProca field are found. The frequencies of the quasinormal modes are also\ncomputed. For the electric mode sector in the VSH method the frequencies are\nfound through an extension, which substitutes number coefficients by matrix\ncoefficients, of the Horowitz-Hubeny numerical procedure, whereas for the\nmagnetic mode sector in the VSH method and the electric sector of the FKKS\nmethod it is shown that a direct use of the procedure can be made.

When the particles involved in the test\nexhibit quantum properties, it is unknown whether this principle still holds. A\npossibility introduced in arXiv:2012.13754 is that the EEP holds in a\ngeneralised form for particles having an arbitrary quantum state. The core of\nthis proposal is the ability to transform to a Quantum Reference Frame (QRF)\nassociated to an arbitrary quantum state of a physical system, in which the\nmetric is locally inertial.

Since only the spiral shape from a circularly orbiting perturber is\nknown, most previous works assume that the planet is in a circular orbit. We\ndevelop a simple semi-analytical method to calculate the shape of the spirals\nlaunched by an eccentric planet. We assume that the planet emits wavelets\nduring its orbit, and the wave fronts of these propagating wavelets form the\nspirals. The resulting spiral shape from this simple method agrees with\nnumerical simulations exceptionally well. The spirals excited by an eccentric\nplanet can detach from the planet, bifurcate, or even cross each other, which\nare all reproduced by this simple method. The spiral's bifurcation point\ncorresponds to the wavelet that is emitted when the planet's radial speed\nreaches the disc's sound speed. Multiple spirals can be excited by an eccentric\nplanet (more than 5 spirals when $e\\gtrsim0.2$). The pitch angle and pattern\nspeed are different between different spirals and can vary significantly across\none spiral. The spiral wakes launched by high-mass eccentric planets steepen to\nspiral shocks and the crossing of spiral shocks leads to distorted or broken\nspirals. With the same mass, a more eccentric planet launches weaker spirals\nand induces a shallower gap over a long period of time. The observed unusually\nlarge/small pitch angles of some spirals, the irregular multiple spirals, and\nthe different pattern speeds between different spirals may suggest the\nexistence of eccentric perturbers in protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 19:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Traditionally, model criticism methods have been based on the\npredictive check, an adaptation of goodness-of-fit testing to Bayesian modeling\nand an effective method to understand how well a model captures the\ndistribution of the data. In modern practice, however, researchers iteratively\nbuild and develop many models, exploring a space of models to help solve the\nproblem at hand. While classical predictive checks can help assess each one,\nthey cannot help the researcher understand how the models relate to each other.\nThis paper introduces the posterior predictive null check (PPN), a method for\nBayesian model criticism that helps characterize the relationships between\nmodels. The idea behind the PPN is to check whether data from one model's\npredictive distribution can pass a predictive check designed for another model.\nThis form of criticism complements the classical predictive check by providing\na comparative tool. A collection of PPNs, which we call a PPN study, can help\nus understand which models are equivalent and which models provide different\nperspectives on the data. With mixture models, we demonstrate how a PPN study,\nalong with traditional predictive checks, can help select the number of\ncomponents by the principle of parsimony. With probabilistic factor models, we\ndemonstrate how a PPN study can help understand relationships between different\nclasses of models, such as linear models and models based on neural networks.\nFinally, we analyze data from the literature on predictive checks to show how a\nPPN study can improve the practice of Bayesian model criticism.

These diverse applications\nhave utilized a diverse set of tools and assumptions. Thus, need exists to\npresent these approaches in a unifying manner. The goal of this tutorial is\nthreefold. First, we provide a coherent and unifying description of PS. Second,\nwe emphasize that estimation of effects within PS relies on strong assumptions\nand we thoroughly examine the consequences of these assumptions to understand\nin which situations certain assumptions are reasonable. Finally, we provide an\noverview of a variety of key methods for PS analysis and use a real clinical\ntrial example to illustrate them. Examples of code for implementation of some\nof these approaches are given in supplemental materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 20:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 20:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

In this paper, we identify and categorize different design\naspects in AR label design and report on a formal user study on labels for\nout-of-view objects to support visual search tasks in AR. We design three\nvisualization techniques for out-of-view object labeling in AR, which\nrespectively encode the relative physical position (height-encoded), the\nrotational direction (angle-encoded), and the label values (value-encoded) of\nthe objects. We further implement two traditional in-view object labeling\ntechniques, where labels are placed either next to the respective objects\n(situated) or at the edge of the AR FoV (boundary). We evaluate these five\ndifferent label conditions in three visual search tasks for static objects. Our\nstudy shows that out-of-view object labels are beneficial when searching for\nobjects outside the FoV, spatial orientation, and when comparing multiple\nspatially sparse objects. Angle-encoded labels with directional cues of the\nsurrounding objects have the overall best performance with the highest user\nsatisfaction.

System-assigned authentication keys can\nbe guaranteed to be secure, but this comes at a cost to memorability. In this\nstudy we investigate the memorability of system-assigned passphrases from a\nfamiliar vocabulary to the user. The passphrases are generated with the\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model trained on the familiar\nvocabulary and are readable, pronounceable, sentence like passphrases\nresembling natural English sentences.

However,\na well-known yet little studied limitation of discrete MRFs is that they cannot\ncapture context-specific independence (CSI). Existing methods require carefully\ndeveloped theories and purpose-built inference methods, which limit their\napplications to only small-scale problems. In this paper, we propose the Markov\nAttention Model (MAM), a family of discrete MRFs that incorporates an attention\nmechanism. The attention mechanism allows variables to dynamically attend to\nsome other variables while ignoring the rest, and enables capturing of CSIs in\nMRFs. A MAM is formulated as an MRF, allowing it to benefit from the rich set\nof existing MRF inference methods and scale to large models and datasets. To\ndemonstrate MAM's capabilities to capture CSIs at scale, we apply MAMs to\ncapture an important type of CSI that is present in a symbolic approach to\nrecurrent computations in perceptual grouping. Experiments on two recently\nproposed synthetic perceptual grouping tasks and on realistic images\ndemonstrate the advantages of MAMs in sample-efficiency, interpretability and\ngeneralizability when compared with strong recurrent neural network baselines,\nand validate MAM's capabilities to efficiently capture CSIs at scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 21:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

For these dynamic cases, we find again that ~90% of habitable planets\nare free of surface ice for a range of assumptions for ice's albedo. Planets\norbiting F dwarfs are three times as likely to have ice caps than belts, but\nfor planets orbiting K and G dwarfs ice belts are twice as likely as caps. In\nsome cases, a planet's surface ice can cycle between the equatorial and polar\nregions.

To better inform design for vulnerable road\nusers, we need to conduct more studies to evaluate how bicyclist and pedestrian\nbehavior and physiological states change in different roadway designs and\ncontextual settings. Previous research highlights the advantages of Immersive\nVirtual Environment (IVE) in conducting bicyclist and pedestrian studies.

Recent progress in object recognition from event-based sensors\nhas come from conversions of deep neural networks, trained with\nbackpropagation. However, using these approaches for event streams requires a\ntransformation to a synchronous paradigm, which not only loses computational\nefficiency, but also misses opportunities to extract spatio-temporal features.\nIn this article we propose a hybrid architecture for end-to-end training of\ndeep neural networks for event-based pattern recognition and object detection,\ncombining a spiking neural network (SNN) backbone for efficient event-based\nfeature extraction, and a subsequent analog neural network (ANN) head to solve\nsynchronous classification and detection tasks. This is achieved by combining\nstandard backpropagation with surrogate gradient training to propagate\ngradients through the SNN. Hybrid SNN-ANNs can be trained without conversion,\nand result in highly accurate networks that are substantially more\ncomputationally efficient than their ANN counterparts. We demonstrate results\non event-based classification and object detection datasets, in which only the\narchitecture of the ANN heads need to be adapted to the tasks, and no\nconversion of the event-based input is necessary. Since ANNs and SNNs require\ndifferent hardware paradigms to maximize their efficiency, we envision that SNN\nbackbone and ANN head can be executed on different processing units, and thus\nanalyze the necessary bandwidth to communicate between the two parts. Hybrid\nnetworks are promising architectures to further advance machine learning\napproaches for event-based vision, without having to compromise on efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 23:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

It is well known that a\ngeneral normal form game in N players and k strategies requires exponential\nspace simply to write down. This Curse of Multi-Agents prompts the study of\nsuccinct games which can be written down efficiently. A canonical example of a\nsuccinct game is the graphical game which models players as nodes in a graph\ninteracting with only their neighbors in direct analogy with markov random\nfields. Graphical games have found applications in wireless, financial, and\nsocial networks. However, computing the nash equilbrium of graphical games has\nproven challenging. Even for polymatrix games, a model where payoffs to an\nagent can be written as the sum of payoffs of interactions with the agent's\nneighbors, it has been shown that computing an epsilon approximate nash\nequilibrium is PPAD hard for epsilon smaller than a constant. The focus of this\nwork is to circumvent this computational hardness by considering average case\ngraph models i.e random graphs. We provide a quasipolynomial time approximation\nscheme (QPTAS) for computing an epsilon approximate nash equilibrium of\npolymatrix games on random graphs with edge density greater than poly(k,\n1/epsilon, ln(N))$ with high probability. Furthermore, with the same runtime we\ncan compute an epsilon-approximate Nash equilibrium that epsilon-approximates\nthe maximum social welfare of any nash equilibrium of the game.

Our experiments show that we can often achieve one\nor two orders of magnitude reduction in error in comparison with prior works\nunder typical choices of parameters, while incurring insignificant\ncommunication cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 02:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:13:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 02:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The\nCardEst problem has been extensively studied in the last several decades, using\nboth traditional and ML-enhanced methods. Whereas, the hardest problem in\nCardEst, i.e., how to estimate the join query size on multiple tables, has not\nbeen extensively solved. Current methods either reply on independence\nassumptions or apply techniques with heavy burden, whose performance is still\nfar from satisfactory. Even worse, existing CardEst methods are often designed\nto optimize one goal, i.e., inference speed or estimation accuracy, which can\nnot adapt to different occasions.\n  In this paper, we propose a very general framework, called Glue, to tackle\nwith these challenges.

Glue supports obtaining the single table-wise\nCardEst results using any existing CardEst method and can process any complex\njoin schema.

This paper is the first work that proves a\ngeneralization bound for the complex-valued neural network. The bound scales\nwith the spectral complexity, the dominant factor of which is the spectral norm\nproduct of weight matrices. Further, our work provides a generalization bound\nfor CVNNs when training data is sequential, which is also affected by the\nspectral complexity.

The\nmatter worsens when performing on languages with separate morphological or\nstructural features, making the cross-lingual alignment more challenging,\nresulting in the performance drop. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel\nKnowledge-Distillation-based framework for Cross-Lingual Summarization, seeking\nto explicitly construct cross-lingual correlation by distilling the knowledge\nof the monolingual summarization teacher into the cross-lingual summarization\nstudent. Since the representations of the teacher and the student lie on two\ndifferent vector spaces, we further propose a Knowledge Distillation loss using\nSinkhorn Divergence, an Optimal-Transport distance, to estimate the discrepancy\nbetween those teacher and student representations. Due to the intuitively\ngeometric nature of Sinkhorn Divergence, the student model can productively\nlearn to align its produced cross-lingual hidden states with monolingual hidden\nstates, hence leading to a strong correlation between distant languages.\nExperiments on cross-lingual summarization datasets in pairs of distant\nlanguages demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models under\nboth high and low-resourced settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 03:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

However, to date it is unclear if one can represent antisymmetric\nfunctions of physical interest, and it is difficult to measure the\nexpressiveness of the antisymmetric layer. This work attempts to address this\nproblem by introducing explicitly antisymmetrized universal neural network\nlayers as a diagnostic tool. We first introduce a generic antisymmetric (GA)\nlayer, which we use to replace the entire antisymmetric layer of the highly\naccurate ansatz known as the FermiNet. We demonstrate that the resulting\nFermiNet-GA architecture can yield effectively the exact ground state energy\nfor small systems. We then consider a factorized antisymmetric (FA) layer which\nmore directly generalizes the FermiNet by replacing products of determinants\nwith products of antisymmetrized neural networks. Interestingly, the resulting\nFermiNet-FA architecture does not outperform the FermiNet. This suggests that\nthe sum of products of antisymmetries is a key limiting aspect of the FermiNet\narchitecture. To explore this further, we investigate a slight modification of\nthe FermiNet called the full determinant mode, which replaces each product of\ndeterminants with a single combined determinant. The full single-determinant\nFermiNet closes a large part of the gap between the standard single-determinant\nFermiNet and FermiNet-GA. Surprisingly, on the nitrogen molecule at a\ndissociating bond length of 4.0 Bohr, the full single-determinant FermiNet can\nsignificantly outperform the standard 64-determinant FermiNet, yielding an\nenergy within 0.4 kcal/mol of the best available computational benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 04:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Many example-based\nexplanation methods have been proposed, such as representer point selection,\nwhere an explanation model defined by a set of training examples is used for\nexplaining a prediction model. For improving the interpretability, reducing the\nnumber of examples in the explanation model is important.

The vulnerability originates from the fact that even though each\nindividual parameter receives a value in the recommended value range, certain\ncombinations of parameter values may affect the drone physical stability. In\nthis paper we develop a novel learning-guided search system to find such\ncombinations, that we refer to as incorrect configurations. Our system applies\nmetaheuristic search algorithms mutating configurations to detect the\nconfiguration parameters that have values driving the drone to unstable\nphysical states. To guide the mutations, our system leverages a machine\nlearning predictor as the fitness evaluator. Finally, by utilizing\nmulti-objective optimization, our system returns the feasible ranges based on\nthe mutation search results. Because in our system the mutations are guided by\na predictor, evaluating the parameter configurations does not require\nrealistic/simulation executions. Therefore, our system supports a comprehensive\nand yet efficient detection of incorrect configurations. We have carried out an\nexperimental evaluation of our system. The evaluation results show that the\nsystem successfully reports potentially incorrect configurations, of which over\n85% lead to actual unstable physical states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 05:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The calculated\ntransverse momentum spectra of protons, deuterons, and tritons are comparable\nto those of experimental data from the RHIC-STAR collaboration. Both\ncoalescence parameters $B_{2}$ for (anti-)deuteron and $B_{3}$ for triton\nincrease with the transverse momentum as well as the collision centrality, and\nthey are comparable with the measured values in experiments. The effect of\nsystem size on the production of light nuclei is also investigated by $^{10}$B\n+ $^{10}$B, $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca, and $^{197}$Au +\n$^{197}$Au systems in central collisions. The results show that yields of light\nnuclei increase with system size, while the values of coalescence parameters\npresent an opposite trend. It is interesting to see that the system size, as\nwell as the centrality dependence of $B_A$ ($A$ = 2, 3), falls into the same\ngroup, which further demonstrates production probability of light nuclei is\nproportional to the size of the fireball. Furthermore, we compare our\ncoalescence results with other models, such as the thermal model and analytic\ncoalescence model, it seems that the description of light nuclei production is\nconsistent with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 06:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

However, real-scanned 3D point clouds are often incomplete, and it is\nimportant to recover complete point clouds for downstream applications. Most\nexisting point cloud completion methods use Chamfer Distance (CD) loss for\ntraining. The CD loss estimates correspondences between two point clouds by\nsearching nearest neighbors, which does not capture the overall point density\ndistribution on the generated shape, and therefore likely leads to non-uniform\npoint cloud generation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Point\nDiffusion-Refinement (PDR) paradigm for point cloud completion. PDR consists of\na Conditional Generation Network (CGNet) and a ReFinement Network (RFNet). The\nCGNet uses a conditional generative model called the denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM) to generate a coarse completion conditioned on the\npartial observation. DDPM establishes a one-to-one pointwise mapping between\nthe generated point cloud and the uniform ground truth, and then optimizes the\nmean squared error loss to realize uniform generation. The RFNet refines the\ncoarse output of the CGNet and further improves quality of the completed point\ncloud. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-path architecture for both\nnetworks. The architecture can (1) effectively and efficiently extract\nmulti-level features from partially observed point clouds to guide completion,\nand (2) accurately manipulate spatial locations of 3D points to obtain smooth\nsurfaces and sharp details. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark\ndatasets show that our PDR paradigm outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nmethods for point cloud completion. Remarkably, with the help of the RFNet, we\ncan accelerate the iterative generation process of the DDPM by up to 50 times\nwithout much performance drop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 06:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 03:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 03:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Indeed,\nmotivated by the theory of theta correspondence, especially the Siegel-Weil\nformula globally, and the composition problem of degenerate principal series\nand the demand of a g.c.d. definition of standard $L$-functions in the\nframework of the doubling method locally, an optimal normalization factor has\nbeen determined for degenerate principal series of classical groups via the\ntheory of integrals on prehomogeneous vector spaces.

The lookup table-based\nmethod achieves promising retouching performance by learning image-adaptive\nweights to combine 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs) and conducting\npixel-to-pixel color transformation. However, this paradigm ignores the local\ncontext cues and applies the same transformation to portrait pixels and\nbackground pixels when they exhibit the same raw RGB values. In contrast, an\nexpert usually conducts different operations to adjust the color temperatures\nand tones of portrait regions and background regions. This inspires us to model\nlocal context cues to improve the retouching quality explicitly. Firstly, we\nconsider an image patch and predict pixel-adaptive lookup table weights to\nprecisely retouch the center pixel. Secondly, as neighboring pixels exhibit\ndifferent affinities to the center pixel, we estimate a local attention mask to\nmodulate the influence of neighboring pixels. Thirdly, the quality of the local\nattention mask can be further improved by applying supervision, which is based\non the affinity map calculated by the groundtruth portrait mask. As for\ngroup-level consistency, we propose to directly constrain the variance of mean\ncolor components in the Lab space. Extensive experiments on PPR10K dataset\nverify the effectiveness of our method, e.g. on high-resolution photos, the\nPSNR metric receives over 0.5 gains while the group-level consistency metric\nobtains at least 2.1 decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 07:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Then a bootstrapping training\nalgorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the agent and ViT with weight\nsharing, during which the ViT learns inductive biases from the intermediate\nfeatures of the agent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1k\nwith limited training data have shown encouraging results that the inductive\nbiases help ViTs converge significantly faster and outperform conventional CNNs\nwith even fewer parameters.

Earlier work\nhas shown that a technique termed \"gravitational-wave geodesy\" can be used to\ngenerically differentiate observations of a gravitational-wave background from\nsignals due to correlated terrestrial effects, requiring true observations to\nbe consistent with the known geometry of our detector network. The key result\nof this test is a Bayes factor between the hypotheses that a candidate signal\nis astrophysical or terrestrial in origin.

The Fundamental Plane (FP) relation and the distribution of\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs) in the FP projections, cannot be easily explained in\nthe hierarchical framework, where galaxies grow up by merging and star\nformation episodes. Aims. We want to show here that both the FP and its\nprojections arise naturally from the combination of the Virial Theorem (VT) and\na new time-dependent relation, describing how luminosity and stellar velocity\ndispersion change during galaxy evolution. This relation has the form of the\nFaber-Jackson (FJ) relation but a different physical meaning: the new relation\nis $L = L'_0(t) \\sigma^{\\beta(t)}$, where its coefficients $L'_0$ and $\\beta$\nare time-dependent and can vary considerably from object to object, at variance\nwith those obtained from the fit of the $L - \\sigma$ plane. Methods. We derive\nthe equations of the FP and its projections as a function of $\\beta$ and\n$L'_0$, by combining the VT and the $L = L'_0(t) \\sigma^{\\beta(t)}$ law. Then,\nfrom their combination we derive the expression of the FP as a function of\n$\\beta$ and the solutions for $\\beta$ and $L'_0$. Results. We demonstrate that\nthe observed properties of ETGs in the FP and its projections can be understood\nin terms of variations of $\\beta$ and $L'_0$. These two parameters encrypt the\nhistory of galaxy evolution across the cosmic epochs and determine the future\naspect of the FP and its projections. Using the solutions found for $\\beta$ and\n$L'_0$ for each galaxy at the present epoch, we derive the coefficients of the\nFP (and FJ relation) and show that, the values of the coefficients coming form\nthe fit, obtained in the literature, originate from the average of the single\nFP coefficients derived for each galaxy. In addition, we show that the\nvariations of beta naturally explain the curvature observed in the FP\nprojections and the correct position of the Zone of Exclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 08:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 08:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

However, existing methods fail to increase the temporal\ndiversity of unlabeled videos and ignore elaborately modeling multi-scale\ntemporal dependencies in an explicit way. To overcome these limitations, we\ntake advantage of the multi-scale temporal dependencies within videos and\nproposes a novel video self-supervised learning framework named Temporal\nContrastive Graph Learning (TCGL), which jointly models the inter-snippet and\nintra-snippet temporal dependencies for temporal representation learning with a\nhybrid graph contrastive learning strategy. Specifically, a Spatial-Temporal\nKnowledge Discovering (STKD) module is first introduced to extract\nmotion-enhanced spatial-temporal representations from videos based on the\nfrequency domain analysis of discrete cosine transform. To explicitly model\nmulti-scale temporal dependencies of unlabeled videos, our TCGL integrates the\nprior knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into graph structures, i.e.,\nthe intra-/inter- snippet Temporal Contrastive Graphs (TCG). Then, specific\ncontrastive learning modules are designed to maximize the agreement between\nnodes in different graph views. To generate supervisory signals for unlabeled\nvideos, we introduce an Adaptive Snippet Order Prediction (ASOP) module which\nleverages the relational knowledge among video snippets to learn the global\ncontext representation and recalibrate the channel-wise features adaptively.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TCGL over the\nstate-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval\nbenchmarks.The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/YangLiu9208/TCGL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 09:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 03:44:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 07:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

In this paper, to make better use of the movement patterns\nintroduced by extreme augmentations, a Contrastive Learning framework utilizing\nAbundant Information Mining for self-supervised action Representation (AimCLR)\nis proposed. First, the extreme augmentations and the Energy-based\nAttention-guided Drop Module (EADM) are proposed to obtain diverse positive\nsamples, which bring novel movement patterns to improve the universality of the\nlearned representations. Second, since directly using extreme augmentations may\nnot be able to boost the performance due to the drastic changes in original\nidentity, the Dual Distributional Divergence Minimization Loss (D$^3$M Loss) is\nproposed to minimize the distribution divergence in a more gentle way.

Currently, attention-based\nencoder-decoder models are widely used in this task.

In this paper, we propose an Attention aggregation\nbased Bi-directional Mutual learning Network (ABM) which consists of one shared\nencoder and two parallel inverse decoders (L2R and R2L). The two decoders are\nenhanced via mutual distillation, which involves one-to-one knowledge transfer\nat each training step, making full use of the complementary information from\ntwo inverse directions. Moreover, in order to deal with mathematical symbols in\ndiverse scales, an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) is proposed to\neffectively integrate multi-scale coverage attentions.

Although very appealing\nand valuable due to their predictive capabilities, one common threat remains\nchallenging to resolve. A specifically trained attacker can introduce malicious\ninput perturbations to fool the network, thus causing potentially harmful\nmispredictions. Moreover, these attacks can succeed when the adversary has full\naccess to the target model (white-box) and even when such access is limited\n(black-box setting). The ensemble of models can protect against such attacks\nbut might be brittle under shared vulnerabilities in its members (attack\ntransferability). To that end, this work proposes a novel diversity-promoting\nlearning approach for the deep ensembles. The idea is to promote saliency map\ndiversity (SMD) on ensemble members to prevent the attacker from targeting all\nensemble members at once by introducing an additional term in our learning\nobjective. During training, this helps us minimize the alignment between model\nsaliencies to reduce shared member vulnerabilities and, thus, increase ensemble\nrobustness to adversaries.

At the same time, across machine learning, there is a recent trend of\nusing randomized truncation techniques to accelerate computations involving\nlarge sums. Here, we propose a family of randomized dynamic programming (RDP)\nalgorithms for scaling structured models to tens of thousands of latent states.\nOur method is widely applicable to classical DP-based inference (partition,\nmarginal, reparameterization, entropy) and different graph structures (chains,\ntrees, and more general hypergraphs). It is also compatible with automatic\ndifferentiation: it can be integrated with neural networks seamlessly and\nlearned with gradient-based optimizers. Our core technique approximates the\nsum-product by restricting and reweighting DP on a small subset of nodes, which\nreduces computation by orders of magnitude. We further achieve low bias and\nvariance via Rao-Blackwellization and importance sampling. Experiments over\ndifferent graphs demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.\nFurthermore, when using RDP for training a structured variational autoencoder\nwith a scaled inference network, we achieve better test likelihood than\nbaselines and successfully prevent posterior collapse. code at:\nhttps://github.com/FranxYao/RDP\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 11:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 22:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 16:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

To address the problem that DCNN always requires a large-scale annotated\ndataset to supervise its training while manual annotation is exhausting and\ntime-consuming, we propose a new framework based on co-training called Gram\nSelf-Labeling and Detection (Gram-SLD).

Many existing approaches build on homomorphic encryption\n(HE) that allow simple mathematical operations to be carried out on encrypted\ndata. Unfortunately, HE is computationally demanding and many control laws (in\nparticular non-polynomial ones) cannot be efficiently implemented with this\ntechnology.\n  We show in this paper that secure two-party computation using garbled\ncircuits provides a powerful alternative to HE for encrypted control. More\nprecisely, we present a novel scheme that allows to efficiently implement\n(non-polynomial) max-out neural networks with one hidden layer in a secure\nfashion. These networks are of special interest for control since they allow,\nin principle, to exactly describe piecewise affine control laws resulting from,\ne.g., linear model predictive control (MPC).

Fortunately, we illustrate that\neven low-dimensional learning-based approximations are sufficiently accurate\nfor linear MPC.

When classes are\nseparable, the misclassification rate improves to be exponentially fast.\nFurther, the resulting margin is proven to be lower bounded away from zero,\nproviding theoretical guarantees for robustness. We expect our findings to hold\nbeyond the NTK regime and translate to practical settings. To this end, we\nconduct extensive empirical studies on practical neural networks, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of square loss in both synthetic low-dimensional data and\nreal image data.

Existing works mainly focus on solving either cross-domain\nuser recommendation or cold-start content recommendation. However, when a new\ndomain evolves at its early stage, it has potential users similar to the source\ndomain but with much fewer interactions. It is critical to learn a user's\npreference from the source domain and transfer it into the target domain,\nespecially on the newly arriving contents with limited user feedback. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a self-trained Cross-dOmain User Preference LEarning\n(COUPLE) framework, targeting cold-start recommendation with various semantic\ntags, such as attributes of items or genres of videos. More specifically, we\nconsider three levels of preferences, including user history, user content and\nuser group to provide reliable recommendation. With user history represented by\na domain-aware sequential model, a frequency encoder is applied to the\nunderlying tags for user content preference learning. Then, a hierarchical\nmemory tree with orthogonal node representation is proposed to further\ngeneralize user group preference across domains. The whole framework updates in\na contrastive way with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue to obtain more\ndistinctive representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate\nthe efficiency of COUPLE in both user and content cold-start situations.

An enhanced version of SVD,\nnamely E-SVD, is accordingly established to losslessly and quickly release\nconstraints and recover the orthonormal parts in SVD by avoiding multiple\nmatrix multiplications. According to the theory, advantages of E-SVD over SVD\nbecome increasingly evident with the rising requirement of data fidelity. In\nparticular, E-SVD will reduce 25% storage units as SVD reaches its limitation\nand fails to compress data. Empirical evidences from typical scenarios of\nremote sensing and Internet of things further justify our theory and\nconsistently demonstrate the superiority of E-SVD in compression. The presented\ntheory sheds insightful lights on the constraint solution in orthonormal\nmatrices and E-SVD, guaranteed by which will profoundly enhance the SVD-based\ncompression in the context of explosive growth in both data acquisition and\nfidelity levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 14:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

A physically\nimportant class of PIDs are those that do not require quantum memory to\nimplement, and these are naturally \"free\" in this resource theory. The\ntraditional notion of measurement incompatibility emerges as a resource in this\ntheory since any PID controlling an incompatible family of instruments requires\nquantum memory to build. We identify an incompatibility partial ordering of\nPIDs based on whether one can be transformed into another using processes that\ndo not require additional quantum memory.

Ultimately our results\nprovide an operational characterization of incompatibility, and they offer\ndevice-independent tests for incompatibility in the most general types of\nquantum instruments.

In light of this new data, we\nre-examine the prospects to constrain the abundance of PBHs via FRBs.

In CNNs, RFs can simply be enlarged by increasing the convolution\nkernel sizes. Yet the number of trainable parameters, which scales\nquadratically with the kernel's size in the 2D case, rapidly becomes\nprohibitive, and the training is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a\nnew method to increase the RF size without increasing the number of parameters.\nThe dilated convolution (DC) has already been proposed for the same purpose. DC\ncan be seen as a convolution with a kernel that contains only a few non-zero\nelements placed on a regular grid. Here we present a new version of the DC in\nwhich the spacings between the non-zero elements, or equivalently their\npositions, are no longer fixed but learnable via backpropagation thanks to an\ninterpolation technique. We call this method \"Dilated Convolution with\nLearnable Spacings\" (DCLS) and generalize it to the n-dimensional convolution\ncase. However, our main focus here will be on the 2D case. We first tried our\napproach on ResNet50: we drop-in replaced the standard convolutions with DCLS\nones, which increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification at\niso-parameters, but at the expense of the throughput. Next, we used the recent\nConvNeXt state-of-the-art convolutional architecture and drop-in replaced the\ndepthwise convolutions with DCLS ones. This not only increased the accuracy of\nImageNet1k classification but also of typical downstream and robustness tasks,\nagain at iso-parameters but this time with negligible cost on throughput, as\nConvNeXt uses separable convolutions. Conversely, classic DC led to poor\nperformance with both ResNet50 and ConvNeXt.

Such problems can\noften be solved by stochastic optimization methods: performing optimization\nsteps with respect to the indexed target function with randomly switched\nindices. In this work, we study a continuous-time variant of the stochastic\ngradient descent algorithm for optimization problems with continuous data.

Few-shot learning is developed to alleviate this burden,\nwhich achieves competitive performances with only several labeled data.\nHowever, a crucial yet previously overlooked problem in few-shot learning is\nabout the selection of template images for annotation before learning, which\naffects the final performance. We herein propose a novel Sample Choosing Policy\n(SCP) to select \"the most worthy\" images for annotation, in the context of\nfew-shot medical landmark detection.

The advantage of SCP is demonstrated\nby various experiments on three widely-used public datasets.

A solution of MTL with conflicting objectives requires modelling\nthe trade-off among them which is generally beyond what a straight linear\ncombination can achieve. A theoretically principled and computationally\neffective strategy is finding solutions which are not dominated by others as it\nis addressed in the Pareto analysis. Multi-objective optimization problems\narising in the multi-task learning context have specific features and require\nadhoc methods. The analysis of these features and the proposal of a new\ncomputational approach represent the focus of this work. Multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can easily include the concept of dominance and\ntherefore the Pareto analysis. The major drawback of MOEAs is a low sample\nefficiency with respect to function evaluations. The key reason for this\ndrawback is that most of the evolutionary approaches do not use models for\napproximating the objective function. Bayesian Optimization takes a radically\ndifferent approach based on a surrogate model, such as a Gaussian Process. In\nthis thesis the solutions in the Input Space are represented as probability\ndistributions encapsulating the knowledge contained in the function\nevaluations. In this space of probability distributions, endowed with the\nmetric given by the Wasserstein distance, a new algorithm MOEA/WST can be\ndesigned in which the model is not directly on the objective function but in an\nintermediate Information Space where the objects from the input space are\nmapped into histograms.

Recently, many demonstrations of deep learning (DL)\ntechniques that address individual NDE tasks (data pre-processing, defect\ndetection, defect characterisation, and property measurement) have started to\nemerge in the research community. These methods have the potential to offer\nhigh flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy subject to the availability of\nsufficient training data. Moreover, they enable the automation of complex\nprocesses that span one or more NDE steps (e.g. detection, characterisation,\nand sizing). There is, however, a lack of consensus on the direction and\nrequirements that these new methods should follow. These elements are critical\nto help achieve automation of ultrasonic NDE driven by artificial intelligence\nsuch that the research community, industry, and regulatory bodies embrace it.\nThis paper reviews the state-of-the-art of autonomous ultrasonic NDE enabled by\nDL methodologies. The review is organised by the NDE tasks that are addressed\nby means of DL approaches. Key remaining challenges for each task are noted.\nBasic axiomatic principles for DL methods in NDE are identified based on the\nliterature review, relevant international regulations, and current industrial\nneeds. By placing DL methods in the context of general NDE automation levels,\nthis paper aims to provide a roadmap for future research and development in the\narea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 10:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 14:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Various types of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) methods have been utilized for the assessment and evaluation\nof civil structures. In AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)\nalgorithms require plenty of datasets to train; particularly, the more data DL\nmodels are trained with, the better output it yields. Yet, in SHM applications,\ncollecting data from civil structures through sensors is expensive and\nobtaining useful data (damage associated data) is challenging. In this paper,\n1-D Wasserstein loss Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks using\nGradient Penalty (1-D WDCGAN-GP) is utilized to generate damage associated\nvibration datasets that are similar to the input. For the purpose of\nvibration-based damage diagnostics, a 1-D Deep Convolutional Neural Network\n(1-D DCNN) is built, trained, and tested on both real and generated datasets.\nThe classification results from the 1-D DCNN on both datasets resulted to be\nvery similar to each other.

Prosumers may trade within their communities to better\nmanage their demand and supply as well as providing social and economic\nbenefits. In this paper, we explore the use of Blockchain technologies and\nauction mechanisms to facilitate autonomous peer-to-peer energy trading within\nmicrogrids. We design two frameworks that utilize the smart contract\nfunctionality in Ethereum and employ the continuous double auction and\nuniform-price double-sided auction mechanisms, respectively. We validate our\ndesign by conducting A/B tests to compare the performance of different\nframeworks on a real-world dataset.

An interesting feature\nof these systems is the presence of stable periodic behavior even when each\nunit oscillates chaotically if in isolation. Surprisingly, the mechanism in\nwhich the network interaction replaces chaos by periodicity is still poorly\nunderstood. Here, we show that such an onset of regularity can occur via\nreplication of periodic windows. This phenomenon multiplies the stability\ndomains in the system parameter space, not only suppressing chaos but also\nmaking the network less vulnerable to external disturbances such as shocks and\nnoise. Moreover, we observe that the network cluster synchronizes for the\nparameters corresponding to the replica periodic windows. To confirm these\nobservations, we employ the formalism of the master stability function\ndemonstrating that the complete synchronized state is indeed transversally\nunstable in the replica windows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 20:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Design methodology approach: The model\nof social Frohlich condensation and its analysis are based on the mathematical\nformalism of quantum thermodynamics and field theory (applied outside of\nphysics). Findings: The presented quantum-like model provides the consistent\noperational model of such complex socio-political phenomenon as Frohlich\ncondensation. Research limitations implications: The model of social Frohlich\ncondensation is heavily based on theory of open quantum systems. Its consistent\nelaboration needs additional efforts. Practical implications: Evidence of such\nphenomenon as social Frohlich condensation is demonstrated by stability of\nmodern informationally open societies. Social implications: Approaching the\nstate of Frohlich condensation is the powerful source of social stability.\nUnderstanding its informational structure and origin may help to stabilize the\nmodern society.
