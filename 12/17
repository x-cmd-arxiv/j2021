Most\nexisting cyber-attack detection systems are implemented based on manually\ndesigned rules by referring to domain knowledge (e.g., threat models, threat\nintelligences).

To\neffective and efficient detect cyber-attacks from a huge number of system\nevents in the provenance data, we firstly model the provenance data by a\nheterogeneous graph to capture the rich context information of each system\nentities (e.g., process, file, socket, etc.), and learns a semantic vector\nrepresentation for each system entity. Then, we perform online cyber-attack\ndetection by sampling a small and compact local graph from the heterogeneous\ngraph, and classifying the key system entities as malicious or benign. We\nconducted a series of experiments on two provenance datasets with real\ncyber-attacks. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms\nother learning based detection models, and has competitive performance against\nstate-of-the-art rule based cyber-attack detection systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 16:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

This\nis partly due to the rise in the use of license-free and managed shared bands\nfor Wi-Fi, long term evolution (LTE) unlicensed (LTE-U), LTE licensed assisted\naccess (LAA), 5G NR, and other opportunistic spectrum access solutions. As a\nresult of this, the need for efficient spectrum usage schemes that are robust\nagainst interference has never been more important. In the past, most solutions\nto interference have addressed the problem by using avoidance techniques as\nwell as non-AI mitigation approaches (for example, adaptive filters). The key\ndownside to non-AI techniques is the need for domain expertise in the\nextraction or exploitation of signal features such as cyclostationarity,\nbandwidth and modulation of the interfering signals. More recently, researchers\nhave successfully explored AI/ML enabled physical (PHY) layer techniques,\nespecially deep learning which reduces or compensates for the interfering\nsignal instead of simply avoiding it. The underlying idea of ML based\napproaches is to learn the interference or the interference characteristics\nfrom the data, thereby sidelining the need for domain expertise in suppressing\nthe interference. In this paper, we review a wide range of techniques that have\nused deep learning to suppress interference.

In this study, we address the anomaly by\nconsidering a minimal and generic extension to the SM which also provides for a\ndark matter (DM) candidate. The extra states in this framework are: a SM\nsinglet Majorana fermion, referred to as the Bino, playing the role of DM; and\nmuonic scalars, referred to as sleptons. The couplings between the sleptons, SM\nmuons and the Bino can account for the muon $g-2$ anomaly if the scalar muon\npartners, or smuons, mix chirality. On the other hand, the DM relic density is\nsatisfied primarily through coannihilation effects involving the Bino and the\nlighter sleptons. The viable parameter space of our model includes regions with\nrelatively light coannihilating particles, similar to what has been found in\nprevious scans of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Relaxing\nthe assumption of minimal flavor violation typically assumed in the MSSM, we\nsee that scenarios with sizable smuon mixing and large mass splittings between\nthe smuons can satisfy both the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the DM relic density for\ncoannihilating particle masses up to and beyond the TeV scale. When we specify\nthe origin of the left-right smuon mixing to be trilinear couplings between the\nsmuons and the SM Higgs boson, the constraints on these scenarios arising from\nperturbative unitarity and electroweak vacuum stability confine the\ncoannihilating particle masses to be $\\lesssim$ 1 TeV. We demonstrate that next\ngeneration direct detection experiments are only marginally sensitive to the\nviable parameter space of our model and, thus, a future lepton collider could\nbe the essential probe necessary to distinguish our model from other BSM\nsolutions to the muon $g-2$ anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 16:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

The\n$k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm ($k$-WL) is a more powerful variant\nof color refinement that colors $k$-tuples instead of single vertices, where\nthe terms $1$-WL and color refinement are often used interchangeably since they\ncompute equivalent colorings. We show how to adapt the result of Greb\\'ik and\nRocha to $k$-WL or, in other words, how $k$-WL and its characterizations\ngeneralize to graphons. In particular, we obtain characterizations in terms of\nhomomorphism densities from multigraphs of bounded treewidth and linear\nequations. We give a simple example that parallel edges make a difference in\nthe graphon case, which means that the equivalence between $1$-WL and color\nrefinement is lost. We also show how to define a variant of $k$-WL that\ncorresponds to homomorphism densities from simple graphs of bounded treewidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 16:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Domain shift is a generalisation problem of\nmachine learning models that occurs when the data distribution of the training\nset is different to the data distribution encountered by the model when it is\ndeployed.

In\nthis work, we address this challenge by studying both neural style transfer\nalgorithms and unpaired image-to-image translation methods in the context of\nthe segmentation of tumour spheroids.\n  Methods. We have illustrated the domain shift problem in the context of\nspheroid segmentation with 4 deep learning segmentation models that achieved an\nIoU over 97% when tested with images following the training distribution, but\nwhose performance decreased up to an 84\\% when applied to images captured under\ndifferent conditions.

The first attack type is based on compromised RNGs. The first RNG\nattacks are deterministic. First, Eve knows both noises. She can crack the bit\nvia Ohm's Law and one-bit powers within a fraction of the bit exchange period.\nSecond, Eve knows only Bob's noise, so she can learn Bob's resistance value via\nOhm's Law and Alice's resistance at the end of the bit exchange period. She can\nalso use a process of elimination. The second RNG attacks are statistical.\nFirst, Eve has partial knowledge of Alice's and Bob's noises. She can crack the\nbit by taking the highest cross-correlation between her noises and the measured\nnoise in the wire, and by taking the highest cross-correlation between her\nnoises and Alice's/Bob's noises. Second, Eve has partial knowledge of only\nAlice's noise. She can still crack the bit, but after the bit exchange period.\nThe second attack type is based on thermodynamics. Previously, the KLJN scheme\nrequired thermal equilibrium. However, Vadai, et al, in (Nature) Science\nReports shows a modified scheme, where there is a non-zero thermal noise, yet\nthe system resists all the known attacks. We utilize coincidence events between\nthe line current and voltage and show that there is non-zero information leak.\nAs soon as thermal equilibrium is restored, the system is perfectly secure\nagain. The final attack type is based on the nonlinearity of the noise\ngenerators. We explore the effect of distortion at the second and third orders.\nIt is demonstrated that 1% distortion results in a significant information\nleak. We also show that decreasing the effective temperature results in the\nKLJN scheme approaching perfect security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

The\nprobability of a chance coincidence is only 4*10^-5 corresponding to a\nsignificance of 4.1 sigma. We explicitly list four strong radio blazars as\nhighly probable sources of neutrinos above 200 TeV: 3C 279, NRAO 530, PKS\n1741-038, and PKS 2145+067. There are at least 70 more radio-bright blazars\nthat emit neutrinos of lower energies, starting from TeVs. Using continuous\nRATAN-600 monitoring of VLBI-selected blazars, we find that radio flares at\nfrequencies above 10 GHz coincide with neutrino arrival dates. The most\npronounced example of such behavior is PKS 1502+106 that experienced a major\nflare in 2019. We demonstrate that the majority of IceCube astrophysical\nneutrino flux derived from muon-track analyses may be explained by blazars,\nthat is, AGNs with bright Doppler-boosted jets. High-energy neutrinos can be\nproduced in photohadronic interactions within parsec-scale relativistic jets.\nRadio-bright blazars associated with neutrino detections have very diverse\ngamma-ray properties, which suggests that gamma-rays and neutrinos may be\nproduced in different regions of blazars and not directly related. A narrow jet\nviewing angle is, however, required to detect either of them.

The key idea is to draw insights from empirical sampling of\nhard propositional SAT problems and from complexity-theoretic studies of\nlanguage. This methodology allows us to distinguish easy from hard instances,\nand to systematically increase the complexity of existing reasoning benchmarks\nsuch as RuleTaker. We find that current transformers, given sufficient training\ndata, are surprisingly robust at solving the resulting NLSat problems of\nsubstantially increased difficulty. They also exhibit some degree of\nscale-invariance - the ability to generalize to problems of larger size and\nscope.

Our aim is to study the velocity field of the galaxy cluster Abell\n780, which is known for the powerful radio source Hydra A at its center and\nwhere a spectacular X-ray tail associated with the galaxy LEDA 87445 has been\ndiscovered. Our analysis is based on the new spectroscopic data for hundreds of\ngalaxies obtained with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale {\\em Galileo} and the\nVery Large Telescope. We have constructed a redshift catalog of 623 galaxies\nand selected a sample of 126 cluster members. We analyze the internal structure\nof the cluster using a number of techniques. We estimate the mean redshift\nz=0.0545, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion sigmav about 800 km/s, and the\ndynamical mass M200 about 5.4 10E14 solar masses. The global properties of\nAbell 780 are typical of relaxed clusters. On a smaller scale, we can detect\nthe presence of a galaxy group associated with LEDA 87445 in projected phase\nspace. The mean velocity and position of the center of the group agree well\nwith the velocity and position of LEDA 87445. We estimate the following\nparameters of the collision. The group is characterized by a higher velocity\nrelative to the main system. It is infalling at a rest frame velocity of\nVrf=+870 km/s and lies at a projected distance D=1.1 Mpc to the south, slightly\nsoutheast of the cluster center. The mass ratio between the group and the\ncluster is about 1:5. We also find evidence of an asymmetry in the velocity\ndistribution of galaxies in the inner cluster region, which might be related to\na small low-velocity group detected as a substructure at Vrf=-750 km/s. We\nconclude that A780, although dynamically relaxed at first sight, contains small\nsubstructures that may have some impact on the energetics of the core region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Despite significant progress\nin recent years, most learning-based approaches to visual localization target\nat a single domain and require a dense database of geo-tagged images to\nfunction well. To mitigate the data scarcity issue and improve the scalability\nof the neural localization models, we introduce TOPO-DataGen, a versatile\nsynthetic data generation tool that traverses smoothly between the real and\nvirtual world, hinged on the geographic camera viewpoint. New large-scale\nsim-to-real benchmark datasets are proposed to showcase and evaluate the\nutility of the said synthetic data. Our experiments reveal that synthetic data\ngenerically enhances the neural network performance on real data. Furthermore,\nwe introduce CrossLoc, a cross-modal visual representation learning approach to\npose estimation that makes full use of the scene coordinate ground truth via\nself-supervision. Without any extra data, CrossLoc significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods and achieves substantially higher real-data sample\nefficiency.

In this paper, we relax this assumption about\nindistinguishable agents and propose a new mean field system known as\nDecentralized Mean Field Games, where each agent can be quite different from\nothers. All agents learn independent policies in a decentralized fashion, based\non their local observations. We define a theoretical solution concept for this\nsystem and provide a fixed point guarantee for a Q-learning based algorithm in\nthis system. A practical consequence of our approach is that we can address a\n`chicken-and-egg' problem in empirical mean field reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. Further, we provide Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms that use\nthe decentralized mean field learning approach and give stronger performances\ncompared to common baselines in this area. In our setting, agents do not need\nto be clones of each other and learn in a fully decentralized fashion. Hence,\nfor the first time, we show the application of mean field learning methods in\nfully competitive environments, large-scale continuous action space\nenvironments, and other environments with heterogeneous agents. Importantly, we\nalso apply the mean field method in a ride-sharing problem using a real-world\ndataset. We propose a decentralized solution to this problem, which is more\npractical than existing centralized training methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 18:30:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 05:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 15:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 17:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

The strong magnetic fields\ngenerated inhibit convection, which in turn produces large starspots, radius\ninflation, and lower-than-expected average surface temperatures and\nluminosities. Here we cross-reference a catalog of active giant binaries (RS\nCVns) in the field with Gaia EDR3. Using the Gaia photometry and parallaxes we\nprecisely position the RS CVns in a CMD. We identify stars that fall below a 14\nGyr, metal-rich isochrone as candidate field SSGs.

Finding ways of accurately evaluating\nLyman-$\\alpha$ constraints across large classes of candidate models of\ndark-matter physics is thus of paramount importance. While such constraints\nhave been evaluated for dark-matter models with relatively simple dark-matter\nvelocity distributions, more complex models -- particularly those with\ndark-matter velocity distributions stretching across multiple scales -- are\nreceiving increasing attention. In this paper, we undertake a study of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ constraints associated with general dark-matter velocity\ndistributions.

We utilize both of these\nrecasts in order to determine the Lyman-$\\alpha$ bounds on different classes of\ndark-matter velocity distributions. We also develop a general method by which\nthe results of these different recasts can be compared. For relatively simple\ndark-matter velocity distributions, we find that these two classes of recasts\ntend to align and give similar results. However, the situation is far more\ncomplex for distributions involving multiple velocity scales: while these two\nrecasts continue to yield similar results within certain regions of parameter\nspace, they nevertheless yield dramatically different results within precisely\nthose regions of parameter space which are likely to be phenomenologically\nrelevant.

The EDS model\nexhibits new phenomenology in both the early and late universe, the latter due\nto an EDE-mediated dark matter self-interaction. This dark matter-philic \"fifth\nforce\", while constrained to be small, remains active in the late universe and\nis not screened in virialized halos.

We investigate existing methods in the\ncontext of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a\nvariety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study\nusing a novel dataset of 15 diverse NLP tasks.

By\nusing RCDM to analyze self-supervised models, we are able to clearly show\nvisually that i) SSL (backbone) representation are not invariant to the data\naugmentations they were trained with -- thus debunking an often restated but\nmistaken belief; ii) SSL post-projector embeddings appear indeed invariant to\nthese data augmentation, along with many other data symmetries; iii) SSL\nrepresentations appear more robust to small adversarial perturbation of their\ninputs than representations trained in a supervised manner; and iv) that\nSSL-trained representations exhibit an inherent structure that can be explored\nthanks to RCDM visualization and enables image manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 15:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

We found that this\nmodel is able to explain non-flaring VHE emission of M87 as well as an orphan\nflare reported in 2005.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 20:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

We first show\nthat a $2d$-dimensional triangulation has no interior $(d + 1)$-simplices if\nand only if its quiver is a cut quiver of type $A$, in the sense of Iyama and\nOppermann. This is a higher-dimensional generalisation of the fact that\ntriangulations of polygons with no interior triangles correspond to\norientations of an $A_{n}$ Dynkin diagram. An application of this first result\nis that the set of triangulations of a $2d$-dimensional cyclic polytope with no\ninterior $(d + 1)$-simplices is connected via bistellar flips -- the\nhigher-dimensional analogue of flipping a diagonal inside a quadrilateral. In\ndimensions higher than 2, bistellar flips cannot be performed at all locations\nin a triangulation.

Extensive experiments show\nthat, although Ensemble and Bayesian models could provide relatively better\nuncertainty estimations under dataset shifts, all tested models fail to meet\nthe promise in trustworthy prediction and model calibration. Our work paves the\nway for a comprehensive evaluation for any newly developed biosignal\nclassifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 20:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear\ndictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in\nthe $l_1$ norms of the codes.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the\nneed to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so\nthat each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold\nover a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we\nexplore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer\ndecoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear\ndictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show\nthat decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the\nlinear and multi-layer case.

In doing\nso, existing methods often ignore that the natural RGB images in today's\ndatasets are not captured but, in fact, recovered from RAW color filter array\ncaptures that are subject to various degradations in the capture. In this work,\nwe exploit this RAW data distribution as an empirical prior for adversarial\ndefense.

Hydrogen atoms and CO or H2CO molecules are co-deposited\non top of the predeposited H2O ice to mimic the conditions associated with the\nbeginning of 'rapid' CO freeze-out. Quadrupole mass spectrometry is used to\nanalyze the gas-phase COM composition following a temperature programmed\ndesorption. Monte Carlo simulations are used for an astrochemical model\ncomparing the MM formation efficiency with that of other COMs. Unambiguous\ndetection of newly formed MM has been possible both in CO+H and H2CO+H\nexperiments. The resulting abundance of MM with respect to CH3OH is about 0.05,\nwhich is about 6 times less than the value observed toward NGC 6334I and about\n3 times less than the value reported for IRAS 16293B. The results of\nastrochemical simulations predict a similar value for the MM abundance with\nrespect to CH3OH factors ranging between 0.06 to 0.03. We find that MM is\nformed by co-deposition of CO and H2CO with H atoms through the recombination\nof CH2OH and CH3O radicals. In both the experimental and modeling studies, the\nefficiency of this channel alone is not sufficient to explain the observed\nabundance of MM. These results indicate an incomplete knowledge of the reaction\nnetwork or the presence of alternative solid-state or gas-phase formation\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 22:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Unfortunately, existing\nfault-tolerant routing techniques proposed for 2D and 3D on-chip networks\ncannot be applied to chiplet networks. To address these problems, this paper\npresents the first deadlock-free and fault-tolerant routing algorithm, called\nDeFT, for 2.5D integrated chiplet systems.

Moreover, DeFT can tolerate different vertical-link-fault\nscenarios while accounting for vertical-link utilization.

The optical torque is traditionally calculated via the flux of total\nangular momentum (AM) into a volume enclosing an object. In [Phys. Rev. A 92,\n043843 (2015)] a powerful method was suggested to calculate optical torque\nseparately from the flux of the spin and the orbital parts of optical AM,\nproviding useful physical insight. However, the method predicted a new type of\ndipolar torque dependent on the gradient of the helicity density of the optical\nbeam, inconsistent with prior torque calculations. In this work we intend to\nclarify this discrepancy and clear up the confusion. We re-derive, from first\nprinciples and with detailed derivations, both the traditional dipolar total\ntorque using total AM flux, and the spin and orbital torque components based on\nthe corresponding AM contributions, ensuring that their sum agrees with the\ntotal torque. We also test our derived analytical expressions against numerical\nintegration, with exact agreement. We find that `helicity gradient' torque\nterms indeed exist in the spin and orbital components separately, but we\npresent corrected prefactors, such that upon adding them, they cancel out, and\nthe `helicity gradient' term vanishes from the total dipolar torque,\nreconciling literature results. We also derive the analytical expression of the\nquadrupolar torque, showing that it is proportional to the spin of the EM field\ngradient, rather than the local EM field spin, as sometimes wrongly assumed in\nthe literature. We provide examples of counter-intuitive situations where the\nspin of the EM field gradient behaves very differently to the local EM spin.\nNaively using the local EM field spin leads to wrong predictions of the torque\non large particles with strong contributions of quadrupole and higher-order\nmultipoles, especially in a structured incident field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 23:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

However, existing\nalignment techniques often assume that the input KGs are complete and\nisomorphic, which is not true due to the real-world heterogeneity in the\ndomain, size, and sparsity. In this work, we address the problem of aligning\nincomplete KGs with representation learning. Our KG embedding framework\nexploits two feature channels: transitivity-based and proximity-based. The\nformer captures the consistency constraints between entities via translation\npaths, while the latter captures the neighbourhood structure of KGs via\nattention guided relation-aware graph neural network. The two feature channels\nare jointly learned to exchange important features between the input KGs while\nenforcing the output representations of the input KGs in the same embedding\nspace.

A specific application that can benefit from\nthese features is the transportation of THz undulator radiation over hundreds\nof meters to reach the experimental halls at the LCLS facility, SLAC, Stanford.\nSuch a structure has been modelled before as a boundary-value problem using\nVainstein's impedance boundary condition and assuming infinitely-thin screens.\nGiven that physical realizations of such screens must have finite thickness and\nthat the THz wavelength in the 3-15 THz range is expected to be smaller than\nconvenient screen thicknesses in practice, the question of the impact of finite\nscreen thickness on propagation performance becomes rather pressing.

By tailoring the cavity length, EOT phenomenon has been\npushed deep into the sub-wavelength region by a factor of as large as 20%, and\nEOT frequency comb with cavity function has been achieved. Due to the enhanced\nslow-wave effect as the frequency approaches fpl0, the cavity induced EOT\ngradually merges with the first order SP EOT. Distinguishing from the classic\nEOT phenomenon, no transmission zero is found between these two EOTs, which\ndramatically broadens the EOT bandwidth by a factor of 10 at terahertz (THz)\nfrequencies. Furthermore, the EOT transmittance is actively modulated with\ngraphene, achieving a large modulation range from 0.5 to 0.25 under a sub-volt\nbias from -0.3 to 0.5 V at 500 GHz. To the best of the authors' knowledge, both\nthe modulation range and the low bias are among the best for active EOT devices\nwith graphene to date. Such a structure provides a new strategy for\nminiaturizing sensing devices, high-power sources, and broadband photonics as\nwell as their active control in the THz regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 02:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

We consider flow past a sphere\nto examine the accuracy of our DL-ROM predictions. The proposed methodology\nrelies on a three-dimensional convolutional recurrent autoencoder network (3D\nCRAN) to extract the low-dimensional flow features from full-order snapshots.\nThe low-dimensional features are evolved in time using a long short-term\nmemory-based recurrent neural network and reconstructed back to the full-order\nas flow voxels. These 3D voxels are introduced as static and uniform query\nprobes in the point cloud domain to reduce the unstructured mesh complexity\nwhile providing convenience in 3D CRAN training. We analyze a novel procedure\nto recover the interface description and the force quantities from the 3D flow\nvoxels. The 3D CRAN methodology is first applied to an external flow past a\nstatic sphere at a single Reynolds number of Re = 300. We provide an assessment\nof the computing requirements in terms of the memory usage, training costs, and\ntesting times associated with the 3D CRAN framework. Subsequently, variable\nRe-based flow information is infused in one 3D CRAN to learn a complicated\nsymmetry-breaking flow regime (280 < Re < 460) for the flow past a sphere.\nEffects of transfer learning are analyzed for training this complicated 3D flow\nregime on a relatively smaller time series dataset. The 3D CRAN framework\nlearns the flow regime nearly 20 times faster than the parallel full-order\nmodel and predicts unsteady flows with an excellent to good accuracy. Based on\nthe predicted flow fields, the network demonstrates an R2 accuracy of 98.58%\nfor drag and 76.43% for lift over the sphere in the chosen flow regime. The\nproposed framework aligns with the development of a digital twin for 3D\nunsteady flow field with variable Re effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 03:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

High computational and memory\nrequirements of CNNs, limited processing power and thermal constraints of\nmobile devices, combined with large output image resolutions (typically 8--12\nMPix) prevent their wider application. In this work, we introduce Procedural\nKernel Networks (PKNs), a family of machine learning models which generate\nparameters of image filter kernels or other traditional algorithms. A\nlightweight CNN processes the input image at a lower resolution, which yields a\nsignificant speedup compared to other kernel-based machine learning methods and\nallows for new applications. The architecture is learned end-to-end and is\nespecially well suited for a wide range of low-level image processing tasks,\nwhere it improves the performance of many traditional algorithms. We also\ndescribe how this framework unifies some previous work applying machine\nlearning for common image restoration tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 04:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

One important yet unsolved issue for learning on point cloud is that\npoint clouds of the same object can have significant geometric variations if\ngenerated using different procedures or captured using different sensors. These\ninconsistencies induce domain gaps such that neural networks trained on one\ndomain may fail to generalize on others. A typical technique to reduce the\ndomain gap is to perform adversarial training so that point clouds in the\nfeature space can align. However, adversarial training is easy to fall into\ndegenerated local minima, resulting in negative adaptation gains. Here we\npropose a simple yet effective method for unsupervised domain adaptation on\npoint clouds by employing a self-supervised task of learning geometry-aware\nimplicits, which plays two critical roles in one shot. First, the geometric\ninformation in the point clouds is preserved through the implicit\nrepresentations for downstream tasks. More importantly, the domain-specific\nvariations can be effectively learned away in the implicit space. We also\npropose an adaptive strategy to compute unsigned distance fields for arbitrary\npoint clouds due to the lack of shape models in practice. When combined with a\ntask loss, the proposed outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods that rely on adversarial domain alignment and more\ncomplicated self-supervised tasks.

Quantum computing,\nas the most generic usage of quantum information, follows a hybrid architecture\nso far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically, and\nmainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum\nprocessing units. Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its\nclassical ingredients, and cannot reveal the computational power of a fully\nquantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the field. Recently,\nthe nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the\nno-programming and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of\nquantum algorithms and computing models. As a result, in this work we propose a\nmodel of universal quantum computer system, the quantum version of the von\nNeumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e., Bell states) as elements of the\nquantum memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and\nprocessing unit. As a digital quantum system, its global configurations can be\nviewed as tensor-network states. Its universality is proved by the capability\nto execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme via a\nuniversal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty\nprinciple, the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure\ndistinct from the classical case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of\nquantum circuits, including the tailed, nested, and topological ones, to\ncharacterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also be of\nindependent interest in other contexts.

However, aggregating\nmassive (unlabeled) 3D medical images like computerized tomography (CT) remains\nchallenging due to its high imaging cost and privacy restrictions. In this\npaper, we advocate bringing a wealth of 2D images like chest X-rays as\ncompensation for the lack of 3D data, aiming to build a universal medical\nself-supervised representation learning framework, called UniMiSS. The\nfollowing problem is how to break the dimensionality barrier, \\ie, making it\npossible to perform SSL with both 2D and 3D images? To achieve this, we design\na pyramid U-like medical Transformer (MiT). It is composed of the switchable\npatch embedding (SPE) module and Transformers. The SPE module adaptively\nswitches to either 2D or 3D patch embedding, depending on the input dimension.\nThe embedded patches are converted into a sequence regardless of their original\ndimensions. The Transformers model the long-term dependencies in a\nsequence-to-sequence manner, thus enabling UniMiSS to learn representations\nfrom both 2D and 3D images. With the MiT as the backbone, we perform the\nUniMiSS in a self-distillation manner. We conduct expensive experiments on six\n3D/2D medical image analysis tasks, including segmentation and classification.\nThe results show that the proposed UniMiSS achieves promising performance on\nvarious downstream tasks, outperforming the ImageNet pre-training and other\nadvanced SSL counterparts substantially.

It is difficult to accurately estimate the min-entropy of a\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) source. Hence, NIST\nSpecial Publication (SP) 800-90B adopts ten different min-entropy estimators\nand then conservatively selects the minimum value among ten min-entropy\nestimates. Among these estimators, the longest repeated substring (LRS)\nestimator estimates the collision entropy instead of the min-entropy by\ncounting the number of repeated substrings. Since the collision entropy is an\nupper bound on the min-entropy, the LRS estimator inherently provides\n\\emph{overestimated} outputs. In this paper, we propose two techniques to\nestimate the min-entropy of a non-IID source accurately. The first technique\nresolves the overestimation problem by translating the collision entropy into\nthe min-entropy. Next, we generalize the LRS estimator by adopting the general\nR{\\'{e}}nyi entropy instead of the collision entropy (i.e., R{\\'{e}}nyi entropy\nof order two). We show that adopting a higher order can reduce the variance of\nmin-entropy estimates. By integrating these techniques, we propose a\ngeneralized LRS estimator that effectively resolves the overestimation problem\nand provides stable min-entropy estimates. Theoretical analysis and empirical\nresults support that the proposed generalized LRS estimator improves the\nestimation accuracy significantly, which makes it an appealing alternative to\nthe LRS estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 08:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

Their main interests are a\nlarge capacity and a low price per gigabyte, which come at the cost of a much\nlarger file access time than on disks. With tapes, finding the right ordering\nof multiple file accesses is thus key to performance. Moving the reading head\nback and forth along a kilometer long tape has a non-negligible cost and\nunnecessary movements thus have to be avoided. However, the optimization of\ntape request ordering has then rarely been studied in the scheduling\nliterature, much less than I/O scheduling on disks. For instance, minimizing\nthe average service time for several read requests on a linear tape remains an\nopen question. Therefore, in this paper, we aim at improving the quality of\nservice experienced by users of tape storage systems, and not only the peak\nperformance of such systems. To this end, we propose a reasonable\npolynomial-time exact algorithm while this problem and simpler variants have\nbeen conjectured NP-hard. We also refine the proposed model by considering\nU-turn penalty costs accounting for inherent mechanical accelerations.

It can occur in the two-dimensional (2D) tilted\nDirac materials when the energy bands change between the type-I phase ($0<t<1$)\nand the type-II phase ($t>1$) through the type-III phase ($t=1$), where\ndifferent tilts are parametrized by the values of $t$. In order to characterize\nthe Lifshitz transition therein, we theoretically investigate the longitudinal\noptical conductivities (LOCs) in type-I, type-II, and type-III Dirac materials\nwithin linear response theory. In the undoped case, the LOCs are constants\neither independent of the tilt parameter in both type-I and type-III phases or\ndetermined by the tilt parameter in the type-II phase. In the doped case, the\nLOCs are anisotropic and possess two critical frequencies determined by\n$\\omega=\\omega_1(t)$ and $\\omega=\\omega_2(t)$, which are also confirmed by the\njoint density of state. The tilt parameter and chemical potential can be\nextracted from optical experiments by measuring the positions of these two\ncritical boundaries and their separation\n$\\Delta\\omega(t)=\\omega_2(t)-\\omega_1(t)$. With increasing the tilting, the\nseparation becomes larger in the type-I phase whereas smaller in the type-II\nphase. The LOCs in the regime of large photon energy are exactly the same as\nthat in the undoped case. The type of 2D tilted Dirac bands can be determined\nby the asymptotic background values, critical boundaries and their separation\nin the LOCs. These can therefore be taken as signatures of Lifshitz transition\ntherein.

The experiment\nrevealed that the increase of data records or their sample frequency does not\nimmediately lead to significant increases in the model accuracies or\nperformance, however the variance of accuracies does diminish in the case of\nensemble models. Similar phenomenon was witnessed while increasing the number\nof input features for the models. The study refutes the starting assumption and\ncontinues to state that in this case the significance in data lies in the\nquality of the data instead of the quantity of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 09:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

In\norder to produce such contents to support a large applications (e.g.,\ne-commerce), the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered persuasive\nvideo generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is\ninterdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to\ngrasp. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey of AIPVG available. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by reviewing key AI techniques that can be utilized\nto automatically generate persuasive videos. We offer a first-of-its-kind\ntaxonomy which divides AIPVG into three major steps: 1) visual material\nunderstanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs)\nrelevant to the target of promotion; 2) visual storyline generation, which\nshortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a\nstoryline with persuasive power; and 3) post-production, which involves\nbackground music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing\nexperience. We also introduce the evaluation metrics and datasets commonly\nadopted in the field of AIPVG.

A significant percentage of the mass of Sun-like\nstars accumulates during periods of increased accretion known as FUor\noutbursts. Since we know only about two dozen stars of this type, the study of\neach new object is very important for our knowledge. In this paper, we present\ndata from photometric monitoring on a FUor object V2493 Cyg discovered in 2010.\nOur data were obtained in the optical region with BVRI Johnson-Cousins set of\nfilters during the period from November 2016 to February 2021.

Such\nphotometric behavior is not typical of other stars from FUor type. Usually the\nlight curves of FUors are asymmetrical, with a very rapid rise and gradual\ndecline of the brightness. V2493 Cyg remains unique in this respect with a very\nrapid rise in brightness and prolonged retention in maximum light.

One simple option to address such a\nneed is to replace the reasoning based on logical rules with a neural network.\nHowever, this step brings several problems that often create at least a\ntemporary regress.

Turbulent and\ncompressed sheaths contribute to the acceleration of particles in the corona\nand in interplanetary space, but the relation of their internal structures to\nparticle energization is still relatively little studied. In particular, the\nrole of sheaths in accelerating particles when the shock Mach number is low is\na significant open problem. This work seeks to provide new insights on the\ninternal structure of CME sheaths with regard to energetic particle\nenhancements. A good opportunity to achieve this aim was provided by\nobservations of a sheath made by radially aligned spacecraft at 0.8 and $\\sim$\n1 AU (Solar Orbiter, Wind, ACE and BepiColombo) on 19-21 April 2020. The sheath\nwas preceded by a weak shock. Energetic ion enhancements occurred at different\nlocations within the sheath structure at Solar Orbiter and L1. Magnetic\nfluctuation amplitudes at inertial-range scales increased in the sheath\nrelative to the upstream wind. However, when normalised to the local mean\nfield, fluctuation amplitudes did not increase significantly; magnetic\ncompressibility of fluctuation also did not increase. Various substructures\nwere embedded within the sheath at the different spacecraft, including multiple\nheliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings and a small-scale flux rope. At L1,\nthe ion flux enhancement was associated with the HCS crossings, while at Solar\nOrbiter, the enhancement occurred within the rope. Substructures that are swept\nfrom the upstream solar wind and compressed in the sheath can act as\nparticularly effective acceleration sites. A possible acceleration mechanism is\nbetatron acceleration associated with the small-scale flux rope and the warped\nHCS in the sheath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 12:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

However,\ntraditional social learning strategies rely on the fundamental assumption that\neach agent has significant prior knowledge of the underlying distribution of\nthe observations. In this work we overcome this issue by introducing a machine\nlearning framework that exploits social interactions over a graph, leading to a\nfully data-driven solution to the distributed classification problem. In the\nproposed social machine learning (SML) strategy, two phases are present: in the\ntraining phase, classifiers are independently trained to generate a belief over\na set of hypotheses using a finite number of training samples; in the\nprediction phase, classifiers evaluate streaming unlabeled observations and\nshare their instantaneous beliefs with neighboring classifiers.

We analyze LEMP\ntheoretically and establish a finite-sample bound on the regret. We show that\nLEMP achieves a logarithmic regret order with time. We further analyze LEMP\nnumerically and present simulation results that support the theoretical\nfindings and demonstrate that LEMP significantly outperforms alternative\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 12:47:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 08:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The model presented\nis based on a multi commodity network flow model. The model comprises three\ndifferent layers: the demand level in which the requirements on the transports\nare presented, the route layer which describes the routes possible to implement\nthe demands and the flow layer in which the resulting flows of train volumes\nare calculated and distributed over discrete time periods. This structure\ncorresponds well to other industrial planning processes where different\nproducts or services that are to be accomplished are first decomposed by\nmethods into different layers of tasks, by e.g. a work breakdown structure\n(WBS). Resources are then allocated to the tasks as well as scheduled in time.\nThe most important feature of the proposed model is that it is volume based,\ni.e. volume of trains are handled instead of scheduling individual trains.\nScheduling a timetable is a very complex task, and by concentrating on the\nvolumes of trains over time rather than the detailed scheduling of them, the\ncomplexity is greatly reduced which is a large computational advantage. The\ndisadvantage is that the representation of capacity in terms of volumes of\ntrains with different properties becomes crucial. The report discusses these\nadvantages and disadvantages as well as gives two examples of the use of the\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 13:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

While such approaches are viable, an adaptive scheduling\nstrategy is preferred to enhance locality and resource sharing efficiency using\na portable programming scheme. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive\nResource-Moldable Scheduler (ARMS) that dynamically maps a task at runtime to a\npartition spanning one or more threads, based on the task and DAG requirements.\nThe scheduler builds an online platform-independent model for the local and\nnon-local scheduling costs for each tuple consisting of task type (function)\nand task topology (task location within DAG).

In this paper, canonical systems on graphs, not\nnecessarily compact but with finitely many vertices, are introduced and proved\nto be unitarily equivalent to certain higher order canonical systems. It is\nshown that any Schr\\\"odinger operator on a graph is unitarily equivalent to a\ncanonical system on the same graph. Consequently, for an arbitrary canonical\nsystem or Schr\\\"odinger operator on a graph, a representation of the resolvent\nas an integral operator and a spectral representation are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 15:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 20:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

In addition, ultrafast optical\nspectroscopy studies on light-soaked samples show that PM6 singlet excitons are\nrapidly converted into interchain polaron pairs on sub-100 fs timescales; this\nprocess outcompetes electron transfer to Y6, significantly reducing the charge\ngeneration yield of the blend.

However, so\nfar, their potential for high-average-power excitation to reach strong THz\nfields at high repetition rates has not been thoroughly investigated. In this\narticle, we explore the power scaling behavior of tri-layer spintronic emitters\nusing an Yb-fiber excitation source, delivering an average power of 18.5 W at\n400 kHz repetition rate, temporally compressed to a pulse duration of 27 fs. We\nconfirm that the reflection geometry with back-side cooling is ideally suited\nfor these emitters in the high-average-power excitation regime. In order to\nunderstand limiting mechanisms, we disentangle the effects on THz power\ngeneration by average power and pulse energy, by varying the repetition rate of\nthe laser. Our results show that the conversion efficiency remains mostly\ndependent on the incident fluence in this high-average-power,\nhigh-repetition-rate excitation regime if the emitters are efficiently cooled.\nUsing these findings, we optimize the conversion efficiency to reach 5e-6 at\nhighest excitation powers in the back-cooled reflection geometry.

Most previous methods capture cross-modal interactions with a\ntransformer-based multimodal encoder, not fully addressing the misalignment\nbetween unimodal video and text features. Besides, learning fine-grained\nvisual-language alignment usually requires off-the-shelf object detectors to\nprovide object information, which is bottlenecked by the detector's limited\nvocabulary and expensive computation cost.\n  We propose Align and Prompt: an efficient and effective video-and-language\npre-training framework with better cross-modal alignment. First, we introduce a\nvideo-text contrastive (VTC) loss to align unimodal video-text features at the\ninstance level, which eases the modeling of cross-modal interactions. Then, we\npropose a new visually-grounded pre-training task, prompting entity modeling\n(PEM), which aims to learn fine-grained region-entity alignment. To achieve\nthis, we first introduce an entity prompter module, which is trained with VTC\nto produce the similarity between a video crop and text prompts instantiated\nwith entity names. The PEM task then asks the model to predict the entity\npseudo-labels (i.e~normalized similarity scores) for randomly-selected video\ncrops. The resulting pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nboth text-video retrieval and videoQA, outperforming prior work by a\nsubstantial margin.

Many of the people who have the tendency to suicide share\ntheir thoughts and opinions through social media platforms. As part of many\nresearches it is observed that the publicly available posts from social media\ncontain valuable criteria to effectively detect individuals with suicidal\nthoughts. The most difficult part to prevent suicide is to detect and\nunderstand the complex risk factors and warning signs that may lead to suicide.\nThis can be achieved by identifying the sudden changes in a user behavior\nautomatically. Natural language processing techniques can be used to collect\nbehavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these\nfeatures can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in\nhuman interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve\nfast detection of suicidal ideation using deep learning and/or machine learning\nbased classification approaches. For such a purpose, we can employ the\ncombination of LSTM and CNN models to detect such emotions from posts of the\nusers. In order to improve the accuracy, some approaches like using more data\nfor training, using attention model to improve the efficiency of existing\nmodels etc. could be done. This paper proposes a LSTM-Attention-CNN combined\nmodel to analyze social media submissions to detect any underlying suicidal\nintentions.

In this work, we\ndevelop machine learning (ML) models that can use in-situ thermographic data to\npredict the microporosity of LPBF stainless steel materials. This work\nconsiders two identified key features from the thermal histories: the time\nabove the apparent melting threshold (/tau) and the maximum radiance (T_{max}).\nThese features are computed, stored for each voxel in the built material, are\nused as inputs. The binary state of each voxel, either defective or normal, is\nthe output. Different ML models are trained and tested for the binary\nclassification task. In addition to using the thermal features of each voxel to\npredict its own state, the thermal features of neighboring voxels are also\nincluded as inputs. This is shown to improve the prediction accuracy, which is\nconsistent with thermal transport physics around each voxel contributing to its\nfinal state.

The driver personalization indicators and the\nproposed RL-based lane change decision algorithm are promising to contribute in\nautomated lane change system developing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 10:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

The strategies employed to investigate their theoretical properties\nmainly rely on Euclidean geometry, but in the last years new approaches based\non Riemannian geometry have been developed. Motivated by some open problems, we\nstudy a particular sequence of maps between manifolds, with the last manifold\nof the sequence equipped with a Riemannian metric. We investigate the\nstructures induced trough pullbacks on the other manifolds of the sequence and\non some related quotients. In particular, we show that the pullbacks of the\nfinal Riemannian metric to any manifolds of the sequence is a degenerate\nRiemannian metric inducing a structure of pseudometric space, we show that the\nKolmogorov quotient of this pseudometric space yields a smooth manifold, which\nis the base space of a particular vertical bundle.
