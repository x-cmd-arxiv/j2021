As a result,\nstencil computations are typically bandwidth-bound workloads, which only\nexperience limited benefits from the deep cache hierarchy of modern CPUs. In\nthis work, we propose Casper, a near-cache accelerator consisting of\nspecialized stencil compute units connected to the last-level cache (LLC) of a\ntraditional CPU. Casper is based on two key ideas: (1) avoiding the cost of\nmoving rarely reused data through the cache hierarchy, and (2) exploiting the\nregularity of the data accesses and the inherent parallelism of the stencil\ncomputation to increase the overall performance.\n  With minimal changes in LLC address decoding logic and data placement, Casper\nperforms stencil computations at the peak bandwidth of the LLC.

Thus it becomes much harder to\ncollect real data for ReID task. Meanwhile, the labor cost of labeling ReID\ndata is still very high and further hinders the development of the ReID\nresearch. Therefore, many methods turn to generate synthetic images for ReID\nalgorithms as alternatives instead of real images. However, there is an\ninevitable domain gap between synthetic and real images. In previous methods,\nthe generation process is based on virtual scenes, and their synthetic training\ndata can not be changed according to different target real scenes\nautomatically. To handle this problem, we propose a novel Target-Aware\nGeneration pipeline to produce synthetic person images, called TAGPerson.\nSpecifically, it involves a parameterized rendering method, where the\nparameters are controllable and can be adjusted according to target scenes. In\nTAGPerson, we extract information from target scenes and use them to control\nour parameterized rendering process to generate target-aware synthetic images,\nwhich would hold a smaller gap to the real images in the target domain. In our\nexperiments, our target-aware synthetic images can achieve a much higher\nperformance than the generalized synthetic images on MSMT17, i.e. 47.5% vs.\n40.9% for rank-1 accuracy.

In the hydrodynamic\nregime we show that Fermi-liquid theory is consistent with Navier-Stokes\nhydrodynamics at all temperatures. The soft modes are the ones familiar from\nclassical hydrodynamics that are controlled by the five conservation laws;\nnamely, two first-sound modes, two shear diffusion modes, and one heat\ndiffusion mode. These modes have a particle-like spectrum and are soft, or\nscale invariant, at all temperatures. In the collisionless regime we show that\nthe entire single-particle distribution function is soft with a continuous part\nof the spectrum. This continuous soft mode, which is well known but often not\nemphasized, has important physical consequences, e.g., for certain quantum\nphase transitions. In addition, there are the well known soft zero-sound\nexcitations that describe angular fluctuations of the Fermi surface; their\nspectra are particle-like. They are unrelated to conservation laws, acquire a\nmass at any nonzero temperature, and their number depends on the strength of\nthe quasiparticle interaction. We also discuss the fates of these two families\nof soft modes as the temperature changes. With increasing temperature the size\nof the collisionless regime shrinks, the damping of the modes grows, and\neventually all of the collisionless modes become overdamped. In their stead the\nfive hydrodynamic modes appear in the hydrodynamic regime at asymptotically low\nfrequencies.

In a synthesizer, a frequency comb provides a reference grid\nacross a broad spectrum and a frequency-tunable laser accomplishes synthesis by\nphase-lock to the comb. Optical synthesizers have matured to chip-scale with\nintegrated photonics, however, the tunable laser and frequency comb\nfundamentally constrain the tuning range. Here, we present an optical\nsynthesizer based on four-wave mixing (FWM) spectral translation of a tunable\nlaser and a frequency comb. We implement both the spectral translation and the\nfrequency comb by use of advanced microresonators. The intrinsic energy\nconservation of FWM ensures deterministic optical synthesis, and it allows a\nnearly arbitrary frequency tuning range by the dependence of resonant FWM on\ngroup-velocity dispersion, temperature, and tunable laser frequency. Moreover,\nwe take advantage of highly efficient parametric amplification associated with\nspectral translation. We operate spectral translation across output ranges up\nto 200 THz, and we characterize it through ultraprecise optical-frequency\nmetrology, demonstrating <0.1 Hz absolute accuracy and a fractional frequency\nprecision of 4.7x10^(-13) in 1 s measurements.

A critical\nchallenge is to accurately model user intent with only limited evidence in\nthese short sessions.

Hence, this paper proposes a\nnovel session-based recommendation system empowered by hypergraph attention\nnetworks. Three unique properties of the proposed approach are: (i) it\nconstructs a hypergraph for each session to model the item correlations defined\nby various contextual windows in the session simultaneously, to uncover item\nmeanings; (ii) it is equipped with hypergraph attention layers to generate item\nembeddings by flexibly aggregating the contextual information from correlated\nitems in the session; and (iii) it aggregates the dynamic item representations\nfor each session to infer the general purpose and current need, which is\ndecoded to infer the next interesting item in the session.

While this effect can generally\nbe neglected for gapped baths -- a key feature for superconducting qubits -- ,\nit is possible for the bath to be gapped near the potential minima between\nwhich the particle tunnels, but different minima to correspond to different\nbath topologies. This enforces the bath to undergo gap closing along the\ntunneling path. In this work, we investigate quantum tunneling in the presence\nof such a topology-changing fermionic bath. We develop a field theory for this\nproblem, linking the instantons describing tunneling in a bath of $d$ space\ndimensions to topological boundary modes of systems in $d+1$ dimensions, thus\nstepping a level higher in a dimensional hierarchy. We study in detail a $d=1$\nexample, inspired by planar Josephson junctions where the particle coordinate\nis the superconducting phase whose value sets the electronic topology. We find\nthat the topology change suppresses tunneling by a factor scaling exponentially\nwith the system size. This translates to a correspondingly enhanced suppression\nof the energy splitting for the lowest-lying states, despite these being linear\ncombinations of states near potential minima where the bath is gapped.

Ride-hailing is typically complemented with ridepooling options,\nwhich can reduce the negative externalities associated with ride-hailing\nservices and increase the utilization of vehicles. Determining optimal policies\nfor vehicle dispatching and pricing, two key components that enable MoD\nservices, are challenging due to their massive scale and online nature. The\nchallenge is amplified when the MoD platform offers exclusive (conventional\nride-hailing) and shared services, and customers have the option to select\nbetween them. The pricing and dispatching problems are coupled because the\nrealized demand depends on the quality of service (i.e., whom to share rides\nwith) and the prices for each service type. We propose an integrated and\ncomputationally efficient method for solving the joint pricing and dispatching\nproblem -- both when the problem is solved one request at a time or in batches\n(a common strategy in the industry). The main results of this research include\nshowing that: (i) the sequential pricing problem has a closed-form solution\nunder a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model, and (ii) the batched pricing\nproblem is jointly concave in the expected demand distributions. To account for\nthe spatial evolution of supply and demand, we introduce so-called\nretrospective costs to retain a tractable framework.

These\nsenses are combined together to achieve a synergistic effect where the learning\nis more effectively than using each sense separately. For robotics, vision and\ntouch are two key senses for the dexterous manipulation. Vision usually gives\nus apparent features like shape, color, and the touch provides local\ninformation such as friction, texture, etc. Due to the complementary properties\nbetween visual and tactile senses, it is desirable for us to combine vision and\ntouch for a synergistic perception and manipulation. Many researches have been\ninvestigated about multimodal perception such as cross-modal learning, 3D\nreconstruction, multimodal translation with vision and touch. Specifically, we\npropose a cross-modal sensory data generation framework for the translation\nbetween vision and touch, which is able to generate realistic pseudo data.

Our proposed method not only\npays attention to the salient features in each spatial feature, but also models\nthe temporal correlation in the through the time.

In the context of morphological classification of\ngalaxies, we study the effects of perturbations in imaging data. In particular,\nwe examine the consequences of using neural networks when training on baseline\ndata and testing on perturbed data. We consider perturbations associated with\ntwo primary sources: 1) increased observational noise as represented by higher\nlevels of Poisson noise and 2) data processing noise incurred by steps such as\nimage compression or telescope errors as represented by one-pixel adversarial\nattacks. We also test the efficacy of domain adaptation techniques in\nmitigating the perturbation-driven errors. We use classification accuracy,\nlatent space visualizations, and latent space distance to assess model\nrobustness. Without domain adaptation, we find that processing pixel-level\nerrors easily flip the classification into an incorrect class and that higher\nobservational noise makes the model trained on low-noise data unable to\nclassify galaxy morphologies. On the other hand, we show that training with\ndomain adaptation improves model robustness and mitigates the effects of these\nperturbations, improving the classification accuracy by 23% on data with higher\nobservational noise. Domain adaptation also increases by a factor of ~2.3 the\nlatent space distance between the baseline and the incorrectly classified\none-pixel perturbed image, making the model more robust to inadvertent\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 21:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 02:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 20:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

In this paper, we introduce a\ntime-incremental learning framework: given a dataset of labeled signal traces\nwith a common time horizon, we propose a method to predict the label of a\nsignal that is received incrementally over time, referred to as prefix signal.\nPrefix signals are the signals that are being observed as they are generated,\nand their time length is shorter than the common horizon of signals. We present\na novel decision-tree based approach to generate a finite number of Signal\nTemporal Logic (STL) specifications from the given dataset, and construct a\npredictor based on them. Each STL specification, as a binary classifier of\ntime-series data, captures the temporal properties of the dataset over time.\nThe predictor is constructed by assigning time-variant weights to the STL\nformulas. The weights are learned by using neural networks, with the goal of\nminimizing the misclassification rate for the prefix signals defined over the\ngiven dataset. The learned predictor is used to predict the label of a prefix\nsignal, by computing the weighted sum of the robustness of the prefix signal\nwith respect to each STL formula.

We observe that the\nreaction time and accuracy of existing datacenter congestion control schemes\nare inherently limited. They either rely only on explicit feedback about the\nnetwork state (e.g., queue lengths in DCTCP) or only on variations of state\n(e.g., RTT gradient in TIMELY). To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel congestion control algorithm, PowerTCP, which achieves much more\nfine-grained congestion control by adapting to the bandwidth-window product\n(henceforth called power). PowerTCP leverages in-band network telemetry to\nreact to changes in the network instantaneously without loss of throughput and\nwhile keeping queues short. Due to its fast reaction time, our algorithm is\nparticularly well-suited for dynamic network environments and bursty traffic\npatterns. We show analytically and empirically that PowerTCP can significantly\noutperform the state-of-the-art in both traditional datacenter topologies and\nemerging reconfigurable datacenters where frequent bandwidth changes make\ncongestion control challenging. In traditional datacenter networks, PowerTCP\nreduces tail flow completion times of short flows by 80% compared to DCQCN and\nTIMELY, and by 33% compared to HPCC even at 60% network load. In reconfigurable\ndatacenters, PowerTCP achieves 85% circuit utilization without incurring\nadditional latency and cuts tail latency by at least 2x compared to existing\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 22:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

Screening\nprioritization (ie., document ranking) is an approach for assisting researchers\nby providing document rankings where relevant documents are ranked higher than\nirrelevant ones. Seed-driven document ranking (SDR) uses a known relevant\ndocument (ie., seed) as a query and generates such rankings. Previous work on\nSDR seeks ways to identify different term weights in a query document and\nutilizes them in a retrieval model to compute ranking scores. Alternatively, we\nformulate the SDR task as finding similar documents to a query document and\nproduce rankings based on similarity scores. We propose a document matching\nmeasure named Mirror Matching, which calculates matching scores between medical\nabstract texts by incorporating common writing patterns, such as background,\nmethod, result, and conclusion in order. We conduct experiments on CLEF 2019\neHealth Task 2 TAR dataset, and the empirical results show this simple approach\nachieves the higher performance than traditional and neural retrieval models on\nAverage Precision and Precision-focused metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 22:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

In these techniques, the random field is decomposed to a set of\ndeterministic TDBs and time-dependent stochastic coefficients. When applied to\nSPDEs with non-homogeneous stochastic boundary conditions (BCs), appropriate BC\nmust be specified for each of the TDBs. However, determining BCs for TDB is not\ntrivial because: (i) the dimension of the random BCs is different than the rank\nof the TDB subspace; (ii) TDB in most formulations must preserve orthonormality\nor orthogonality constraints and specifying BCs for TDB should not violate\nthese constraints in the space-discretized form.

DML models are often trained with specific\nloss functions, including pairwise-based and proxy-based losses. The\npairwise-based loss functions leverage rich semantic relations among data\npoints, however, they often suffer from slow convergence during DML model\ntraining. On the other hand, the proxy-based loss functions often lead to\nsignificant speedups in convergence during training, while the rich relations\namong data points are often not fully explored by the proxy-based losses. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel DML approach to address these challenges. The\nproposed DML approach makes use of a hybrid loss by integrating the\npairwise-based and the proxy-based loss functions to leverage rich data-to-data\nrelations as well as fast convergence. Furthermore, the proposed DML approach\nutilizes both global and local features to obtain rich representations in DML\nmodel training.

Despite its importance, there is limited work on how to sample clients\neffectively.

The MAB framework,\nhowever, overlooks the scenario where the decision-maker cannot take actions\n(e.g., pulling arms) directly. It is a practically important scenario in many\napplications such as spectrum sharing, crowdsensing, and edge computing. In\nthese applications, the decision-maker would incentivize other selfish agents\nto carry out desired actions (i.e., pulling arms on the decision-maker's\nbehalf). This paper establishes the incentivized online learning (IOL)\nframework for this scenario. The key challenge to design the IOL framework lies\nin the tight coupling of the unknown environment learning and asymmetric\ninformation revelation. To address this, we construct a special Lagrangian\nfunction based on which we propose a socially-optimal mechanism for the IOL\nframework.

To this end, a new technique has emerged for\nmitigating attacks on image classification DNNs, namely, preprocessing\nadversarial images using super resolution -- upscaling low-quality inputs into\nhigh-resolution images. This defense requires running both image classifiers\nand super resolution models on constrained autonomous systems. However, super\nresolution incurs a heavy computational cost. Therefore, in this paper, we\ninvestigate the following question: Does the robustness of image classifiers\nsuffer if we use tiny super resolution models? To answer this, we first review\na recent work called Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) that achieves\nsimilar or better image quality than prior art while requiring 2x to 330x fewer\nMultiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations.

In this paper, we address this\nlimitation by proposing a dynamic fusion-based federated learning(FL) for OWL\nidentification.

Although\nthis bound is proved to be minimax optimal for convex functions, in this paper,\nwe demonstrate that it is possible to further enhance the guarantee for some\neasy problem instances, particularly when online functions are smooth.\nSpecifically, we introduce novel online algorithms that can exploit smoothness\nand replace the dependence on $T$ in dynamic regret with problem-dependent\nquantities: the variation in gradients of loss functions, the cumulative loss\nof the comparator sequence, and the minimum of these two terms. These\nquantities are at most $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ while could be much smaller in benign\nenvironments.

To prove that this is the case, we conducted an\nextensive comparison between recent deep-learning models and naive contextual\nmodels that we devised and surprisingly discovered that the latter easily\noutperforms the former.

Our results show that both forward and futile cycles\nconsist of two biochemical pathways, while backward cycle may be realized\nthrough six possible pathways. Backward motion of kinesin-1 is mainly through\nbackward sliding along microtubule when it is in semi-detach state, and usually\ncoupled with ATP hydrolysis.

The second goal is to propose an\nalgebraically independent subset of $\\mathcal{W}(c_k)$ if $c_k$ is rapidly\nincreasing. As a corollary, we disclose that the minimum of $\\mathcal{W}(k)$ is\ntranscendental. In addition, we apply the main result to the set of $A>1$ such\nthat the integer part of $A^{3^{k!}}$ is always a prime number. As a\nconsequence, we give a certain infinite subset of this set which is\nalgebraically independent. Furthermore, we also get results on the rational\napproximation, $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear independence, and numerical calculations of\nelements in $\\mathcal{W}(c_k)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 03:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 01:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

In this paper, the\ntraining time minimization problem is investigated in a quantized FEEL system,\nwhere the heterogeneous edge devices send quantized gradients to the edge\nserver via orthogonal channels. In particular, a stochastic quantization scheme\nis adopted for compression of uploaded gradients, which can reduce the burden\nof per-round communication but may come at the cost of increasing number of\ncommunication rounds. The training time is modeled by taking into account the\ncommunication time, computation time and the number of communication rounds.\nBased on the proposed training time model, the intrinsic trade-off between the\nnumber of communication rounds and per-round latency is characterized.\nSpecifically, we analyze the convergence behavior of the quantized FEEL in\nterms of the optimality gap.

By routing tokens with a sparse\ngate to a few experts (i.e., a small pieces of the full model), MoE can easily\nincrease the model parameters to a very large scale while keeping the\ncomputation cost in a constant level. Most existing works just initialize some\nrandom experts, set a fixed gating strategy (e.g., Top-k), and train the model\nfrom scratch in an ad-hoc way. We identify that these MoE models are suffering\nfrom the immature experts and unstable sparse gate, which are harmful to the\nconvergence performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient end-to-end MoE\ntraining framework called EvoMoE. EvoMoE starts from training one single expert\nand gradually evolves into a large and sparse MoE structure. EvoMoE mainly\ncontains two phases: the expert-diversify phase to train the base expert for a\nwhile and spawn multiple diverse experts from it, and the gate-sparsify phase\nto learn an adaptive sparse gate and activate a dynamic number of experts.\nEvoMoE naturally decouples the joint learning of both the experts and the\nsparse gate and focuses on learning the basic knowledge with a single expert at\nthe early training stage. Then it diversifies the experts and continues to\ntrain the MoE with a novel Dense-to-Sparse gate (DTS-Gate). Specifically,\ninstead of using a permanent sparse gate, DTS-Gate begins as a dense gate that\nroutes tokens to all experts, then gradually and adaptively becomes sparser\nwhile routes to fewer experts. Evaluations are conducted on three popular\nmodels and tasks, including RoBERTa for masked language modeling task, GPT for\nlanguage modeling task and Transformer for machine translation task.

In contrast, First-Come-First-Served\n(FCFS) minimizes the maximum flow time but may result in poor average flow\ntime. A natural way to balance these two objectives is to minimize the $\\ell_2$\nnorm of flow time. For this problem, no online algorithm is known to achieve a\nbetter competitive ratio than SRPT and FCFS.\n  It can be argued that SRPT and FCFS complement each other. To exploit this\ncomplementary relationship, we mitigate the starvation caused by SRPT with the\nhelp of FCFS. Specifically, when there are starving jobs, we process the job\nthat becomes starving first. The main question is: when should a job be viewed\nas starving? If the timing is too early or too late, then the algorithm still\nbehaves like FCFS or SRPT, respectively. In this paper, we answer the above\nquestion by estimating the number of jobs.

Maintaining\nbeliefs (i.e., distributions) over high-dimensional states (e.g., entire\ntrajectories) was not only shown to significantly improve accuracy, but also\nallows planning with information-theoretic objectives, as required for the\ntasks of active SLAM and information gathering. Nonetheless, planning under\nthis \"smoothing\" paradigm holds a high computational complexity, which makes it\nchallenging for online solution. Thus, we suggest the following idea: before\nplanning, perform a standalone state variable reordering procedure on the\ninitial belief, and \"push forwards\" all the predicted loop closing variables.\nSince the initial variable order determines which subset of them would be\naffected by incoming updates, such reordering allows us to minimize the total\nnumber of affected variables, and reduce the computational complexity of\ncandidate evaluation during planning. We call this approach PIVOT: Predictive\nIncremental Variable Ordering Tactic. Applying this tactic can also improve the\nstate inference efficiency; if we maintain the PIVOT order after the planning\nsession, then we should similarly reduce the cost of loop closures, when they\nactually occur. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied PIVOT in a\nrealistic active SLAM simulation, where we managed to significantly reduce the\ncomputation time of both the planning and inference sessions. The approach is\napplicable to general distributions, and induces no loss in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 07:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

We investigate how anomalies in the train set\naffect the training of forecasting models, which are commonly used for time\nseries anomaly detection, and show that our method improves the training of the\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 07:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

Among them, image hiding steganography(hiding\nimage with image) has attracted much attention in recent years because of its\ngreat steganographic capacity. However, images generated by image hiding\nsteganography may show some obvious color distortion or artificial texture\ntraces. We propose a color image steganographic model based on frequency\nsub-band selection to solve the above problems. Firstly, we discuss the\nrelationship between the characteristics of different color spaces/frequency\nsub-bands and the generated image quality. Then, we select the B channel of the\nRGB image as the embedding channel and the high-frequency sub-band as the\nembedding domain. DWT(discrete wavelet transformation) transforms B channel\ninformation and secret gray image into frequency domain information, and then\nthe secret image is embedded and extracted in the frequency domain.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that images generated by our model have\nbetter image quality, and the imperceptibility is significantly increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 07:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

Despite of the recent success of GNNs, the\ngraph convolution in most GNNs have two limitations. Since the graph\nconvolution is performed in a small local neighborhood on the input graph, it\nis inherently incapable to capture long-range dependencies between distance\nnodes. In addition, when a node has neighbors that belong to different classes,\ni.e., heterophily, the aggregated messages from them often negatively affect\nrepresentation learning. To address the two common problems of graph\nconvolution, in this paper, we propose Deformable Graph Convolutional Networks\n(Deformable GCNs) that adaptively perform convolution in multiple latent spaces\nand capture short/long-range dependencies between nodes. Separated from node\nrepresentations (features), our framework simultaneously learns the node\npositional embeddings (coordinates) to determine the relations between nodes in\nan end-to-end fashion. Depending on node position, the convolution kernels are\ndeformed by deformation vectors and apply different transformations to its\nneighbor nodes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Deformable GCNs\nflexibly handles the heterophily and achieve the best performance in node\nclassification tasks on six heterophilic graph datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 07:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

The\nproperties of their vibrational modes in 2--15 $\\mu \\rm m$ are investigated in\nrelation to the Unidentified Infrared (UIR) bands. It is found that neutral\nPAHs, when incorporated with NH$_2$ and N (at inner positions), produce intense\ninfrared bands at 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 $\\mu \\rm m$ that have been normally\nattributed to ionized PAHs so far.

This motivates us to propose a more general\nframework, called sketched Bregman projection (SBP) method, in which we are\nable to find solutions with certain structures from linear systems. To\ngeneralize the concept of adaptive sampling to the SBP method, we show how the\nprogress, measured by Bregman distance, of single step depends directly on a\nsketched loss function. Theoretically, we provide detailed global convergence\nresults for the SBP method with different adaptive sampling rules. At last, for\nthe (sparse) Kaczmarz methods, a group of numerical simulations are tested,\nwith which we verify that the methods utilizing sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin rule\ndemands the fewest computational costs to achieve a given error bound comparing\nto the corresponding methods with other sampling rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 08:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In this paper, we consider\na matching problem in which items of different classes arrive according to\nindependent Poisson processes. Unmatched items are stored in a queue, and\ncompatibility constraints are described by a simple graph on the classes, so\nthat two items can be matched if their classes are neighbors in the graph. We\nanalyze the efficiency of matching policies, not only in terms of system\nstability, but also in terms of matching rates between different classes.\n  Our results rely on the observation that, under any stable policy, the\nmatching rates satisfy a conservation equation that equates the arrival and\ndeparture rates of each item class. Our main contributions are threefold. We\nfirst introduce a mapping between the dimension of the solution set of this\nconservation equation, the structure of the compatibility graph, and the\nexistence of a stable policy. In particular, this allows us to derive a\nnecessary and sufficient stability condition that is verifiable in polynomial\ntime. Secondly, we describe the convex polytope of non-negative solutions of\nthe conservation equation. When this polytope is reduced to a single point, we\ngive a closed-form expression of the solution; in general, we characterize the\nvertices of this polytope using again the graph structure. Lastly, we study the\nparts of the polytope that can be achieved by a stable policy. We show that\ngreedy policies are limited to the interior of the polytope, with a strict\ninclusion in general. In contrast, non-greedy policies can reach any point of\nthe interior of this polytope, and also reach the boundary of the polytope\ndepending on a simple condition on the vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 08:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 08:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 13:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

The minimum color degree of\n$G$, denoted by $\\delta^c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of colors\nassigned to the edges incident to a vertex in $G$. In 2013, H. Li proved that\nan edge-colored graph $G$ on $n$ vertices contains a rainbow triangle if\n$\\delta^c(G)\\geq \\frac{n+1}{2}$. In this paper, we obtain several estimates on\nthe number of rainbow triangles through one given vertex in $G$.

Two candidate mechanisms have recently been considered for the\nnonlinear modulation of solar cycle amplitudes. Tilt quenching (TQ) is a\nnegative feedback between cycle amplitude and the mean tilt angle of bipolar\nactive regions relative to the azimuthal direction; latitude quenching (LQ)\nconsists in a positive correlation between cycle amplitude and average\nemergence latitude of active regions. Aims. Here we explore the relative\nimportance of and the determining factors behind the LQ and TQ effects.\nMethods. The degree of nonlinearity induced by TQ, LQ and their combination is\nsystematically probed in a grid of surface flux transport (SFT) models. The\nrole of TQ and LQ is also explored in the successful 2x2D dynamo model\noptimized to reproduce the statistical behaviour of real solar cycles. Results.\nThe relative importance of LQ vs TQ is found to correlate with the ratio u 0\n/{\\eta} in the SFT model grid, where u 0 is the meridional flow amplitude and\n{\\eta} is diffusivity. An analytical interpretation of this result is given,\nfurther showing that the main underlying parameter is the dynamo effectivity\nrange {\\lambda} R which in turn is determined by the ratio of equatorial flow\ndivergence to diffusivity. The relative importance of LQ vs TQ is shown to\nscale as C 1 +C 2 /{\\lambda} 2 R .

Key idea of the proposed approach, henceforth referred to as semantic\nfeature extraction-based GZSL (SE-GZSL), is to use the semantic feature\ncontaining only attribute-related information in learning the relationship\nbetween the image and the attribute. In doing so, we can remove the\ninterference, if any, caused by the attribute-irrelevant information contained\nin the image feature. To train a network extracting the semantic feature, we\npresent two novel loss functions, 1) mutual information-based loss to capture\nall the attribute-related information in the image feature and 2)\nsimilarity-based loss to remove unwanted attribute-irrelevant information. From\nextensive experiments using various datasets, we show that the proposed SE-GZSL\ntechnique outperforms conventional GZSL approaches by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 09:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

Moreover, in recent years, point process models\non the foundation of neural networks, especially recurrent neural networks\n(RNN) are proposed and compare with the traditional models, their performance\nare greatly improved. Enlighten by transformer model, which can learning\nsequence data efficiently without recurrent and convolutional structure,\ntransformer Hawkes process is come out, and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. However, there is some research proving that the re-introduction\nof recursive calculations in transformer can further improve transformers\nperformance. Thus, we come out with a new kind of transformer Hawkes process\nmodel, universal transformer Hawkes process (UTHP), which contains both\nrecursive mechanism and self-attention mechanism, and to improve the local\nperception ability of the model, we also introduce convolutional neural network\n(CNN) in the position-wise-feed-forward part. We conduct experiments on several\ndatasets to validate the effectiveness of UTHP and explore the changes after\nthe introduction of the recursive mechanism. These experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that the performance of our proposed new model has a\ncertain improvement compared with the previous state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 09:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

We provide a statistical study of 30 high frequency waves associated with\nspicule type events. These high frequency oscillations have two components of\ntransverse motions: the plane of sky (POS) motion and the line of sight (LOS)\nmotion. We focus on single isolated spicules and track the POS using time\ndistance analysis and in the LOS direction using Doppler information. We use\nmoment analysis to find the relation between the two motions. The composition\nof these two motions suggests that the wave has a helical structure. The\noscillations do not have phase differences between points along the structure.\nThis may be the result of the oscillation being a standing mode, or that\npropagation is mostly in the perpendicular direction. There is evidence of fast\nmagnetoacoustic wave fronts propagating across these structures. To conclude,\nwe hypothesize that the compression and rarefaction of passing magnetoacoustic\nwaves may influence the appearance of spicule type events, not only by\ncontributing to moving them in and out of the wing of the spectral line but\nalso through the creation of density enhancements and an increase in opacity in\nthe Halpha line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 10:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

In an attempt to strengthen realism, a\nrecent line of research uses advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep\nlearning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to seed faults that look like\n(syntactically) real ones, implying that fault realism is related to syntactic\nsimilarity. This raises the question of whether seeding syntactically similar\nfaults indeed results in semantically similar faults and more generally whether\nsyntactically dissimilar faults are far away (semantically) from the real ones.\nWe answer this question by employing 4 fault-seeding techniques (PiTest - a\npopular mutation testing tool, IBIR - a tool with manually crafted fault\npatterns, DeepMutation - a learning-based fault seeded framework and CodeBERT -\na novel mutation testing tool that use code embeddings) and demonstrate that\nsyntactic similarity does not reflect semantic similarity.

The innovation of labor-saving technologies and the\nrenewal of traditional extraction methodology, however, induced the\ninstitutional change through the revision of labor regulations on the female\nminers in the early 1930s. This dramatically changed the mines as the place\nwhere skilled males were the principal miners engaged in the underground works.\nI investigate the impact of coal mining on the regional growth and assess how\nthe institutional change induced by the labor regulations affected its process.\nBy linking the location information of mines with registration- and\ncensus-based statistics, I found that coal mines led to the remarkable\npopulation growths. The labor regulations did not stagnate but accelerated the\nlocal population growth as it had forced female miners to exist from labor\nmarket and to form their families. The regulations prohibited risky underground\nworks by the female miners. This reduction in the occupational hazards also led\nto the improvements in the early-life mortality via the mortality selection\nmechanism in utero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 11:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 12:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 07:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 06:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 12:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 13:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 13:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 06:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 14:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Motivated by the mutual influence\nbetween language and perception in cognition, we apply systematic manipulations\nto the agents' (i) visual representations, to analyze the effects on emergent\ncommunication, and (ii) communication protocols, to analyze the effects on\nvisual representations. Our analyses show that perceptual biases shape semantic\ncategorization and communicative content. Conversely, if the communication\nprotocol partitions object space along certain attributes, agents learn to\nrepresent visual information about these attributes more accurately, and the\nrepresentations of communication partners align. Finally, an evolutionary\nanalysis suggests that visual representations may be shaped in part to\nfacilitate the communication of environmentally relevant distinctions.

A main limitation of current source\ndetection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network,\nwhich is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called\npatient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new\nframework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework\n(SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the\nfirst hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact\nnetwork other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then\nexplore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test\nqueries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be\nasymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is\nto find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible.\n  We propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is\nmore data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic\nagents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic\nagents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art\nadaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF,\neven though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network.\nExtending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate\nthe probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our\nanalytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on\nthe Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the\nfirst time source detection algorithms are tested on such a complex dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

To avoid heating of the ions by stray electric fields, the\nreactions are observed within the large orbit of a highly excited Rydberg\nelectron. A beam of He Rydberg atoms was merged with a supersonic beam of\nammonia using a curved surface-electrode Rydberg-Stark deflector, which was\nalso used for adjusting the final velocity of the He Rydberg atoms, and thus\nthe collision energy ($E_{\\rm coll}$). A collision-energy resolution of about\n200 mK was reached at the lowest $E_{\\rm coll}$ values.

We\ncritically examined the violation of L\\\"uders bound of LGIs and its relation to\nthe violation of various no-signaling in time conditions, another formalism for\ntesting macrorealism. It is shown that mere violations of no-signaling\nconditions are not enough to warrant the violation of standard LGIs, an\ninterplay between the violations of various NSIT condition along with a\nthreshold value play an important role. On the other hand violation of\nthird-order LGI is obtained when the degree of violation of a specific\nno-signaling in time condition reaches a different threshold value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 13:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

As the number of GW events\nincreases to 700, the constraint precision of $H_0$ will exceed that of the\n\\textit{Planck} 2018 results.

Through a numerical approach\nwe study the dependence of collapse times on the physical features of the\nsuperposition generated, including also the effect of a finite reaction time of\nthe measuring apparatus. We find that collapse dynamics is sensitive to the\nnumber of detectors and the physical properties of the photon-detector quantum\nstates superposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 14:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

Scale-free regret\nbounds must scale linearly with the maximum loss, both toward large losses and\ntoward very small losses. Adaptive regret bounds demonstrate that an algorithm\ncan take advantage of easy data and potentially have constant regret. We seek\nto develop fast algorithms that depend on as few parameters as possible, in\nparticular they should be anytime and thus not depend on the time horizon. Our\nfirst and main tool, isotuning, is a generalization of the idea of balancing\nthe trade-off of the regret. We develop a set of tools to design and analyze\nsuch learning rates easily and show that they adapts automatically to the rate\nof the regret (whether constant, $O(\\log T)$, $O(\\sqrt{T})$, etc.) within a\nfactor 2 of the optimal learning rate in hindsight for the same observed\nquantities. The second tool is an online correction, which allows us to obtain\ncentered bounds for many algorithms, to prevent the regret bounds from being\nvacuous when the domain is overly large or only partially constrained. The last\ntool, null updates, prevents the algorithm from performing overly large\nupdates, which could result in unbounded regret, or even invalid updates. We\ndevelop a general theory using these tools and apply it to several standard\nalgorithms. In particular, we (almost entirely) restore the adaptivity to small\nlosses of FTRL for unbounded domains, design and prove scale-free adaptive\nguarantees for a variant of Mirror Descent (at least when the Bregman\ndivergence is convex in its second argument), extend Adapt-ML-Prod to\nscale-free guarantees, and provide several other minor contributions about\nProd, AdaHedge, BOA and Soft-Bayes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 14:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

To achieve computationally feasible inference\nfor large datasets, a popular approach is the Vecchia approximation, which is\nan ordered conditional approximation of the data vector that implies a sparse\nCholesky factor of the precision matrix. The ordering and sparsity pattern are\ntypically determined based on Euclidean distance of the inputs or locations\ncorresponding to the data points.

The correlation-based approach has two advantages\nfor complex settings: It can result in more accurate approximations, and it\noffers a simple, automatic strategy that can be applied to any covariance, even\nwhen Euclidean distance is not applicable.

By making use of the\ncompleteness relation for the flavor wave functions of the ground state baryon\n{\\bf 20'} representation we are able to rewrite the results of the current\nalgebra approach in terms of the seven topological tensor invariants describing\nthe decays. The representation of the current algebra results in terms of\ntopological tensor invariants depends only on the initial and final state of\nthe process. The summation over intermediate states inherent to the current\nalgebra result is automatically taken care of in the tensor representation. In\nthis way one arrives at a new, quick and very compact assessment of the results\nof the current algebra/pole model calculation. For example, one can quickly\nidentify the decays in which the p.v.\\ $S$-wave amplitude is predicted to\nvanish implying zero polarization asymmetries in these decays. We provide\ntables of the values of the seven topological tensor invariants for all Cabibbo\nfavored and singly and doubly Cabibbo suppressed nonleptonic single and double\ncharm baryon decays.

Due to the one-to-many nature of the SSR\nproblem, a single RGB image can be reprojected to many HSIs. The key to tackle\nthis ill-posed problem is to plug into multi-source prior information such as\nthe natural spatial context-prior of RGB images, deep feature-prior or inherent\nstatistical-prior of HSIs, etc., so as to effectively alleviate the degree of\nill-posedness. However, most current approaches only consider the general and\nlimited priors in their customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which\nleads to the inability to guarantee the confidence and fidelity of\nreconstructed spectra. In this paper, we propose a novel holistic\nprior-embedded relation network (HPRN) to integrate comprehensive priors to\nregularize and optimize the solution space of SSR. Basically, the core\nframework is delicately assembled by several multi-residual relation blocks\n(MRBs) that fully facilitate the transmission and utilization of the\nlow-frequency content prior of RGBs. Innovatively, the semantic prior of RGB\ninputs is introduced to mark category attributes, and a semantic-driven spatial\nrelation module (SSRM) is invented to perform the feature aggregation of\nclustered similar range for refining recovered characteristics. Additionally,\nwe develop a transformer-based channel relation module (TCRM), which breaks the\nhabit of employing scalars as the descriptors of channel-wise relations in the\nprevious deep feature-prior, and replaces them with certain vectors to make the\nmapping function more robust and smoother. In order to maintain the\nmathematical correlation and spectral consistency between hyperspectral bands,\nthe second-order prior constraints (SOPC) are incorporated into the loss\nfunction to guide the HSI reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 15:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 08:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

These vulnerabilities result in a failed transaction\nwith an out-of-gas error and are often present in contracts containing loops\nwhose bounds are affected by end-user input. Note that such vulnerabilities\ndiffer from gas limit DoS on the network via block stuffing. Therefore, we\npresent Gas Gauge, a tool aimed at detecting Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities in\nEthereum smart contracts. Gas Gauge consists of three major components: the\nDetection, Identification, and Correction Phases. The Detection Phase consists\nof an accurate static analysis approach that finds and summarizes all the loops\nin a smart contract. The Identification Phase uses a white-box fuzzing approach\nto generate a set of inputs that causes the contract to run out of gas. The\nCorrection Phase uses static analysis and run-time verification to predict the\nmaximum loop bounds consistent with allowable gas usage and suggest appropriate\nrepairs to the user of the tool. Each part of the tool can be used separately\nfor different purposes or all together to detect, identify and help repair the\ncontracts vulnerable to Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities. Gas Gauge was tested on\n1,000 real-world solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet. The\nresults were compared to seven state-of-the-art static and symbolic tools, and\nit was empirically demonstrated that Gas Gauge is far more effective than\ncompeting state-of-the-art tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 01:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 22:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Consequently, the discriminative capability\nof the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep\ngraph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by\nreducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method,\nwe first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the\ncross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix\nto approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information\ncorrelation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of\nthe resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse\ncaused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term\nto enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow\nnetwork structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 04:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Several mathematical approaches have been proposed to\nmodel the coupling of both processes, where one of the most successful methods\nrelies on a phase field that encodes the morphology of the cell, together with\nthe integration of partial differential equations that account for the\npolarization mechanism inside the cell domain as defined by the phase field.\nThis approach has been previously employed to model the motion of single cells\nof the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used model organism to\nstudy actin-driven motility and chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells. Besides single\ncell motility, Dictyostelium discoideum is also well-known for its collective\nbehavior. Here, we extend the previously introduced model for single cell\nmotility to describe the collective motion of large populations of interacting\namoebae by including repulsive interactions between the cells. We performed\nnumerical simulations of this model, first characterizing the motion of single\ncells in terms of their polarity and velocity vectors. We then systematically\nstudied the collisions between two cells that provided the basic interaction\nscenarios also observed in larger ensembles of interacting amoebae.

X 8, 011015 (2018)] it has been\ndemonstrated that discrimination of two nonorthogonal pure quantum states\nentails contextual advantage when the states are supplied with equal prior\nprobabilities. We generalized the work to arbitrary prior probabilities as well\nas to three arbitrary mirror-symmetric states. We show that the contextual\nadvantage can be obtained for any value of prior probability when only two\nquantum states are present in the task. But surprisingly, in the case of three\nmirror-symmetric states, the contextual advantage is available only for a\nrestrictive range of prior probabilities with which the states are prepared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 14:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is\noften problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they\nmight be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result,\nDPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address\nthis issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm,\nwhich is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering\ntask on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data\npoints and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives\nfor further analysis of the clusters' property. Furthermore, we divide all data\npoints into different levels according to their local density and propose a\nunified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and\nDBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different\ndensity levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive\nexperiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six\nimage datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two\nclassical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended\nDPC algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network\nweights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new\ntarget modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We\npropose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to\nthe commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model\nwith larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of\nsource and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts\nfeatures of the target modality, matching these to the features from the\ncorresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature\nmatching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different\nneural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data.\nParticularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the\nnon-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically\noutperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from\n0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets.

We obtain an\nexact solution for the decay rate to equilibrium for a conformal fluid in\nkinetic theory under the relaxation time approximation, and compare it to two\nhydrodynamic schemes, one accounting for the second moments of the distribution\nfunction and thus equivalent, in the small deviations from equilibrium limit,\nto an Israel-Stewart framework, and another accounting for both second and\nthird moments. While still having a finite characteristic speed, the second\nmodel is a significant improvement on the first.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 19:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 23:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, many ILP systems lack the ability\nto naturally learn from any noisy or partially misclassified training data. We\nintroduce the relaxed learning from failures approach to ILP, a noise handling\nmodification of the previously introduced learning from failures (LFF) approach\nwhich is incapable of handling noise. We additionally introduce the novel Noisy\nPopper ILP system which implements this relaxed approach and is a modification\nof the existing Popper system. Like Popper, Noisy Popper takes a\ngenerate-test-constrain loop to search its hypothesis space wherein failed\nhypotheses are used to construct hypothesis constraints. These constraints are\nused to prune the hypothesis space, making the hypothesis search more\nefficient. However, in the relaxed setting, constraints are generated in a more\nlax fashion as to avoid allowing noisy training data to lead to hypothesis\nconstraints which prune optimal hypotheses. Constraints unique to the relaxed\nsetting are generated via hypothesis comparison. Additional constraints are\ngenerated by weighing the accuracy of hypotheses against their sizes to avoid\noverfitting through an application of the minimum description length. We\nsupport this new setting through theoretical proofs as well as experimental\nresults which suggest that Noisy Popper improves the noise handling\ncapabilities of Popper but at the cost of overall runtime efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 16:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 01:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Noticeable\nchanges of the intensity of the N$-$H and Si$-$N absorption bands have been\nobserved in the IR absorbance spectra as a result of the deposition of the\nsilicon and germanium films. The thicker was the deposited film, the more\nconsiderable were the decrease of N$-$H absorption band intensity and the\nincrease in that of the Si$-$N band. This tendency has been observed during the\ngrowth of both amorphous and polycrystalline Si or Ge films. The reduction of\nIR absorption at the band assigned to the N$-$H bond vibration is explained by\nbreaking of these bonds followed by the diffusion of the hydrogen atoms from\nthe Si$_3$N$_4$ layer into the growing film of silicon or germanium. The effect\nof the deposited film thickness on the diffusion of hydrogen is discussed\nwithin a model of the diffusion of hydrogen atoms controlled by the difference\nin chemical potentials of hydrogen atoms in the dielectric Si$_3$N$_4$ layer\nand the growing silicon or germanium film. Hydrogen atoms escape from the\nSi$_3$N$_4$ layer only during the deposition of a Si or Ge film when its\nthickness gradually grows. The interruption of the film growth stops the\nmigration of hydrogen atoms into the film because of the decline in the\nchemical potential difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 11:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}
