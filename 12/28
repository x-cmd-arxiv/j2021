DDF prevents existing CVR models\nfrom being effective since 1) several months of data are needed to train CVR\nmodels sufficiently in small scenarios, leading to considerable distribution\ndiscrepancy between training and online serving; and 2) e-commerce promotions\nhave significant impacts on small scenarios, leading to distribution\nuncertainty of the upcoming time period. In this work, we propose a novel CVR\nmethod named MetaCVR from a perspective of meta learning to address the DDF\nissue. Firstly, a base CVR model which consists of a Feature Representation\nNetwork (FRN) and output layers is designed and trained sufficiently with\nsamples across months. Then we treat time periods with different data\ndistributions as different occasions and obtain positive and negative\nprototypes for each occasion using the corresponding samples and the\npre-trained FRN. Subsequently, a Distance Metric Network (DMN) is devised to\ncalculate the distance metrics between each sample and all prototypes to\nfacilitate mitigating the distribution uncertainty. At last, we develop an\nEnsemble Prediction Network (EPN) which incorporates the output of FRN and DMN\nto make the final CVR prediction. In this stage, we freeze the FRN and train\nthe DMN and EPN with samples from recent time period, therefore effectively\neasing the distribution discrepancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study of CVR prediction targeting the DDF issue in small-scale\nrecommendation scenarios.

While most previous studies of the\nRIS focus on its ability to beamform and to boost the received signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), this paper shows that if the information data stream is also\navailable at the RIS and can be modulated through the adjustable phases at the\nRIS, significant improvement in the {degree-of-freedom} (DoF) of the overall\nchannel is possible. For example, for an RIS system in which the signals are\nreflected from a transmitter with $M$ antennas to a receiver with $K$ antennas\nthrough an RIS with $N$ reflective elements, assuming no direct path between\nthe transmitter and the receiver, joint transmission of the transmitter and the\nRIS can achieve a DoF of $\\min(M+\\frac{N}{2}-\\frac{1}{2},N,K)$ as compared to\nthe DoF of $\\min(M,K)$ for the conventional multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) channel. This result is obtained by establishing a connection between\nthe RIS system and the MIMO channel with phase noises and by using results for\ncharacterizing the information dimension under projection. The result is\nfurther extended to the case with a direct path between the transmitter and the\nreceiver, and also to the multiple access scenario, in which the transmitter\nand the RIS send independent information. Finally, this paper proposes a\nsymbol-level precoding approach for modulating data through the phases of the\nRIS, and provides numerical simulation results to verify the theoretical DoF\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 17:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

It enables bacteria and algae to\nexplore space for food, cancer to spread, and immune system to fight\ninfections.\n  Motile cells display trajectories of intriguing complexity, from regular\n(e.g. circular, helical, and so on) to irregular motions (run-tumble), the\norigin of which has remained elusive for over a century. This dynamics\nversatility is conventionally attributed to the shape asymmetry of the motile\nentity, to the suspending media, and/or to stochastic regulation. We propose\nhere a universal approach highlighting that these movements are generic,\noccurring for a large class of cells and artificial microswimmers, without the\nneed of invoking shape asymmetry nor stochasticity, but are encoded in their\ninherent nonlinear evolution.\n  We show, in particular, that for a circular and spherical particle moving in\na simple fluid, circular, helical and chaotic motions (akin to a persistent\nrandom walk) emerge naturally in different regions of parameter space. This\nestablishes the operating principles for complex trajectories manifestation of\nmotile systems, and offers a new vision with minimal ingredients. The reduced\nevolution equations based on symmetries are consistent with those derived for a\nmodel of an autophoretic particle including diffusion, emission/absorption at\nthe particle surface and hydrodynamics, and provide qualitative and\nquantitative agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 17:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nof infants demonstrates a specific pattern of development beyond simply\nmyelination. While radiologists have used myelination patterns, brain\nmorphology and size characteristics to determine age-adequate brain maturity,\nthis requires years of experience in pediatric neuroradiology. With no\nstandardized criteria, visual estimation of the structural maturity of the\nbrain from MRI before three years of age remains dominated by inter-observer\nand intra-observer variability. A more objective estimation of brain\ndevelopmental age could help physicians identify many neurodevelopmental\nconditions and diseases earlier and more reliably.

In this light, we explore the\ngeneral feasibility to tackle this task, and the utility of different\napproaches, including two- and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) that were trained on a fusion of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton\ndensity (PD) weighted sequences from 84 individual subjects divided into four\nage groups from birth to 3 years of age.

However, while this rate is tight in the worst case, it remained\nopen whether faster rates are possible, without prior knowledge, if few changes\nin distribution are actually severe.\n  To resolve this question, we propose a new notion of significant shift, which\nonly counts very severe changes that clearly necessitate a restart: roughly,\nthese are changes involving not only best arm switches, but also involving\nlarge aggregate differences in reward overtime. Thus, our resulting procedure\nadaptively achieves rates always faster (sometimes significantly) than\n$O(\\sqrt{ST})$, where $S\\ll L$ only counts best arm switches, while at the same\ntime, always faster than the optimal $O(V^{\\frac{1}{3}}T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ when\nexpressed in terms of total variation $V$ (which aggregates differences\novertime).

Model\nreduction can thus play an important role in reducing the computational cost\nfor an efficient prediction of shocks. Yet, reduced models typically aim to\napproximate large-scale dominating dynamics, which do not resolve the small\nscales by design. To resolve this representation barrier, we introduce a new\nqualitative characterization of the space-time locations of shocks, named as\nthe ``shock trace'', via a space-time indicator function based on an empirical\nresolution-adaptive threshold. Different from the exact shocks, the shock\ntraces can be captured within the representation capacity of the large scales,\nwhich facilitates the forecast of the timing and locations of the shocks\nutilizing reduced models. Within the context of a viscous stochastic Burgers\nequation, we show that a data-driven reduced model, in the form of nonlinear\nautoregression (NAR) time series models, can accurately predict the random\nshock traces, with relatively low rates of false predictions. The NAR model\nsignificantly outperforms the corresponding Galerkin truncated model in the\nscenario of either noiseless or noisy observations. The results illustrate the\nimportance of the data-driven closure terms in the NAR model, which account for\nthe effects of the unresolved small scale dynamics on the resolved ones due to\nnonlinear interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 18:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The disc gains mass from the envelope, and transports matter to the star\nvia a disc accretion mechanism that includes episodic gravitational instability\nand mass accretion bursts according to the Toomre $Q$-criterion.

The origin of most of these\nhypervelocity stars (HVSs) is still poorly constrained. Here we show that the\nvelocity distribution, and in particular the deficiency in >700 km/s HVSs is\ninconsistent with binary disruptions by the massive black hole (MBH) in the\nGalactic Centre. This conclusion holds in the full and empty loss cone regime,\nand for secular instabilities in eccentric disks. Accounting for multiple close\nencounters between binaries and the MBH, does not qualitatively change the\nresults. Moreover, there is no observed counterpart population in the Galactic\nCentre that is consistent with the HVSs. The star-formation history could be\ntuned explain the HVS velocity distribution, but this tuning would produce a\nmismatch with the observed HVS flight times. Frequent stellar collisions of the\nbinary components due to interactions with the MBH do not significantly impact\nthe velocity distribution in the Galactic halo. Such collisions, however, can\nleave observable remnants in the Galactic Centre, and potentially explain the\norigins of G2-like dust clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 19:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 15:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

However,\nmethods to detect shift or variance in data have not been significantly\nresearched. Challenges to this are the lack of effective approaches to learn\ndense representation of a dataset and difficulties of sharing private data\nacross medical institutions. To overcome the problems, we propose a unified\npipeline called MedShift to detect the top-level shift samples and thus\nfacilitate the medical curation. Given an internal dataset A as the base\nsource, we first train anomaly detectors for each class of dataset A to learn\ninternal distributions in an unsupervised way. Second, without exchanging data\nacross sources, we run the trained anomaly detectors on an external dataset B\nfor each class. The data samples with high anomaly scores are identified as\nshift data. To quantify the shiftness of the external dataset, we cluster B's\ndata into groups class-wise based on the obtained scores. We then train a\nmulti-class classifier on A and measure the shiftness with the classifier's\nperformance variance on B by gradually dropping the group with the largest\nanomaly score for each class. Additionally, we adapt a dataset quality metric\nto help inspect the distribution differences for multiple medical sources. We\nverify the efficacy of MedShift with musculoskeletal radiographs (MURA) and\nchest X-rays datasets from more than one external source.

Pruning, a\ntraditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely\napplied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to\nperform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:\nthe structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the\nrelated edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and\npropose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on\nvanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as\nPooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based\nmulti-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive\ninstance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,\nwhich integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module\ninto a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather\nthan being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through\nour proposed computation-aware training strategy.

However, depending on the cost of single\nobservations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may\nstill be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this\nissue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution\napproximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for\nmulti-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms\nthat are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.\n  Here we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many\nsituations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either\nvia a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an\nadditional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous\nmulti-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately\nestablish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost\nreduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto\noptimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.\n  The presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in\nexisting, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be\nextended to batch optimization.

A low-cost, rapidly fabricable\nrobot inspired by the physiological structure of bacteria is presented. It\nconsists of a rigid head, with a motor and batteries embedded, and multiple\nelastic rods (our model for flagella) to investigate locomotion in GM. The\nelastic flagella are rotated at one end by the motor, and they deform due to\nthe drag from GM, propelling the robot. The external drag is determined by the\nflagellar shape, while the latter changes due to the competition between\nexternal loading and elastic forces. In this coupled fluid-structure\ninteraction problem, we observe that increasing the number of flagella can\ndecrease or increase the propulsive speed of the robot, depending on the\nphysical parameters of the system.

The interplay between the\nmagnetic fields and the fluid motion gives rise to complex flow physics, which\ndepend on the electrical conductivity of the bounding walls. An effective\napproach to represent the latter is via the Shercliff boundary condition for\nthin conducting walls relating the induced magnetic field and its wall normal\ngradient at the boundary via a parameter referred to as the wall conductance\nratio (Shercliff, JA, J. Fluid Mech. 1, 644 (1956)).

However,\nthe prior LB algorithms only accounted for limiting special cases involving\nperfectly insulated boundaries and did not consider the finite conductivity\neffects. In this paper, we present two new boundary schemes that enforce the\nShercliff boundary condition in the LB schemes for MHD. It allows for the\nspecification of the wall conductance ratio to any desired value based on the\nactual conductivities and length scales of the container and the wall\nthicknesses. One approach is constructed using a link-based formulation\ninvolving a weighted combination of the bounce back and anti-bounce back of the\ndistribution function for the magnetic field and the other approach involves an\non-node moment-based implementation.

Since\nsuch photonic lattices are generally lossy, an alternative way of probing them\nconsists in coherently driving them to an steady-state from which\nphotoluminescence can be extracted. Here, we formalize connections between\nthese two seemingly different situations and use that intuition to predict the\nformation of non-trivial photonic steady-states in one and two dimensions.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel Siamese network with a specifically designed\ninteractive transformer, called SITVOS, to enable effective context propagation\nfrom historical to current frames. Technically, we use the transformer encoder\nand decoder to handle the past frames and current frame separately, i.e., the\nencoder encodes robust spatio-temporal context of target object from the past\nframes, while the decoder takes the feature embedding of current frame as the\nquery to retrieve the target from the encoder output. To further enhance the\ntarget representation, a feature interaction module (FIM) is devised to promote\nthe information flow between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we employ the\nSiamese architecture to extract backbone features of both past and current\nframes, which enables feature reuse and is more efficient than existing\nmethods.

To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by the global\nself-attention, various methods constrain the range of attention within a local\nregion to improve its efficiency. Consequently, their receptive fields in a\nsingle attention layer are not large enough, resulting in insufficient context\nmodeling. To address this issue, we propose a Pale-Shaped self-Attention\n(PS-Attention), which performs self-attention within a pale-shaped region.\nCompared to the global self-attention, PS-Attention can reduce the computation\nand memory costs significantly. Meanwhile, it can capture richer contextual\ninformation under the similar computation complexity with previous local\nself-attention mechanisms. Based on the PS-Attention, we develop a general\nVision Transformer backbone with a hierarchical architecture, named Pale\nTransformer, which achieves 83.4%, 84.3%, and 84.9% Top-1 accuracy with the\nmodel size of 22M, 48M, and 85M respectively for 224 ImageNet-1K\nclassification, outperforming the previous Vision Transformer backbones.

A recently synthesized compound\n\\bnoas, which contains isolated `infinite layer' NiO$_2$ planes, may lead to\nnew insights. Our investigations have discovered that, at density functional\ntheory mean field level, the ground state consists of an unusual $e_g$ singlet\non the Ni$^{2+}$ ion arising from large but separate Mott insulating gaps in\nboth $e_g$ orbitals, but with different, anti-Hund's, spin directions of their\nmoments.

Different kinds of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been\ntrained to accomplish key tasks such as power control, beamforming and\nadmission control. There are two popular training paradigms for such DNNs-based\ninterference management models: supervised learning (i.e., fitting labels\ngenerated by an optimization algorithm) and unsupervised learning (i.e.,\ndirectly optimizing some system performance measure). Although both of these\nparadigms have been extensively applied in practice, due to the lack of any\ntheoretical understanding about these methods, it is not clear how to\nsystematically understand and compare their performance.\n  In this work, we conduct theoretical studies to provide some in-depth\nunderstanding about these two training paradigms. First, we show a somewhat\nsurprising result, that for some special power control problem, the\nunsupervised learning can perform much worse than its supervised counterpart,\nbecause it is more likely to stuck at some low-quality local solutions. We then\nprovide a series of theoretical results to further understand the properties of\nthe two approaches. Generally speaking, we show that when high-quality labels\nare available, then the supervised learning is less likely to be stuck at a\nsolution than its unsupervised counterpart.

As application memory footprints grow, they induce more and\nmore minor faults.

Our evaluation of several workloads indicates an\noverhead due to minor faults as high as 29% of execution time.

We use refined isogeometric analysis\n(rIGA) to solve quadratic eigenproblems. rIGA discretization, while conserving\ndesirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA), reduces\nthe interconnection between degrees of freedom by adding low-continuity basis\nfunctions. This connectivity reduction in rIGA's algebraic system results in\nfaster matrix LU factorizations when using multifrontal direct solvers. We\ncompare computational costs of rIGA versus those of IGA when employing Krylov\neigensolvers to solve quadratic eigenproblems arising in 2D vector-valued\nmultifield problems. For large problem sizes, the eigencomputation cost is\ngoverned by the cost of LU factorization, followed by costs of several\nmatrix-vector and vector-vector multiplications, which correspond to Krylov\nprojections. We minimize the computational cost by introducing C^0 and C^1\nseparators at specific element interfaces for our rIGA generalizations of the\ncurl-conforming Nedelec and divergence-conforming Raviart-Thomas finite\nelements. Let p be the polynomial degree of basis functions; the LU\nfactorization is up to O((p-1)^2) times faster when using rIGA compared to IGA\nin the asymptotic regime. Thus, rIGA theoretically improves the total\neigencomputation cost by O((p-1)^2) for sufficiently large problem sizes. Yet,\nin practical cases of moderate-size eigenproblems, the improvement rate\ndeteriorates as the number of computed eigenvalues increases because of\nmultiple matrix-vector and vector-vector operations. Our numerical tests show\nthat rIGA accelerates the solution of quadratic eigensystems by O(p-1) for\nmoderately sized problems when we seek to compute a reasonable number of\neigenvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 09:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The purpose of the agents is to recognize\nobjects and other semantic classes in the whole building at the end of a\nprocess that combines exploration and active visual learning. As we study this\ntask in a lifelong learning context, the agents should use knowledge gained in\nearlier visited environments in order to guide their exploration and active\nlearning strategy in successively visited buildings. We use the semantic\nsegmentation performance as a proxy for general visual perception and study\nthis novel task for several exploration and annotation methods, ranging from\nfrontier exploration baselines which use heuristic active learning, to a fully\nlearnable approach. For the latter, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning\n(RL) based agent which jointly learns both navigation and active learning.

Images of small asteroids from\nspacecraft show a depletion in terms of smaller craters. Seismic shaking was\nconsidered to be responsible for crater erasure and the main driver modifying\nthe geology of asteroids via regolith convection or the Brazil nut effect.\nHowever, a recent artificial impact experiment on the asteroid Ryugu by the\nJapanese Hayabusa2 mission revealed minimal seismic activity. To investigate\nwhether a seismic shaking model can reproduce the observed crater record, the\ncrater distribution on Ryugu was analyzed using crater production functions\nunder cohesionless conditions. Crater retention ages were estimated as a\nfunction of crater diameter for Ryugu, Itokawa, Eros, and Bennu using the\ncrater size-frequency distribution and crater production function estimated for\nthose asteroids. We found that the power-law indices \"a\" are inconsistent with\ndiffusion processes (e.g., seismic shaking, a=2). This result suggests that\nseismic shaking models based on diffusion equations cannot explain the crater\ndistribution on small asteroids.

The young surface age\nof Ryugu is consistent with the slow space weathering that results from\ncratering, as suggested in previous studies.

For both models, we train on the complete VATEX dataset and 90% of\nthe TRECVID-VTT dataset for pretraining while using the remaining 10% for\nvalidation. We finetune both models with self-critical sequence training, which\nboosts the validation performance significantly. Overall, we find that training\na Video-to-Text system on traditional Image Captioning pipelines delivers very\npoor performance. When switching to a Transformer-based architecture our\nresults greatly improve and the generated captions match better with the\ncorresponding video.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 11:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

For robots, tactile sensing is also\nirreplaceable. While interacting with objects, tactile sensing provides useful\ninformation for the robot to understand the object, such as distributed\npressure, temperature, vibrations and texture. During robot grasping, vision is\noften occluded by its end-effectors, whereas tactile sensing can measure areas\nthat are not accessible by vision. In the past decades, a number of tactile\nsensors have been developed for robots and used for different robotic tasks. In\nthis chapter, we focus on the use of tactile sensing for robotic grasping and\ninvestigate the recent trends in tactile perception of object properties. We\nfirst discuss works on tactile perception of three important object properties\nin grasping, i.e., shape, pose and material properties. We then review the\nrecent development in grasping stability prediction with tactile sensing. Among\nthese works, we identify the requirement for coordinating vision and tactile\nsensing in the robotic grasping. To demonstrate the use of tactile sensing to\nimprove the visual perception, our recent development of vision-guided tactile\nperception for crack reconstruction is presented. In the proposed framework,\nthe large receptive field of camera vision is first leveraged to achieve a\nquick search of candidate regions containing cracks, a high-resolution optical\ntactile sensor is then used to examine these candidate regions and reconstruct\na refined crack shape. The experiments show that our proposed method can\nachieve a significant reduction of mean distance error from 0.82 mm to 0.24 mm\nfor crack reconstruction. Finally, we conclude this chapter with a discussion\nof open issues and future directions for applying tactile sensing in robotic\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

The experimental results verified\nthat the collection of unlabeled data for a short duration is sufficient to\nlearn the pattern in raw FTM measurements and produce improved ranging results.\nThe proposed method reduced the ranging errors in raw distance measurements and\nwell-calibrated ranging results requiring the collection of ground truth data\nby 47-50% and 17-29%, respectively.

A key question is whether\nglobally emergent volume evolution that is faster than that of a Friedmannian\nreference model results from the averaged effects of structure formation.\nChecking that emergent volume evolution is correctly modelled by the packages\nis thus needed. We numerically replace the software's default random\nrealisation of initial seed fluctuations by a fluctuation of spatially constant\namplitude in a simulation's initial conditions. The average volume evolution of\nthe perturbed model should follow that of a Friedmannian expansion history that\ncorresponds to the original Friedmannian reference solution modified by the\ninsertion of the spatially constant perturbation. We derive the equations that\nconvert from the perturbed reference solution to the effective solution.

For initial conditions with a resolution of $N =\n128^3$ particles and an initial non-zero extrinsic curvature invariant $I_i =\n0.001$, inhomog matches an exact Friedmannian solution to -0.0058% (Einstein-de\nSitter, EdS) or -0.0033% (LCDM).

As a software agent residing in the cloud, a DT can obtain both\nglobal network information by using communications among DTs, and historical\ninformation of a vehicle by using the communications within the twin. The\nglobal network information and historical vehicular information can\nsignificantly facilitate the offloading. In specific, to preserve the precious\ncomputing resource at different levels for most appropriate computing tasks, we\nintegrate a learning scheme based on the prediction of futuristic computing\ntasks in DT. Accordingly, we model the offloading scheduling process as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of a\ntrade off between task latency, energy consumption, and renting cost of clouds.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively find the\noptimal offloading strategy, as well as achieve the fast convergence speed and\nhigh performance, compared with other existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 08:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

PTMs account for many cellular processes such as\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, cell signaling and cell death. One of the\nrecent PTMs is succinylation. Succinylation modifies lysine residue from $-1$\nto $+1$. Locating succinylation sites using experimental methods, such as mass\nspectrometry is very laborious. Hence, computational methods are favored using\nmachine learning techniques. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture\nto predict succinylation sites. The performance of the proposed architecture is\ncompared to the state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and other\ntraditional machine learning techniques for succinylation. It is shown from the\nperformance metrics that the proposed architecture provides a good trade-off\nbetween speed of computation and classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 16:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}
