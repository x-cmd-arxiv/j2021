We first prove that the classical explicit numerical methods are\nunstable and suffer from the numerical divergence phenomenon. Then we propose a\nkind of explicit splitting numerical methods and prove that the\nstructure-preserving splitting strategy is able to enhance the numerical\nstability. Furthermore, we establish the regularity analysis and strong\nconvergence analysis of the proposed schemes for SNLSEs based on two key\ningredients. One ingredient is proving new regularity estimates of SNLSEs by\nconstructing a logarithmic auxiliary functional and exploiting the Bourgain\nspace. Another one is providing a dedicated error decomposition formula and a\nnovel truncated stochastic Gronwall's lemma, which relies on the tail estimates\nof underlying stochastic processes.

We expected it to enhance\nthe efficiency of interpreting CXRs and reduce the possibilities of delayed\ndiagnosis of lung cancer.\n  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected CXRs from NCKUH database and VBD, an\nopen-source medical image dataset, as our training and validation data. A\nnumber of CXRs from the Ministry of Health and Welfare(MOHW) database served as\nour test data. We built a segmentation model to identify lung areas from CXRs,\nand sliced them into 16 patches.

These labeled patches were then used to train and fine-tune a deep\nneural network(DNN) model, classifying the patches as positive or negative.\nFinally, we test the DNN model with the lung patches of CXRs from MOHW.\n  RESULTS: Our segmentation model identified the lung regions well from the\nwhole CXR.

We use a Transformer-based architecture to detect the keypoints, as\nwell as to summarize the visual context of the image. This visual context\ninformation is then used while lifting the keypoints to 3D, to allow\ncontext-based reasoning for better performance. Our method can handle\nocclusions as well as a wide variety of object classes. Our experiments on\nthree benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs better than the\nstate-of-the-art.

In\nPresto, the automated optimization of a conditional rewrite theory R (whose\nrules define the concurrent transitions of a system) is achieved by partially\nevaluating, with respect to the rules of R, an underlying, companion equational\nlogic theory E that specifies the algebraic structure of the system states of\nR. This can be particularly useful for specializing an overly general\nequational theory E whose operators may obey complex combinations of\nassociativity, commutativity, and/or identity axioms, when being plugged into a\nhost rewrite theory R as happens, for instance, in protocol analysis, where\nsophisticated equational theories for cryptography are used. Presto implements\ndifferent unfolding operators that are based on folding variant narrowing (the\nsymbolic engine of Maude's equational theories). When combined with an\nappropriate abstraction algorithm, they allow the specialization to be adapted\nto the theory termination behavior and bring significant improvement while\nensuring strong correctness and termination of the specialization. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Presto in several examples of protocol\nanalysis where it achieves a significant speed-up. Actually, the transformation\nprovided by Presto may cut down an infinite folding variant narrowing space to\na finite one, and moreover, some of the costly algebraic axioms and rule\nconditions may be eliminated as well.

The periodicity of the magnetic order is found to\nchange rapidly with applied stress; the rate of change indicates that the\nmagnetic anisotropy is roughly forty times the stress-induced bond length\nanisotropy. At low stress, the incommensuration period becomes extremely long,\non the order of 1000 lattice spacings; no locking of the magnetism to\ncommensurate periodicity is detected.

Optical systems\ndriven out of equilibrium such as lasers and supercontinuum generation exhibit\nchaotic states of light with fluctuations of both amplitude and phase and can\ngive rise to Levy statistics, turbulence, and rogue waves. Spatio-temporal\nchaos also occurs in continuous-wave driven photonic chip based Kerr\nmicro-resonators, where it is referred to as chaotic modulation instability.\nSuch modulation instability states have generally been considered impractical\nfor applications, in contrast to their coherent light state counterparts, which\ninclude soliton or dark-pulse states. Here we demonstrate that incoherent and\nchaotic states of light in an optical microresonator can be harnessed to\nimplement unambiguous and interference-immune massively parallel coherent laser\nranging by using the intrinsic random amplitude and phase modulation of the\nchaotic comb lines. We utilize 40 distinct lines of a microresonator frequency\ncomb operated in the modulation instability regime. Each line carries more than\n1 GHz noise bandwidth, which greatly surpasses the cavity linewidth, and\nenables to retrieve the distance of objects with cm-scale resolution. Our\napproach utilizes one of the most widely accessible microcomb states, and\noffers -- in contrast to dissipative Kerr soliton states -- high conversion\nefficiency, as well as flat optical spectra, and alleviates the need for\ncomplex laser initiation routines. Moreover the approach generates wideband\nsignal modulation without requiring any electro-optical modulator or microwave\nsynthesizer.

However, models proposed in the literature for spatial\nextremes, which are based on max-stable or Pareto processes or comparatively\nless computationally demanding ``sub-asymptotic'' models based on Gaussian\nlocation and/or scale mixtures, generally assume that spatial extremal\ndependence persists across the entire spatial domain. This is a clear\nlimitation when modeling extremes over large geographical domains, but\nsurprisingly, it has been mostly overlooked in the literature. In this paper,\nwe develop a more realistic Bayesian framework based on a novel Gaussian scale\nmixture model, where the Gaussian process component is defined by a stochastic\npartial differential equation that yields a sparse precision matrix, and the\nrandom scale component is modeled as a low-rank Pareto-tailed or Weibull-tailed\nspatial process determined by compactly supported basis functions. We show that\nour proposed model is approximately tail-stationary despite its non-stationary\nconstruction in terms of basis functions, and we demonstrate that it can\ncapture a wide range of extremal dependence structures as a function of\ndistance. Furthermore, the inherently sparse structure of our spatial model\nallows fast Bayesian computations, even in high spatial dimensions, based on a\ncustomized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which prioritize calibration in\nthe tail. In our application, we fit our model to analyze heavy monsoon\nrainfall data in Bangladesh.

We show that the observed PISN mass-scale can get smeared and the\nposition of the PISN mass-scale is likely to exhibit a strong redshift\ndependence due to a combined effect from the non-zero value of the delay time\nbetween the formation of a star and the merging of two black holes and the\nmetallicity dependence of PISN mass scale. Due to the unknown form of the\ndelay-time distribution, the redshift dependence of the PISN mass cut-off of\nthe binary black holes (BBHs) cannot be well characterized and will exhibit a\nlarge variation with the change in redshift. As a result, the use of a fixed\nPISN mass scale to infer the redshift of the BBHs from the observed masses will\nbe systematically biased. Though this uncertainty is not severe for the third\nobservation run conducted by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, in the future\nthis uncertainty will cause a systematic error in the redshift inferred from\nthe PISN mass scale.

A prominent\nmisleading effect is unintended storage cycling that was observed in previous\nliterature by simultaneous charging and discharging of the same storage in 12\nof 18 energy models. Especially for popular net-zero energy model scenarios,\nunintended storage cycling can cause high distortions and, hence, urges for its\nremoval. Methods to remove such misleading effects exist, but are not\ncomputational efficient and sometimes not effective such as MILP formulations.\nOther techniques are successful, but only if renewable energy target\nconstraints exist. This paper explores how to eradicate unintended storage\ncycling for models without renewable target constraints by correctly setting\nvariable costs of relevant system components. We find through 124 simulations\nthat determining appropriate levels of variable costs depends on the solver\naccuracy used for the optimization. If set too loose, the solver prevents the\nremoval of unintended storage cycling. We further find that reliable data for\nvariable costs in energy modelling needs to be improved and provide a list of\nrecommended model inputs as well as a minimum variable cost threshold that can\nsignificantly reduce the magnitude and likeliness of unintended storage\ncycling. Finally, our results suggest that variable cost additives may remove\nother known unintended energy cycling effects, such as unintended line cycling\nor sector cycling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 21:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 10:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 09:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

In other words, the effect of interdigital capacitor\n(IDC) on LWA with periodic J-shaped metamaterial is investigated. This\nmicrostrip antenna is designed by cascading J-shaped metallic and IDC unit\ncells. Then it is simulated by full-wave ADS Momentum software. Advantageously,\nthe proposed structure has tunable dispersion diagram that can be tuned by the\nnumber of IDC fingers. As will be clarified, altering the number of IDC fingers\nis able to adapt the equivalent capacitor of the antenna equivalent circuit.\nThanks to the availability of RF switches technologies, changing the\nconfiguration of the IDCs can be practical. Furthermore, scanning the space\nfrom backward to forward region through broadside is one of the distinguishing\nfeatures of the antenna. Indeed, the CRLH LWA continuously scans the space\nthrough broadside from -55 degree to +65 degree in {\\phi} = 0 degree plane. The\nresults of the investigation reveal that the LWA with two fingers, as more\neffective configuration, is a circularly polarized CRLH LWA and it is one of\nthe highly desirable advantages of this structure.

Second, MRSs with limited FOV sensors can be more\nsusceptible to sensor attacks aimed at their FOVs, and therefore must be\nresilient to such attacks. Based on these shortcomings, we propose a\ncomprehensive solution that combines efforts in adaptive gain tuning and attack\nresilience to the problem of topology control for MRSs with limited FOVs.\nSpecifically, we first derive an adaptive gain tuning scheme based on\nsatisfying nominal pairwise interactions, which yields a dynamic balancing of\ninteraction strengths in a robot's neighborhood.

The ensembles explore two horizontal\nresolutions and different representations of the riverine inflow, and focus on\nthe Loop Current system (LCS) and the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System\n(MARS) interactions.\n  The predictability of the surface fields is high in the northern GoM if the\natmospheric forcing and the flow at Yucatan Channel are known, and the\nensembles simulate similar LCS behavior up to 5 months. In terms of LCS-MARS\ninteractions, the ensembles confirm that they are strongly modulated by the LC\nmesoscale variability. The relationship is two-ways, with the LCS being\ninfluenced by - and not only influencing - the freshwater plume. Whenever the\nfreshwater flux is strong, the northward extension of the LCS is constrained.\nThe ensemble simulations also indicate that this influence is stronger if the\nriverine inflow is simulated in an active fashion with a meridional velocity\ncomponent proportional to the flux.

In this\npaper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized\nfederated edge learning (SD-FEEL), where multiple edge servers are employed to\ncollectively coordinate a large number of client nodes. By exploiting the\nlow-latency communication among edge servers for efficient model sharing,\nSD-FEEL can incorporate more training data, while enjoying much lower latency\ncompared with conventional federated learning. We detail the training algorithm\nfor SD-FEEL with three main steps, including local model update, intra-cluster,\nand inter-cluster model aggregations. The convergence of this algorithm is\nproved on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, which\nalso helps to reveal the effects of key parameters on the training efficiency\nand provides practical design guidelines. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of edge\ndevices may cause the straggler effect and deteriorate the convergence speed of\nSD-FEEL.

Improving the intra-slice resolution is beneficial to the disease\ndiagnosis for both human experts and computer-aided systems. To this end, this\npaper builds a novel medical slice synthesis to increase the between-slice\nresolution. Considering that the ground-truth intermediate medical slices are\nalways absent in clinical practice, we introduce the incremental cross-view\nmutual distillation strategy to accomplish this task in the self-supervised\nlearning manner. Specifically, we model this problem from three different\nviews: slice-wise interpolation from axial view and pixel-wise interpolation\nfrom coronal and sagittal views. Under this circumstance, the models learned\nfrom different views can distill valuable knowledge to guide the learning\nprocesses of each other. We can repeat this process to make the models\nsynthesize intermediate slice data with increasing inter-slice resolution. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on a large-scale CT dataset.

As a result, researchers typically estimate the\nproperties of large systems that approach the thermodynamic limit by\nextrapolating the properties of smaller, computationally-accessible systems\nbased on relatively simple scaling expressions. In this work, we employ\nGaussian processes to more accurately and efficiently extrapolate many-body\nsimulations to their thermodynamic limit.

However, these choices are not robust\nto the presence of outliers/unexpected observations. The robit link function,\nwhich is equal to the inverse CDF of the Student's $t$-distribution, provides a\nrobust alternative to the probit and logistic link functions. A multivariate\nnormal prior for the regression coefficients is the standard choice for\nBayesian inference in robit regression models. The resulting posterior density\nis intractable and a Data Augmentation (DA) Markov chain is used to generate\napproximate samples from the desired posterior distribution. Establishing\ngeometric ergodicity for this DA Markov chain is important as it provides\ntheoretical guarantees for asymptotic validity of MCMC standard errors for\ndesired posterior expectations/quantiles. Previous work [Roy(2012)] established\ngeometric ergodicity of this robit DA Markov chain assuming (i) the sample size\n$n$ dominates the number of predictors $p$, and (ii) an additional constraint\nwhich requires the sample size to be bounded above by a fixed constant which\ndepends on the design matrix $X$. In particular, modern high-dimensional\nsettings where $n < p$ are not considered. In this work, we show that the robit\nDA Markov chain is trace-class (i.e., the eigenvalues of the corresponding\nMarkov operator are summable) for arbitrary choices of the sample size $n$, the\nnumber of predictors $p$, the design matrix $X$, and the prior mean and\nvariance parameters. The trace-class property implies geometric ergodicity.\nMoreover, this property allows us to conclude that the sandwich robit chain\n(obtained by inserting an inexpensive extra step in between the two steps of\nthe DA chain) is strictly better than the robit DA chain in an appropriate\nsense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 06:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

The copula models with parametric\nassumptions are easy to estimate but can be highly biased when such assumptions\nare false, while the empirical copulas are non-smooth and often not genuine\ncopula making the inference about dependence challenging in practice. As a\ncompromise, the empirical Bernstein copula provides a smooth estimator but the\nestimation of tuning parameters remains elusive. In this paper, by using the\nso-called empirical checkerboard copula we build a hierarchical empirical Bayes\nmodel that enables the estimation of a smooth copula function for arbitrary\ndimensions. The proposed estimator based on the multivariate Bernstein\npolynomials is itself a genuine copula and the selection of its\ndimension-varying degrees is data-dependent.

With a deep X-ray exposure\nusing the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a slightly off-plane region in the\nGalactic bulge, most of the extended emission was resolved into faint discrete\nX-ray sources in the Fe K band (Revnivtsev et al.,2009). The major constituents\nof these sources have long been considered to be X-ray active stars and\nmagnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, recent works including our NIR\nimaging and spectroscopic studies (Morihana et al.,2013, 2016) argue that other\npopulations should be more dominant. To investigate this further, we conducted\na much deeper NIR imaging observation at the center of the Chandra's exposure\nfield. We have used the MOIRCS on the Subaru telescope, reaching the limiting\nmagnitude of ~18 mag in the J, H, and Ks bands in this crowded region, and\nidentified ~50 % of the X-ray sources with NIR candidate counterparts. We\nclassified the X-ray sources into three groups (A, B, and C) based on their\npositions in the X-ray color-color diagram and characterized them based on the\nX-ray and NIR features. We argue that the major populations of the Group A and\nC sources are, respectively, CVs (binaries containing magnetic or non-magnetic\nwhite dwarfs with high accretion rates) and X-ray active stars. The major\npopulation of the Group B sources is presumably WD binaries with low mass\naccretion rates. The Fe K equivalent width in the composite X-ray spectrum of\nthe Group B sources is the largest among the three and comparable to that of\nthe Galactic bulge X-ray emission. This leads us to speculate that there are\nnumerous WD binaries with low mass accretion rates, which are not recognized as\nCVs, but are the major contributor of the apparently extended X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 06:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Stochastic MM\nkinetics based on the chemical master equation (CME), with no a priori\nassumption of fast equilibration, however, unravels an observably long\nnon-classical transient regime at mesoscopic enzyme concentrations. The\nenzymatic velocity in the transient regime is non-hyperbolic for product\nturnovers below a critical time, but asymptotically recovers the hyperbolic MME\nat long times. Here, we use this description to introduce a new kinetic\nmeasure, the turnover number dependent fractional enzyme velocity. This measure\nquantifies the degree of non-hyperbolicity in the non-classical transient\nregime with respect to the hyperbolic MME. From this, we obtain a generalized\nrate parameter condition for detailed balance in mesoscopic MM kinetics. This\ncondition, while subsuming the fast equilibrium approximation of the classical\nMM kinetics, provides a strict lower bound on the magnitude of the catalytic\nrate parameter. Further, from the condition of stationarity of the generating\nfunction solution of the CME, we quantify the duration of the non-classical\nregime. Our results show that the violation of detailed balance condition in\nthe transient regime is inextricably linked to the non-hyperbolic substrate\ndependence of the enzymatic velocity. In the steady-state, when an effective\nequilibrium between enzyme and complex is asymptotically established, the\ncondition of detailed balance emerges as a sufficient condition for the\nhyperbolic substrate dependence of the MME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 07:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

[SIGMOD 2003] and by Roberts et\nal. [Bioinf. 2004]. Given two positive integers $w$ and $k$, it selects the\nlexicographically smallest length-$k$ substring in every fragment of $w$\nconsecutive length-$k$ substrings (in every sliding window of length $w + k -\n1$). Minimizers samples are approximately uniform, locally consistent, and\ncomputable in linear time. Two main disadvantages of minimizers sampling\nmechanisms are: first, they do not have good guarantees on the expected size of\ntheir samples for every combination of $w$ and $k$; and, second, indexes that\nare constructed over their samples do not have good worst-case guarantees for\non-line pattern searches.\n  We introduce bidirectional string anchors (bd-anchors), a new string sampling\nmechanism. Given a positive integer $\\ell$, our mechanism selects the\nlexicographically smallest rotation in every length-$\\ell$ fragment (in every\nsliding window of length $\\ell$). We show that bd-anchors samples are also\napproximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. In\naddition, our experiments using several datasets demonstrate that the\nbd-anchors sample sizes decrease proportionally to $\\ell$; and that these sizes\nare competitive to or smaller than the minimizers sample sizes using the\nanalogous sampling parameters. We provide theoretical justification for these\nresults by analyzing the expected size of bd-anchors samples. As a negative\nresult, we show that computing a total order $\\leq$ on the input alphabet,\nwhich minimizes the bd-anchors sample size, is NP-hard. We also show that by\nusing any bd-anchors sample, we can construct, in near-linear time, an index\nwhich requires linear (extra) space in the size of the sample and answers\non-line pattern searches in near-optimal time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 07:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

In this model we have a single source-sink\npair and each link has a per-time-unit capacity and a transit time. A dynamic\nequilibrium (or equilibrium flow over time) is a flow pattern over time such\nthat no flow particle has incentives to unilaterally change its path. Although\nthe model has been around for almost fifty years, only recently results\nregarding existence and characterization of equilibria have been obtained. In\nparticular the long term behavior remains poorly understood. Our main result in\nthis paper is to show that, under a natural (and obviously necessary) condition\non the queuing capacity, a dynamic equilibrium reaches a steady state (after\nwhich queue lengths remain constant) in finite time. Previously, it was not\neven known that queue lengths would remain bounded. The proof is based on the\nanalysis of a rather non-obvious potential function that turns out to be\nmonotone along the evolution of the equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that the\nsteady state is characterized as an optimal solution of a certain linear\nprogram. When this program has a unique solution, which occurs generically, the\nlong term behavior is completely predictable. On the contrary, if the linear\nprogram has multiple solutions the steady state is more difficult to identify\nas it depends on the whole temporal evolution of the equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 09:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Interestingly, the torsion\nfield couples to all fermions through its axial-vector mode with a universal\ncoupling $\\eta=1/8$ which is possible to change under the quantum effects. We\nargue that Einstein-Cartan gravity provides a significant portal to probe $A'$\ndark gauge boson which resides in dark sector existing as an invisible world\nparallel to our own and couples to the standard model (SM) particles through\nonly the kinetic mixing. For the (very) small kinetic mixing, searches for the\n$A'$ from Drell-Yan processes are insensitive due to the suppressed production\ncross-section and the considerable SM backgrounds. However, through the\nmediation of torsion field the $pp$ collisions produce dark-sector fermions\nwhich would significantly produce the $A'$ due to unsuppressed dark gauge\ncoupling.

Each selfish miner (or attacker\ninterchangeably) maintains a private chain and makes it public\nopportunistically for acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hash power.\nWe first establish a general Markov chain model to characterize the state\ntransition of public and private chains for Basic Selfish Mining (BSM), and\nderive the stationary profitable threshold of Hash power in closed-form. It\nreduces from 25% for a single attacker to below 21.48% for two symmetric\nattackers theoretically, and further reduces to around 10% with eight symmetric\nattackers experimentally. We next explore the profitable threshold when one of\nthe attackers performs strategic mining based on Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP) that only half of the attributes pertinent to a mining\nstate are observable to him. An online algorithm is presented to compute the\nnearly optimal policy efficiently despite the large state space and high\ndimensional belief space. The strategic attacker mines selfishly and more\nagilely than BSM attacker when his Hash power is relatively high, and mines\nhonestly otherwise, thus leading to a much lower profitable threshold. Last, we\nformulate a simple model of absolute mining revenue that yields an interesting\nobservation: selfish mining is never profitable at the first difficulty\nadjustment period, but replying on the reimbursement of stationary selfish\nmining gains in the future periods. The delay till being profitable of an\nattacker increases with the decrease of his Hash power, making blockchain\nminers more cautious on performing selfish mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 11:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 14:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 02:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Most\noften in the literature, a simple control structure is chosen, and the control\ngains are tuned empirically based on ground testings. However, due to the large\ndimensions of the balloon and the flight chain, experimental set-ups only\ninvolve the pointing system and the platform, whereas flight experience shows\nthat the pointing performance is essentially limited by the rejection of the\nnatural pendulum-like oscillations of the fully deployed system. This\nobservation justifies the need for a model that predicts such flight conditions\nthat cannot be replicated in laboratory, and for an adequate methodology\naddressing the line-of-sight controller design. In particular, it is necessary\nto ensure robust stability and performance to the parametric uncertainties\ninherent to balloon-borne systems, such as complex balloon's properties or\nrelease of ballast throughout the flight, especially since experimental\nvalidation is limited. In this paper, a dynamical model of the complete system\nis proposed, based on a multibody approach and accounting for parametric\nuncertainties with Linear Fractional Transformations. The comparison with\nflight data shows that the frequency content of the platform's motion is\naccurately predicted.

In this paper, we exploit the cross-domain relation and\npropose a novel normalization method, Reciprocal Normalization (RN).\nSpecifically, RN first presents a Reciprocal Compensation (RC) module to\nacquire the compensatory for each channel in both domains based on the\ncross-domain channel-wise correlation.

In the 3D-QA task, models receive visual information from the entire\n3D scene of the rich RGB-D indoor scan and answer the given textual questions\nabout the 3D scene. Unlike the 2D-question answering of VQA, the conventional\n2D-QA models suffer from problems with spatial understanding of object\nalignment and directions and fail the object identification from the textual\nquestions in 3D-QA. We propose a baseline model for 3D-QA, named ScanQA model,\nwhere the model learns a fused descriptor from 3D object proposals and encoded\nsentence embeddings. This learned descriptor correlates the language\nexpressions with the underlying geometric features of the 3D scan and\nfacilitates the regression of 3D bounding boxes to determine described objects\nin textual questions and outputs correct answers. We collected human-edited\nquestion-answer pairs with free-form answers that are grounded to 3D objects in\neach 3D scene. Our new ScanQA dataset contains over 40K question-answer pairs\nfrom the 800 indoor scenes drawn from the ScanNet dataset. To the best of our\nknowledge, the proposed 3D-QA task is the first large-scale effort to perform\nobject-grounded question-answering in 3D environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 12:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 06:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 21:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Prior works adopt\npairwise or triplet loss formulations to learn an embedding space amenable for\nassociated matching and verification tasks. Albeit showing some progress, such\nloss formulations are, however, restrictive due to dependency on\ndistance-dependent margin parameter, poor run-time training complexity, and\nreliance on carefully crafted negative mining procedures. In this work, we\nhypothesize that enriched feature representation coupled with an effective yet\nefficient supervision is necessary in realizing a discriminative joint\nembedding space for improved face-voice association. To this end, we propose a\nlight-weight, plug-and-play mechanism that exploits the complementary cues in\nboth modalities to form enriched fused embeddings and clusters them based on\ntheir identity labels via orthogonality constraints. We coin our proposed\nmechanism as fusion and orthogonal projection (FOP) and instantiate in a\ntwo-stream pipeline. The overall resulting framework is evaluated on a\nlarge-scale VoxCeleb dataset with a multitude of tasks, including cross-modal\nverification and matching.

To solve this problem, firstly, we propose a\nscale-difference-aware image matching method (SDAIM) that reduces image scale\ndifferences before local feature extraction, via resizing both images of an\nimage pair according to an estimated scale ratio. Secondly, in order to\naccurately estimate the scale ratio, we propose a\ncovisibility-attention-reinforced matching module (CVARM) and then design a\nnovel neural network, termed as Scale-Net, based on CVARM. The proposed CVARM\ncan lay more stress on covisible areas within the image pair and suppress the\ndistraction from those areas visible in only one image. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments confirm that the proposed Scale-Net has higher scale\nratio estimation accuracy and much better generalization ability compared with\nall the existing scale ratio estimation methods. Further experiments on image\nmatching and relative pose estimation tasks demonstrate that our SDAIM and\nScale-Net are able to greatly boost the performance of representative local\nfeatures and state-of-the-art local feature matching methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 12:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Variable rates of interaction in structured\npopulations can be described by networks with the time-varying activity of\nlinks and nodes. One of the key statistics to summarize temporal patterns is\nthe inter-event time (IET), namely the duration between successive pairwise\ninteractions. Empirical studies have found IET distributions that are\nheavy-tailed (or \"bursty\"), for temporally varying interaction, both physical\nand digital. But it is difficult to construct theoretical models of\ntime-varying activity on a network that reproduces the burstiness seen in\nempirical data. Here we develop a spanning-tree method to construct temporal\nnetworks and activity patterns with bursty behavior. Our method ensures a\ndesired target IET distribution of single nodes/links, provided the\ndistribution fulfills a consistency condition, regardless of whether the\nunderlying topology is static or time-varying. We show that this model can\nreproduce burstiness found in empirical datasets, and so it may serve as a\nbasis for studying dynamic processes in real-world bursty interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 13:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 02:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

The precision of the published transit ephemeris of most of these planets\nhas been limited by the relative short durations of the CoRoT pointings, which\nimplied a danger that the transits will become unobservable within a few years\ndue to the uncertainty of their future transit epochs. Ground-based follow-up\nobservations of the majority of the CoRoT planets have been published in recent\nyears. Between Dec. 2018 and Jan. 2021, the TESS mission in its sectors 6 and\n33 re-observed those CoRoT fields that pointed towards the Galactic\nanti-center. These data permitted the identification of transits from nine of\nthe CoRoT planets, and the derivation of precise new transit epochs. The main\nmotivation of this study has been to derive precise new ephemerides of the\nCoRoT planets, in order to keep these planets' transits observable for future\ngenerations of telescopes. The TESS data were analyzed for the presence of\ntransits and the epochs of these re-observed transits were measured. The\noriginal CoRoT epochs, epochs from ground-based follow-up observations and\nthose from TESS were collected. From these data updated ephemerides are\npresented for nine transiting planets discovered by the CoRoT mission in its\nfields pointing towards the Galactic anti-center. In three cases (CoRoT-4b, 19b\nand 20b), transits that would have been lost for ground observations, due to\nthe large uncertainty in the previous ephemeris, have been recovered. The\nupdated ephemerides permit transit predictions with uncertainties of less than\n30 min for observations at least until the year 2030. No significant transit\ntiming variations were found in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 13:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Formulating such instructions in\nterms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out\nthe foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a\nsubject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing.\nIn this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean\npolynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic $\\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\mathbb{Z}$ ring\noperations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which\nallows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits.\nFor arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as\nFourier-arithmetic.

Recently, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are making\nstrides as a novel and effective representation, especially in the\nreconstruction task. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel HSI\nreconstruction model based on INR which represents HSI by a continuous function\nmapping a spatial coordinate to its corresponding spectral radiance values. In\nparticular, as a specific implementation of INR, the parameters of parametric\nmodel are predicted by a hypernetwork that operates on feature extraction using\nconvolution network.

Moreover, periodic\nspatial encoding are deeply integrated with the reconstruction procedure, which\nmakes our model capable of recovering more high frequency details. To verify\nthe efficacy of our model, we conduct experiments on three HSI datasets (CAVE,\nNUS, and NTIRE2018). Experimental results show that the proposed model can\nachieve competitive reconstruction performance in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Design: To estimate the determinants of problem\ndrinking using a Heckman and a two-part estimation model. Psychological and\nneuro-scientific studies justify my underlying estimation assumptions and\ncovariate exclusion restrictions. Higher order tests checking for\nmulticollinearity validate the use of Heckman over the use of two-part\nestimation models. I discuss the generalizability of the two models in applied\nresearch. Settings and Participants: Two pooled national population surveys\nfrom 2016 and 2017 were used: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey\n(BRFS), and the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Measurements:\nParticipation in problem drinking and meeting the criteria for problem\ndrinking. Findings: Both U.S. national surveys perform well with the Heckman\nmodel and pass all higher order tests. The Heckman model corrects for selection\nbias and reveals the direction of bias, where the two-part model does not. For\nexample, the coefficients on age are upward biased and unemployment is downward\nbiased in the two-part where the Heckman model does not have a selection bias.\nCovariate exclusion restrictions are sensitive to survey conditions and are\ncontextually generalizable. Conclusions: The Heckman model can be used for\nalcohol (smoking studies as well) if the underlying estimation specification\npasses higher order tests for multicollinearity and the exclusion restrictions\nare justified with integrity for the data used. Its use is merit-worthy because\nit corrects for and reveals the direction and the magnitude of selection bias\nwhere the two-part does not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Despite the\nintuitiveness of such practice and its arguably already widespread use in\nreality, the existing literature knows little about its implications on\nsubsequent inference, subjecting many effectively rerandomized experiments to\npossibly inefficient analyses. To fill this gap, we examine a variety of\npotentially useful schemes for rerandomization based on $p$-values (ReP) from\ncovariate balance tests, and demonstrate their impact on subsequent inference.\nSpecifically, we focus on three estimators of the average treatment effect from\nthe unadjusted, additive, and fully interacted linear regressions of the\noutcome on treatment, respectively, and derive their respective asymptotic\nsampling properties under ReP. The main findings are twofold. First, the\nestimator from the fully interacted regression is asymptotically the most\nefficient under all ReP schemes examined, and permits convenient\nregression-assisted inference identical to that under complete randomization.\nSecond, ReP improves not only covariate balance but also the efficiency of the\nestimators from the unadjusted and additive regressions asymptotically.

For instance, hyperedge covariates can express the\ntendency of senders to repeatedly address the same pairs (or larger sets) of\nreceivers - a simple and frequent pattern in polyadic interaction data which,\nhowever, cannot be expressed with dyadic covariates. In this article we\ndemonstrate the potential benefits of RHEMs for the analysis of polyadic social\ninteraction. We define and discuss practically relevant effects that are not\navailable for REMs but may be incorporated in empirical specifications of RHEM.\nWe illustrate the empirical value of RHEM, and compare them with related REM,\nin a reanalysis of the canonical Enron email data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 11:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Regression adjustment\nprovides a convenient way to incorporate covariate information for additional\nefficiency. This article provides a unified account of its utility for\nimproving estimation efficiency in multi-armed experiments. We start with the\ncommonly used additive and fully interacted models for regression adjustment,\nand clarify the trade-offs between the resulting ordinary least-squares (OLS)\nestimators for estimating average treatment effects in terms of finite-sample\nperformance and asymptotic efficiency. We then move on to regression adjustment\nbased on restricted least squares (RLS), and establish for the first time its\nproperties for inferring average treatment effects from the design-based\nperspective. The resulting inference has multiple guarantees. First, it is\nasymptotically efficient when the restriction is correctly specified. Second,\nit remains consistent as long as the restriction on the coefficients of the\ntreatment indicators, if any, is correctly specified and separate from that on\nthe coefficients of the treatment-covariates interactions. Third, it can have\nbetter finite-sample performance than its unrestricted counterpart even if the\nrestriction is moderately misspecified. It is thus our recommendation for\ncovariate adjustment in multi-armed experiments when the OLS fit of the fully\ninteracted regression risks large finite-sample variability in case of many\ncovariates, many treatments, yet a moderate sample size. In addition, the\nproposed theory of RLS also provides a powerful tool for studying OLS-based\ninference from general regression specifications. As an illustration, we\ndemonstrate its unique value for studying OLS-based regression adjustment in\nfactorial experiments via both theory and simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:29:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 03:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Our approach further\nestablishes that determining if a graph has weak $r$-coloring number at most\n$k$ is para-NP-hard when parameterized by $k$ for all $r \\geq 2$. We adapt this\nto determining if a graph has $r$-coloring number at most $k$ as well, proving\npara-NP-hardness for all $r \\geq 2$.

Moreover, there exists a constant $c$ such that it is\nNP-hard to approximate the generalized coloring numbers within a factor of $c$.\nTo complement these results, we give an approximation algorithm for the\ngeneralized coloring numbers, improving both the runtime and approximation\nfactor of the existing approach of Dvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k (EuJC 2013).

In swarm robotics applications, where a group of robots need to\ncoordinate in order to achieve their common goals, robot-centric localization\nwill not suffice as each member of the swarm has its own frame of reference.\nOne way to deal with this problem is to create, maintain and share a common map\n(global coordinate system), among the members of the swarm. This paper presents\nan approach to global localization for a group of robots in unknown, GPS and\nlandmark free environments that extends the localization scheme of the LadyBug\nalgorithm. The main idea relies on members of the swarm stay still and act as\nbeacons, emitting electromagnetic signals.

The scales explored require a relativistic\ndescription, in addition to statistical tools for their analysis. In this\nthesis, we study the effects of adding relativistic and primordial\nnon-Gaussianity contributions to the power spectrum. We begin by reviewing the\nstandard cosmology, then we present the cosmological and Newtonian perturbation\ntheory, which are necessary mathematical tools in the computation of our main\nresults. Afterwards we present the main contributions to this thesis. First, we\npresent solutions to the Einstein equations in the long-wavelength\napproximation, this allow us to obtain expressions for the relativistic density\npower spectrum at second and third order, these expressions also include\ncontributions from primordial non-Gaussianity, in terms of the parameters\n$f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{NL}}$. These results are complemented with\nthe well known Newtonian solutions for the density contrast and are used in the\ncomputation of the total (relativistic + Newtonian) one-loop power spectrum.\nFor completeness we also calculate the bispectrum at tree-level. We discuss the\npossibility of these relativistic effects being detectable with the future\nsurveys considering different limiting values for $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ and\n$g_{\\mathrm{NL}}$. Subsequently, we compute the real space galaxy power\nspectrum, including relativistic and primordial non-Gaussianity effects. These\neffects come from the relativistic one-loop power spectrum terms and from\nfactors of the non-linear bias parameter $b_{\\mathrm{NL}}$. We use our\nmodelling to assess the ability of Stage-IV surveys to constrain primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. Finally, we show how this non-linear bias parameter can\neffectively renormalize diverging relativistic contributions at large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 15:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Conventional methods to control the False Discovery\nRate (FDR) assume that all p-values are available at the time point of test\ndecision. In platform trials, however, treatment arms enter and leave the trial\nat any time during its conduct. Therefore, the number of treatments and\nhypothesis tests is not fixed in advance and hypotheses are not tested at once,\nbut sequentially. Recently, for such a setting the concept of online control of\nthe FDR was introduced. We investigate the LOND procedure to control the online\nFDR in platform trials and propose an extension to allow for interim analyses\nwith the option of early stopping for efficacy or futility for individual\nhypotheses. The power depends sensitively on the prior distribution of effect\nsizes, e.g., whether true alternatives are uniformly distributed over time or\nnot. We consider the choice of design parameters for the LOND procedure to\nmaximize the overall power and compare the OBrien-Fleming group-sequential\ndesign with the Pocock approach.

These proteins, known as\nintrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), are present as highly dynamic\nconformational ensembles. IDPs can partially (mis) fold into (dys) functional\nconformations and accumulate as amyloid aggregates upon interaction with other\ncytosolic partners such as proteins or lipid membranes. In addition, an\nincreasing number of reports link the toxicity of amyloid proteins to their\nharmful effects on membrane integrity. Still, the molecular mechanism\nunderlying the amyloidogenic proteins transfer from the aqueous environment to\nthe hydrocarbon core of the membrane is poorly understood. This review starts\nwith a historical overview of the toxicity models of amyloidogenic proteins to\ncontextualize the more recent lipid-chaperone hypothesis. Then, we report the\nearly molecular-level events in the aggregation and ion-channel pore formation\nof Abeta, IAPP, and alpha-synuclein interacting with model membranes,\nemphasizing the complexity of these processes due to their different\nspatial-temporal resolutions. Next, we underline the need for a combined\nexperimental and computational approach, focusing on the strengths and\nweaknesses of the most commonly used techniques.

Such a cloud-based\ncontrol scheme, however, requires data sharing between the plant (agent) and\nthe cloud, which raises privacy concerns. This is because privacy-sensitive\ninformation such as system states and control inputs has to be sent to the\ncloud and thus can be leaked to attackers for various malicious activities. In\nthis paper, we develop a simple yet effective privacy-preserved nonlinear MPC\nframework via affine masking. Specifically, we consider external eavesdroppers\nor honest-but-curious cloud servers that wiretap the communication channel and\nintend to infer the local plant's information including state information,\nsystem dynamics, and control inputs. An affine transformation-based\nprivacy-preservation mechanism is designed to mask the true states and control\nsignals while reformulating the original MPC problem into a different but\nequivalent form. We show that the proposed privacy scheme does not affect the\nMPC performance and it preserves the privacy of the local plant such that the\neavesdropper is unable to find a unique value or even estimate a rough range of\nthe private state and input signals. The proposed method is further extended to\nachieve privacy preservation in cloud-based output-feedback MPC.

In this case it follows (from a\nresult of Vodopyanov, Goldshtein and Reshetnyak) that discontinuous\ndeformations must have infinite energy. After characterizing the rate at which\nthis energy blows up, we introduce a modified energy functional which differs\nfrom the original by a null lagrangian, and for which cavitating energy\nminimizers with finite energy exist. In particular, the Euler--Lagrange\nequations for the modified energy functional are identical to those for the\noriginal problem except for the boundary condition at the inner cavity. This\nnew boundary condition states that a certain modified radial Cauchy stress\nfunction has to vanish at the inner cavity. This condition corresponds to the\nradial Cauchy stress for the original functional diverging to $-\\infty$ at the\ncavity surface. Many previously known variational results for finite energy\ncavitating solutions now follow for the modified functional, such as the\nexistence of radial energy minimizers, satisfaction of the Euler-Lagrange\nequations for such minimizers, and the existence of a critical boundary\ndisplacement for cavitation. We also discuss a numerical scheme for computing\nthese singular cavitating solutions using regular solutions for punctured\nballs.

Unfortunately, there is limited opportunity to increase\nthe capacity of LLCs due to the area and power requirements of the underlying\nSRAM technology. Interestingly, emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies\npromise a feasible alternative to SRAM for LLCs due to their higher area\ndensity. However, NVMs have substantially higher read and write latencies,\nwhich offset their area density benefit. Although researchers have proposed\nmethods to tolerate NVM's increased write latency, little emphasis has been\nplaced on reducing the critical NVM read latency.\n  To address this problem, this paper proposes Cloak. Cloak exploits data reuse\nin the LLC at the page level, to hide NVM read latency. Specifically, on\ncertain L1 TLB misses to a page, Cloak transfers LLC-resident data belonging to\nthe page from the LLC NVM array to a set of small SRAM Page Buffers that will\nservice subsequent requests to this page. Further, to enable the\nhigh-bandwidth, low-latency transfer of lines of a page to the page buffers,\nCloak uses an LLC layout that accelerates the discovery of LLC-resident cache\nlines from the page. We evaluate Cloak with full-system simulations of a 4-core\nprocessor across 14 workloads. We find that, on average, Cloak outperforms an\nSRAM LLC by 23.8% and an NVM-only LLC by 8.9% -- in both cases, with negligible\nadditional area. Further, Cloak's ED^2 is 39.9% and 17.5% lower, respectively,\nthan these designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 15:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

As a\nresult, FPTT can be computed in an online fashion and has fixed complexity with\nrespect to the sequence length. When combined with a novel dynamic spiking\nneuron model, the Liquid-Time-Constant neuron, we show that SNNs trained with\nFPTT outperform online BPTT approximations, and approach or exceed offline BPTT\naccuracy on temporal classification tasks.

The accurate soil moisture (state) estimation is critical in\nimplementing the closed-loop irrigation of agrohydrological systems. In\ngeneral, the agricultural fields are high dimensional systems. Due to the high\ndimensionality for a large field, it is very challenging to solve an\noptimizationbased advanced state estimator like moving horizon estimation\n(MHE). This work addresses the aforementioned challenge and proposes a\nsystematic approach for state estimation of large agricultural fields. We use a\nnon-linear state-space model based on discretization of the cylindrical\ncoordinate version of Richards equation to describe the agro-hydrological\nsystems equipped with a central pivot irrigation system. We propose a\nstructure-preserving adaptive model reduction method using trajectory-based\nunsupervised machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the adaptive MHE\nalgorithm is developed based on an adaptive reduced model. The proposed\nalgorithms are applied to a small simulated field to compare the performance of\nadaptive MHE over original MHE. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a\nlarge-scale real agricultural field to test the effectiveness and superiority\nto address the current challenges. Extensive simulations are carried out to\nshow the efficiency of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 05:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

For example, when lidar is used to track noncooperative targets, the\nmeasurement noise is different under different distances and weather\nconditions. In addition, the process noise changes with the object's motion\nstate, especially when the tracking object is a pedestrian, and the process\nnoise changes more frequently. This paper proposes a new\nestimation-calibration-correction closed-loop estimation method to estimate the\nKalman filter process and measurement noise covariance matrices online. First,\nwe decompose the noise covariance matrix into an element distribution matrix\nand noise intensity and improve the Sage filter to estimate the element\ndistribution matrix. Second, we propose a calibration method to accurately\ndiagnose the noise intensity deviation. We then propose a correct method to\nadaptively correct the noise intensity online. Third, under the assumption that\nthe system is detectable, the unbiased and convergence of the proposed method\nis mathematically proven. Simulation results prove the effectiveness and\nreliability of the proposed method. Finally, we apply the proposed method to\nmultiobject tracking of lidar and evaluate it on the official KITTI server. The\nproposed method on the KITTI pedestrian multiobject tracking leaderboard\n(http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets /kitti/eval_tracking.php) surpasses all\nexisting methods using lidar, proving the feasibility of the method in\npractical applications. This work provides a new way to improve the performance\nof the Kalman filter and multiobject tracking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 03:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Confounding occurs when a variable affects both the\ntreatment and the outcome. Traditional methods such as propensity score\nmatching estimate treatment effects by conditioning on the confounders. Recent\nliterature has presented new methods that use machine learning to predict the\ncounterfactuals in observational studies which then allow for estimating\ntreatment effects. These studies however, have been applied to real world data\nwhere the true treatment effects have not been known. This study aimed to study\nthe effectiveness of this counterfactual prediction method by simulating two\nmain scenarios: with and without confounding. Each type also included linear\nand non-linear relationships between input and output data. The key item in the\nsimulations was that we generated known true causal effects. Linear regression,\nlasso regression and random forest models were used to predict the\ncounterfactuals and treatment effects. These were compared these with the true\ntreatment effect as well as a naive treatment effect. The results show that the\nmost important factor in whether this machine learning method performs well, is\nthe degree of non-linearity in the data. Surprisingly, for both non-confounding\n\\textit{and} confounding, the machine learning models all performed well on the\nlinear dataset. However, when non-linearity was introduced, the models\nperformed very poorly. Therefore under the conditions of this simulation study,\nthe machine learning method performs well under conditions of linearity, even\nif confounding is present, but at this stage should not be trusted when\nnon-linearity is introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 08:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

One\nof the main challenges in Maintenance and Rehabilitation (M&R) practices is to\ndetermine maintenance type and timing. This research proposes a framework using\nReinforcement Learning (RL) based on the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP)\ndatabase to determine the type and timing of M&R practices. A predictive DNN\nmodel is first developed in the proposed algorithm, which serves as the\nEnvironment for the RL algorithm. For the Policy estimation of the RL model,\nboth DQN and PPO models are developed. However, PPO has been selected in the\nend due to better convergence and higher sample efficiency. Indicators used in\nthis study are International Roughness Index (IRI) and Rutting Depth (RD).\nInitially, we considered Cracking Metric (CM) as the third indicator, but it\nwas then excluded due to the much fewer data compared to other indicators,\nwhich resulted in lower accuracy of the results. Furthermore, in\ncost-effectiveness calculation (reward), we considered both the economic and\nenvironmental impacts of M&R treatments. Costs and environmental impacts have\nbeen evaluated with paLATE 2.0 software. Our method is tested on a hypothetical\ncase study of a six-lane highway with 23 kilometers length located in Texas,\nwhich has a warm and wet climate. The results propose a 20-year M&R plan in\nwhich road condition remains in an excellent condition range. Because the early\nstate of the road is at a good level of service, there is no need for heavy\nmaintenance practices in the first years. Later, after heavy M&R actions, there\nare several 1-2 years of no need for treatments. All of these show that the\nproposed plan has a logical result. Decision-makers and transportation agencies\ncan use this scheme to conduct better maintenance practices that can prevent\nbudget waste and, at the same time, minimize the environmental impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 13:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 18:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

The investigation of\nfundamental phenomena such as pair creation, photon-photon and photon-electron\ninteractions in the nonlinear QED regime are a formidable challenge -- both\nexperimentally and theoretically.

LUXE (Laser\nUnd XFEL Experiment) is an experimental platform which envisages the collision\nof the high quality 16.5 GeV electron beam from the European XFEL accelerator\nwith a 100 TW class high power laser. One of the unique features of LUXE is to\nmeasure the key observables such as pair rates ($e^+e^-$) with unprecedented\naccuracy in the characterization of both beams together with ample statistics.\nThe state-of-art detector technologies for high energy particle and photon\ndetection enable percent level precision. The state-of-art high power lasers\noffer high quality laser beams, however, the residual shot-to-shot fluctuations\ncoupled with the large nonlinearity of the processes under investigation form a\nparticular challenge. An uncertainty of 5 percent on the absolute laser\nintensity already leads to a very large ( about 40 percent) uncertainty in the\npair rate. Hence it becomes essential to control the laser parameters\nprecisely. To mitigate this issue a full suite of laser diagnostics is being\ncurrently developed at the JETI40 laser in Jena with the aim of tagging the\nshot intensity to less than 1 percent. In this presentation, details of the\nlaser and the diagnostics suit for the single shot tagging of all the laser\nparameters will be presented.
