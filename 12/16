Neural networks usually involve a large number\nof parameters, which correspond to the weights of the network. Such parameters,\nobtained with the help of a training process, are determinant for the\nperformance of the network. However, they are also highly redundant.

We find that most of the\nbaryons that are associated with haloes of mass $10^{11} < M_{200} \\,\n/\\mathrm{M_\\odot} < 10^{13}$ at $z=0$ have been ejected beyond the virial\nradius after having been accreted. When the gas ejected from satellites (and\ntheir progenitors) is accounted for, the combined ejected mass represents half\nof the total baryon budget even in the most massive simulated galaxy clusters\n($M_{200} \\approx 10^{14.5} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), with the consequence that\nthe total baryon budget exceeds the cosmic average if ejected gas is included.\nWe find that gas is only prevented from being accreted onto haloes for $M_{200}\n< 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, and that this component accounts for about half\nthe total baryon budget for $M_{200} < 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, with\nejected gas making up most of the remaining half. For metals, most of the mass\nthat is not locked into stars has been ejected beyond the virial radius, at\nleast for $M_{200} < 10^{13} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. Finally, within the virial\nradius we find that most of the mass in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) has\nnot passed through the ISM of a progenitor galaxy, for all halo masses and\nredshifts. About half of the CGM within half the virial radius has passed\nthrough the ISM in the past, however.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 16:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

The corks were selected within fibril H$\\alpha$\nformation regions. From this set, a cork was selected, and the field line\npassing through it was constructed. Other fibrilar corks close to this\nfieldline were also selected. Pathlines were constructed, revealing the\nlocations of the mass elements forward and backward in time. The forces acting\non these mass elements were analysed.\n  Results: The main process of fibrilar loading in the simulation is different\nto the mass loading scenario in which waves steepen into shocks and push\nmaterial upwards along the fieldlines from near their footpoints. Twisted low\nlying fieldlines were destabilised and then they untwisted, lifting the\nmaterial trapped above their apexes via the Lorentz force. Subsequently, the\nmajority of the mass drained down the fieldlines towards one or both footpoints\nunder gravity. Material with large horizontal velocities could also elevated in\nrising fieldlines, creating somewhat parabolic motions, but material was not\ngenerally moving upward along a stationary magnetic fieldline during loading.\n  Conclusions: The processes observed in the simulation are plausible\nadditional scenarios.

Such emissions are\nreliably described within the context of the relativistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi\nacceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of\nthe jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the\njet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet\nplasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the\nthermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons,\nmuons, $\\eta$-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation\nfrom the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy\ngamma-rays.

Such models can be expensive to build in terms of\ncommunication and computing cost, and they rely on data that is collected over\nextended periods of time. Further, they become out-of-date when changes in the\nsystem occur. To address these challenges, we investigate online learning\ntechniques that automatically reduce the number of available data sources for\nmodel training. We present an online algorithm called Online Stable Feature Set\nAlgorithm (OSFS), which selects a small feature set from a large number of\navailable data sources after receiving a small number of measurements. The\nalgorithm is initialized with a feature ranking algorithm, a feature set\nstability metric, and a search policy. We perform an extensive experimental\nevaluation of this algorithm using traces from an in-house testbed and from a\ndata center in operation. We find that OSFS achieves a massive reduction in the\nsize of the feature set by 1-3 orders of magnitude on all investigated\ndatasets. Most importantly, we find that the accuracy of a predictor trained on\na OSFS-produced feature set is somewhat better than when the predictor is\ntrained on a feature set obtained through offline feature selection. OSFS is\nthus shown to be effective as an online feature selection algorithm and robust\nregarding the sample interval used for feature selection.

Among the\ndifferent intents that a chatbot is trained to recognize, there is a set of\nthem that is universal to any customer service chatbot. Universal intents may\ninclude salutation, switch the conversation to a human agent, farewells, among\nothers. A system to recognize those universal intents will be very helpful to\noptimize the training process of specific customer service chatbots. We propose\nthe development of a universal intent recognition system, which is trained to\nrecognize a selected group of 11 intents that are common in 28 different\nchatbots. The proposed system is trained considering state-of-the-art\nword-embedding models such as word2vec and BERT, and deep classifiers based on\nconvolutional and recurrent neural networks. The proposed model is able to\ndiscriminate between those universal intents with a balanced accuracy up to\n80.4\\%. In addition, the proposed system is equally accurate to recognize\nintents expressed both in short and long text requests. At the same time,\nmisclassification errors often occurs between intents with very similar\nsemantic fields such as farewells and positive comments. The proposed system\nwill be very helpful to optimize the training process of a customer service\nchatbot because some of the intents will be already available and detected by\nour system. At the same time, the proposed approach will be a suitable base\nmodel to train more specific chatbots by applying transfer learning strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 16:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

Automatically extracting such causal information\nenables multiple use cases, such as test case generation, but it also requires\nto reliably detect causal relations in the first place.

Objective: In our empirically informed\nresearch, we aim at better understanding the notion of causality and supporting\nthe automatic extraction of causal relations in NL requirements. Method: In a\nfirst case study, we investigate 14.983 sentences from 53 requirements\ndocuments to understand the extent and form in which causality occurs. Second,\nwe present and evaluate a tool-supported approach, called CiRA, for causality\ndetection. We conclude with a second case study where we demonstrate the\napplicability of our tool and investigate the impact of causality on NL\nrequirements. Results: The first case study shows that causality constitutes\naround 28% of all NL requirements sentences.

Inferring the\ndepth of a person in an image, however, is fundamentally ambiguous without\nknowing their height. This is particularly problematic when the scene contains\npeople of very different sizes, e.g. from infants to adults. To solve this, we\nneed several things. First, we develop a novel method to infer the poses and\ndepth of multiple people in a single image. While previous work that estimates\nmultiple people does so by reasoning in the image plane, our method, called\nBEV, adds an additional imaginary Bird's-Eye-View representation to explicitly\nreason about depth. BEV reasons simultaneously about body centers in the image\nand in depth and, by combing these, estimates 3D body position. Unlike prior\nwork, BEV is a single-shot method that is end-to-end differentiable. Second,\nheight varies with age, making it impossible to resolve depth without also\nestimating the age of people in the image. To do so, we exploit a 3D body model\nspace that lets BEV infer shapes from infants to adults. Third, to train BEV,\nwe need a new dataset. Specifically, we create a \"Relative Human\" (RH) dataset\nthat includes age labels and relative depth relationships between the people in\nthe images. Extensive experiments on RH and AGORA demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the model and training scheme. BEV outperforms existing methods on depth\nreasoning, child shape estimation, and robustness to occlusion.

To achieve this,\nSeqFormer locates an instance in each frame and aggregates temporal information\nto learn a powerful representation of a video-level instance, which is used to\npredict the mask sequences on each frame dynamically. Instance tracking is\nachieved naturally without tracking branches or post-processing.

In this paper, we attempt a systematic study of the SD problem.\nFirst, we introduce the Object State Detection Dataset (OSDD), a new publicly\navailable dataset consisting of more than 19,000 annotations for 18 object\ncategories and 9 state classes. Second, using a standard deep learning\nframework used for Object Detection (OD), we conduct a number of appropriately\ndesigned experiments, towards an in-depth study of the behavior of the SD\nproblem. This study enables the setup of a baseline on the performance of SD,\nas well as its relative performance in comparison to OD, in a variety of\nscenarios. Overall, the experimental outcomes confirm that SD is harder than OD\nand that tailored SD methods need to be developed for addressing effectively\nthis significant problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 20:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

However, it is well known that the low rank CPD\napproximation problem is ill-posed. That is, a tensor may fail to have a best\nrank $R$ CPD approximation when $R>1$.\n  This article gives deterministic bounds for the existence of best low rank\ntensor approximations over $\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{C}$.\nMore precisely, given a tensor $\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{K}^{I \\times I \\times\nI}$ of rank $R \\leq I$, we compute the radius of a Frobenius norm ball centered\nat $\\mathcal{T}$ in which best $\\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$ approximations are\nguaranteed to exist. In addition we show that every $\\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$\ntensor inside of this ball has a unique canonical polyadic decomposition. This\nneighborhood may be interpreted as a neighborhood of \"mathematical truth\" in\nwith CPD approximation and computation is well-posed.\n  In pursuit of these bounds, we describe low rank tensor decomposition as a\n``joint generalized eigenvalue\" problem. Using this framework, we show that,\nunder mild assumptions, a low rank tensor which has rank strictly greater than\nborder rank is defective in the sense of algebraic and geometric multiplicities\nfor joint generalized eigenvalues. Bounds for existence of best low rank\napproximations are then obtained by establishing perturbation theoretic results\nfor the joint generalized eigenvalue problem. In this way we establish a\nconnection between existence of best low rank approximations and the tensor\nspectral norm. In addition we solve a \"tensor Procrustes problem\" which\nexamines orthogonal compressions for pairs of tensors.\n  The main results of the article are illustrated by a variety of numerical\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

Fitting and interpreting APC models to data in\nequal intervals (equal age and period widths) is non-trivial due to the\nstructural link between the three temporal effects (given two, the third can\nalways be found) causing the well-known identification problem. The usual\nmethod for resolving the structural link identification problem is to base a\nmodel off identifiable quantities. It is common to find health and demographic\ndata in unequal intervals, this encounters further identification problems on\ntop of the structural link. We highlight the new issues by showing quantities\nthat were identifiable for equal intervals are no longer identifiable for\nunequal data. Furthermore, through extensive simulation studies, we show how\nprevious methods for unequal APC models are not always appropriate due to their\nsensitivity to the choice of functions used to approximate the true temporal\nfunctions. We propose a new method for modelling unequal APC data using\npenalised smoothing splines. Our proposal effectively resolves any additional\nissues that arise and is robust to the choice of the approximating function.

Adversarial training\nsolves a min-max optimization problem, with the \\textit{inner maximization}\ngenerating adversarial examples by maximizing the classification loss, and the\n\\textit{outer minimization} finding model parameters by minimizing the loss on\nadversarial examples generated from the inner maximization. A criterion that\nmeasures how well the inner maximization is solved is therefore crucial for\nadversarial training. In this paper, we propose such a criterion, namely\nFirst-Order Stationary Condition for constrained optimization (FOSC), to\nquantitatively evaluate the convergence quality of adversarial examples found\nin the inner maximization. With FOSC, we find that to ensure better robustness,\nit is essential to use adversarial examples with better convergence quality at\nthe \\textit{later stages} of training. Yet at the early stages, high\nconvergence quality adversarial examples are not necessary and may even lead to\npoor robustness. Based on these observations, we propose a \\textit{dynamic}\ntraining strategy to gradually increase the convergence quality of the\ngenerated adversarial examples, which significantly improves the robustness of\nadversarial training.

The Gorkov approach to self-consistent Green's function theory\nhas been formulated in [V. Som\\`a, T. Duguet, C. Barbieri, Phys. Rev. C 84,\n064317 (2011)]. Over the past decade, it has become a method of reference for\nfirst-principle computations of semi-magic nuclear isotopes. The currently\navailable implementation is limited to a second-order self-energy and neglects\nparticle-number non-conserving terms arising from contracting three-particle\nforces with anomalous propagators. For nuclear physics applications, this is\nsufficient to address first-order energy differences, ground-state radii and\nmoments on an accurate enough basis. However, addressing absolute binding\nenergies, fine spectroscopic details of $N\\pm1$ particle systems or delicate\nquantities such as second-order energy differences associated to pairing gaps,\nrequires to go to higher truncation orders.\n  Purpose. The formalism is extended to third order in the algebraic\ndiagrammatic construction (ADC) expansion with two-body Hamiltonians.\n  Methods. The expansion of Gorkov propagators in Feynman diagrams is combined\nwith the algebraic diagrammatic construction up to the third order as an\norganization scheme to generate the Gorkov self-energy.\n  Results. Algebraic expressions for the static and dynamic contributions to\nthe self-energy, along with equations for the matrix elements of the Gorkov\neigenvalue problem, are derived.

Our framework consists in dividing the\nstream into different sections of elliptical geometry, whose properties are\nindependently evolved in their co-moving frame under the tidal, pressure, and\nself-gravity forces. Through an explicit treatment of the tidal force and the\ninclusion of the gas angular momentum, we can accurately follow the stream\nevolution near pericenter.

Creating a tool for interactively designing prototypes while\nobserving the wind flow change requires simpler models to simulate faster.\nInstead of running numerical approximations resulting in detailed calculations,\ndata-driven methods and deep learning might be able to give similar results in\na fraction of the time. This work rephrases the problem from computing 3D flow\nfields using CFD to a 2D image-to-image translation-based problem on the\nbuilding footprints to predict the flow field at pedestrian height level. We\ninvestigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN), such as Pix2Pix\n[1] and CycleGAN [2] representing state-of-the-art for image-to-image\ntranslation task in various domains as well as U-Net autoencoder [3]. The\nmodels can learn the underlying distribution of a dataset in a data-driven\nmanner, which we argue can help the model learn the underlying\nReynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations from CFD. We experiment on\nnovel simulated datasets on various three-dimensional bluff-shaped buildings\nwith and without height information. Moreover, we present an extensive\nqualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated images for a selection\nof models and compare their performance with the simulations delivered by CFD.\nWe then show that adding positional data to the input can produce more accurate\nresults by proposing a general framework for injecting such information on the\ndifferent architectures.

As\nthe remnant of a historical supernova (observed in 1604 CE), Kepler's SNR\npresents the rare opportunity to study the dynamical evolution of such an\nobject in real time. Measurements of the asymmetry in forward shock velocity\ncan also provide insight into the nature of the explosion and density of the\ncircumstellar material. Combining data from 2014 with previous epochs in 2000\nand 2006, we can observe the proper motion of filaments along the outer rim of\nthe SNR. Prior studies of Kepler's SNR have shown proper motion differences up\nto a factor of 3 between northern and southern regions around the remnant. With\nthe longer time baseline we use here, we find results that are consistent with\nprevious studies, but with smaller uncertainties. Additionally, by adding a\nthird epoch of observations, we search for any systemic change in the velocity\nin the form of a deceleration of the blast wave, as was recently reported in\nTycho's SNR. We find little to no conclusive evidence of such deceleration, and\nconclude that Kepler's SNR is encountering circumstellar material that is\nroughly constant in density, though substantially varied around the periphery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

A key\nchallenge in using kernels -- both classical and quantum -- is that ML\nworkflows involve acquiring new observations, for which new kernel values need\nto be calculated. Transferring data back-and-forth between where the new\nobservations are generated & a quantum computer incurs a time delay; this delay\nmay exceed the timescales relevant for using the QML algorithm in the first\nplace. In this work, we show quantum kernel matrices can be extended to\nincorporate new data using a classical (chordal-graph-based) matrix completion\nalgorithm. The minimal sample complexity needed for perfect completion is\ndependent on matrix rank. We empirically show that (a) quantum kernel matrices\ncan be completed using this algorithm when the minimal sample complexity is\nmet, (b) the error of the completion degrades gracefully in the presence of\nfinite-sampling noise, and (c) the rank of quantum kernel matrices depends\nweakly on the expressibility of the quantum feature map generating the kernel.\nFurther, on a real-world, industrially-relevant data set, the completion error\nbehaves gracefully even when the minimal sample complexity is not reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

That engages anodic aluminum oxide\n(AAO) layers to be used as formats in various nanotechnology applications\nwithout the necessity for expensive lithographical systems. This review article\nsurveys the current status of the investigation on AAO membranes. A\ncomprehensive analysis is performed on AAO membranes in applications;\nfiltration, sensors, drug delivery, template-assisted growth of various\nnanostructures. Their multiple usages in nanotechnology have also been\ndiscussed to gather nanomaterials and devices or unite them into specific\napplications, such as nano-electronic gadgets, channel layers, and clinical\nplatforms tissue designing. From this review, the fact that the specified\nenhancement of properties of AAO can be done by varying geometric parameters of\nAAO has been highlighted. No review paper focused on a detailed discussion of\napplications of AAO with prospects and challenges. This review paper represents\nthe formation, properties, applications with objective consideration of the\nprospects and challenges of AAO applications. The prospects may appeal to\nresearchers to promote the development of unique membranes with\nfunctionalization and controlled geometric parameters and check the feasibility\nof the AAO membranes in nano-devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Coherent motions\nare characterized by the triple decomposition of a multi-scale flow and used to\ndefine mean, coherent, and random kinetic energy. Specific scales of individual\ncoherent structures are identified through mode decomposition, whereby the\ntotal coherent velocity is separated into a set of velocities classified by the\nscale of the mode based on frequency to embed spectral characteristics. The set\nof scale-specific coherent velocities are used to identify scale-specific\ncoherent kinetic energy, which quantifies the kinetic energy of a specific\nscale, and an equation for the balance of scale-specific coherent kinetic\nenergy. Each equation includes terms with velocity triads, which represent the\ninter-scale transfer. The methodology is assessed in the wake behind a square\ncylinder, where scales of the flow are related to the vortex shedding. The\nscale-specific inter-scale transfer identifies that kinetic energy initially in\nthe near wake is transferred from vortex shedding to scales associated with\nhigher harmonics of the vortex shedding. In the far wake, inter-scale transfer\nis homogeneous and transfer occurs over many frequencies. While the inter-scale\ntransfer is identified over a range of scales, the scale-specific transport,\nconvection, and dissipation of coherent kinetic energy are associated with only\nthe largest, dominant scales. The wake flow is subjected to unsteady inflow at\nvarious frequencies to identify the changes to inter-scale transfer and\ncoherent kinetic energy induced by other frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Not surprisingly, approximating complex systems in a generic\nfunctional format and informing it ex-nihilo from available observations has\nbecome common practice in the age of machine learning, as illustrated by the\nnumerous successful examples based on deep neural networks.

The richness of\npositions and orientations of terrain features in the 3-D world gives limbless\nanimals like snakes that can bend their body versatility to generate forces\nfrom different contact areas for propulsion. Despite many previous studies of\nhow snakes use lateral body bending for propulsion on relatively flat surfaces\nwith lateral contact points, little is known about whether and how much snakes\nuse vertical body bending in combination with lateral bending in 3-D terrain.\nThis lack had contributed to snake robots being inferior to animals in\nstability, efficiency, and versatility when traversing complex 3-D\nenvironments. Here, to begin to elucidate this, we studied how the generalist\ncorn snake traversed an uneven arena of blocks of random height variation 5\ntimes its body height. The animal traversed the uneven terrain with perfect\nstability by propagating 3-D bending down its body with little transverse\nmotion (11{\\deg} slip angle). Although the animal preferred moving through\nvalleys with higher neighboring blocks, it did not prefer lateral bending.\nAmong body-terrain contact regions that potentially provide propulsion, 52%\nwere formed by vertical body bending and 48% by lateral bending. The\ncombination of vertical and lateral bending may dramatically expand the sources\nof propulsive forces available to limbless locomotors by utilizing various\nasperities available in 3-D terrain. Direct measurements of contact forces are\nnecessary to further understand how snakes coordinate 3-D bending along the\nentire body via sensory feedback to propel through 3-D terrain.

Specifically, the matter density contrast, which is by and large\nscale-invariant in the deep sub-horizon limit, not only gets dragged as the\ninteraction affects the background Hubble expansion rate, but also receives a\ncontribution from the perturbation in the (scalar field induced) dark energy,\nwhich oscillates about a non-zero mean value.

As LINGO uses VSM in\ncluster content discovery, our task is to replace VSM with LSI for cluster\ncontent discovery and to analyze the feasibility of using LSI with Okapi BM25.\nThe next task is to compare the results of a modified method with the LINGO\noriginal method. The research is applied to five different text-based data sets\nto get more reliable results for every method. Research results show that LINGO\nproduces 40-50% better results when using LSI for content Discovery. From\ntheoretical evidence using Okapi BM25 for scoring method in LSI (LSI+Okapi\nBM25) for cluster content discovery instead of VSM, also results in better\nclusters generation in terms of scalability and performance when compares to\nboth VSM and LSI's Results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 21:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

One of the most important language\nfunctions is to categorize the world so messages can be communicated through\nconversation. While we know a great deal about how human languages vary in\ntheir encoding of information within semantic domains such as color, sound,\nnumber, locomotion, time, space, human activities, gender, body parts and\nbiology, little is known about the global structure of semantic information and\nits effect on human communication. Using large-scale computation, artificial\nintelligence techniques, and massive, parallel corpora across 15 subject\nareas--including religion, economics, medicine, entertainment, politics, and\ntechnology--in 999 languages, here we show substantial variation in the\ninformation and semantic density of languages and their consequences for human\ncommunication and coordination.

Then, using over 9,000 real-life conversations across\n14 languages and 90,000 Wikipedia articles across 140 languages, we show that\nbecause there are more ways to discuss any given topic in denser languages,\nconversations and articles retrace and cycle over a narrower conceptual\nterrain.

In such settings the\nabsolute levels of anticipated consumption can range from 5-100 kWh/month,\nleading to high variability amongst these customers. Precious resources are at\nstake if a significant fraction of low consumers are connected over those with\nhigher consumption.\n  This is the first study of it's kind in low-income settings that attempts to\npredict a building's consumption and not that of an aggregate administrative\narea. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over pre-electrification\ndaytime satellite imagery with a sample of utility bills from 20,000\ngeo-referenced electricity customers in Kenya (0.01% of Kenya's residential\ncustomers).

Many of physical\nenvironments consist of two or more types of particles, each having its own\ncharacteristics, such an environment may undergo some evolutions in the\npresence of external forces, e.g., in the presence of electromagnetic or\ngravitation fields, and may also be affected by a source of energy or by\ninteraction with its external environment. The situation becomes more complex\nwhen there are some internal interactions due to collisions between particles,\nchemical reactions and various dissipation mechanisms. From microscopic point\nof view, the random motion of different particles and local forces, energy or\nmass transaction and their recursive dependence with that of global makes the\nqualitative behaviors of the environment even more complex. Heat convection in\na liquid mixture, a vibrating or rotating viscose fluid, chemically reacting\nmultiphase media and plasma in an electric and magnetic field are examples, to\nsay a few. Up to the author knowledge there is no general and precise\nmathematical formulation efficiently describing such environments, although\nstatistical formulation in Kinetic theory combined with some physical\ninterpretations is a good approach but insufficient, say in describing\nradiation. Our aim in this note is to give a set of partial differential\nequation governing evaluation of a multispecies environment consisting of\ncharged particles in an electromagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 22:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Such\nassignment strategies increase the risk of statistical hypothesis tests\nidentifying a difference between arms when there is not one, and failing to\nconclude there is a difference in arms when there truly is one. We tackle this\nby introducing a novel heuristic algorithm, called TS-PostDiff (Posterior\nProbability of Difference). TS-PostDiff takes a Bayesian approach to mixing TS\nand Uniform Random (UR): the probability a participant is assigned using UR\nallocation is the posterior probability that the difference between two arms is\n'small' (below a certain threshold), allowing for more UR exploration when\nthere is little or no reward to be gained. We evaluate TS-PostDiff against\nstate-of-the-art strategies. The empirical and simulation results help\ncharacterize the trade-offs of these approaches between reward, False Positive\nRate (FPR), and statistical power, as well as under which circumstances each is\neffective. We quantify the advantage of TS-PostDiff in performing well across\nmultiple differences in arm means (effect sizes), showing the benefits of\nadaptively changing randomization/exploration in TS in a \"Statistically\nConsiderate\" manner: reducing FPR and increasing statistical power when\ndifferences are small or zero and there is less reward to be gained, while\nexploiting more when differences may be large.

Standard practices such as\ndata augmentation attempt to bridge this gap by augmenting source images in an\neffort to extend the support of the training distribution to better cover what\nthe agent might experience at test time. In many cases, however, it is\nimpossible to know test-time distribution-shift a priori, making these schemes\ninfeasible. In this paper, we introduce a general approach, called Invariance\nThrough Latent Alignment (ILA), that improves the test-time performance of a\nvisuomotor control policy in deployment environments with unknown perceptual\nvariations. ILA performs unsupervised adaptation at deployment-time by matching\nthe distribution of latent features on the target domain to the agent's prior\nexperience, without relying on paired data. Although simple, we show that this\nidea leads to surprising improvements on a variety of challenging adaptation\nscenarios, including changes in lighting conditions, the content in the scene,\nand camera poses.

Similarly, the scheduling of\nradiotherapy for cancer treatments needs to handle patients with different\nurgency levels when allocating resources. High priority patients may arrive at\nany time, and there must be resources available to accommodate them. A common\nsolution is to reserve a flat percentage of treatment capacity for emergency\npatients. However, this solution can result in overdue treatments for urgent\npatients, a failure to fully exploit treatment capacity, and delayed treatments\nfor low-priority patients. This problem is especially severe in large and\ncrowded hospitals. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based approach for\nonline dynamic radiotherapy scheduling that dynamically adapts the present\nscheduling decision based on each incoming patient and the current allocation\nof resources. Our approach is based on a regression model trained to recognize\nthe links between patients' arrival patterns, and their ideal waiting time in\noptimal offline solutions where all future arrivals are known in advance. When\nour prediction-based approach is compared to flat-reservation policies, it does\na better job of preventing overdue treatments for emergency patients, while\nalso maintaining comparable waiting times for the other patients. We also\ndemonstrate how our proposed approach supports explainability and\ninterpretability in scheduling decisions using SHAP values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 01:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 03:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Moreover, they also require the\nlabeled source data during adaptation, limiting their usability in data\nprivacy-sensitive applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nUniversal Model ADaptation (UMAD) framework which handles both UDA scenarios\nwithout access to the source data nor prior knowledge about the category shift\nbetween domains. Specifically, we aim to learn a source model with an elegantly\ndesigned two-head classifier and provide it to the target domain. During\nadaptation, we develop an informative consistency score to help distinguish\nunknown samples from known samples. To achieve bilateral adaptation in the\ntarget domain, we further maximize localized mutual information to align known\nsamples with the source classifier and employ an entropic loss to push unknown\nsamples far away from the source classification boundary, respectively.\nExperiments on open-set and open-partial-set UDA scenarios demonstrate that\nUMAD, as a unified approach without access to source data, exhibits comparable,\nif not superior, performance to state-of-the-art data-dependent methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 01:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

In recent years, the accumulation of a large number of genomics\nand pharmacology data has formed mass drug and target related heterogeneous\nnetworks (HNs), which provides new opportunities of developing HN-based\ncomputational models to accurately predict DTIs. The HN implies lots of useful\ninformation about DTIs but also contains irrelevant data, and how to make the\nbest of heterogeneous networks remains a challenge. Results: In this paper, we\npropose a heterogeneous graph automatic meta-path learning based DTI prediction\nmethod (HampDTI). HampDTI automatically learns the important meta-paths between\ndrugs and targets from the HN, and generates meta-path graphs. For each\nmeta-path graph, the features learned from drug molecule graphs and target\nprotein sequences serve as the node attributes, and then a node-type specific\ngraph convolutional network (NSGCN) which efficiently considers node type\ninformation (drugs or targets) is designed to learn embeddings of drugs and\ntargets. Finally, the embeddings from multiple meta-path graphs are combined to\npredict novel DTIs. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our\nproposed HampDTI achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art\nDTI prediction methods. More importantly, HampDTI identifies the important\nmeta-paths for DTI prediction, which could explain how drugs connect with\ntargets in HNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 02:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The dynamic current oscillates due to the\ntemporal coherence of the electron tunneling device only when the tunneling\ntransition is coupled. The oscillation frequency of the transport current is\nrelated to the step voltage applied by the lead, while the $T$, e-e interaction\n$U$ and the bandwidth $W$ have little influence.

Moreover, this amounts to a 36$\\pm$8% X-ray detection\nrate (despite the sometimes high, X-ray-absorbing, HI column densities),\ncompared to just 10$\\pm$5% for (the largely HI-free) dwarf early-type galaxies\nin the Virgo cluster. The expected contribution of X-ray binaries from the\ngalaxies' inner field stars is negligible. Moreover, given that both the spiral\nand dwarf galaxies contain nuclear star clusters, the above inequality appears\nto disfavor X-ray binaries in nuclear star clusters. The higher occupation, or\nrather detection, fraction among the spiral galaxies may instead reflect an\nenhanced cool gas/fuel supply and Eddington ratio. Indeed, four of the 11 new\nX-ray detections are associated with known LINERs or LINER/HII composites. For\nall (four) of the new detections for which the X-ray flux was strong enough to\nestablish the spectral energy distribution in the Chandra band, it is\nconsistent with power-law spectra. Furthermore, the X-ray emission from the\nsource with the highest flux (NGC 4197: $L_X \\approx 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$)\nsuggests a non-stellar-mass black hole if the X-ray spectrum corresponds to the\n`low/hard state'.

Moreover, we\nobserve a valley polarized Chern insulator with C = 2 emanating at v = 2 in the\nelectron side and a valley polarized Fermi surface around v = -2 in the hole\nside. The valley Chern insulator with C = 2 is evident from a well quantized\nHall conductance plateau at 2e^2/h and correspondingly a vanishing longitudinal\ncomponent. The valley polarized Fermi surface is topologically trivial with C =\n0, and it shows a series of quantized Landau levels with v_LL = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\nand others.

The single-dimensional LS\nfeatures mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic data, which\nare automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder\nnetwork. Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic\ninformation, such as the waveform variations, of the seismic data. Therefore\nthe NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber velocity details.\nTo mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features,\nwhich can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data.

An outstanding issue is\nthe use of paired (registered) LR and HR data, which is often required in the\ntraining step of such methods but is difficult to obtain. In this work, we\nrigorously compare two different state-of-the-art SR deep learning techniques,\nusing both paired and unpaired data, with like-for-like ground truth data.

Recently, the generalized zero-shot XMC (GZ-XMC) setup\nhas been studied and ZestXML is proposed accordingly to handle the unseen\nlabels, which still requires a large number of annotated (instance, label)\npairs. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario called Extreme\nZero-Shot XMC (EZ-XMC), in which no supervision is needed and merely raw text\nof instances and labels are accessible. Few-Shot XMC (FS-XMC), an extension to\nEZ-XMC with limited supervision is also investigated. To learn the semantic\nembeddings of instances and labels with raw text, we propose to pre-train\nTransformer-based encoders with self-supervised contrastive losses.\nSpecifically, we develop a pre-training method MACLR, which thoroughly\nleverages the raw text with techniques including Multi-scale Adaptive\nClustering, Label Regularization, and self-training with pseudo positive pairs.\nExperimental results on four public EZ-XMC datasets demonstrate that MACLR\nachieves superior performance compared to all other leading baseline methods,\nin particular with approximately 5-10% improvement in precision and recall on\naverage. Moreover, we also show that our pre-trained encoder can be further\nimproved on FS-XMC when there are a limited number of ground-truth positive\npairs in training. By fine-tuning the encoder on such a few-shot subset, MACLR\nstill outperforms other extreme classifiers significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 06:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

While we do not\nknow how language models (LMs) answer such questions, we conjecture that they\nmay answer more accurately if they are also provided with additional details\nabout the question situation, elaborating the \"scene\". To test this conjecture,\nwe train a new model, DREAM, to answer questions that elaborate the scenes that\nsituated questions are about, and then provide those elaborations as additional\ncontext to a question-answering (QA) model. We find that DREAM is able to\ncreate better scene elaborations (more accurate, useful, and consistent) than a\nrepresentative state-of-the-art, zero-shot model (Macaw). We also find that\nusing the scene elaborations as additional context improves the answer accuracy\nof a downstream QA system, including beyond that obtainable by simply further\nfinetuning the QA system on DREAM's training data. These results suggest that\nadding focused elaborations about a situation can improve a system's reasoning\nabout it, and may serve as an effective way of injecting new scenario based\nknowledge into QA models.

A typical pipeline of CL-based recommendation\nmodels is first augmenting the user-item bipartite graph with structure\nperturbations, and then maximizing the node representation consistency between\ndifferent graph augmentations. Although this paradigm turns out to be\neffective, what underlies the performance gains is still a mystery. In this\npaper, we first experimentally disclose that, in CL-based recommendation\nmodels, CL operates by learning more evenly distributed user/item\nrepresentations that can implicitly mitigate the popularity bias. Meanwhile, we\nreveal that the graph augmentations, which were considered necessary, just play\na trivial role. Based on this finding, we propose a simple CL method which\ndiscards the graph augmentations and instead adds uniform noises to the\nembedding space for creating contrastive views. A comprehensive experimental\nstudy on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that, though it appears\nstrikingly simple, the proposed method can smoothly adjust the uniformity of\nlearned representations and has distinct advantages over its graph\naugmentation-based counterparts in terms of recommendation accuracy and\ntraining efficiency.

However, prior MoE-based DG ReID\nmethods suffer from a large model size with the increase of the number of\nsource domains, and most of them overlook the exploitation of domain-invariant\ncharacteristics. To handle the two issues above, this paper presents a new\napproach called Mimic Embedding via adapTive Aggregation (META) for DG person\nReID. To avoid the large model size, experts in META do not adopt a branch\nnetwork for each source domain but share all the parameters except for the\nbatch normalization layers.

Benefiting from a proposed consistency loss and an\nepisodic training algorithm, META is expected to mimic embedding for a truly\nunseen target domain.

We give the first theoretical study of such methods, by\nspecializing to logistic classification probabilities. We prove that if the\nobservations are generated from a two-component isotropic Gaussian mixture,\nthen minimizing the entropy risk over a Euclidean ball indeed allows to\nidentify the separation vector of the mixture.

Promotions are one of the most important business strategies that are\noften used to boost sales. While promotions are attractive for generating\ndemand, it is often difficult to forecast demand in their presence. In the past\nfew decades, several quantitative models have been developed to forecast sales\nincluding statistical and machine learning models. However, these methods may\nnot be adequate to account for all the internal and external factors that may\nimpact sales. As a result, qualitative models have been adopted along with\nquantitative methods as consulting experts has been proven to improve forecast\naccuracy by providing contextual information. Such models are being used\nextensively to account for factors that can lead to a rapid change in sales,\nsuch as during promotions. In this paper, we aim to use Bayesian Networks to\nforecast promotional sales where a combination of factors such as price, type\nof promotions, and product location impacts sales. We choose to develop a BN\nmodel because BN models essentially have the capability to combine various\nqualitative and quantitative factors with causal forms, making it an attractive\ntool for sales forecasting during promotions. This can be used to adjust a\ncompany's promotional strategy in the context of this case study. We gather\nsales data for a particular product from a retailer that sells products in\nAustralia. We develop a Bayesian Network for this product and validate our\nresults by empirical analysis. This paper confirms that BNs can be effectively\nused to forecast sales, especially during promotions. In the end, we provide\nsome research avenues for using BNs in forecasting sales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

However, most existing models only intercept users' recent\ninteraction behaviors as training data, discarding a large amount of historical\ninteraction sequences. This may raise two issues. On the one hand, data\nreflecting multiple interests of users is missing; on the other hand, the\nco-occurrence between items in historical user-item interactions is not fully\nexplored. To tackle the two issues, this paper proposes a novel sequential\nrecommendation model called \"Global Interaction Aware Multi-Interest Framework\nfor Sequential Recommendation (GIMIRec)\". Specifically, a global context\nextraction module is firstly proposed without introducing any external\ninformation, which calculates a weighted co-occurrence matrix based on the\nconstrained co-occurrence number of each item pair and their time interval from\nthe historical interaction sequences of all users and then obtains the global\ncontext embedding of each item by using a simplified graph convolution.\nSecondly, the time interval of each item pair in the recent interaction\nsequence of each user is captured and combined with the global context item\nembedding to get the personalized item embedding. Finally, a self-attention\nbased multi-interest framework is applied to learn the diverse interests of\nusers for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments on the three\nreal-world datasets of Amazon-Books, Taobao-Buy and Amazon-Hybrid show that the\nperformance of GIMIRec on the Recall, NDCG and Hit Rate indicators is\nsignificantly superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods.

This applies to frequentist approaches based\non P-values and to Bayesian approaches although for different reasons. In the\nfirst part of the paper 13 model based procedures are compared to the\nmodel-free Gaussian covariate procedure in terms of the covariates selected and\nthe time required. The comparison is based on seven data sets and three\nsimulations. There is nothing special about these data sets which are often\nused as examples in the literature. All the model based procedures failed.\n  In the second part of the paper it is argued that the cause of this failure\nis the very use of a model. If the model involves all the available covariates\nstandard P-values can be used. The use of P-values in this situation is quite\nstraightforward. As soon as the model specifies only some unknown subset of the\ncovariates the problem being to identify this subset the situation changes\nradically.

In addition, we demonstrate how the\ntransformer model can be further improved with our proposed task- and\nlanguage-agnostic model architecture based on ensembles over random splits and\ncross-sentence context. Our studies in low-resource and transfer settings\nreveal stable model performance despite a lack of annotated data with\nimprovements of up to 47 F1 points when only 250 labeled sentences are\navailable. Our results highlight the importance of specialized language models\nas CLIN-X for concept extraction in non-standard domains, but also show that\nour task-agnostic model architecture is robust across the tested tasks and\nlanguages so that domain- or task-specific adaptations are not required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:07:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 11:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 18:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

As a proof\nof principle, we consider the interaction of graphene nanoribbons, with zigzag\nas well as armchair terminations, and resonant fields polarized along the\ncross-ribbon direction. Here, this effect is particularly prominent due to many\nnearly equi-separated energy levels. In such a scenario, a cascade resonance\neffect can take place in high-harmonic generation when the field strength is\nabove a critical threshold, which is completely different from the harmonic\ngeneration mechanism of atoms, molecules and bulk solids. We further discuss\nthe implications not only for other systems in a nanoribbon geometry, but also\nsystems where only a few subbands (energy levels) meet this frequency-matching\ncondition by considering a generalized multilevel Hamiltonian.

Albeit their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods are prone to\ncreate harmful samples due to their randomness. To address this issue, 'maximum\nsaliency' strategies were recently proposed: they select only the most\ninformative features to prevent such a phenomenon.

Yet in many situations, global dataset\ninformation such as its underlying distribution, e.g. $k$-way marginals or\ncorrelations are similarly sensitive or secret. We here explore for the first\ntime whether a model leaks information about the correlations between the input\nvariables of its training dataset, something we name correlation inference\nattack. We first propose a model-less attack, showing how an attacker can\nexploit the spherical parametrization of correlation matrices to make an\ninformed guess based on the correlations between the input variables and the\ntarget variable alone. Second, we propose a model-based attack, showing how an\nattacker can exploit black-box access to the model to infer the correlations\nusing shadow models trained on synthetic datasets. Our synthetic data\ngeneration approach combines Gaussian copula-based generative modeling with a\ncarefully adapted procedure for sampling correlation matrices under\nconstraints. Third, we evaluate our model-based attack against Logistic\nRegression and Multilayer Perceptron models and show it to strongly outperform\nthe model-less attack on three real-world tabular datasets, indicating that the\nmodels leak information about the correlations. We also propose a novel\ncorrelation inference-based attribute inference attack (CI-AIA), and show it to\nobtain state-of-the-art performance. Taken together, our results show how\nattackers can use the model to extract information about the dataset\ndistribution, and use it to improve their prior on sensitive attributes of\nindividual records.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 11:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 19:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 10:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

These algorithms are typically parameterized in the\nnumber of participants, and their correctness requires the existence of bounds\non message delays and on the relative speed of processes after reaching Global\nStabilization Time. These characteristics make partially synchronous algorithms\nparameterized in the number of processes, and parametric in time bounds, which\nrender automated verification of partially synchronous algorithms challenging.\nIn this paper, we present a case study on formal verification of both safety\nand liveness of the Chandra and Toueg failure detector that is based on partial\nsynchrony. To this end, we first introduce and formalize the class of symmetric\npoint-to-point algorithms that contains the failure detector. Second, we show\nthat these symmetric point-to-point algorithms have a cutoff, and the cutoff\nresults hold in three models of computation: synchrony, asynchrony, and partial\nsynchrony. As a result, one can verify them by model checking small instances,\nbut the verification problem stays parametric in time. Next, we specify the\nfailure detector and the partial synchrony assumptions in three frameworks:\nTLA+, IVy, and counter automata. Importantly, we tune our modeling to use the\nstrength of each method: (1) We are using counters to encode message buffers\nwith counter automata, (2) we are using first-order relations to encode message\nbuffers in IVy, and (3) we are using both approaches in TLA+.

Most in vitro protein folding\nstudies have focused on single-domain proteins. Hence, it is important to\nunderstand the folding process of multi-domain proteins, especially when\ndomains are discontinuous. We choose the Maltose binding protein (MBP) as a\nmodel system. In particular, we studied a mutant of MBP that folds slowly.\nHere, using two- and three-color single-molecule Foerster resonance energy\ntransfer (smFRET) experiments, we study the refolding of both the domains and\nthe interaction between the domains of DM-MBP. Initial two-color smFRET\nmeasurements of the N-terminal domain (NTD) reveal the presence of a folding\nintermediate. The same folding intermediate is observed in measurements\nmonitoring the C- terminal domain (CTD) and the NTD-CTD (N-C) interface. The\nrefolding intermediate is dynamic on the sub-millisecond timescale.\nQuantitative analysis on underlying dynamic interconversions revealed a delay\nin NTD folding imposed by the entropic barrier being the primary cause for slow\nDM-MBP folding. Moreover, CTD folds after NTD completes the folding. Using\nthree-color smFRET, we could show the NTD folds first and CTD later in a same\nprotein. Molecular dynamic simulations for temperature-induced unfolding on WT-\nand DM-MBP identify a folding nucleus in the NTD, which is rich in hydrophobic\nresidues, and explains why the two mutations slow down the folding kinetics. In\nthe presence of the bacterial Hsp60 chaperonin system GroEL/ES, we observe that\nDM-MBP is dynamic within the chaperonin cavity but the chaperonin limits the\nconformational space of substrate.

It is,\ntherefore, essential to establish non-destructive, fast, and compact techniques\nto assess porosity, in-situ, during the manufacturing process. In this paper,\nthe terahertz frequency-domain (THz-FD) technique was explored as a fast,\nnon-destructive, and sensitive technique for porosity measurement of\npharmaceutical tablets. We studied a sample set of 69 tablets with different\ndesign factors, such as particle size of the active pharmaceutical ingredient\n(API), Ibuprofen, particle size of the filler, Mannitol, API concentration, and\ncompaction force. The signal transmitted through each tablet was measured\nacross the frequency range 500-750 GHz using a vector network analyzer combined\nwith a quasi-optical set-up consisting of four off-axis parabolic mirrors to\nguide and focus the beam. We first extracted the effective refractive index of\neach tablet from the measured complex transmission coefficients and then\ntranslated it to porosity, using an empirical linear relation between effective\nrefractive index and tablet density. The results show that the THz-FD technique\nwas highly sensitive to the variations of the design factors, showing that\nfiller particle size and compaction force had a significant impact on the\neffective refractive index of the tablets and, consequently, porosity.\nMoreover, the fragmentation behaviour of particles was observed by THz porosity\nmeasurements and was verified with scanning electron microscopy of the\ncross-section of tablets. In conclusion, the THz-FD technique, based on\nelectronic solutions, allows for fast, sensitive, and non-destructive porosity\nmeasurement that opens for compact instrument systems capable of in-situ\nsensing in tablet manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:49:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 08:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

The ion-chain coupling is discussed in the form of\nbinding time, mean-square-displacement (MSD) relative to the chain, local ion\ntransport coefficient, and spatio-temporal correlations in the effective\ncharge. We have shown that a counterion exhibits sub-diffusive behavior\n$\\langle \\delta R^2 \\rangle \\sim t^\\delta$, $\\delta\\approx0.9$ w.r.t. chain's\ncentre of mass (COM). The MSD of ions perpendicularly outwards from the chain\nsegment exhibits a smaller sub-diffusive exponent compared to the one relative\nto the chain's COM. Further, we confirm that the effective\ndiffusion-coefficient of counterions is strongly coupled with the chain. The\neffective diffusivity of ion is the lowest in chain's close proximity,\nextending up to length-scale of the radius of gyration Rg. Beyond Rg at larger\ndistances, they attain diffusivity of free ion with a smooth cross-over from\nthe adsorbed regime to the free ion regime. We have shown that the effective\ndiffusivity drastically decreases for the higher valent ions, while the\ncrossover length scale remains the same. Conversely, with increasing salt\nconcentration the coupling-length scale reduces, while the diffusivity remains\nunaltered. The effective diffusivity of adsorbed-ion reveals an exponential\nreduction with electrostatic interaction strength. We further corroborate this\nfrom the binding time of ions on the chain, which also grows exponentially with\nthe coupling strength of the ion-polymer duo. Moreover, the binding time of\nions exhibits a weak dependence with salt concentration for the monovalent\nsalt, while for higher valent salts the binding time decreases dramatically\nwith concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

The most prominent candidate so far is\nthe blazar TXS 0506+056, which is found to be associated with the neutrino\nevent IceCube-170922A. Furthermore, the IceCube reported an excess of neutrinos\ntowards TXS 0506+056 between September 2014 and March 2015, even though this\nassociation needs additional investigation, considering the presence of a\nnearby gamma-ray source, the quasar PKS 0502+049. Motivated by this, we studied\nthe parsec-scale structures of TXS 0506+056 and PKS 0502+049 through radio\ninterferometry at 8 and 15\\,GHz. We identified twelve jet components in TXS\n0506+056 and seven components in PKS 0502+049. The most reliable jet components\nshow superluminal speeds ranging from 9.5c to 66c in the case of TXS 0506+056,\nand from 14.3c to 59c for PKS 0502+049, which were used to estimate a lower\n(upper) limit for the Lorentz factor (jet viewing angle) for both sources. A\nnovel approach using simultaneously the brightness temperature of the core\nregion and the apparent speeds of the jet components allowed us to infer basic\njet parameters for TXS 0506+056 at distinct epochs. We also found that the\nemergence of new jet components coincides with the occurrence of gamma-ray\nflares. Interestingly, two of these coincidences in the case of PKS 0502+049\nand one for TXS 0506+056 seems to be correlated with neutrino events detected\nby the IceCube Observatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 13:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Within\nthe non-equilibrium time-relaxation framework, NTRKM is extended in the form of\nmodified Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Based on the first-order Chapman-Enskog\nexpansion, NTRKM connects with the six-variable macroscopic governing\nequations. The first five governing equations correspond to the conservative\nlaws in mass, momentum and total energy, while the sixth equation governs the\nevolution of unresolved turbulence kinetic energy Kutke. The unknowns in NTRKM,\nincluding turbulent relaxation time and source term, are determined by\nessential gradient-type assumption and standard dynamic modeling approach.\nCurrent generalized kinetic model on unresolved grids consequently offers a\nprofound mesoscopic understanding for one-equation subgrid-scale turbulence\nkinetic energy Ksgs model in compressible large eddy simulation. To solve NTRKM\naccurately and robustly, a non-equilibrium gas-kinetic scheme is developed,\nwhich succeeds the well-established gas-kinetic scheme for simulating\nNavier-Stokes equations. Three-dimensional decaying compressible isotropic\nturbulence and temporal compressible plane mixing layer on unresolved grids are\nsimulated to evaluate the generalized kinetic model and non-equilibrium\ngas-kinetic scheme. The performance of key turbulent quantities up to\nsecond-order statistics confirms that NTRKM is comparable with the widely-used\neddy-viscosity Smagorinsky model (SM) and dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM).\nSpecifically, compared with the DNS solution in temporal compressible plane\nmixing layer, the performance of NTRKM is much closer with DSM and better than\nSM.

This is limiting because an utterance may refer to visual\nentities at various levels of granularity, such as the chair, the leg of the\nchair, or the tip of the front leg of the chair, which may be missed by the\ndetector. We propose a language grounding model that attends on the referential\nutterance and on the object proposal pool computed from a pre-trained detector\nto decode referenced objects with a detection head, without selecting them from\nthe pool. In this way, it is helped by powerful pre-trained object detectors\nwithout being restricted by their misses. We call our model Bottom Up Top Down\nDEtection TRansformers (BUTD-DETR) because it uses both language guidance (top\ndown) and objectness guidance (bottom-up) to ground referential utterances in\nimages and point clouds. Moreover, BUTD-DETR casts object detection as\nreferential grounding and uses object labels as language prompts to be grounded\nin the visual scene, augmenting supervision for the referential grounding task\nin this way. The proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art across popular 3D\nlanguage grounding benchmarks with significant performance gains over previous\n3D approaches (12.6% on SR3D, 11.6% on NR3D and 6.3% on ScanRefer).

To implement this essential function in integrated\nphotonic systems, it is desirable to drive microcombs directly with an on-chip\nlaser in a simple and flexible way. However, two major difficulties are\npreventing this goal: 1) generating mode-locked comb states usually requires a\nsignificant amount of pump power and 2) the requirement to align laser and\nresonator frequency significantly complicates operation and limits the\ntunability of the comb lines. Here, we address these problems by using\nmicroresonators on an AlGaAs on-insulator platform to generate dark-pulse\nmicrocombs. This highly nonlinear platform dramatically relaxes fabrication\nrequirements and leads to a record-low pump power of less than 1 mW for\ncoherent comb generation. Dark-pulse microcombs facilitated by\nthermally-controlled avoided mode-crossings are accessed by direct DFB laser\npumping. Without any feedback or control circuitries, the comb shows good\ncoherence and stability. This approach also leads to an unprecedented wide\nchirping range of all the comb lines.

In order to\nfacilitate the human painting process, substantial research efforts have been\nmade on teaching machines how to \"paint like a human\", and then using the\ntrained agent as a painting assistant tool for human users. However, current\nresearch in this direction is often reliant on a progressive grid-based\ndivision strategy wherein the agent divides the overall image into successively\nfiner grids, and then proceeds to paint each of them in parallel. This\ninevitably leads to artificial painting sequences which are not easily\nintelligible to human users. To address this, we propose a novel painting\napproach which learns to generate output canvases while exhibiting a more\nhuman-like painting style. The proposed painting pipeline Intelli-Paint\nconsists of 1) a progressive layering strategy which allows the agent to first\npaint a natural background scene representation before adding in each of the\nforeground objects in a progressive fashion. 2) We also introduce a novel\nsequential brushstroke guidance strategy which helps the painting agent to\nshift its attention between different image regions in a semantic-aware manner.\n3) Finally, we propose a brushstroke regularization strategy which allows for\n~60-80% reduction in the total number of required brushstrokes without any\nperceivable differences in the quality of the generated canvases. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative results, we show that the resulting agents not\nonly show enhanced efficiency in output canvas generation but also exhibit a\nmore natural-looking painting style which would better assist human users\nexpress their ideas through digital artwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

This is\nparticularly true for systems with continuous and high-dimensional state and\naction spaces, such as robotic manipulators. The challenge is accentuated in\nthe sparse rewards setting, where the low-level state information required for\nthe design of dense rewards is unavailable. Adversarial imitation learning\n(AIL) can partially overcome this barrier by leveraging expert-generated\ndemonstrations of optimal behaviour and providing, essentially, a replacement\nfor dense reward information. Unfortunately, the availability of expert\ndemonstrations does not necessarily improve an agent's capability to explore\neffectively and, as we empirically show, can lead to inefficient or stagnated\nlearning. We present Learning from Guided Play (LfGP), a framework in which we\nleverage expert demonstrations of, in addition to a main task, multiple\nauxiliary tasks. Subsequently, a hierarchical model is used to learn each task\nreward and policy through a modified AIL procedure, in which exploration of all\ntasks is enforced via a scheduler composing different tasks together. This\naffords many benefits: learning efficiency is improved for main tasks with\nchallenging bottleneck transitions, expert data becomes reusable between tasks,\nand transfer learning through the reuse of learned auxiliary task models\nbecomes possible. Our experimental results in a challenging multitask robotic\nmanipulation domain indicate that our method compares favourably to supervised\nimitation learning and to a state-of-the-art AIL method.

Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into\nseveral sub-tasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks,\ncentres and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer\nstrategy requires complex post-processing in both spatial and temporal domains\nand is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by\nobject-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations,\nwe present Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode\nall panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and\nbackground semantics, with a unified representation called panoptic slots. The\ncoherent spatio-temporal object's information is retrieved and encoded into the\npanoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling it to\nlocalize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner.\nFinally, the output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class,\nmask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video.

Over\nthe past two decades, observational instruments (both onboard and on\nground-based facilities) have revealed an astonishing diversity in planetary\nphysical features (i. e. mass and radius), and orbital parameters (e.g. period,\nsemi-major axis, inclination). Exoplanetary atmospheres provide direct clues to\nunderstand the origin of these differences through their observable spectral\nimprints. In the near future, upcoming ground and space-based telescopes will\nshift the focus of exoplanetary science from an era of 'species discovery' to\none of 'atmospheric characterization'. In this context, the Atmospheric\nRemote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large (Ariel) survey, will play a key role.\nAs it is designed to observe and characterize a large and diverse sample of\nexoplanets, Ariel will provide constraints on a wide gamut of atmospheric\nproperties allowing us to extract much more information than has been possible\nso far (e.g. insights into the planetary formation and evolution processes).\nThe low resolution spectra obtained with Ariel will probe layers different from\nthose observed by ground-based high resolution spectroscopy, therefore the\nsynergy between these two techniques offers a unique opportunity to\nunderstanding the physics of planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we set the\nbasis for building up a framework to effectively utilise, at near-infrared\nwavelengths, high-resolution datasets (analyzed via the cross-correlation\ntechnique) with spectral retrieval analyses based on Ariel low-resolution\nspectroscopy. We show preliminary results, using a benchmark object, namely HD\n209458 b, addressing the possibility of providing improved constraints on the\ntemperature structure and molecular/atomic abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

In this contribution, the notion of a driven Gaussian\nquantum walk is introduced. In contrast to typically considered quantum walks\nin optical settings, we describe the operation of the walk in terms of a\nnonlinear map rather than a unitary operation, e.g., by replacing a\nbeam-splitter-type coin with a two-mode squeezer, being a process that is\ncontrolled and driven by a pump field. This opens previously unattainable\npossibilities for quantum walks that include nonlinear elements as core\ncomponents of their operation, vastly extending their range of applications. A\nfull framework for driven Gaussian quantum walks is developed, including\nmethods to dynamically characterize nonlinear, quantum, and quantum-nonlinear\neffects. Moreover, driven Gaussian quantum walks are compared with their\nclassically interfering and linear counterparts, which are based on classical\ncoherence of light rather than quantum superpositions. In particular, the\ngeneration and boost of highly multimode entanglement, squeezing, and other\nquantum effects are studied over the duration of the nonlinear walk.\nImportantly, we prove the quantumness of the evolution itself, regardless of\nthe input state. A scheme for an experimental realization is proposed.\nFurthermore, nonlinear properties of driven Gaussian quantum walks are\nexplored, such as amplification that leads to an ever increasing number of\ncorrelated quantum particles, constituting a source of new walkers during the\nwalk. Therefore, a concept for quantum walks is proposed that leads to -- and\neven produces -- directly accessible quantum phenomena, and that renders the\nquantum simulation of nonlinear processes possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 17:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

In projection filters, the Kushner--Stratonovich\nstochastic partial differential equation that governs the propagation of the\noptimal filtering density is projected to a manifold of parametric densities,\nresulting in a finite-dimensional stochastic differential equation. Despite the\nfact that projection filters are capable of representing complicated\nprobability densities, their current implementations are limited to Gaussian\nfamily or unidimensional filtering applications. This work considers a\ncombination of numerical integration and automatic differentiation to construct\nprojection filter algorithms for more generic problems. Specifically, we\nprovide a detailed exposition of this combination for the manifold of the\nexponential family, and show how to apply the projection filter to\nmultidimensional cases. We demonstrate numerically that based on comparison to\na finite-difference solution to the Kushner--Stratonovich equation and a\nbootstrap particle filter with systematic resampling, the proposed algorithm\nretains an accurate approximation of the filtering density while requiring a\ncomparatively low number of quadrature points. Due to the sparse-grid\nintegration and automatic differentiation used to calculate the expected values\nof the natural statistics and the Fisher metric, the proposed filtering\nalgorithms are highly scalable. They therefore are suitable to many\napplications in which the number of dimensions exceeds the practical limit of\nparticle filters, but where the Gaussian-approximations are deemed\nunsatisfactory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 16:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

This\nsituation, known as imbalanced data classification, causes low predictive\nperformance for the minority class examples. Thus, the prediction model is\nunreliable although the overall model accuracy can be acceptable. Oversampling\nand undersampling techniques are well-known strategies to deal with this\nproblem by balancing the number of examples of each class. However, their\neffectiveness depends on several factors mainly related to data intrinsic\ncharacteristics, such as imbalance ratio, dataset size and dimensionality,\noverlapping between classes or borderline examples. In this work, the impact of\nthese factors is analyzed through a comprehensive comparative study involving\n40 datasets from different application areas. The objective is to obtain models\nfor automatic selection of the best resampling strategy for any dataset based\non its characteristics.
