Tops\nin the list of questions are perhaps (1) absence of superconductivity in the\nbulk nickelate and limited thickness of the infinite-layer phase in thin film,\n(2) absence of superconductivity in the La-nickelate despite it being the\nearliest studied rare-earth nickelate, and the role of 4f orbital in the recipe\nof superconductivity, (3) absence of Meissner effect and suspect of the origin\nof superconductivity from the interface, (4) whether nickelate hosts similar\npairing symmetry to the single-band high-Tc cuprates or multiband iron-based\nsuperconductor. In this perspective article, we will discuss the following\naspects: (1) stabilization of the infinite-layer phase on the SrTiO3(001)\nsubstrate and the thickness dependency of observables; (2) rare earth\ndependence of the superconducting dome and phase diagram on the (La/Pr/Nd)-\ninfinite-layer nickelate thin film; (3) experimental aspects of the measurement\nof Meissner effect; (4) theoretical framework and experimental study of the\npairing symmetry of infinite-layer nickelate superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Their non-Abelian exchange statistics, making them a\nunique state of matter, and their potential applications in topological quantum\ncomputation, earned them attention from both theorists and experimentalists. It\nis generally understood that in order to form Majorana zero modes in\nquasi-one-dimensional topological insulators, time-reversal symmetry must be\nbroken. The straightforward mechanisms for doing so -- applying magnetic fields\nor coupling to ferromagnets -- turned out to have many unwanted side effects,\nsuch as degradation of superconductivity and the formation of sub-gap states,\nwhich is part of the reason Majorana zero modes have been eluding direct\nexperimental detection for a long time. Here we review several proposal that\nrely on controlling the phase of the superconducting order parameter, either as\nthe sole mechanism for time-reversal-symmetry breaking, or as an additional\nhandy knob used to reduce the applied magnetic field. These proposals hold\npractical promise to improve Majorana formation, and they shed light on the\nphysics underlying the formation of the topological superconducting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

The properties of\nthese sensors allow for accurate and fast calculation of optical flow as events\nare generated. Existing solutions for calculating optical flow from event data\neither fail to capture the true direction of motion due to the aperture\nproblem, do not use the high temporal resolution of the sensor, or are too\ncomputationally expensive to be run in real time on embedded platforms. In this\nresearch, we first present a faster version of our previous algorithm, ARMS\n(Aperture Robust Multi-Scale flow). The new optimized software version (fARMS)\nsignificantly improves throughput on a traditional CPU. Further, we present\nhARMS, a hardware realization of the fARMS algorithm allowing for real-time\ncomputation of true flow on low-power, embedded platforms. The proposed hARMS\narchitecture targets hybrid system-on-chip devices and was designed to maximize\nconfigurability and throughput. The hardware architecture and fARMS algorithm\nwere developed with asynchronous neuromorphic processing in mind, abandoning\nthe common use of an event frame and instead operating using only a small\nhistory of relevant events, allowing latency to scale independently of the\nsensor resolution. This change in processing paradigm improved the estimation\nof flow directions by up to 73% compared to the existing method and yielded a\ndemonstrated hARMS throughput of up to 1.21 Mevent/s on the benchmark\nconfiguration selected. This throughput enables real-time performance and makes\nit the fastest known realization of aperture-robust, event-based optical flow\nto date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Thus,\nthe strongest constraints on the LIV coefficients $\\delta_{i,n}$ tend to come\nfrom the highest energies. At sufficiently high energies, photons produced by\ncosmic ray interactions as they propagate through the Universe could be\nsubluminal and unattenuated over cosmological distances. Cosmic ray\ninteractions can also be modified and lead to detectable fingerprints in the\nenergy spectrum and mass composition observed on Earth. The data collected at\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory are therefore possibly sensitive to both the\nelectromagnetic and hadronic sectors of LIV. In this article, we explore these\ntwo sectors by comparing the energy spectrum and the composition of cosmic rays\nand the upper limits on the photon flux from the Pierre Auger Observatory with\nsimulations including LIV. Constraints on LIV parameters depend strongly on the\nmass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies.

This work brings a new solution with\na set of improvements, which increase the quantitative and qualitative\nunderstanding of depth maps compared to existing methods. Recently, a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its extraordinary ability\nin estimating depth maps from monocular videos. However, traditional CNN does\nnot support topological structure and they can work only on regular image\nregions with determined size and weights. On the other hand, graph\nconvolutional networks (GCN) can handle the convolution on non-Euclidean data\nand it can be applied to irregular image regions within a topological\nstructure. Therefore, in this work in order to preserve object geometric\nappearances and distributions, we aim at exploiting GCN for a self-supervised\ndepth estimation model. Our model consists of two parallel auto-encoder\nnetworks: the first is an auto-encoder that will depend on ResNet-50 and\nextract the feature from the input image and on multi-scale GCN to estimate the\ndepth map. In turn, the second network will be used to estimate the ego-motion\nvector (i.e., 3D pose) between two consecutive frames based on ResNet-18. Both\nthe estimated 3D pose and depth map will be used for constructing a target\nimage. A combination of loss functions related to photometric, projection, and\nsmoothness is used to cope with bad depth prediction and preserve the\ndiscontinuities of the objects. In particular, our method provided comparable\nand promising results with a high prediction accuracy of 89% on the publicly\nKITTI and Make3D datasets along with a reduction of 40% in the number of\ntrainable parameters compared to the state of the art solutions.

For flow\nover waves (inhomogeneous surfaces), phase-averaged roughness length scales are\noften prescribed through models based on the wave characteristics and the wind\nspeed. However, such approaches lack generalizability over different wave ages\nand steepnesses due to the reliance on model coefficients tuned to specific\ndatasets. In this paper, a sea surface-based hydrodynamic drag model applicable\nto moving surfaces is developed to model the pressure-based surface drag felt\nby the wind due to the waves. The model is based on the surface gradient\napproach of \\citet{Anderson2010} applicable to stationary obstacles and\nextended here to the wind-wave problem. The wave drag model proposed specifies\nthe hydrodynamic force based on the incoming momentum flux, wave phase speed,\nand the surface frontal area. The drag coefficient associated with the\nwind-wave momentum exchange is determined based on the wave steepness. The wave\ndrag model is used to simulate turbulent airflow above a monochromatic wave\ntrain with different wave ages and wave steepnesses. The mean velocity profiles\nand model form stresses are validated with available lab-scale experimental\ndata and show good agreement across a wide range of wave steepnesses and wave\nages. The drag force is correlated with the wave surface gradient and\nout-of-phase with the wave height distribution by a factor $\\pi/2$ for the\nsinusoidal wave-train considered.

The long-term stability of these implants is achieved by bone growing\naround and into the porous surface of the implant, a process called\nosseointegration. However, debonding of the bone-implant interface can still\noccur due to aseptic implant loosening and insufficient osseointegration, which\nmay have dramatic consequences. The aim of this work is to describe a new 3D\nfinite element frictional contact formulation for the debonding of partially\nosseointegrated implants. The contact model is based on a modified Coulomb's\nfriction law (Immel et al. 2020, Biomech. Model. Mechanobiol.) that takes into\naccount the tangential debonding of the bone-implant interface. This model is\nextended in the direction normal to the bone-implant interface by considering a\ncohesive zone model, to account for adhesion phenomena in the normal direction\nand for adhesive friction of partially bonded interfaces. The model is applied\nto simulate the debonding of an acetabular cup implant. The influence of\npartial osseointegration and adhesive effects on the long-term stability of the\nimplant is assessed. The influence of different patient- and implant-specific\nparameters such as the friction coefficient, the trabecular Young's modulus and\nthe interference fit is also analyzed, in order to determine the optimal\nstability for different configurations.

We observe retardation and aberrational\nlight-bending that allow determination of the pulsar's spin direction. In\ntotal, we have detected seven post-Keplerian (PK) parameters, more than for any\nother binary pulsar. For some of these effects, the measurement precision is so\nhigh that for the first time we have to take higher-order contributions into\naccount. These include contributions of A's effective mass loss (due to\nspin-down) to the observed orbital period decay, a relativistic deformation of\nthe orbit, and effects of the equation of state of super-dense matter on the\nobserved PK parameters via relativistic spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the\nimplications of our findings, including those for the moment of inertia of\nneutron stars. We present the currently most precise test of general\nrelativity's (GR's) quadrupolar description of gravitational waves, validating\nGR's prediction at a level of $1.3 \\times 10^{-4}$ (95% conf.). We demonstrate\nthe utility of the Double Pulsar for tests of alternative theories by focusing\non two specific examples and discuss some implications for studies of the\ninterstellar medium and models for the formation of the Double Pulsar. Finally,\nwe provide context to other types of related experiments and prospects for the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 20:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

We\nconducted a multi-scale, multi-component analysis of the Herschel column\ndensity maps (resolution of 18.2\" or $\\sim$0.07 pc at 830 pc) of the region\nusing a newly developed algorithm \"getsf\" to identify the structural\ncomponents, namely, extended cloud, filaments, and sources. We find that\ncascades of lower column density filaments coalesce to form higher density\nfilaments eventually merging inside the hub (0.8 pc radius). As opposed to the\nprevious view of the hub as a massive clump with $\\sim$1 pc radius, we find it\nto be a network of short high-density filaments. The total mass reservoir in\nthe MonR2 HFS (5 pc $\\times$ 5 pc) is split between filaments (54%), extended\ncloud (37%) and sources (9%). The M/L of filaments increase from $\\sim$ 10\nMsun/pc at 1.5pc from the hub to $\\sim$ 100 Msun/pc at its centre, while the\nnumber of filaments per annulus of 0.2pc width decreases from 20 to 2 in the\nsame range.

We present a scenario where the HFS can be\nsupported by magnetic fields which interact, merge and reorganize themselves as\nthe filaments coalesce. In the new view of the hub as a network of high-density\nfilaments, we suggest that only the stars located in the network can benefit\nfrom the longitudinal flows of gas to become massive, which may explain the\nreason for the formation of many low-mass stars in cluster centres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 18:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In astronomical data,\nthis information is often given in the data but discarded because popular\nmachine learning classifiers cannot incorporate it. We propose a\nsimulation-based approach that incorporates heteroscedastic measurement error\ninto existing classification method to better quantify uncertainty in\nclassification. The proposed method first simulates perturbed realizations of\nthe data from a Bayesian posterior predictive distribution of a Gaussian\nmeasurement error model. Then, a chosen classifier is fit to each simulation.\nThe variation across the simulations naturally reflects the uncertainty\npropagated from the measurement errors in both labeled and unlabeled data sets.\nWe demonstrate the use of this approach via two numerical studies. The first is\na thorough simulation study applying the proposed procedure to SVM and RF,\nwhich are well-known hard and soft classifiers, respectively.

During the last decades, numerous methods were proposed\nfor converting pH2-derived nuclear spin order to the observable magnetization\nof pro-tons or other nuclei of interest, usually 13C or 15N. Here, we analyze\nthe constraints imposed by the topological symmetry of the spin systems on the\namplitude of transferred polarization. In asymmetric systems, heteronuclei can\nbe polarized to 100%. However, the amplitude drops to 75% in A2BX systems and\nfurther to 50% in A3B2X systems. The latter case is of primary importance for\nbiological applications of PHIP using sidearm hydrogenation (PHIP-SAH). If the\npolarization is transferred to the same type of nuclei, i.e. 1H, symmetry\nconstraints impose significant boundaries on the spin-order distribution. For\nAB, A2B, A3B, A2B2, AA'(AA') systems, the maxi-mum average polarization for\neach spin is 100%, 50%, 33.3%, 25%, and 0, respectively, when A and B (or A')\ncame from pH2 We also discuss the effect of dipole-dipole induced pH2\nspin-order distribution in heterogeneous catalysis or nematic liquid crystals.\nPractical examples from the literature illustrate our theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 18:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

In this paper, we describe a choice-free\ntopological representation of Boolean algebras. This representation uses a\nsubclass of the spectral spaces that Stone used in his representation of\ndistributive lattices via compact open sets. It also takes advantage of\nTarski's observation that the regular open sets of any topological space form a\nBoolean algebra. We prove without choice principles that any Boolean algebra\narises from a special spectral space X via the compact regular open sets of X;\nthese sets may also be described as those that are both compact open in X and\nregular open in the upset topology of the specialization order of X, allowing\none to apply to an arbitrary Boolean algebra simple reasoning about regular\nopens of a separative poset. Our representation is therefore a mix of Stone and\nTarski, with the two connected by Vietoris: the relevant spectral spaces also\narise as the hyperspace of nonempty closed sets of a Stone space endowed with\nthe upper Vietoris topology. In addition to representation, we establish a\nchoice-free dual equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras with\nBoolean homomorphisms and a subcategory of the category of spectral spaces with\nspectral maps.

We perform a suite of tests of GR using the\ncompact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing\nrun of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals\nthat have false alarm rates $\\leq 10^{-3}\\, {\\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to\nsignals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include\nGW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find\nthe residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for\neach event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all\nthe post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the\npredictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN\nparameter.

In\nglasses, instead, carriers behave wave-like, diffusing via a Zener-like\ntunneling between quasi-degenerate vibrational eigenstates, as described by the\nAllen-Feldman equation. Recently, it has been shown that these two conduction\nmechanisms emerge from a Wigner transport equation, which unifies and extends\nthe Peierls-Boltzmann and Allen-Feldman formulations, allowing to describe also\ncomplex crystals where particle-like and wave-like conduction mechanisms\ncoexist. Here, we discuss the theoretical foundations of such transport\nequation as is derived from the Wigner phase-space formulation of quantum\nmechanics, elucidating how the interplay between disorder, anharmonicity, and\nthe quantum Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations determines thermal\nconductivity. This Wigner formulation argues for a preferential phase\nconvention for the dynamical matrix in the reciprocal Bloch representation and\nrelated off-diagonal velocity operator's elements; such convention is the only\none yielding a conductivity which is invariant with respect to the non-unique\nchoice of the crystal's unit cell and is size-consistent. We rationalize the\nconditions determining the crossover from particle-like to wave-like heat\nconduction, showing that phonons below the Ioffe-Regel limit (i.e. with a mean\nfree path shorter than the interatomic spacing) contribute to heat transport\ndue to their wave-like capability to interfere and tunnel. Finally, we show\nthat the present approach overcomes the failures of the Peierls-Boltzmann\nformulation for materials with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 18:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 15:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

As a proof of principle, we show for a selection of feature\nsignals that the oscillations can be reconstructed with LISA, employing a\nmethod based on principal component analysis.

For a sharp feature we\ndistinguish between the contributions to the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground induced during inflation and in the post-inflationary period, which\npeak at different frequencies. We find that for the latter case the amplitude\nof the oscillation is expected to be measurable with $< 10\\%$ accuracy if the\ncorresponding peak satisfies $h^2 \\Omega_\\textrm{GW} \\gtrsim\n10^{-12}$-$10^{-11}$, while for inflationary-era gravitational waves a\ndetection of the oscillations requires a higher peak amplitude of $h^2\n\\Omega_\\textrm{GW}$, as the oscillations only appear on the UV tail of the\nspectrum.

By\ndirectly affecting the BH mass and spin, superradiance can lead to a time\nevolution of the BH shadow, which nonetheless has been argued to be\nunobservable through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) over realistic\nobservation timescales. We revisit the superradiance-induced BH shadow\nevolution including the competing effects of gas accretion and gravitational\nwave (GW) emission and, as a first step towards modelling realistic new physics\nscenarios which predict the existence of multiple ultra-light species, we study\nthe system in the presence of two ultra-light bosons, whose combined effect\ncould help reducing the shadow evolution timescale. We find that accretion and\nGW emission play a negligible role in our results (justifying previous\nsimplified analyses), and that contrary to our intuition the inclusion of an\nadditional ultra-light boson does not shorten the BH shadow evolution timescale\nand hence improve detection prospects. However, we point out an important\nsubtlety concerning the observationally meaningful definition of the\nsuperradiance-induced BH shadow evolution timescale, which reduces the latter\nby about an order of magnitude, opening up the possibility of observing the\nsuperradiance-induced BH shadow evolution with upcoming VLBI arrays, provided\nangular resolutions just below the $\\mu{\\rm as}$ level can be reached.

Unlike the standard perturbative approach, in which\ndynamical friction arises from the LBK torque due to pure resonances, this\nalternative, complementary view nicely illustrates how a massive perturber\nsignificantly changes the energies and angular momenta of field particles on\nnear-resonant orbits, with friction arising from an imbalance between particles\nthat gain energy and those that lose energy. We treat dynamical friction in a\nspherical host system as a restricted three-body problem. This treatment is\napplicable in the `slow' regime, in which the perturber sinks slowly and the\nstandard perturbative framework fails due to the onset of non-linearities.\nHence it is especially suited to investigate the origin of core-stalling: the\ncessation of dynamical friction in central constant-density cores. We identify\nthree different families of near-co-rotation-resonant orbits that dominate the\ncontribution to dynamical friction. Their relative contribution is governed by\nthe Lagrange points (fixed points in the co-rotating frame). In particular, one\nof the three families, which we call Pac-Man orbits because of their appearance\nin the co-rotating frame, is unique to cored density distributions. When the\nperturber reaches a central core, a bifurcation of the Lagrange points\ndrastically changes the orbital make-up, with Pac-Man orbits becoming dominant.\nIn addition, due to relatively small gradients in the distribution function\ninside a core, the net torque from these Pac-Man orbits becomes positive\n(enhancing), thereby effectuating a dynamical buoyancy. We argue that core\nstalling occurs where this buoyancy is balanced by friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

In this tutorial, we\nprovide a pedagogical introduction to known results about the entanglement\nentropy of subsystems of typical pure states and of typical pure Gaussian\nstates. They both exhibit a leading term that scales with the volume of the\nsubsystem, when smaller than one half of the volume of the system, but the\nprefactor of the volume law is fundamentally different. It is constant (and\nmaximal) for typical pure states, and it depends on the ratio between the\nvolume of the subsystem and of the entire system for typical pure Gaussian\nstates. Since particle-number conservation plays an important role in many\nphysical Hamiltonians, we discuss its effect on typical pure states and on\ntypical pure Gaussian states. We prove that while the behavior of the leading\nvolume-law terms does not change qualitatively, the nature of the subleading\nterms can change. In particular, subleading corrections can appear that depend\non the square root of the volume of the subsystem. We unveil the origin of\nthose corrections.

In contrast to simpler assembly\nmotifs -- spheres, cylinders, layers -- TPN assemblies require molecules to\noccupy variable local domain shapes, confounding attempts to understand their\nformation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid (DG) network phase of block\ncopolymer (BCP) melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system, by using a\ngeometric formulation of the strong stretching theory (SST) of BCP melts. The\ntheory establishes the direct link between molecular BCP packing,\nthermodynamics of melt assembly and the {\\it medial map}, a generic geometric\nmeasure of the center of complex shapes. We show that \"medial packing\" is\nessential for thermodynamic stability of DG in strongly-segregated melts,\nreconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and\nfinite-segregation theories, corroborating our SST predictions at\nfinite-segregation via self-consistent field calculations. Additionally, we\nfind a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of DG stability on the\nelastic asymmetry, the comparative entropic stiffness of matrix-forming to\ntubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable DG --\nintermediate to competitor lamellar and columnar phases -- widens both for\nlarge and small elastic asymmetry, seemingly overturning the heuristic view\nthat packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study\ndemonstrates utility of geometric optimization of {\\it medial tesselations} for\nunderstanding in soft-molecular assembly. As such, the particular medial-based\napproach deployed here is readily generalizable to study packing frustration\nfar beyond the case of DG morphologies in neat BCP assemblies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 19:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Since event cameras can capture\napparent motion with a high temporal resolution, several attempts have explored\nthe potential of events for guiding deblurring. These methods generally assume\nthat the exposure time is the same as the reciprocal of the video frame rate.\nHowever, this is not true in real situations, and the exposure time might be\nunknown and dynamically varies depending on the video shooting\nenvironment(e.g., illumination condition). In this paper, we address the\nevent-guided motion deblurring assuming dynamically variable unknown exposure\ntime of the frame-based camera.

Our understanding of the\nrelationship between the failures of them remains incomplete. We sought to\nimprove this understanding through computational modeling of force in these\nsoft tissues. The impact of PTT and ligament tears on force changes in the\nremaining ligaments was investigated using a previously validated finite\nelement model of the foot. The ability of the PTT to restore foot alignment in\na collapsed foot was evaluated by increasing the PTT force in a foot with\nattenuated ligaments and comparing the alignment angles to the intact foot.\nRupture of any one of the ligaments led to overloading the remaining ligaments,\nexcept for the plantar naviculocuneiform, first plantar tarsometatarsal, and\nspring ligaments, where removing one led to unloading the other two. The\nattenuation of the plantar fascia, long plantar, short plantar, and spring\nligaments significantly overloaded the deltoid and talocalcaneal ligaments.\nIsolated PTT rupture had no effect on foot alignment, but did increase the\nforce in the deltoid and spring ligaments. Increasing the force within the PTT\nto 30% of body weight was effective at restoring foot alignment during quiet\nstance, primarily through reducing hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction as\nopposed to improving arch height. The attenuation of any one ligament often\nleads to overload of the remaining ligaments which may lead to progressive\ndegeneration. The PTT can maintain alignment in the collapsing foot, but at an\nincreased load which could lead to its injury. Early intervention, in the form\nof ligament repair or reconstruction, might be used to prevent the progression\nof deformity. Moreover, strengthening the PTT through therapeutic exercise\nmight improve its ability to restore foot alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 20:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

As an effect of\nthe instability, the FRB radiation intensity develops sheets perpendicular to\nthe direction of the wind magnetic field.

Our\nresults do not support the occurrence of a runaway melting process proposed by\nLuan and Goldreich (2017). In our study, the strong dependence of conductive\nloss on shell thickness stabilizes the thermal state of Enceladus's ice shell.\nOur study implies that thermal runaway (if it occurred) or episodic heating on\nEnceladus is unlikely to originate from librations of the ice shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 21:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

These reactions,\nhowever, suffer from sluggish kinetics due to a low local concentration of\nradicals around the electrocatalyst. A large electrode potential can enhance\nthe fuel generation efficiency via enhancing the radical concentration around\nthe electrocatalyst sites, but this comes at the cost of electricity. Here, we\nreport about a 45 percent saving in energy to achieve an electrochemical\nhydrogen generation rate of 10 mA per cm2 through localized electric\nfield-induced enhancement in the reagent concentration (LEFIRC) at\nlaser-induced periodic surface structured (LIPSS) electrodes. The finite\nelement model is used to simulate the spatial distribution of the electric\nfield to understand the effects of LIPSS geometric parameters in field\nlocalization. When the LIPSS patterned electrodes are used as substrates to\nsupport Pt-C and RuO2 electrocatalysts, the overpotentials for HER and OER are\ndecreased by 40 and 25 percent, respectively. Moreover, the capability of the\nLIPSS-patterned electrodes to operate at significantly reduced energy is also\ndemonstrated in a range of electrolytes including alkaline, acidic, neutral,\nand seawater. Importantly, when two LIPSS patterned electrodes were assembled\nas the anode and cathode into a cell, it requires 330 mVs of lower electric\npotential with enhanced stability over a similar cell made of pristine\nelectrodes to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2.

Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly\ninterpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely\nrelated? Are they narrow or broad matches? Are they associated in some other\nway? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented,\nleading to incorrect assumptions and making them hard to use in scenarios that\nrequire a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction).\nAlso, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to\ncombine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones.\n  The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) addresses these\nproblems by: 1. Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to\ndescribe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in\nmappings explicit. 2. Defining an easy to use table-based format that can be\nintegrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or\nquery ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data standards. 3.\nImplementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows designed to\nevolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping\npractices. 4.

The famous Birkhoff Conjecture states that if the billiard boundary has\nan inner neighborhood foliated by closed caustics, then the billiard is an\nellipse. It was studied by many mathematicians, including H.Poritsky, M.Bialy,\nS.Bolotin, A.Mironov, V.Kaloshin, A.Sorrentino and others. In the paper we\nstudy its following generalized dual version stated by S.Tabachnikov. Consider\na closed smooth strictly convex curve $\\gamma\\subset\\mathbb{RP}^2$ equipped\nwith a dual billiard structure: a family of non-trivial projective involutions\nacting on its projective tangent lines and fixing the tangency points. Suppose\nthat its outer neighborhood admits a foliation by closed curves (including\n$\\gamma$) such that the involution of each tangent line permutes its\nintersection points with every leaf. Then $\\gamma$ and the leaves are conics\nforming a pencil. We prove positive answer in the case, when the curve $\\gamma$\nis $C^4$-smooth and the foliation admits a rational first integral. To this\nend, we show that each $C^4$-smooth germ $\\gamma$ of planar curve carrying a\nrationally integrable dual billiard structure is a conic and classify all the\nrationally integrable dual billiards on (punctured) conic. They include the\ndual billiards induced by pencils of conics, two infinite series of exotic dual\nbilliards and five more exotic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 22:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 13:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 16:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 21:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Such data publication schemes implicitly assume that all data analysts\nand users have the same data access privilege levels. However, it is not\napplicable for the scenario that data users often have different levels of\naccess to the same data, or different requirements of data utility. The\nmulti-level privacy requirements for different authorization levels pose new\nchallenges for private data publication. Traditional PPDP mechanisms only\npublish one perturbed and private data copy satisfying some privacy guarantee\nto provide relatively accurate analysis results. To find a good tradeoff\nbetween privacy preservation level and data utility itself is a hard problem,\nlet alone achieving multi-level data utility on this basis. In this paper, we\naddress this challenge in proposing a novel framework of data publication with\ncompressive sensing supporting multi-level utility-privacy tradeoffs, which\nprovides differential privacy. Specifically, we resort to compressive sensing\n(CS) method to project a $n$-dimensional vector representation of users' data\nto a lower $m$-dimensional space, and then add deliberately designed noise to\nsatisfy differential privacy. Then, we selectively obfuscate the measurement\nvector under compressive sensing by adding linearly encoded noise, and provide\ndifferent data reconstruction algorithms for users with different authorization\nlevels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ML-DPCS yields\nmulti-level of data utility for specific users at different authorization\nlevels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 23:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data\ntowards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.\nThe complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution\nitself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current\nSGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex\ndenoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on\nconnections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped\nLangevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior\nperformance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended\nspace, where the auxiliary variables can be considered \"velocities\" that are\ncoupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel\nscore matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn\nthe score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,\nan easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new\nsampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We\nfind that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar\nnetwork architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel\nsampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama.

We also propose\na software-based crosstalk detection protocol that efficiently and successfully\ncharacterizes the hardware's suitability for multi-programming. We found a\ntrade-off between the success rate and execution time of the multi-programming.\nThis would be attractive not only to quantum computer service but also to users\naround the world who want to run algorithms of suitable scale on NISQ\nprocessors that have recently attracted great attention and are being\nenthusiastically investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 01:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

By\nlinearly restricting high-dimensional maps to informed reduced bases of the\ninputs, one can compress high-dimensional maps in a constructive way that can\nbe used to detect appropriate basis ranks, equipped with rigorous error\nestimates. A scalable neural network learning framework is thus to learn the\nnonlinear compressed reduced basis mapping.

Due to the enhanced density\nof states, the Coulomb interaction induces a variety of instabilities. The most\nprominent occur at integer filling and are therefore commonly attributed to\nspontaneous polarization of the moir\\'e unit cell's `flavor' degrees of freedom\n-- spin, valley, and the flat-band degeneracy. As the dominant member of the\nhierarchy, these correlated states are thought to crucially determine further\ninstabilities at lower energy scales, such as superconductivity and weaker\nincompressible states at fractional filling. In this work, we examine the\nbehavior of twisted trilayer graphene in a window of twist angle around\n$1.3^{\\circ}$, well below the expected magic angle of $1.55^{\\circ}$. In this\nsmall twist angle regime, we find surprisingly narrow bands, which are\npopulated with both an abundance of correlation-driven states at fractional\nfilling as well as robust superconductivity. The absence of linear-in-$T$\nresistivity without significant reduction of the superconducting transition\ntemperature, provides insights into the origin of both phenomena. Most\nremarkably, the hierarchy between integer and fractional filling is absent,\nindicating that flavor polarization does not play a governing role. The\nprominence of fractional filling in the small twist angle regime also points\ntowards a longer-range effective Coulomb interaction. Combined, our results\nshed new light on outstanding questions in the field, while establishing the\nsmall twist angle regime as a new paradigm for exploring novel flavors of\nmoir\\'e physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 02:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 20:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

As such, only first-order derivative is\nrequired in the loss functions, hence the method is applicable to a much larger\nclass of problems, e.g. problems with non-smooth solutions.

In this study, we investigated\nthe effects of cavitation and near-critical fluid on soundwaves using the\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Lennard-Jones fluids. In the first-order\nliquid-to-gas transition region (far from the critical point), the waveform\ndoes not continuously change with the temperature and source oscillation\namplitude owing to the discontinuous change in the density due to the phase\ntransition. Meanwhile, in the continuous transition region (crossing near the\ncritical point), the waveform continuously varies with temperature regardless\nof the amplitudes because phase separation is not involved in this region. The\ndensity fluctuations increase as the amplitude increases; however, it does not\naffect the waveform. Thus, we clarified that the first-order and continuous\ntransitions have different impacts on soundwaves. Moreover, we determined the\nacoustic characteristics, such as attenuation and nonlinear parameters, by\ncomparing the results of the numerical solution of Burgers' equation and MD\nsimulation. Burgers' equation clearly describes the soundwave phenomenon until\nphase separation or bubble formation occurs. In the continuous transition\nregion, the attenuation parameters tend to diverge, reflecting a critical\nanomaly trend.

This paper aims to derive a general expression for SEFD of a\npolarimetric tripole interferometer. The derivation makes only two basic and\nreasonable assumptions. First, the noise under consideration is zero mean and\nwhen expressed in complex phasor domain, has independent and identically\ndistributed (iid) real and imaginary components. Correlated and non-identically\ndistributed noise sources are allowed as long as the real and imaginary\ncomponents remain iid. Second, the system noise is uncorrelated between the\nelements separated by a baseline distance. The SEFD expression is derived from\nfirst principles, that is the standard deviation of the noisy flux estimate in\na target direction due to system noise. The resulting SEFD expression is\nexpressed as a simple matrix operation that involves a mixture of the system\ntemperatures of each antenna and the Jones matrix elements. It is not limited\nto tripoles, but rather, fully extensible to multipole antennas; it is not\nlimited to mutually orthogonal antennas. To illustrate the usefulness of the\nexpression and how the formula is applied, we discuss an example calculation\nbased on a tripole interferometer on lunar orbit for ultra-long wavelengths\nobservation. We compared the SEFD results based on a formula assuming short\ndipoles and the general expression. As expected, the SEFDs converge at the\nultra-long wavelengths where the dipoles are well-approximated as short\ndipoles. The general SEFD expression can be applied to any multipole antenna\nsystems with arbitrary shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 04:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The gravimetric weight\ncontent of hydrogen is 8.84 %, which exceeds the target value of 6.5 wt % H by\nthe department of energy (DoE) of the United States.

In this study, we\nreveal that this difficulty can be overcome with an ultrahigh-frequency\nwireless QCM biosensor. The sensitivity of a QCM biosensor dramatically\nimproves by thinning the quartz resonator, which also makes the resonance\nfrequency higher, causing high-speed surface movement. Contaminants weakly\n(nonspecifically) interact with the quartz surface, and they fail to follow the\nfast surface movement and cannot be detected as the loaded mass. The targets\nare, however, tightly captured by the receptor proteins immobilized on the\nsurface, and they can move with the surface, contributing to the loaded mass\nand decreasing the resonant frequency.

Such ML-based attacks\nhave triggered the development of learning-resilient locking techniques. The\nmost advanced state-of-the-art deceptive MUX-based locking (D-MUX) and the\nsymmetric MUX-based locking techniques have recently demonstrated resilience\nagainst existing ML-based attacks. Both defense techniques obfuscate the design\nby inserting key-controlled MUX logic, ensuring that all the secret inputs to\nthe MUXes are equiprobable.\n  In this work, we show that these techniques primarily introduce local and\nlimited changes to the circuit without altering the global structure of the\ndesign. By leveraging this observation, we propose a novel graph neural network\n(GNN)-based link prediction attack, MuxLink, that successfully breaks both the\nD-MUX and symmetric MUX-locking techniques, relying only on the underlying\nstructure of the locked design, i.e., in an oracle-less setting. Our trained\nGNN model learns the structure of the given circuit and the composition of\ngates around the non-obfuscated wires, thereby generating meaningful link\nembeddings that help decipher the secret inputs to the MUXes. The proposed\nMuxLink achieves key prediction accuracy and precision up to 100% on D-MUX and\nsymmetric MUX-locked ISCAS-85 and ITC-99 benchmarks, fully unlocking the\ndesigns.

The proposed approach is based on the\nconstruction of sub-barrier certificates for each stochastic agent via a set of\ndata collected from its trajectories while providing an a-priori guaranteed\nconfidence on the data-driven estimation. In our proposed setting, we first\ncast the original collision risk problem for each agent as a robust\noptimization program (ROP). Solving the acquired ROP is not tractable due to an\nunknown model that appears in one of its constraints. To tackle this\ndifficulty, we collect finite numbers of data from trajectories of each agent\nand provide a scenario optimization program (SOP) corresponding to the original\nROP. We then establish a probabilistic bridge between the optimal value of SOP\nand that of ROP, and accordingly, we formally construct the sub-barrier\ncertificate for each unknown agent based on the number of data and a required\nlevel of confidence.

We address this problem\nfor the lower back and abdominal musculature, through a novel dry electrodes\nbelt, multi-channel high density EMG circuitry and problem-specific signal\nprocessing. The subject can easily strap the dry electrodes belt around himself\nwhich provides 16 EMG channels. Interferences from the ECG and motion artefacts\nare reduced by a stationary wavelet decomposition. Afterwards, an inter-channel\nfilter is applied to increase the robustness of the signals. Subject\nmeasurements during different kinds of typical abdominal and lower back\ntraining exercises were performed wearing the novel dry electrodes belt.

The\nadditional information obtained via the multi-channel EMG circuitry and spatial\noversampling can be used to address current problems of EMG applications.

To maintain both task-agnostic and\ntask-specific knowledge in our pruned model, we propose ContrAstive Pruning\n(CAP) under the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning.

In the presence of\nderivative self-interaction of a scalar field and its kinetic coupling to the\nEinstein tensor, the gravitational friction to inflaton dynamics is enhanced.\nAs a result, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is suppressed. We place the\nobservational constraints on a natural inflation model and show that the model\nis now consistent with the observational data for some plausible range of the\nmodel parameter $\\Delta$, mainly due to the suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio.\nTo be consistent with the data at the $1\\sigma$ ($68\\%$ confidence) level, a\nslightly longer $N_k\\gtrsim60$ duration of inflation than usually assumed is\npreferred. Since the duration of inflation, for any specific inflaton\npotential, is related to reheating parameters, including the duration $N_{re}$,\ntemperature $T_{re}$, and equation-of-state $\\omega_{re}$ parameter during\nreheating, we imposed the effects of reheating to the inflationary predictions\nto put further constraints.

Many clustering problems are $\\mathsf{APX}$-hard but admit\npolynomial time $O(1)$-approximation algorithms. Thus, it is a natural question\nwhether we can maintain $O(1)$-approximate solutions for them in subpolynomial\nupdate time, against adaptive and oblivious adversaries. Only a few results are\nknown that give partial answers to this question.

We\nconsider a ride-sourcing market where a mixture of AVs and human drivers is\ndeployed by the platform to provide mobility-on-demand services under labor\nregulations. In this market, the ride-sourcing platform determines the spatial\nprices, fleet size, human driver payments, and vehicle relocation strategies to\nmaximize its profit, while individual passengers choose between different\ntransport modes to minimize their travel costs. A market equilibrium model is\nproposed to capture the interactions among passengers, human drivers, AVs, and\nthe ride-sourcing platform over the network. The overall problem is formulated\nas a non-convex program with network constraints, and an algorithm is developed\nto derive its approximate solution with performance guarantee. Our study shows\nthat ride-sourcing platform prioritizes AV deployment in high-demand areas to\nmake a higher profit. As AVs flood into these high-demand areas, they compete\nwith human drivers in the urban core and push them to relocate to suburbs. This\nleads to reduced earning opportunities for human drivers and increased spatial\ninequity for passengers. We also show that placing a wage floor may protect\ndrivers from the negative impact of AVs, and meanwhile the total vehicle supply\nand passenger demand are almost unaffected. However, there exists a threshold\nbeyond which the minimum wage will trigger a paradigm shift of labor supply\nwhere the platform will completely replace all human drivers with AVs. This\nindicates that the minimum wage should be carefully designed in the mixed\nenvironment to avoid the loss of job opportunities for human drivers. These\nresults are validated with realistic case studies for San Francisco.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 08:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The second is transmission-termination\ncontrol by the server for which the optimal policy is shown to exhibit a\nthreshold structure. Specifically, the transmission is stopped when the\nincremental uncertainty reduction by further feature transmission is outweighed\nby its communication cost. The indices of the selected features and\ntransmission decision are fed back to the device in each slot. The optimal\npolicy is first derived for the tractable case of linear classification and\nthen extended to the more complex case of classification using a convolutional\nneural network. Both Gaussian and fading channels are considered. Experimental\nresults are obtained for both a statistical data model and a real dataset. It\nis seen that ProgressFTX can substantially reduce the communication latency\ncompared to conventional feature pruning and random feature transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 09:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

However, scheduling workflow applications in mobile edge-cloud\nsystems is challenging due to computational heterogeneity, changing latencies\nof mobile devices and the volatile nature of workload resource requirements.

It does not\nconsider how many filters to reserve for each layer is the most reasonable\nchoice. From this perspective, we propose a new filter pruning method by\nsearching the proper number of filters (SNF).

In particular, we present the physical foundations of\nmagneto-electronic hydrogen sensors and we critically overview their advantages\nand disadvantages for applications in the vital areas of the safety of\nhydrogen-powered cars and hydrogen fuelling stations as well as hydrogen\nconcentration meters, including those operating directly inside\nhydrogen-fuelled fuel cells. We believe that this review will be of interest to\na broad readership, also facilitating the translation of research results into\npolicy and practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 11:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

To address this issue, in this paper we take a different\nperspective. Instead of focusing on improving the optimizer, we work on the\nlevel of optimization model and propose a meta multi-objectivization (MMO)\nmodel that considers an auxiliary performance objective (e.g., throughput in\naddition to latency). What makes this model unique is that we do not optimize\nthe auxiliary performance objective, but rather use it to make\nsimilarly-performing while different configurations less comparable (i.e.\nPareto nondominated to each other), thus preventing the search from being\ntrapped in local optima.

The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) has\nobtained precise photometry in twelve specially designed filters for large\nnumbers of Galactic stars. Deriving their precise stellar atmospheric\nparameters and individual elemental abundances is crucial for studies of\nGalactic structure, and the assembly history and chemical evolution of our\nGalaxy.

Our goal is to estimate not only stellar parameters (effective\ntemperature, Teff, surface gravity, log g, and metallicity, [Fe/H]), but also\n[{\\alpha}/Fe] and four elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and\n[Ca/Fe]) using data from J-PLUS DR1.

On the one hand,\nbuilding roads in villages may increase connectivity, boost employment, and\nlead to better living standards, reducing criminal activities. On the other\nhand, if the benefits of roads are non-uniformly distributed among villagers,\nit may lead to higher inequality and possibly higher crime. We empirically test\nthe relationship using the two waves of the Indian Human Development Survey. We\nuse an instrumental variable estimation strategy and observe that building\nroads in rural parts of India has reduced crime. The findings are robust to\nrelaxing the strict instrument exogeneity condition and using alternate\nmeasures. On exploring the pathways, we find that improved street lighting,\nbetter public bus services and higher employment are a few of the direct\npotential channels through which road infrastructure impedes crime. We also\nfind a negative association between villages with roads and various types of\ninequality measures confirming the broad economic benefits of roads. Our study\nalso highlights that the negative impact of roads on crime is more pronounced\nin states with weaker institutions and higher income inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 11:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In\nthis paper, we address the problem of reconstructing HR images from raw burst\nsequences acquired from a modern handheld device. The central idea is a\nkernel-guided strategy which can solve the burst SR problem with two steps:\nkernel estimation and HR image restoration. The former estimates burst kernels\nfrom raw inputs, while the latter predicts the super-resolved image based on\nthe estimated kernels. Furthermore, we introduce a pyramid kernel-aware\ndeformable alignment module which can effectively align the raw images with\nconsideration of the blurry priors.

In contrast, epidemic modelling of marine ecosystems is a\nbit behind, and compartmental models have been introduced only recently. One of\nthe reasons is that many epidemic processes in terrestrial ecosystems can be\ndescribed through a contact process, while modelling marine epidemics is more\nsubtle in many cases. Here we present a model describing disease outbreaks\ncaused by parasites in bivalve populations. The SIRP model is a\nmulticompartmental model with four compartments, three of which describe the\ndifferent states of the host, susceptible (i.e. healthy), S, infected, I, and\nremoved (dead), R, and one compartment for the parasite in the marine medium,\nP, written as a 4-dimensional dynamical system. Even if this is the simplest\nmodel one can write to describe this system, it is still too complicated for\nboth direct analytical manipulation and direct comparison with experimental\nobservations, as it depends on four parameters to be fitted. We show that it is\npossible to simplify the model, including a reduction to the standard SIR model\nif the parameters fulfil certain conditions. The model is validated with\navailable data for the recent Mass Mortality Event of the noble pen shell Pinna\nnobilis, a disease caused by the parasite Haplosporidium pinnae, showing that\nthe reduced SIR model is able to fit the data. So, we show that a model in\nwhich the species that suffers the epidemics (host) cannot move, and contagion\noccurs through parasites, can be reduced to the standard SIR model that\nrepresents epidemic transmission between mobile hosts. The fit indicates that\nthe assumptions made to simplify the model are reasonable in practice, although\nit leads to an indeterminacy in three of the original parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

This paper presents a novel non-iterative algorithm\nfor the quasi-dynamic energy flow calculation. The kernel of the proposed\nalgorithm is to transform these nonlinear equations into linear recursive ones,\nby solving which, we obtain explicit closed-form solutions of unknown\nvariables. In each step, the proposed algorithm requires only one matrix\nfactorization and fixed times of arithmetic operations regardless of the\nloading levels, so that it achieves small and consistent per-step time costs. A\nsemi-discrete scheme is used in PDE solution to avoid dissipative and\ndispersive errors that are often overlooked in previous literature. To ensure\nconvergence, we also propose to control the temporal step sizes adaptively by\nestimating the simulation errors. Case studies showed that the proposed method\nmanifested efficient and robust time performance compared with the iterative\nalgorithms, and meanwhile preserved high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 02:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 03:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

However, due to the\nintrinsic high-DoF structure, the joint states of the articulated objects are\nhard to be estimated. To model articulated objects, two kinds of shape\ndeformations namely the geometric and the pose deformation should be\nconsidered. In this work, we present a novel category-specific parametric\nrepresentation called Object Model with Articulated Deformations (OMAD) to\nexplicitly model the articulated objects. In OMAD, a category is associated\nwith a linear shape function with shared shape basis and a non-linear joint\nfunction. Both functions can be learned from a large-scale object model dataset\nand fixed as category-specific priors. Then we propose an OMADNet to predict\nthe shape parameters and the joint states from an object's single observation.\nWith the full representation of the object shape and joint states, we can\naddress several tasks including category-level object pose estimation and the\narticulated object retrieval. To evaluate these tasks, we create a synthetic\ndataset based on PartNet-Mobility.

In many applications, tables occur not in\nisolation, but embedded in, or linked to unstructured text. Often, a question\nis best answered by matching its parts to either table cell contents or\nunstructured text spans, and extracting answers from either source. This leads\nto a new space of TextTableQA problems that was introduced by the HybridQA\ndataset. Existing adaptations of table representation to transformer-based\nreading comprehension (RC) architectures fail to tackle the diverse modalities\nof the two representations through a single system. Training such systems is\nfurther challenged by the need for distant supervision. To reduce cognitive\nburden, training instances usually include just the question and answer, the\nlatter matching multiple table rows and text passages. This leads to a noisy\nmulti-instance training regime involving not only rows of the table, but also\nspans of linked text. We respond to these challenges by proposing MITQA, a new\nTextTableQA system that explicitly models the different but closely-related\nprobability spaces of table row selection and text span selection.

Existing approaches usually first embed the identities as\ndeterministic vectors in a shared latent space, and then learn a classifier\nbased on the available annotations. However, the formation and characteristics\nof real-world social platforms are full of uncertainties, which makes these\ndeterministic embedding based methods sub-optimal. In addition, it is\nintractable to collect sufficient linkage annotations due to the tremendous\ngaps between different platforms. Semi-supervised models utilize the unlabeled\ndata to help capture the intrinsic data distribution, which are more promising\nin practical usage. However, the existing semi-supervised linkage methods\nheavily rely on the heuristically defined similarity measurements to\nincorporate the innate closeness between labeled and unlabeled samples. Such\nmanually designed assumptions may not be consistent with the actual linkage\nsignals and further introduce the noises. To address the mentioned limitations,\nin this paper we propose a novel Noise-aware Semi-supervised Variational User\nIdentity Linkage (NSVUIL) model. Specifically, we first propose a novel\nsupervised linkage module to incorporate the available annotations. Each social\nidentity is represented by a Gaussian distribution in the Wasserstein space to\nsimultaneously preserve the fine-grained social profiles and model the\nuncertainty of identities. Then, a noise-aware self-learning module is designed\nto faithfully augment the few available annotations, which is capable of\nfiltering noises from the pseudo-labels generated by the supervised module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 13:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

To automatically identify biased\nlanguage, we present an exploratory approach that compares the context of\nrelated words. We train two word embedding models, one on texts of left-wing,\nthe other on right-wing news outlets. Our hypothesis is that a word's\nrepresentations in both word embedding spaces are more similar for non-biased\nwords than biased words. The underlying idea is that the context of biased\nwords in different news outlets varies more strongly than the one of non-biased\nwords, since the perception of a word as being biased differs depending on its\ncontext. While we do not find statistical significance to accept the\nhypothesis, the results show the effectiveness of the approach. For example,\nafter a linear mapping of both word embeddings spaces, 31% of the words with\nthe largest distances potentially induce bias.

To acquire the spatial signal characteristics from the\nthorax, multiple electrodes are commonly used. Displacements of electrodes\naffect the signal morphologies and can lead to incorrect diagnoses. For\nquantitative analysis of these effects we propose the usage of a numerical\ncomputer simulation. In order to create a realistic representation of the human\nthorax including the heart and lung a three-dimensional model with a simplified\ngeometry is used. The electrical excitation of the heart is modelled on a\ncellular level via the bidomain approach. To numerically solve the differential\nequations, describing the signal propagation within the body, we use the finite\nelement method in COMSOL Multiphysics. The spatial gradients of the simulated\nbody potentials are calculated to determine placement sensitivity maps. The\nsimulated results show that the sensitivity is different for each considered\npoint in time of each ECG wave. In general, the impact of displacement is\nincreased as an electrode is more closely located to the signal source.\nHowever, in some specific regions associated with differential ECG leads the\nplacement sensitivity distribution deviates from this simple circular pattern.\nThe results provide useful information to enhance the understanding of placed\nspecific effects on classical ECG features.

The way media frames events can significantly alter the beliefs and\nperceptions of our society. Nevertheless, nearly all media outlets are known to\nreport news in a biased way. While such bias can be introduced by altering the\nword choice or omitting information, the perception of bias also varies largely\ndepending on a reader's personal background. Therefore, media bias is a very\ncomplex construct to identify and analyze. Even though media bias has been the\nsubject of many studies, previous assessment strategies are oversimplified,\nlack overlap and empirical evaluation. Thus, this study aims to develop a scale\nthat can be used as a reliable standard to evaluate article bias. To name an\nexample: Intending to measure bias in a news article, should we ask, \"How\nbiased is the article?\" or should we instead ask, \"How did the article treat\nthe American president?\". We conducted a literature search to find 824 relevant\nquestions about text perception in previous research on the topic. In a\nmulti-iterative process, we summarized and condensed these questions\nsemantically to conclude a complete and representative set of possible question\ntypes about bias. The final set consisted of 25 questions with varying\nanswering formats, 17 questions using semantic differentials, and six ratings\nof feelings. We tested each of the questions on 190 articles with overall 663\nparticipants to identify how well the questions measure an article's perceived\nbias. Our results show that 21 final items are suitable and reliable for\nmeasuring the perception of media bias.

It is suspected that given the quality of currently\navailable data, certain model parameters, such as coronal power law photon\nindex and parameters determining the morphology of the AGN torus, may be poorly\nconstrained due to model degeneracies. In this work, we test the reliability of\nthese models in terms of recovery of parameters and the ability to discern the\nmorphology of the torus using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectral data. We perform\nextensive simulations of X-ray spectra of Compton-thick AGNs under six X-ray\nspectral models of the torus. We use Bayesian methods to investigate degeneracy\nbetween model parameters, distinguish models and determine the dependence of\nthe parameter constraints on the instruments used. For typical exposure times\nand fluxes for nearby Compton-thick AGN, we find that several parameters across\nthe models used here cannot be well constrained, e.g., the distribution of\nclouds, the number of clouds in the radial direction, even when the applied\nmodel is correct.

However, GO fails at caustics such as\ncutoffs and focal points, erroneously predicting the wave intensity to be\ninfinite. This is a critical shortcoming of GO, since the caustic wave\nintensity is often the quantity of interest, e.g. RF heating. Full-wave\nmodeling can be used instead, but the computational cost limits the speed at\nwhich such optimizations can be performed. We have developed a less expensive\nalternative called metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO). Instead of evolving\nwaves in the usual $\\textbf{x}$ (coordinate) or $\\text{k}$ (spectral)\nrepresentation, MGO uses a mixed $\\textbf{X} \\equiv \\textsf{A}\\textbf{x} +\n\\textsf{B}\\textbf{k}$ representation.

Their\nlinear response to a step strain displays a fast, near-exponential relaxation\nwhen using low valence crosslinkers, while larger supramolecular crosslinkers\nbring about much slower dynamics involving a wide distribution of time scales\nwhose physical origin is still debated. Here, we propose a model where the\nrelaxation of polymer gels in the dilute regime originate from elementary\nevents in which the bonds connecting two neighboring crosslinkers all\ndisconnect. Larger crosslinkers allow for a greater average number of bonds\nconnecting them, but also generate more heterogeneity. We characterize the\nresulting distribution of relaxation time scales analytically, and accurately\nreproduce stress relaxation measurements on metal-coordinated hydrogels with a\nvariety of crosslinker sizes including ions, metal-organic cages, and\nnanoparticles. Our approach is simple enough to be extended to any crosslinker\nsize and could thus be harnessed for the rational design of complex\nviscoelastic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:12:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 15:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 08:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 17:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The accretion process can transform a seed black\nhole into a final scalarized or bald black hole, depending on the initial\nparameter of the scalar field $p$. There is a critical parameter $p_{\\ast}$ and\nnear it all intermediate solutions are attracted to a critical solution and\nstay there for a time scaling as $T\\propto-\\gamma\\ln|p-p_{\\ast}|$. At late\ntimes, the solutions evolve into scalarized black holes if $p>p_{\\ast}$, or\nbald black holes if $p<p_{\\ast}$.

It has been conjectured that the existence\nof a suitable linear time-invariant (LTI) O'Shea-Zames-Falb multiplier is not\nonly sufficient but also necessary. Roughly speaking, a successful proof of the\nconjecture would require: (a) a conic parameterization of a set of multipliers\nthat describes exactly the set of nonlinearities, (b) a lossless S-procedure to\nshow that the non-existence of a multiplier implies that the Lurye system is\nnot uniformly robustly stable over the set of nonlinearities, and (c) the\nexistence of a multiplier in the set of multipliers used in (a) implies the\nexistence of an LTI multiplier. We investigate these three steps, showing the\ncurrent bottlenecks for proving this conjecture. In addition, we provide an\nextension of the class of multipliers which may be used to disprove the\nconjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

It is not a trivial task, as we need to consider\nboth intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies. However,\nexisting works are designed for specific scenarios, and require much domain\nknowledge and expert efforts, which is difficult to transfer between different\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose a scale-aware neural architecture search\nframework for MTS forecasting (SNAS4MTF). A multi-scale decomposition module\ntransforms raw time series into multi-scale sub-series, which can preserve\nmulti-scale temporal patterns. An adaptive graph learning module infers the\ndifferent inter-variable dependencies under different time scales without any\nprior knowledge. For MTS forecasting, a search space is designed to capture\nboth intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies at each time\nscale. The multi-scale decomposition, adaptive graph learning, and neural\narchitecture search modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SNAS4MTF\nachieves a promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Previous experimental reports deal almost exclusively\nwith epitaxial, nominally undoped BP films by chemical vapor deposition. High\nhole concentrations were often observed, but it is unclear if native defects\nalone can be responsible for it. Besides, the feasibility of alternative\ndeposition techniques has not been clarified and optical characterization is\ngenerally lacking. In this work, we demonstrate reactive sputtering of\namorphous BP films, their partial crystallization in a P-containing annealing\natmosphere, and extrinsic doping by C and Si. We obtain the highest hole\nconcentration reported to date for p-type BP ($5 \\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nusing C doping under B-rich conditions.

In this\ncalculation, only the Fab-Fab and Fab-Fc attractive pair interactions are\neffective. The confinement is formed by the randomly distributed hard-spheres\nfixed in space. The spherical obstacles, besides the size exclusion, also\ninteract by the Yukawa attractive interaction with with each bead of the\nantibody molecule. We applied the combination of the scaled-particle theory,\nWertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory and the Flory-Stockmayer theory to\ncalculate: (i) the liquid-liquid phase separation, and (ii) the percolation\nthreshold.

One of the predominant\napproaches is to mimic first-order methods by means of some gradient estimator.\nThe theoretical limitations are well-understood, yet, as most of these methods\nrely on finite-differencing for shrinking differences, numerical cancellation\ncan be catastrophic. The numerical community developed an efficient method to\novercome this by passing to the complex domain. This approach has been recently\nadopted by the optimization community and in this work we analyze the\npractically relevant setting of dealing with computational noise. To exemplify\nthe possibilities we focus on the strongly-convex optimization setting and\nprovide a variety of non-asymptotic results, corroborated by numerical\nexperiments, and end with local non-convex optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 09:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 13:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 11:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Combining mapping rules and functions represents\na powerful formalism to specify pipelines for integrating data into a knowledge\ngraph transparently.

However, current\nfabrication technology is mostly constraint to 2D lithography, and thermal\nenergy dissipation induced by switching electronic signal lines presents a\nfundamental challenge for truly 3D electronic integration. Photonics reduces\nthis problem, and direct laser writing of a photoresin is a promising\nhigh-resolution tool for 3D photonic integration. Here, we combine one and\ntwo-photon polymerization (TPP) for waveguide integration for the first time,\ndramatically accelerating the fabrication process and increasing optical\nconfinement. 3D additive printing is based on femtosecond TPP, while blanket\nirradiation with a UV lamp induces one-photon polymerization (OPP) throughout\nthe entire 3D chip. We locally and dynamically adjust writing conditions to\nimplement (3+1)D \\emph{flash}-TPP: waveguide cores are printed with a small\ndistance between neighboring writing voxels to ensure smooth interfaces,\nmechanical support structures are printed at maximal distance between the\nvoxels to speed up the process. Finally, the entire chip's \\emph{passive}\nvolume not part of waveguide cores or mechanical support is polymerized in a\nsingle instance by UV blanket irradiation. This decouples fabrication time from\nthe passive volume's size. We succeed in printing vertical single-mode\nwaveguides of 6~mm length that reach up to NA = 0.16. Noteworthy, we achieve\nexceptionally low -0.26 dB injection and very low propagation losses of -1.36\ndB/mm, which is within one order of magnitude of standard integrated silicon\nphotonics. Finally, the optical performance of our waveguides does not\ndeteriorate during 120 days within our measurement uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In this work, the oral fluid was studied both\nfrom the point of view of a participant in the transmission of infection and as\na model for studying the rheology of viscoelastic fluids. The method is based\non video recording of the stretching of a drop of the test liquid between the\nlegs of the tweezers and the subsequent spontaneous thinning of the formed\ncapillary filament of the liquid. The process is controlled by the competition\nof forces of inertia, elasticity, capillarity.

Following numerous experiments on the subject,\nthree significant factors have been determined: lens focal length, pulse energy\nand the lens-to-sample distance. These factors were employed to analyze the\nspectral intensity, plasma temperature and electron density in the local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and optically thin condition. Due to the\nshielding effects of mixed plasma, the strongest spectral intensity can be\nobtained in the pre-focused case rather than on the focus, no matter how much\nbeam irradiance was employed. The more intensive the beam irradiance is, the\nmore the optimal position is distant from the focal point. Similarly, the\nevolution of plasma temperature and electron density was shown a peak in the\npre-focused case, which is consistent with the trend of spectral intensity. For\nthe case of extremely high irradiance (on the focus), the shielding effects\nbecome more apparent and the resultant above three factors decreased sharply.\nWhen a longer-focal-length lens was employed, the spectral intensity exhibited\nan obvious bimodal trend.
