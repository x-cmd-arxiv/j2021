We discuss how to bring the Hamiltonian into\na form suitable for the implementation of the Nekhoroshev theorem in the\nversion given by P\\\"oschel(1993) for the `non-resonant' regime. The\nmanipulation of the Hamiltonian includes i) averaging over fast angles, ii) a\nsuitable expansion around reference values for the orbit's eccentricity and\ninclination, and iii) a preliminary normalization allowing to eliminate\nparticular terms whose existence is due to the non-zero inclination of the\ninvariant plane of secular motions known as the `Laplace plane'.

Recently, in deep learning, the Transformer shows the\npotential to exploit the long-range dependency in speech by self-attention.\nTherefore, it is introduced in speech enhancement to improve the speech\nestimation accuracy from a noise mixture. However, to address the computational\ncost issue in Transformer with self-attention, the axial attention is the\noption i.e., to split a 2D attention into two 1D attentions. Inspired by the\naxial attention, in the proposed method we calculate the attention map along\nboth time- and frequency-axis to generate time and frequency sub-attention\nmaps. Moreover, different from the axial attention, the proposed method\nprovides two parallel multi-head attentions for time- and frequency-axis.\nFurthermore, it is proven in the literature that the lower frequency-band in\nspeech, generally, contains more desired information than the higher\nfrequency-band, in a noise mixture. Therefore, the frequency-band aware\nattention is proposed i.e., high frequency-band attention (HFA), and low\nfrequency-band attention (LFA). The U-shaped Transformer is also first time\nintroduced in the proposed method to further improve the speech estimation\naccuracy. The extensive evaluations over four public datasets, confirm the\nefficacy of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 19:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Perhaps the most\nversatile manifestation of magnetic monopoles as quasiparticles in matter has\nbeen in so-called spin ice materials. There, they represent violations of the\nice rule, carry a magnetic charge, and can move freely unbound. Spin ice\nemergent magnetic monopoles appear at the atomic scale in rare earth\npyrochlores or at the nano-scale in artificial spin ices systems.

To fill this gap, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack\nmethod against health risk prediction models named MedAttacker to investigate\ntheir vulnerability.

Using these two scenarios, we have tried to establish a link\nbetween scaffold micromechanics and its macroscopic mechanical properties. We\nhave demonstrated that the macroscopic elastic modulus of fibrous scaffold is\ndependent on the sample shape, size and the degree of fiber fusion. Under\nmicroscopic loading conditions the deformation of the fibrous scaffolds is\nanisotropic with an orientation dependent decay with distance. Further, we\nexplored the stiffness sensing under the conditions of fixed stress or fixed\nstrain application by the cells.

During the\nfitting process, these models learn mostly the desired visual content first,\nand then pick up the potential modeling and observational noise, i.e.,\noverfitting. Thus, the practicality of DIP often depends critically on good\nearly stopping (ES) that captures the transition period. In this regard, the\nmajority of DIP works for vision tasks only demonstrates the potential of the\nmodels -- reporting the peak performance against the ground truth, but provides\nno clue about how to operationally obtain near-peak performance without access\nto the groundtruth. In this paper, we set to break this practicality barrier of\nDIP, and propose an efficient ES strategy, which consistently detects near-peak\nperformance across several vision tasks and DIP variants. Based on a simple\nmeasure of dispersion of consecutive DIP reconstructions, our ES method not\nonly outpaces the existing ones -- which only work in very narrow domains, but\nalso remains effective when combined with a number of methods that try to\nmitigate the overfitting.

For (ordinary) signatures, we focus on the arguably\npreferable security notion of blind-unforgeability recently proposed by Alagic\net al. (Eurocrypt'20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this\nnotion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of\nSIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with\nsuper-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable\nschemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature,\nand both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.\n  For ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21)\nproposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the\nsigner. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the\nclassical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring\nsignatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves\n(even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only\nconduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose\na new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is\nan analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover,\nassuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any\nblind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our\ndefinition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 21:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Instead of directly excluding the\ndetected NLOS satellites from further positioning estimation, this paper\nrectifies the pseudorange measurement model by (1) correcting the pseudorange\nmeasurements if the reflecting point of NLOS signals is detected inside the\nsliding window map, and (2) remodeling the uncertainty of the NLOS pseudorange\nmeasurement using a novel weighting scheme. We evaluated the performance of the\nproposed method in several typical urban canyons in Hong Kong using an\nautomobile-level GNSS receiver. Moreover, we also evaluate the potential of the\nproposed NLOS mitigation method in GNSS and inertial navigation systems\nintegration via factor graph optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 01:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of\nequivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU) transformations was\nproposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in 2D\nfermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other\nhand, the physical picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super\npivotal categories give rise to a generic mathematical framework to describe\nfermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular, it has been\npointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the\nso-called q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic\ntheories. In this paper, we generalize the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to\ninclude those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon excitations. We\nargue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are\ncharacterized by a set of tensors\n$(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\\alpha\\beta}_{kln,\\chi\\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$,\nwhich satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase\nfactors $\\Xi^{ijm,\\alpha\\beta}_{kl}$, $\\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\\chi\\delta}$,\n$\\Omega^{kim,\\alpha\\beta}_{jl}$ and $\\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\\chi\\delta}$.

In this paper, we\nexplore how to efficiently build NMT models in an FL setup by proposing a novel\nsolution. In order to reduce the communication overhead, out of all neural\nlayers we only exchange what we term \"Controller\" layers. Controllers are a\nsmall number of additional neural components connected to our pre-trained\narchitectures. These new components are placed in between original layers. They\nact as liaisons to communicate with the central server and learn minimal\ninformation that is sufficient enough to update clients.\n  We evaluated the performance of our models on five datasets from different\ndomains to translate from German into English. We noted that the models\nequipped with Controllers preform on par with those trained in a central and\nnon-FL setting. In addition, we observed a substantial reduction in the\ncommunication traffic of the FL pipeline, which is a direct consequence of\nusing Controllers. Based on our experiments, Controller-based models are ~6\ntimes less expensive than their other peers. This reduction is significantly\nimportant when we consider the number of parameters in large models and it\nbecomes even more critical when such parameters need to be exchanged for\nmultiple rounds in FL settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 03:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

The\naim of this study was to assess the impact of weight loss and cardiometabolic\nimprovement following bariatric surgery on brain health, as measured by change\nin brain age estimated based on voxel-based morphometry (VBM).

To address this problem, we present\nan extensible framework for deciding the threat level of cryptographic misuse\nin Android apps. Firstly, we propose a general and unified specification for\nrepresenting cryptographic misuses to make our framework extensible and develop\nadapters to unify the detection results of the state-of-the-art cryptographic\nmisuse detectors, resulting in an adapter-based detection tool chain for a more\ncomprehensive list of cryptographic misuses.

To make the per-app assessment more useful for app\nvetting at the app-store level, we apply unsupervised learning to predict and\nclassify the top risky threats to guide more efficient subsequent mitigation.\nIn the experiments on an instantiated implementation of the framework, we\nevaluate the accuracy of our detection and the effect of data-flow-driven risk\nassessment of our framework.

The running time of an algorithm that computes the measure plays a\nvery small role in an offline setting, for example, when the classifier is\nbeing developed by a researcher. However, the running time becomes more crucial\nif our goal is to monitor the performance of a classifier over time.\n  In this paper we study three algorithms for maintaining two measures. The\nfirst algorithm maintains area under the ROC curve (AUC) under addition and\ndeletion of data points in $O(\\log n)$ time. This is done by maintaining the\ndata points sorted in a self-balanced search tree. In addition, we augment the\nsearch tree that allows us to query the ROC coordinates of a data point in\n$O(\\log n)$ time. In doing so we are able to maintain AUC in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nOur next two algorithms involve in maintaining $H$-measure, an alternative\nmeasure based on the ROC curve.

Existing single image RS rectification\nmethods attempt to account for these distortions by either using algorithms\ntailored for specific class of scenes which warrants information of intrinsic\ncamera parameters or a learning-based framework with known ground truth motion\nparameters. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for the\nchallenging task of single image RS rectification. Our network consists of a\nmotion block, a trajectory module, a row block, an RS rectification module and\nan RS regeneration module (which is used only during training). The motion\nblock predicts camera pose for every row of the input RS distorted image while\nthe trajectory module fits estimated motion parameters to a third-order\npolynomial. The row block predicts the camera motion that must be associated\nwith every pixel in the target i.e, RS rectified image. Finally, the RS\nrectification module uses motion trajectory and the output of row block to warp\nthe input RS image to arrive at a distortionfree image. For faster convergence\nduring training, we additionally use an RS regeneration module which compares\nthe input RS image with the ground truth image distorted by estimated motion\nparameters. The end-to-end formulation in our model does not constrain the\nestimated motion to ground-truth motion parameters, thereby successfully\nrectifying the RS images with complex real-life camera motion.

Existing methods warp the target\nimage to the reference image using the estimated warp function, and a\nhomography is one of the most commonly used warping functions. However, when\nimages have large parallax due to non-planar scenes and translational motion of\na camera, the homography cannot fully describe the mapping between two images.\nExisting approaches based on global or local homography estimation are not free\nfrom this problem and suffer from undesired artifacts due to parallax. In this\npaper, instead of relying on the homography-based warp, we propose a novel deep\nimage stitching framework exploiting the pixel-wise warp field to handle the\nlarge-parallax problem. The proposed deep image stitching framework consists of\ntwo modules: Pixel-wise Warping Module (PWM) and Stitched Image Generating\nModule (SIGMo). PWM employs an optical flow estimation model to obtain\npixel-wise warp of the whole image, and relocates the pixels of the target\nimage with the obtained warp field. SIGMo blends the warped target image and\nthe reference image while eliminating unwanted artifacts such as misalignments,\nseams, and holes that harm the plausibility of the stitched result. For\ntraining and evaluating the proposed framework, we build a large-scale dataset\nthat includes image pairs with corresponding pixel-wise ground truth warp and\nsample stitched result images. We show that the results of the proposed\nframework are qualitatively superior to those of the conventional methods,\nespecially when the images have large parallax.

However, a major\ndisadvantage of existing methods is the need for paired data; i.e. sharpblur\nimage pairs of the same scene, which is a complicated and cumbersome\nacquisition procedure. Additionally, due to strong supervision on loss\nfunctions, pre-trained models of such networks are strongly biased towards the\nblur experienced during training and tend to give sub-optimal performance when\nconfronted by new blur kernels during inference time. To address the above\nissues, we propose unsupervised domain-specific deblurring using a\nscale-adaptive attention module (SAAM). Our network does not require supervised\npairs for training, and the deblurring mechanism is primarily guided by\nadversarial loss, thus making our network suitable for a distribution of blur\nfunctions. Given a blurred input image, different resolutions of the same image\nare used in our model during training and SAAM allows for effective flow of\ninformation across the resolutions. For network training at a specific scale,\nSAAM attends to lower scale features as a function of the current scale.\nDifferent ablation studies show that our coarse-to-fine mechanism outperforms\nend-to-end unsupervised models and SAAM is able to attend better compared to\nattention models used in literature.

The set\nof equations describing the temporal development of the fluid impulse has an\nintegro-differential character where the terms representing the effect of\nstratification appear as convolution integral of the component of the fluid\nimpulse and time-depended 'memory' functions. These functions are calculated\nfor the case where the external parallel shear flow varies only in the\ndirection gravitational force and is subjected to localized two- and\nthree-dimensional disturbances. As follows from the solution of evolution\nequations, in both cases there is a range of Richardson numbers where the fluid\nimpulse associated with the disturbance grows exponentially. The upper limit of\nthis range for two- and three-dimensional cases are Ri ~ 1.23 and Ri ~ 0.89.\nBoth cases are also characterized by a critical value of the Richardson number\n(around Ri ~ 0.3 for both cases), beyond which the solution exhibits\noscillatory behavior. Indeed, this oscillatory behavior has been observed in\nturbulent flows and, as is shown in the present study, it is an inherent\nfeature of a non-wavy localized vortex embedded in a stably stratified shear\nflow.

However, conducting efficient driving policy testing faces\ntwo key challenges. On the one hand, the probability of naturally encountering\nhazardous scenarios is low when testing a well-trained autonomous driving\nstrategy. Thus, discovering these scenarios by purely real-world road testing\nis extremely costly. On the other hand, a proper determination of accident\nresponsibility is necessary for this task. Collecting scenarios with\nwrong-attributed responsibilities will lead to an overly conservative\nautonomous driving strategy. To be more specific, we aim to discover hazardous\nscenarios that are autonomous-vehicle responsible (AV-responsible), i.e., the\nvulnerabilities of the under-test driving policy.\n  To this end, this work proposes a Safety Test framework by finding\nAv-Responsible Scenarios (STARS) based on multi-agent reinforcement learning.\nSTARS guides other traffic participants to produce Av-Responsible Scenarios and\nmake the under-test driving policy misbehave via introducing Hazard Arbitration\nReward (HAR). HAR enables our framework to discover diverse, complex, and\nAV-responsible hazardous scenarios. Experimental results against four different\ndriving policies in three environments demonstrate that STARS can effectively\ndiscover AV-responsible hazardous scenarios. These scenarios indeed correspond\nto the vulnerabilities of the under-test driving policies, thus are meaningful\nfor their further improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 08:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

If a variable\nname and the value stored in the variable do not match, then the program\nsuffers from a name-value inconsistency, which is due to one of two situations\nthat developers may want to fix: Either a correct value is referred to through\na misleading name, which negatively affects code understandability and\nmaintainability, or the correct name is bound to a wrong value, which may cause\nunexpected runtime behavior. Finding name-value inconsistencies is hard because\nit requires an understanding of the meaning of names and knowledge about the\nvalues assigned to a variable at runtime. This paper presents Nalin, a\ntechnique to automatically detect name-value inconsistencies. The approach\ncombines a dynamic analysis that tracks assignments of values to names with a\nneural machine learning model that predicts whether a name and a value fit\ntogether.

A classical analysis gives the main result: an explicit\nmetric (joined to the exterior) for the collapse. The metric then provides the\ncausal structure: light cones corresponding to the coordinate speed of light,\nc. If the problem is perturbed from a pure dustball collapse, the solution can\nonly be altered within the future light cones of such perturbations.\n  The metric tells us that c_{interior} << c_{exterior}. Importantly, the speed\nat which the Schwarzschild radius shrinks during evaporation is intermediate\nbetween the two. Thus a perturbation at the (shrinking) surface will only\ninfluence the exterior in finite time. For example, if we assume evaporation to\nbe a process located at the dustball's surface, we can model it as a series of\nperturbations to the classical solution. In this modified solution, the\ninterior is not altered as the evaporation process eats into a frozen interior\nfrom the outside in; the singularity and a region near it are no longer\npresent; infalling particles don't cross the (shrinking) dustball boundary; the\nmetric coefficients don't change sign with time, and therefore timelike world\nlines can exist at constant radius inside the (shrinking) Schwarzschild radius\nand emerge at late times (no absolute horizon forms).\n  Research on evaporation alongside collapse typically study collapsing shells\nand apply quantum field theory.

Confidence bands can be then used to detect abnormal time\nseries, not just individual observations within the time series. We will show\nthat despite being an NP-hard problem it is possible to find optimal confidence\nband for some $k$.

By mapping a truncated numerical\noptimization algorithm into a network with a fixed number of phases, recent\ndeep unfolding networks (DUNs) for spectral snapshot compressive sensing (SCI)\nhave achieved remarkable success. However, DUNs are far from reaching the scope\nof industrial applications limited by the lack of cross-phase feature\ninteraction and adaptive parameter adjustment. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Hyperspectral Explicable Reconstruction and Optimal Sampling deep Network\nfor SCI, dubbed HerosNet, which includes several phases under the\nISTA-unfolding framework. Each phase can flexibly simulate the sensing matrix\nand contextually adjust the step size in the gradient descent step, and\nhierarchically fuse and interact the hidden states of previous phases to\neffectively recover current HSI frames in the proximal mapping step.\nSimultaneously, a hardware-friendly optimal binary mask is learned end-to-end\nto further improve the reconstruction performance. Finally, our HerosNet is\nvalidated to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on both simulation and\nreal datasets by large margins.

Improving the\nautomated fault diagnosis methods using data and machine learning-based models\nis a central aspect of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD). A major challenge in\nIFD is to develop realistic datasets with accurate labels needed to train and\nvalidate models, and to transfer models trained with labeled lab data to\nheterogeneous process industry environments. However, fault descriptions and\nwork-orders written by domain experts are increasingly digitised in modern\ncondition monitoring systems, for example in the context of rotating equipment\nmonitoring. Thus, domain-specific knowledge about fault characteristics and\nseverities exists as technical language annotations in industrial datasets.\nFurthermore, recent advances in natural language processing enable weakly\nsupervised model optimisation using natural language annotations, most notably\nin the form of natural language supervision (NLS). This creates a timely\nopportunity to develop technical language supervision (TLS) solutions for IFD\nsystems grounded in industrial data, for example as a complement to\npre-training with lab data to address problems like overfitting and inaccurate\nout-of-sample generalisation. We surveyed the literature and identify a\nconsiderable improvement in the maturity of NLS over the last two years,\nfacilitating applications beyond natural language; a rapid development of weak\nsupervision methods; and transfer learning as a current trend in IFD which can\nbenefit from these developments. Finally we describe a general framework for\nTLS and implement a TLS case study based on SentenceBERT and contrastive\nlearning based zero-shot inference on annotated industry data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 18:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 08:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

The boundary element method (BEM) is appealing for lossy\nconductor modeling because it can capture the frequency-dependent variation of\nskin depth with only a surface-based discretization of the structure.\nConventional BEM formulations rely on the mutual coupling of electric and\nmagnetic fields, and can become inaccurate or unstable at low frequencies. We\ndevelop a new full-wave BEM formulation based on potentials which can\naccurately model lossy conductors from exactly DC to very high frequencies. A\nnew set of simple boundary conditions is proposed along with a modified Lorenz\ngauge to ensure that the proposed formulation has a stable condition number\ndown to DC. Moreover, coupling the potential-based integral equations to a\ncircuit model allows the straightforward extraction of network parameters.\nRealistic numerical examples at both the chip and package level demonstrate the\naccuracy and stability of the proposed method from DC to high frequencies,\nbeyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art BEM formulations based on fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

However,\nin this paper, we propose a parallel PageRank algorithm which can take\nadvantage of these special vertices. For this end, we firstly interpret\nPageRank from the information transmitting perspective and give a constructive\ndefinition of PageRank. Then, based on the information transmitting\ninterpretation, a parallel PageRank algorithm which we call the Information\nTransmitting Algorithm(ITA) is proposed. We prove that the dangling vertices\ncan increase ITA's convergence rate and the unreferenced vertices and weak\nunreferenced vertices can decrease ITA's calculations.

In this case, two different challenges arise: (1)\npreserving high quality performance on warm items, while (2) learning to\npromote cold items to relevant users. First, we show that these two objectives\nare in fact conflicting, and the balance between them depends on the business\nneeds and the application at hand.

Other than the accuracy objective, display diversity on the homepage\nis also important since homogeneous display usually hurts user experience. In\nthis paper, we propose a two-stage architecture of the homepage recommendation\nsystem. In the first stage, we develop efficient algorithms for recommending\nitems to proper channels while maintaining diversity.
