However, most of the\ncritical scenes of traffic accidents are extremely dynamic and previously\nunseen, which seriously harm the performance of semantic segmentation methods.\nIn addition, the delay of the traditional camera during high-speed driving will\nfurther reduce the contextual information in the time dimension. Therefore, we\npropose to extract dynamic context from event-based data with a higher temporal\nresolution to enhance static RGB images, even for those from traffic accidents\nwith motion blur, collisions, deformations, overturns, etc. Moreover, in order\nto evaluate the segmentation performance in traffic accidents, we provide a\npixel-wise annotated accident dataset, namely DADA-seg, which contains a\nvariety of critical scenarios from traffic accidents. Our experiments indicate\nthat event-based data can provide complementary information to stabilize\nsemantic segmentation under adverse conditions by preserving fine-grained\nmotion of fast-moving foreground (crash objects) in accidents. Our approach\nachieves +8.2% performance gain on the proposed accident dataset, exceeding\nmore than 20 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.

We focus on systems of three planets orbiting the\nprimary star and estimate the timescale for instability finding that it scales\nwith the keplerian period for systems that have the same ratio between inner\nplanet and binary semimajor axes. An empirical formula is also derived from\nsimulations to estimate how the the binary eccentricity affects the extent of\nthe stability region. The presence of the secondary star affects the Planet\nPlanet scattering outcomes causing a broadening of the final distribution in\nsemimajor axis of the inner planet as some of the orbital energy of the planets\nis absorbed by the companion star. Repeated approaches to the secondary star\ncauses also a significant reduction in the frequency of surviving two planet\nsystems in particular for larger values of the inner planet semimajor axis. The\nformation of Kozai states with the companion star increases the number of\nplanets which may be tidally circularized. To predict the possible final\ndistribution of planets in binaries we have performed a large number of\nsimulations where the initial semimajor axis of the inner planets is chosen\nrandomly.

The XL algorithm (XL for short) is a major approach for solving\nthe $\\mathcal MQ$ problem with linearization over a coefficient field.\nFurthermore, the hybrid approach with XL (h-XL) is a variant of XL guessing\nsome variables beforehand. In this paper, we present a variant of h-XL, which\nwe call the polynomial XL (PXL). In PXL, the whole $n$ variables are divided\ninto $k$ variables to be fixed and the remaining $n-k$ variables as \"main\nvariables\", and we generate the Macaulay matrix with respect to the $n-k$ main\nvariables over a polynomial ring of the $k$ variables. By eliminating some\ncolumns of the Macaulay matrix over the polynomial ring before guessing $k$\nvariables, the amount of manipulations required for each guessed value can be\nreduced. Our complexity analysis indicates that PXL is efficient on the system\nwith $n \\approx m$. For example, on systems over ${\\mathbb F}_{2^8}$ with\n$n=m=80$, the number of manipulations required by the hybrid approaches with XL\nand Wiedemann XL and PXL is estimated as $2^{252}$, $2^{234}$, and $2^{220}$,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 16:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

However, the existing vision-based\npedestrian detection algorithms still have two limitations that restrict their\nimplementations, those being real-time performance as well as the resistance to\nthe impacts of environmental factors, e.g., low illumination conditions.

We use HyDRo to assess the\nchemical constraints which can be placed on rocky exoplanet atmospheres using\nJWST. Firstly, we identify the best currently-known rocky exoplanet candidates\nfor spectroscopic observations in thermal emission with JWST, finding >30 known\nrocky exoplanets whose thermal emission will be detectable by JWST/MIRI in\nfewer than 10 eclipses at R~10.

Considering a range of CO_2- to H_2O-rich atmospheric compositions, we find\nthat as few as 8 eclipses of LHS 3844 b or GJ 1132 b with MIRI will be able to\nplace important constraints on the chemical compositions of their atmospheres.\nThis includes confident detections of CO_2 and H_2O in the case of a cloud-free\nCO_2-rich composition, besides ruling out a bare rock scenario.

HyDRo will allow important atmospheric\nconstraints for rocky exoplanets using JWST observations, providing clues about\ntheir geochemical environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 17:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

This algorithmic problem\nasks whether a given tile system uniquely assembles a specific assembly.

Moreover, the problem of echo chambers\nis connected to other pertinent issues like political polarization and the\nspread of misinformation. An echo chamber is defined as a network of users in\nwhich users only interact with opinions that support their pre-existing beliefs\nand opinions, and they exclude and discredit other viewpoints. This survey aims\nto examine the echo chamber phenomenon on social media from a social computing\nperspective and provide a blueprint for possible solutions.

While it is immensely challenging to mitigate\ninternal biases, there has been great efforts seeking to mitigate the bias of\nrecommender systems.

Consequently, in the delay period between the cue and\nthe response the monkey must maintain a memory of cue location.\nElectrophysiological recordings from the prefrontal area of the cortex (PFC)\nrevealed neurons that display selective persistent activity: their firing rate\nchange induced by the cue persists through delay period, but only in response\nto a confined range of cue locations. This suggests that the representation of\nthe cue is maintained in the network by a change in network activity profile.\nIn this work, we study a network of rate-model neurons that is capable of\npreserving information about a past input, owing to structured connectivity and\nnonlinearities in the neuronal transfer function (TFs). Particularly, we focus\non the acceleration of the TF close to firing threshold and the concavity\naround TF saturation.

In addition, this mechanism\nenables the erasure of memory at the end of the delay by a global excitatory\nsignal.

If trained with standard first-order methods most models\nforget previously learned tasks when trained on a new task, which is often\nreferred to as catastrophic forgetting. A popular approach to overcome\nforgetting is to regularize the loss function by penalizing models that perform\npoorly on previous tasks. For example, elastic weight consolidation (EWC)\nregularizes with a quadratic form involving a diagonal matrix build based on\npast data. While EWC works very well for some setups, we show that, even under\notherwise ideal conditions, it can provably suffer catastrophic forgetting if\nthe diagonal matrix is a poor approximation of the Hessian matrix of previous\ntasks. We propose a simple approach to overcome this: Regularizing training of\na new task with sketches of the Jacobian matrix of past data. This provably\nenables overcoming catastrophic forgetting for linear models and for wide\nneural networks, at the cost of memory. The overarching goal of this paper is\nto provided insights on when regularization-based continual learning algorithms\nwork and under what memory costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 18:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

During inference, BLT first generates a draft layout from\nthe input and then iteratively refines it into a high-quality layout by masking\nout low-confident attributes. The masks generated in both training and\ninference are controlled by a new hierarchical sampling policy. We verify the\nproposed model on six benchmarks of diverse design tasks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate two benefits compared to the state-of-the-art layout transformer\nmodels. First, our model empowers layout transformers to fulfill controllable\nlayout generation. Second, it achieves up to 10x speedup in generating a layout\nat inference time than the layout transformer baseline.

Distinct features of Fano resonances in\ncontrast with conventional symmetric resonances have found several applications\nin photonics such as optical switching, sensing, lasing, and nonlinear and\nslow-light devices. Therefore, it is important to have control over the\ngeneration of these resonances. In this work, we show through ab initio\nsimulations of coupled light-matter systems that Fano interference phenomena\ncan be realized in a multimode photonic environment by strong coupling to the\nelectromagnetic continuum. Specifically, we show that by effectively enhancing\nthe light-matter coupling strength to the photon continuum in an experimentally\nfeasible way, we can achieve a transition from Lorentzian to Fano lines shapes\nfor both electronic and polaritonic excitations. An important outcome of\nswitching between these spectral signatures is the possibility to control the\nPurcell enhancement of spontaneous emission alongside electromagnetically\ninduced transparency which is a special case of Fano resonances. Switching from\nFano back to a Lorentzian profile can be achieved by physically reducing the\ncoupling strength to the continuum of modes. Our results hold potential for\nrealizing tunable Fano resonances of molecules and materials interacting with\nthe electromagnetic continuum within multimode photonic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 18:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

In the scenario in which the axion is born after\ninflation, its field develops significant inhomogeneity and evolves in a highly\nnonlinear fashion. Understanding the eventual abundance and distribution of\naxionic dark matter in this scenario therefore requires dedicated numerical\nsimulations. So far the community has focused its efforts on simulations of the\nQCD axion, a model that predicts a specific temperature dependence for the\naxion mass. Here, we go beyond the QCD axion, and perform a suite of\nsimulations over a range of possible temperature dependencies labelled by a\npower-law index. We study the complex dynamics of the axion field, including\nthe scaling of cosmic strings and domain walls, the spectrum of\nnon-relativistic axions, the lifetime and internal structure of axitons, and\nthe seeds of miniclusters. In particular, we quantify how much the string-wall\nnetwork contributes to the dark matter abundance as a function of how quickly\nthe axion mass grows. We find that a temperature-independent model produces\n25\\% more dark matter than the standard misalignment calculation. In contrast\nto this generic ALP, QCD axion models are almost six times less efficient at\nproducing dark matter.

The most widely used evaluation metric for object detection is\nAverage Precision (AP), which captures the performance of localization and\nclassification sub-tasks simultaneously. However, due to the non-differentiable\nnature of the AP metric, traditional object detectors adopt separate\ndifferentiable losses for the two sub-tasks. Such a mis-alignment issue may\nwell lead to performance degradation. To address this, existing works seek to\ndesign surrogate losses for the AP metric manually, which requires expertise\nand may still be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose Parameterized AP Loss,\nwhere parameterized functions are introduced to substitute the\nnon-differentiable components in the AP calculation. Different AP\napproximations are thus represented by a family of parameterized functions in a\nunified formula. Automatic parameter search algorithm is then employed to\nsearch for the optimal parameters. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark\nwith three different object detectors (i.e., RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and\nDeformable DETR) demonstrate that the proposed Parameterized AP Loss\nconsistently outperforms existing handcrafted losses.

One way to bridge the gap between verifiability and\nimplementation is to use \"interactions\" between a prover and a verifier. By\nleveraging cryptographic functions, such protocols enable the classical\nverifier to enforce consistency in a quantum prover's responses across multiple\nrounds of interaction. In this work, we demonstrate the first implementation of\nan interactive quantum advantage protocol, using an ion trap quantum computer.\nWe execute two complementary protocols -- one based upon the learning with\nerrors problem and another where the cryptographic construction implements a\ncomputational Bell test. To perform multiple rounds of interaction, we\nimplement mid-circuit measurements on a subset of trapped ion qubits, with\nsubsequent coherent evolution. For both protocols, the performance exceeds the\nasymptotic bound for classical behavior; maintaining this fidelity at scale\nwould conclusively demonstrate verifiable quantum advantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 02:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

However, as yet, these methods do not work for\nintermediate scale resolutions whereby sinks are more massive compared to\nindividual stars but do not fully sample the IMF. In this paper, we introduce\nthe grouped star formation prescription, whereby sinks are first grouped\naccording to their positions, velocities, and ages, then stars are formed by\nsampling the IMF using the mass of the groups. We test our grouped star\nformation method in simulations of various physical scales, from sub-parsec to\nkilo-parsec, and from static isolated clouds to colliding clouds. With suitable\ngrouping parameters, this star formation prescription can form stars that\nfollow the IMF and approximately mimic the original stellar distribution and\nvelocity dispersion. Each group has properties that are consistent with a\nstar-forming region.

We show that radial velocity measurements for 1000\nindividual stars can constrain the mass contained within the effective radius\nof a dSph to within 5%. This is consistent with constraints extracted from\ncurrent observational data. We demonstrate that a minimum sample of 100,000\n(10,000) stars with both radial and proper motions measurements is required to\ndistinguish between a cusped or cored inner slope at the 2-sigma (1-sigma)\nlevel. If using the log-slope measured at the half-light radius as a proxy for\ndifferentiating between a core or cusp slope, only 1000 line-of-sight and\nproper motions measurements are required, however, we show this choice of\nradius does not always unambiguously differentiate between core and cusped\nprofiles. Once observational errors are below half the value of the intrinsic\ndispersion, improving the observational precision yields little change in the\ndensity profile uncertainties.

Type I outbursts occur each orbital period while type II outbursts\nhave a period and duration that are not related to any periodicity of the\nbinary system. Type II outbursts may be caused by mass transfer to the neutron\nstar from a highly eccentric Be star disk. A sufficiently misaligned Be star\ndecretion disk undergoes secular Von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations of\neccentricity and inclination. Observations show that in some systems the type\nII outbursts come in pairs with the second being of lower luminosity. We use\nnumerical hydrodynamical simulations to explore the dynamics of the highly\nmisaligned disk that forms around the neutron star as a consequence of mass\ntransfer from the Be star disk. We show that the neutron star disk may also be\nZLK unstable and that the eccentricity growth leads to an enhancement in the\naccretion rate onto the neutron star that lasts for several orbital periods,\nresembling a type II outburst. We suggest that in a type II outburst pair, the\nfirst outburst is caused by mass transfer from the eccentric Be star disk while\nthe second and smaller outburst is caused by the eccentric neutron star disk.\nWe find that the timescale between outbursts in a pair may be compatible with\nthe observed estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 19:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Gate set tomography is a characterization approach that\nsimultaneously and self-consistently extracts a tomographic description of the\nimplementation of an entire set of quantum gates, as well as the initial state\nand measurement, from experimental data. Obtaining such a detailed picture of\nthe experimental implementation is associated with high requirements on the\nnumber of sequences and their design, making gate set tomography a challenging\ntask even for only two qubits.\n  In this work, we show that low-rank approximations of gate sets can be\nobtained from significantly fewer gate sequences and that it is sufficient to\ndraw them randomly.

A common feature of EHR data used for deep-learning-based\npredictions is historical diagnoses. Existing work mainly regards a diagnosis\nas an independent disease and does not consider clinical relations among\ndiseases in a visit. Many machine learning approaches assume disease\nrepresentations are static in different visits of a patient. However, in real\npractice, multiple diseases that are frequently diagnosed at the same time\nreflect hidden patterns that are conducive to prognosis. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of a disease is not static since some diseases can emerge or\ndisappear and show various symptoms in different visits of a patient. To\neffectively utilize this combinational disease information and explore the\ndynamics of diseases, we propose a novel context-aware learning framework using\ntransition functions on dynamic disease graphs. Specifically, we construct a\nglobal disease co-occurrence graph with multiple node properties for disease\ncombinations.

The\nCGNS preserves the underlying physics to a large extent and can reproduce\nintermittency, extreme events and other non-Gaussian features in many complex\nsystems arising from practical applications.

However, simulating dyes governed by convection-diffusion\npartial differential equations (PDEs) can also be a useful post-processing\nanalysis approach for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. Such\nsimulations can be used to identify the relative significance of different\nspatial subregions in particular time intervals of interest in an unsteady flow\nfield.

The friends-of-friend (FoF) algorithm has been widely\nadopted for this purpose because of its simplicity and expandability to higher\ndimensions. However, it is cost-inefficient when applied to high-resolution\nsimulations because standard FoF implementation leads to too many distance\ncalculations in dense regions. We confirm this through our exercise of applying\nthe 6-dimensional (6D) FoF galaxy finder code, VELOCIraptor (Elahi et al.\n2019), on the NewHorizon simulation (Dubois et al. 2021). The high particle\nresolution of NewHorizon ($M_{\\rm star} \\sim 10^4 M_{\\odot}$) allows a large\ncentral number density ($10^{6}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-3}$) for typical galaxies,\nresulting in a few days to weeks of galaxy searches for just one snapshot. Even\nworse, we observed a significant decrease in the FoF performance in the\nhigh-dimensional 6D searches: \"the curse of dimensionality\" problem. To\novercome these issues, we have developed several implementations that can be\nreadily applied to any tree-based FoF code. They include limiting visits to\ntree nodes, re-ordering the list of particles for searching neighbor particles,\nand altering the tree structure. Compared to the run with the original code,\nthe new run with these implementations results in the identical galaxy\ndetection with the ideal performance, $O(N \\log{N})$, $N$ being the number of\nparticles in a galaxy -- with a speed gain of a factor of 2700 in 3D or 12 in\n6D FoF search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Due to the importance of this process for the\ndevelopment of catalytic surfaces, a number of existing computational and\nexperimental approaches try to predict and control the orientation of such\nmolecules. However, and despite their own advantages, these tend to be either\ntoo expensive computationally, or oversimplified, undermining their ability to\npredict the most appropriate experimental conditions to maximize the catalytic\nactivity of adsorbed proteins. To address this current need, we present an\nefficient computational approach to model the behavior of proteins near\nsurfaces in the presence of an external electric field, based on continuum\nelectrostatics. Our model can not only estimate the overall affinity of the\nprotein with the surface, but also their most likely orientation as a function\nof the potential applied. In this way, a rational selection of the potential\ncan be performed to maximize the accessibility of the protein's active site to\nthe solvent. The model relies on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and was\nimplemented in an extension of the code PyGBe that includes an external\nelectric field, and renders the electrostatic component of the solvation free\nenergy. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, we investigate the\nadsorption of trypsin onto a carbon electrode under potentiostatic conditions\nboth numerically and experimentally.

In this work, we present a fractional order-TG (FTG) hybrid\nprior to deal with such problems, where the fractional order total variation\n(FTV) term is used to capture the detail information of the unknowns and\nsimultaneously uses the Gaussian measure to ensure that it results in a\nwell-defined posterior measure. For the numerical implementations of linear\ninverse problems in function spaces, we also propose an efficient independence\nsampler based on a transport map, which uses a proposal distribution derived\nfrom a diagonal map, and the acceptance probability associated to the proposal\nis independent of discretization dimensionality. And in order to take full\nadvantage of the transport map, the hierarchical Bayesian framework is applied\nto flexibly determine the regularization parameter. Finally we provide some\nnumerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the FTG prior and the\nefficiency and robustness of the proposed independence sampler method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 01:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

On the other hand, implicit\nrepresentations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater\nfidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting\nscalability. In this work, we endeavour to address both shortcomings with a\nnovel shape representation that allows fast differentiable rendering within an\nimplicit architecture.

Implementation of\ndifferentially private (DP) mechanisms has to be done carefully to ensure\nend-to-end security guarantees. In this paper we study two implementation flaws\nin the noise generation commonly used in DP systems. First we examine the\nGaussian mechanism's susceptibility to a floating-point representation attack.\nThe premise of this first vulnerability is similar to the one carried out by\nMironov in 2011 against the Laplace mechanism. Our experiments show attack's\nsuccess against DP algorithms, including deep learning models trained using\ndifferentially-private stochastic gradient descent.\n  In the second part of the paper we study discrete counterparts of the Laplace\nand Gaussian mechanisms that were previously proposed to alleviate the\nshortcomings of floating-point representation of real numbers. We show that\nsuch implementations unfortunately suffer from another side channel: a novel\ntiming attack. An observer that can measure the time to draw (discrete) Laplace\nor Gaussian noise can predict the noise magnitude, which can then be used to\nrecover sensitive attributes. This attack invalidates differential privacy\nguarantees of systems implementing such mechanisms.\n  We demonstrate that several commonly used, state-of-the-art implementations\nof differential privacy are susceptible to these attacks. We report success\nrates up to 92.56% for floating point attacks on DP-SGD, and up to 99.65% for\nend-to-end timing attacks on private sum protected with discrete Laplace.\nFinally, we evaluate and suggest partial mitigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 02:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 04:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 05:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

The first\napplication of mass measurement using the R3 mass spectrometer at RIBF is\nreported. Rare isotopes produced at RIBF, $^{127}$Sn, $^{126}$In, $^{125}$Cd,\n$^{124}$Ag, $^{123}$Pd, were injected in R3. Masses of $^{126}$In, $^{125}$Cd,\nand $^{123}$Pd were measured whereby the mass uncertainty of $^{123}$Pd was\nimproved. This is the first reported measurement with a new storage ring mass\nspectrometery technique realized at a heavy-ion cyclotron and employing\nindividual injection of the pre-identified rare nuclei. The latter is essential\nfor the future mass measurements of the rarest isotopes produced at RIBF.

From archival Hubble Space Telescope images, we have\ndiscovered a red, tidally-stretched star cluster positioned ~5 arcseconds (~400\npc in projection) from, and pointing toward the center of, the post-merger\nspiral galaxy NGC 4424. The star cluster, which we refer to as `Nikhuli', has a\nnear-infrared luminosity of (6.88+/-1.85)x10^6 L_{solar,F160W} and likely\nrepresents the nucleus of a captured/wedded galaxy. Moreover, from our Chandra\nX-ray Observatory image, Nikhuli is seen to contain a high-energy X-ray point\nsource, with L_{0.5-8 keV} = 6.31^{+7.50}_{-3.77}x10^{38} erg/s (90%\nconfidence). We argue that this is more likely to be an active massive black\nhole than an X-ray binary. Lacking an outward-pointing comet-like appearance,\nthe stellar structure of Nikhuli favors infall rather than the ejection from a\ngravitational-wave recoil event. A minor merger with a low-mass early-type\ngalaxy may have sown a massive black hole, aided an X-shaped pseudobulge, and\nbe sewing a small bulge. The stellar mass and the velocity dispersion of NGC\n4424 predict a central black hole of (0.6-1.0)x10^5 M_solar, similar to the\nexpected intermediate-mass black hole in Nikhuli, and suggestive of a black\nhole supply mechanism for bulgeless late-type galaxies.

For folding-based methods, their data flow is large, convergence\nspeed is slow, and they are also hard to handle the generation of non-smooth\nsurfaces. In this work, we propose AXform, an attention-based method to\ntransform latent features to point clouds. AXform first generates points in an\ninterim space, using a fully connected layer. These interim points are then\naggregated to generate the target point cloud. AXform takes both parameter\nsharing and data flow into account, which makes it has fewer outliers, fewer\nnetwork parameters, and a faster convergence speed. The points generated by\nAXform do not have the strong 2-manifold constraint, which improves the\ngeneration of non-smooth surfaces. When AXform is expanded to multiple branches\nfor local generations, the centripetal constraint makes it has properties of\nself-clustering and space consistency, which further enables unsupervised\nsemantic segmentation.

We show that our method performs significantly\nbetter than existing local outlier methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep\nbaselines. We also show that the performance of our method is much more robust\nto different settings of the local neighbourhood size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 06:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

In\nthose observations, various hyperfine components of the 2,0,2-1,0,1 rotational\ntransition, at 37.5 GHz, were detected using the Yebes 40m telescope. Here, we\nused the IRAM 30m telescope to detect ten hyperfine components of the\n5,0,5-4,0,4 rotational transition, lying at 93.6 GHz. The observed frequencies\ndiffer by 0.2 MHz with respect to the predictions from available laboratory\ndata. This difference is significant for a radioastronomical search for CH2CCH\nin interstellar sources with narrow lines. We thus included the measured\nfrequencies in a new spectroscopic analysis to provide accurate frequency\npredictions for the interstellar search for propargyl at mm wavelengths.\nMoreover, we recommend that future searches for CH2CCH in cold interstellar\nclouds are carried out at lambda 3 mm, rather than at lambda 8 mm. The\n5,0,5-4,0,4 transition is about five times more intense than the 2,0,2-1,0,1\none in TMC-1, which implies that detecting the former requires about seven\ntimes less telescope time than detecting the latter.

Consequently,\ngraph compression has become increasingly important to process such large\ngraphs without expensive I/O over the network or to disk. Among a number of\napproaches, graph summarization, which in essence combines similar nodes into a\nsupernode and describe their connectivity concisely, protrudes with several\nadvantages. However, we note that it fails to exploit pervasive hierarchical\nstructures of real-world graphs as its underlying representation model enforces\nsupernodes to be disjoint.\n  In this work, we propose the hierarchical graph summarization model, which is\nan expressive graph representation model that includes the previous one\nproposed by Navlakha et al. as a special case. The new model represents an\nunweighted graph using positive and negative edges between hierarchical\nsupernodes, each of which can contain others. Then, we propose Slugger, a\nscalable heuristic for concisely and exactly representing a given graph under\nour new model. Slugger greedily merges nodes into supernodes while maintaining\nand exploiting their hierarchy, which is later pruned. Slugger significantly\naccelerates this process by sampling, approximation, and memoization. Our\nexperiments on 16 real-world graphs show that Slugger is (a) Effective:\nyielding up to 29.6% more concise summary than state-of-the-art lossless\nsummarization methods, (b) Fast: summarizing a graph with 0.8 billion edges in\na few hours, and (c) Scalable: scaling linearly with the number of edges in the\ninput graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 08:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Since each verb is associated with a specific\nset of semantic roles, all existing GSR methods resort to a two-stage\nframework: predicting the verb in the first stage and detecting the semantic\nroles in the second stage. However, there are obvious drawbacks in both stages:\n1) The widely-used cross-entropy (XE) loss for object recognition is\ninsufficient in verb classification due to the large intra-class variation and\nhigh inter-class similarity among daily activities. 2) All semantic roles are\ndetected in an autoregressive manner, which fails to model the complex semantic\nrelations between different roles. To this end, we propose a novel SituFormer\nfor GSR which consists of a Coarse-to-Fine Verb Model (CFVM) and a\nTransformer-based Noun Model (TNM). CFVM is a two-step verb prediction model: a\ncoarse-grained model trained with XE loss first proposes a set of verb\ncandidates, and then a fine-grained model trained with triplet loss re-ranks\nthese candidates with enhanced verb features (not only separable but also\ndiscriminative). TNM is a transformer-based semantic role detection model,\nwhich detects all roles parallelly. Owing to the global relation modeling\nability and flexibility of the transformer decoder, TNM can fully explore the\nstatistical dependency of the roles. Extensive validations on the challenging\nSWiG benchmark show that SituFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art performance\nwith significant gains under various metrics.

Such cross-model\ntransferability makes it feasible to perform black-box attacks, which has\nraised security concerns for real-world DNNs applications. Nevertheless,\nexisting works mostly focus on investigating the adversarial transferability\nacross different deep models that share the same modality of input data. The\ncross-modal transferability of adversarial perturbation has never been\nexplored. This paper investigates the transferability of adversarial\nperturbation across different modalities, i.e., leveraging adversarial\nperturbation generated on white-box image models to attack black-box video\nmodels. Specifically, motivated by the observation that the low-level feature\nspace between images and video frames are similar, we propose a simple yet\neffective cross-modal attack method, named as Image To Video (I2V) attack. I2V\ngenerates adversarial frames by minimizing the cosine similarity between\nfeatures of pre-trained image models from adversarial and benign examples, then\ncombines the generated adversarial frames to perform black-box attacks on video\nrecognition models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that I2V can achieve high\nattack success rates on different black-box video recognition models. On\nKinetics-400 and UCF-101, I2V achieves an average attack success rate of 77.88%\nand 65.68%, respectively, which sheds light on the feasibility of cross-modal\nadversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 08:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Quantitative values of diffusivity and diffusion\nbarriers usually rely heavily on empirical rules. In this paper, we compute the\ndiffusion coefficients of adsorbed nitrogen atoms by combining machine-learned\ninteratomic potentials, metadynamics, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. With\nthis approach, we obtain a diffusion coefficient of nitrogen atoms on the\nsurface of amorphous solid water of merely $(3.5 \\pm\n1.1)10^{-34}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ at 10 K for a bare ice surface. Thus, we find that\nnitrogen, as a paradigmatic case for light and weakly bound adsorbates, is\nunable to diffuse on bare amorphous solid water at 10 K. Surface coverage has a\nstrong effect on the diffusion coefficient by modulating its value over 9--12\norders of magnitude at 10 K and enables diffusion for specific conditions. In\naddition, we have found that atom tunneling has a negligible effect. Average\ndiffusion barriers of the potential energy surface (2.56 kJ mol$^{-1}$) differ\nstrongly from the effective diffusion barrier obtained from the diffusion\ncoefficient for a bare surface (6.06 kJ mol$^{-1}$) and are, thus,\ninappropriate for diffusion modeling.

The main bottleneck of the GP method is to compute the inverse of a\nsquare gram matrix, whose size is proportional to the number of sample points.\nTo improve the performance, we introduce the FF method, whose insight comes\nfrom the recent trend of approximating positive definite kernels with random\nFourier features. The FF algorithm seeks approximated solutions in the space\ngenerated by sampled Fourier features. In the FF method, the size of the matrix\nto be inverted depends only on the number of Fourier features selected, which\nis much less than the size of sample points. Hence, the FF method reduces the\nprecomputation time, saves the memory, and achieves comparable accuracy to the\nGP method. We give the existence and the convergence proofs for both\nalgorithms. The convergence argument of the GP method does not depend on any\nmonotonicity condition, which suggests the potential applications of the GP\nmethod to solve MFGs with non-monotone couplings in future work.

We are unaware of the realization $G_p$,\nbut can learn if an edge $e$ exists in $G_p$ by querying it. The goal is to\nfind an approximate minimum vertex cover (MVC) of $G_p$ by querying few edges\nof $G$ non-adaptively.\n  This stochastic setting has been studied extensively for various problems\nsuch as minimum spanning trees, matroids, shortest paths, and matchings.

The result of experiments shows that on the ImageNet-1k\nclassification task, the Couplformer can significantly decrease 28% memory\nconsumption compared with regular Transformer while accessing sufficient\naccuracy requirements and outperforming 0.92% on Top-1 accuracy while occupying\nthe same memory footprint. As a result, the Couplformer can serve as an\nefficient backbone in visual tasks, and provide a novel perspective on the\nattention mechanism for researchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 10:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

This analysis includes five\nsentiment analysis datasets in Brazilian Portuguese, unified in a single\ndataset, and a reference partitioning in training, testing, and validation\nsets, both made publicly available through a digital repository. A\ncross-evaluation of dataset-specific models over different contexts is\nconducted to evaluate their generalization capabilities and the feasibility of\nadopting a unique model for addressing all scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 11:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

However, the family of homogenous sine-Gordon models\nprovides a rare example where both stable and unstable bound states are present\nin the spectrum whilst the scattering matrix is diagonal and solves the usual\nbootstrap equations. In the standard scattering picture, unstable particles\nresult from complex poles of the $S$-matrix located in the unphysical sheet of\nrapidity space. Since they are not part of the asymptotic spectrum, their\npresence is only felt through the effect they have on physical quantities\nassociated either to the theory as a whole (i.e.~scaling functions, correlation\nfunctions) or to the stable particles themselves (i.e.~energy/particle\ndensity). In two recent publications, the effect of unstable particles in\ndifferent out-of-equilibrium settings has been studied. It has been shown that\ntheir presence is associated with specific signatures in many quantities of\nphysical interest. A good way to select those quantities is to adopt the\ngeneralised hydrodynamic approach and to consider the effective velocities and\nparticle densities of the stable particles in the theory. For an initial state\ngiven by a spacial gaussian profile of temperatures peaked at the origin, time\nevolution gives rise to particle and spectral particle densities that exhibit\nhallmarks of the creation and decay of unstable particles. While these\nsignatures have been observed numerically elsewhere, this paper explores their\nquantitative and qualitative dependence on the parameters of the problem. We\nalso consider other initial states characterised by \"inverted gaussian\" and\n\"double gaussian\" temperature profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 11:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

This study compares the effectiveness of supervised, unsupervised, and\nsemi-supervised machine learning algorithms for detecting DDoS attacks in\nCPS-IoT, particularly during data transmission to and from the physical space\nto the cyber space via the Internet. The algorithms considered are broadly\ngrouped into two: i) Detection algorithms, which include Logistic Regression\n(LGR), K-Means, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We also looked into the\neffectiveness of semi-supervised hybrid learning models, which use unsupervised\nK-Means to label data, then feed the output to a supervised learning model for\nattack detection. ii.) Prediction algorithms - LGR, Kernel Ridge Regression\n(KRR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which were used to predict imminent\nattacks. Experimental tests were carried out and obtained results showed that\nthe hybrid model was able to achieve 100% accuracy with zero false positives;\nwhile all the prediction models were able to achieve over 94% attack prediction\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 12:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 14:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

One common criticism of their method is that\nthe observed data are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution.

We believe an\nMDP suitable for applying RL should contain a set of state features that are\nboth sensitive to actions and predictive in rewards. We tested our method in\nconstructed environments showing that our approach can identify certain invalid\nenvironment formulations. As far as we know, performing validity analysis for\nRL problem formulation is a novel direction. We envision that our tool will\nserve as a motivational example to help practitioners apply RL in real-world\nproblems more easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Uncertainty quantification using simulations is a useful tool to\ndesign optimum field-development and to guide decision-making. The optimization\nprocess includes assessments of multiple time-dependent flow mechanisms, which\nare functions of operational parameters subject to subsurface uncertainties.\nThis process requires careful determination of the parameter ranges,\ndependencies, and their probabilistic distribution functions. This study\npresents a new approach to assess time-dependent predictions of thermal\nrecovery and produced-enthalpy rates, including uncertainty quantification and\noptimization. We use time-continuous and multi-objective uncertainty\nquantification for geothermal recovery, undergoing a water re-injection scheme.\nThe ranges of operational and uncertainty parameters are determined from a\ncollected database, including 135 geothermal fields worldwide.

To confine the state of an oscillator\nto the cat qubit manifold, two main approaches have been considered so far: a\nKerr-based Hamiltonian confinement with high gate performances, and a\ndissipative confinement with robust protection against a broad range of noise\nmechanisms.

The bulk of the research has focused on testing\nneural-network models; but these models are defined by writing programs, and\nthere is growing evidence that these neural-network programs often have bugs\ntoo.\n  This paper presents aNNoTest: an approach to generating test inputs for\nneural-network programs. A fundamental challenge is that the dynamically-typed\nlanguages (e.g., Python) commonly used to program neural networks cannot\nexpress detailed constraints about valid function inputs (e.g., matrices with\ncertain dimensions). Without knowing these constraints, automated test-case\ngeneration is prone to producing invalid inputs, which trigger spurious\nfailures and are useless for identifying real bugs. To address this problem, we\nintroduce a simple annotation language tailored for concisely expressing valid\nfunction inputs in neural-network programs. aNNoTest takes as input an\nannotated program, and uses property-based testing to generate random inputs\nthat satisfy the validity constraints. In the paper, we also outline guidelines\nthat simplify writing aNNoTest annotations.\n  We evaluated aNNoTest on 19 neural-network programs from Islam et al's\nsurvey., which we manually annotated following our guidelines -- producing 6\nannotations per tested function on average. aNNoTest automatically generated\ntest inputs that revealed 94 bugs, including 63 bugs that the survey reported\nfor these projects. These results suggest that aNNoTest can be a valuable\napproach to finding widespread bugs in real-world neural-network programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 19:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 10:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 11:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

So, the question arises\nwhether a wide tractor-based system with section control or a small\nagricultural robot has a higher weed control performance for a given\ninfestation scenario. For example, a small autonomous robot moving from one\nweed to the next might have much shorter travel distances (and thus lower\nenergy and time costs) than a tractor-mounted system if the locations of the\nweeds are relatively isolated across the field. However, if the plants are\nhighly concentrated in small areas so-called clusters, the increased width of\nthe tractor-mounted implement could be beneficial because of shorter travel\ndistances and greater working width.\n  An additional challenge is the fact that there is no complete knowledge of\nthe weed locations. Weeds may not have been detected, for example, due to their\ngrowth stage, occlusion by other objects, or misclassification. Weed control\nstrategies must therefore also be evaluated with regard to this issue. Thus, in\naddition to the driving distance, other metrics are also of interest, such as\nthe number of plants that were actually controlled or the size of the total\ntreatment area.\n  We performed this investigation for the treatment of the toxic Colchicum\nautumnale, which had been detected in drone images of extensive grassland\nsites. In addition to real data, we generated and analyzed simulated weed\nlocations using mathematical models of stochastic geometry. These offer the\npossibility to simulate very different spatial distributions of toxic plant\nlocations. Different treatment strategies were then virtually tested on this\ndata using Monte Carlo simulations and their performance was statistically\nevaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Instead, for an isotropic and translation-invariant ray\ndistribution the traversal cost is minimized by minimizing the weight: the\ntotal boundary size of all cells in the structure.\n  We study the 2D case using triangulations as CCSPs and minimize their total\nedge length using a simulated annealing process that allows for topological\nchanges and varying vertex count. Standard Delaunay-based triangulation\ntechniques show total edge lengths ranging from 10% higher to twice as high as\nour optimized triangulations for a variety of scenes, with a similar difference\nin traversal cost when using the triangulations for ray tracing. Compared to a\nroped kd-tree, our triangulations require less traversal steps for all scenes\nthat we tested and they are robust against the kd-tree's pathological behaviour\nwhen geometry becomes misaligned with the world axes. Moreover, the stackless\ntraversal strongly outperforms a BVH, which always requires a top-down descent\nin the hierarchy. In fact, we show several scenes where the number of traversal\noperations for our triangulations decreases(!) as the number of geometric\nprimitives $N$ increases, in contrast to the increasing $\\log N$ behaviour of a\nBVH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Unauthorized reproduction of DL models can lead to\ncopyright infringement and cause huge economic losses to model owners. Existing\ncopyright protection techniques are mostly based on watermarking, which embeds\nan owner-specified watermark into the model. While being able to provide exact\nownership verification, these techniques are 1) invasive, as they need to\ntamper with the training process, which may affect the utility or introduce new\nsecurity risks; 2) prone to adaptive attacks that attempt to remove the\nwatermark; and 3) not robust to the emerging model extraction attacks. Latest\nfingerprinting work, though being non-invasive, also falls short when facing\nthe diverse and ever-growing attack scenarios.

This paper takes a\nstep towards this direction when the list size is a given constant and the\nalphabet size is large (as a function of the code length). We prove a new\nSingleton-type upper bound for list-decodable codes, which improves upon the\npreviously known bound by roughly a factor of $1/L$, where $L$ is the list\nsize.

We show the existence of equilibria\nin pure and mixed strategies depending on the probability $p$, on a concrete\nexample of the duel-truel game. We find a range of $p$ values for which the\ngame has a mixed equilibrium and the proportion of players in each strategy\ndepends on the particular value of $p$. We prove that each of these mixed\nequilibrium points are ESS. A more realistic way to study this dynamics with\nhigh-order interactions is to look at how it evolves in complex networks. We\nintroduce and study an agent-based model on a network with a fixed number of\nnodes, which evolves as the replicator equation predicts. By studying the\ndynamics of this model on random networks we find that the phase transitions\nbetween the pure and mixed equilibria depend on the probability $p$ and also on\nthe mean degree of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 15:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

However, how NSC formation mechanisms work\nin different regimes and what determines galaxy nucleation is still unclear.\nThe dissipationless accretion of infalling globular clusters (GCs) and the in\nsitu formation of stars directly at the galactic centre likely operate to grow\nNSCs in most galaxies; however, their efficiency has been difficult to assess\nobservationally.

However,\ndue to the highly complex nature of the problem, progress has been relatively\nslow. In this note, through the lens of infinite-width networks, a.k.a. neural\nkernels, we present one such principle resulting from hierarchical localities.\nIt is well-known that the eigenstructure of infinite-width multilayer\nperceptrons (MLPs) depends solely on the concept frequency, which measures the\norder of interactions. We show that the topologies from deep convolutional\nnetworks (CNNs) restructure the associated eigenspaces into finer subspaces. In\naddition to frequency, the new structure also depends on the concept space,\nwhich measures the spatial distance among nonlinear interaction terms. The\nresulting fine-grained eigenstructure dramatically improves the network's\nlearnability, empowering them to simultaneously model a much richer class of\ninteractions, including Long-Range-Low-Frequency interactions,\nShort-Range-High-Frequency interactions, and various interpolations and\nextrapolations in-between. Additionally, model scaling can improve the\nresolutions of interpolations and extrapolations and, therefore, the network's\nlearnability. Finally, we prove a sharp characterization of the generalization\nerror for infinite-width CNNs of any depth in the high-dimensional setting. Two\ncorollaries follow: (1) infinite-width deep CNNs can break the curse of\ndimensionality without losing their expressivity, and (2) scaling improves\nperformance in both the finite and infinite data regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 15:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Recent FL techniques tend to solve this by enhancing\nthe generalization of the global model, but they ignore the domain-specific\nfeatures, which may contain important information about the device properties\nand be useful for local reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a\nspecificity-preserving FL algorithm for MR image reconstruction (FedMRI). The\ncore idea is to divide the MR reconstruction model into two parts: a globally\nshared encoder to obtain a generalized representation at the global level, and\na client-specific decoder to preserve the domain-specific properties of each\nclient, which is important for collaborative reconstruction when the clients\nhave unique distribution. Such scheme is then executed in the frequency space\nand the image space respectively, allowing exploration of generalized\nrepresentation and client-specific properties simultaneously in different\nspaces. Moreover, to further boost the convergence of the globally shared\nencoder when a domain shift is present, a weighted contrastive regularization\nis introduced to directly correct any deviation between the client and server\nduring optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FedMRI's\nreconstructed results are the closest to the ground-truth for\nmulti-institutional data, and that it outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 22:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 19:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 20:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

The dual discriminator\ndesign aims to improve the edge information in MRI reconstruction. One\ndiscriminator is used for holistic image reconstruction, whereas the other one\nis responsible for enhancing edge information.

The objective is to\nreduce the operation time and facilitate the surgery for both surgeons and\npatients. We propose an end-to-end trainable Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task\nLearning (ST-MTL) model with a shared encoder and spatio-temporal decoders for\nthe real-time surgical instrument segmentation and task-oriented saliency\ndetection. In the MTL model of shared parameters, optimizing multiple loss\nfunctions into a convergence point is still an open challenge.

To capture better long term\nspatio-temporal dependencies, we enhance the long-short term memory (LSTM)\nmodule by concatenating high-level encoder features of consecutive frames. We\nalso introduce Sinkhorn regularized loss to enhance task-oriented saliency\ndetection by preserving computational efficiency.
