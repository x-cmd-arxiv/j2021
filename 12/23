However, the system-heterogeneity is one major\nchallenge in a FL network to achieve robust distributed learning performance,\nwhich comes from two aspects: i) device-heterogeneity due to the diverse\ncomputational capacity among devices; ii) data-heterogeneity due to the\nnon-identically distributed data across the network. Prior studies addressing\nthe heterogeneous FL issue, e.g., FedProx, lack formalization and it remains an\nopen problem. This work first formalizes the system-heterogeneous FL problem\nand proposes a new algorithm, called FedLGA, to address this problem by\nbridging the divergence of local model updates via gradient approximation. To\nachieve this, FedLGA provides an alternated Hessian estimation method, which\nonly requires extra linear complexity on the aggregator. Theoretically, we show\nthat with a device-heterogeneous ratio $\\rho$, FedLGA achieves convergence\nrates on non-i.i.d. distributed FL training data for the non-convex\noptimization problems with $\\mathcal{O} \\left( \\frac{(1+\\rho)}{\\sqrt{ENT}} +\n\\frac{1}{T} \\right)$ and $\\mathcal{O} \\left( \\frac{(1+\\rho)\\sqrt{E}}{\\sqrt{TK}}\n+ \\frac{1}{T} \\right)$ for full and partial device participation respectively,\nwhere $E$ is the number of local learning epoch, $T$ is the number of total\ncommunication round, $N$ is the total device number and $K$ is the number of\nselected device in one communication round under partially participation\nscheme. The results of comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets show that\nFedLGA outperforms current FL methods against the system-heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 22:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

However, despite observational\nefforts, a pulsar orbiting a black hole has remained elusive. One possible\nexplanation is the extreme Doppler smearing caused by the pulsar's orbital\nmotion which changes its apparent spin frequency during an observation. The\nclassical solution to this problem has been to assume a constant acceleration\nor jerk for the entire observation. However, this assumption breaks down when\nthe observation samples a large fraction of the orbit. This limits the length\nof search observations, and hence their sensitivity. This provides a strong\nmotivation to develop techniques that can find compact binaries in longer\nobservations. Here we present a GPU-based radio pulsar search pipeline that can\nperform a coherent search for binary pulsars by directly searching over three\nor five Keplerian parameters using the template-bank algorithm. We compare the\nsensitivity obtained from our pipeline with acceleration and jerk search\npipelines for simulated pulsar-stellar-mass black hole binaries and\nobservations of PSR J0737-3039A.

This is likely tied to\nimplicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political\ndiscussion. To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in\nconversations about male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive\nstudy of automatic gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic\nlanguage, but also other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the\nform of seemingly positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female\npoliticians, or differences in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a\nmulti-faceted study of gender bias towards politicians investigating both\nlinguistic and extra-linguistic cues. We assess 5 different types of gender\nbias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial, nominal, sentimental, and lexical\nbiases extant in social media language and discourse. Overall, we find that,\ncontrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal\npublic interest in female politicians. Rather than overt hostile or benevolent\nsexism, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest\nis not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians.\nFemale politicians are often named by their first names and are described in\nrelation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not\nsimilarly extended to men.

A new dataset with\nthe ground truth, evaluation metric and baselines has been introduced.\n  The thesis presents the following improvements of the WxBS pipeline. (i) A\nloss function, called HardNeg, for learning a local image descriptor that\nrelies on hard negative mining within a mini-batch and on the maximization of\nthe distance between the closest positive and the closest negative patches.\n(ii) The descriptor trained with the HardNeg loss, called HardNet, is compact\nand shows state-of-the-art performance in standard matching, patch verification\nand retrieval benchmarks. (iii) A method for learning the affine shape,\norientation, and potentially other parameters related to geometric and\nappearance properties of local features. (iv) A tentative correspondences\ngeneration strategy which generalizes the standard first to second closest\ndistance ratio is presented. The selection strategy, which shows performance\nsuperior to the standard method, is applicable to either hard-engineered\ndescriptors like SIFT, LIOP, and MROGH or deeply learned like HardNet. (v) A\nfeedback loop is introduced for the two-view matching problem, resulting in\nMODS -- matching with on-demand view synthesis -- algorithm. MODS is an\nalgorithm that handles a viewing angle difference even larger than the previous\nstate-of-the-art ASIFT algorithm, without a significant increase of\ncomputational cost over \"standard\" wide and narrow baseline approaches. Last,\nbut not least, a comprehensive benchmark for local features and robust\nestimation algorithms is introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

The synthetic spectrum computed employing novel non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer calculations matches the data\nsignificantly better compared to the one computed assuming local thermodynamic\nequilibrium.

Analytical progress is possible by developing a dynamical\nmean-field theory for the Liouvillian time evolution on the Keldysh contour. By\ndisorder-averaging the interactions, we derive an (exact) effective action for\ntwo collective fields (Green's function and self-energy). In the large-$N$,\nlarge-$M$ limit, we obtain the saddle-point equations satisfied by the\ncollective fields, which determine the typical timescales of the dissipative\nevolution, particularly, the spectral gap that rules the relaxation of the\nsystem to its steady state. We solve the saddle-point equations numerically and\nfind that, for strong or intermediate dissipation, the system relaxes\nexponentially, with a spectral gap that can be computed analytically, while for\nweak dissipation, there are oscillatory corrections to the exponential\nrelaxation. In this letter, we illustrate the feasibility of analytical\ncalculations in strongly correlated dissipative quantum matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 18:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

A particularly sensitive approach is based on the\nunique signature of dark matter substructure on galaxy-galaxy strong lensing\nimages. Machine learning applications have been explored in detail for\nextracting just this signal. With limited availability of high quality strong\nlensing data, these approaches have exclusively relied on simulations.\nNaturally, due to the differences with the real instrumental data, machine\nlearning models trained on simulations are expected to lose accuracy when\napplied to real data.

In this\nwork, we deconstruct the current constraints from the Planck CMB and the\nfull-shape clustering data of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS) to understand the origin of different conclusions in the literature. We\nuse two different analyses, a grid sampling and a profile likelihood, to\ninvestigate whether the current constraints suffer from volume effects upon\nmarginalization and are biased towards some values of the EDE fraction,\n$f_\\mathrm{EDE}$. We find that $f_\\mathrm{EDE}$ allowed by the data strongly\ndepends on the particular choice of the other parameters of the model and that\nseveral choices of these parameters prefer larger values of $f_\\mathrm{EDE}$\nthan in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. This suggests that volume\neffects are the reason behind the disagreement in the literature.

While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively\nstudied in the literature, explicit constructions and detailed analyses of\nthresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far\nbeen limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal\nfault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for platform-independent\nlogical gate definitions, flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis,\nand exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource\noverheads. Central to our framework is the description of logical gates\nholistically in a way which treats space and time on a similar footing.\nFocusing on schemes based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, but\nplatform-independent representations of topological logic gates -- called\nlogical blocks -- and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal\nquantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes\nbased on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check\n(LDPC) codes. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient mapping from an\nabstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical\ninstructions for both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation\n(FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate\nset implemented with FBQC, and verify that their thresholds are consistent with\nthe bulk memory threshold. We find that boundaries, defects, and twists can\nsignificantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary\nconditions potentially halving the resource requirements. Motivated by the\nfavorable logical error rates for boundaryless computation, we introduce a\nnovel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer\nfurther resource reductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 06:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Graph Theory, 2021] showed that if $G$ is a line graph\nwith maximum degree $\\Delta$, then $\\chi_{CF}^{CN}(G) = O(\\ln \\Delta)$. As an\nopen question, they asked if the result could be extended to claw-free\n($K_{1,3}$-free) graphs, which are a superclass of line graphs. For $k\\geq 3$,\nwe show that if $G$ is $K_{1,k}$-free, then $\\chi_{CF}^{ON}(G) = O(k^2\\ln\n\\Delta)$. Since it is known that the CFCN chromatic number of a graph is at\nmost twice its CFON chromatic number, this answers the question posed by\nD\\k{e}bski and Przyby\\l{}o.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Worldwide,\ntwo-thirds of deaths do not have a cause assigned. Verbal autopsy (VA) is a\nwell-established tool to collect information describing deaths outside of\nhospitals by conducting surveys to caregivers of a deceased person. It is\nroutinely implemented in many low- and middle-income countries. Statistical\nalgorithms to assign cause of death using VAs are typically vulnerable to the\ndistribution shift between the data used to train the model and the target\npopulation. This presents a major challenge for analyzing VAs as labeled data\nare usually unavailable in the target population.

The objetive of\nthis research is to address these issues by providing valuable diagnostic rules\nthat can be easily implemented in clinical practice. In this research,\nefficient diagnostic rules friendly in clinical practice are provided. In this\npaper, interesting parameters obtained from the ECG signals analysis are\npresented and two simple rules for automatic diagnosis of Bundle Branch Blocks\nare defined using new markers derived from the so-called FMMecg delineator. The\nmain advantages of these markers are the good statistical properties and their\nclear interpretation in clinically meaningful terms. High sensitivity and\nspecificity values have been obtained using the proposed rules with data from\nmore than 35000 patients from well known benchmarking databases. In particular,\nto identify Complete Left Bundle Branch Blocks and differentiate this condition\nfrom subjects without heart diseases, sensitivity and specificity values\nranging from 93% to 99% and from 96% to 99%, respectively.

The proposal is different from others in the literature and\nit is compelling for three main reasons. On the one hand, the markers have a\nconcise electrophysiological interpretation.

Mathematically, this translates to strong asymptotic\nstabilization of a 3D flow by a 2D elastic structure. The stabilization\n(convergence to the stationary set) of a aerodynamic wave-plate model is\nestablished here. A 3D potential flow on the half-space has a spatially-bounded\nvon Karman plate embedded in the boundary. The physical model, then, is a\nNeumann wave equation with low regularity of coupling conditions. Motivated on\nempirical observations, we examine if intrinsic panel damping can stabilize the\nsubsonic flow-plate system to a stationary point. Several partial results have\nbeen established through partial regularization of the model. Without doing so,\nclassical approaches attempting to treat the given wave boundary data have\nfallen short, owing to the failure of the Lopatinski condition (in the sense of\nKreiss, Sakamoto) and the associated regularity defect of the hyperbolic\nNeumann mapping. Here, we operate on the panel model as in the engineering\nliterature with no regularization or modifications; we completely resolve the\nquestion of stability by demonstrating that weak plate damping strongly\nstabilizes system trajectories. This is accomplished by microlocalizing the\nwave data (given by the plate) and observing an \"anisotropic\" a microlocal\ncompensation by the plate dynamics precisely where the regularity of the 3D\nwave is compromsed (in the characteristic sector).

We also identify a new transient\nULX, CXOU J022230.1+421937, which faded from view over the course of a two\nmonth period from Nov 2016 to Jan 2017. Modeling of each source at every epoch\nwas conducted using six different models ranging from thermal bremsstrahlung to\naccretion disk models. Unfortunately, but as is common with many ULXs, no\nsingle model yielded a much better fit than the others. The two known sources\nhad unabsorbed luminosities that remained fairly consistent over five or more\nyears. Various possibilities for the new transient ULX are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 20:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

At large scales, it is governed by galactic\nencounters, mass inflows connected to spirals arms and bars, or due to\nexpanding shells from supernova (SN) explosions in the central parts of\ngalaxies. The investigation of the latter process requires an extensive set of\ngas dynamical simulations to explore the muti-dimensional parameter space\nneeded to frame the phenomenon. The aims of this paper are to extend our\ninvestigation of the importance of supernovae for inducing accretion onto a\nSMBH and carry out a comparison between the fully hydrodynamic code Flash and\nthe much less computationally intensive code Ring, which uses the thin shell\napproximation.

Combining automated source finding with source\nextraction at optical redshifts and visual verification, we obtained 40 HI\ndetections of which 24 are new. Over half of the sample displays perturbed HI\nmorphologies indicative of an ongoing interaction with the cluster environment.\nWith the use of ancillary UV and mid-IR, data we measured their stellar masses\nand star formation rates and compared the HI properties to a set of field\ngalaxies spanning a similar stellar mass and star formation rate range. We find\nthat $\\sim$ 75 % of HI-selected Coma galaxies have simultaneously enhanced star\nformation rates (by $\\sim$ 0.2 dex) and are HI deficient (by $\\sim$ 0.5 dex)\ncompared to field galaxies of the same stellar mass. According to our toy\nmodel, the simultaneous HI deficiency and enhanced star formation activity can\nbe attributed to either HI stripping of already highly star forming galaxies on\na very short timescale, while their H$_2$ content remains largely unaffected,\nor to HI stripping coupled to a temporary boost of the HI-to-H$_2$ conversion,\ncausing a brief starburst phase triggered by ram pressure before eventually\nquenching the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 22:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 16:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

A trending approach in this\ndirection is to recur to in-network distributed processing in which individual\nnodes implement adaptation rules and diffuse their estimation to the network.\n  When the a priori knowledge about the filtering scenario is limited or\nimprecise, selecting the most adequate filter structure and adjusting its\nparameters becomes a challenging task, and erroneous choices can lead to\ninadequate performance. To address this difficulty, one useful approach is to\nrely on combinations of adaptive structures.\n  The combination of adaptive filters exploits to some extent the same divide\nand conquer principle that has also been successfully exploited by the\nmachine-learning community (e.g., in bagging or boosting). In particular, the\nproblem of combining the outputs of several learning algorithms (mixture of\nexperts) has been studied in the computational learning field under a different\nperspective: rather than studying the expected performance of the mixture,\ndeterministic bounds are derived that apply to individual sequences and,\ntherefore, reflect worst-case scenarios. These bounds require assumptions\ndifferent from the ones typically used in adaptive filtering, which is the\nemphasis of this overview article. We review the key ideas and principles\nbehind these combination schemes, with emphasis on design rules.

The first objective of this paper is\nto study the importance of fission product libraries in the construction of\nantineutrino spectrum using the summation method and with various corrections.\nWe have used ENDF/B-VIII and JEFF3.3 as our base data to model the spectrum. We\nhave also included the TAGS data (pandemonium free) when such data is\navailable. The isomeric transitions correction has the highest impact on the\nantineutrino spectra increasing the values 29% to 37% on an average in the\nenergy range of 0.5 MeV to 2 MeV. This correction also shows an increase of\n4.71% to 7.13% in the range of 0 to 2 MeV, with improving isomeric transitions\nusing the TAGS data. Next, the spectra including the isomeric transition\ncorrection using the Gross Theory causes reduction by 11.56 % to 69.46 % in the\nrange of 6 to 8 MeV. The finite size, radiative, and weak magnetism corrections\ncause no more than 3.27% difference between the corrected and uncorrected\nspectra. Our second objective is to calculate pulse height distributions of Ge\nand Si based CEvNS sensors assuming a 20eV nuclear recoil threshold. In our\nstudy, we have assumed a 100kg detector placed 10m away from the 1MW TRIGA\nreactor. Our results show that the detector response with corrected spectra for\na natural Ge and Si detector are 44.25events/day and 7.99events/day.

We call\nit the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). The principle is deeply\nrooted in classical mechanics via Gauss' principle of least constraint.\nTherefore, while we prove mathematically that Navier-Stokes' equation\nrepresents the necessary condition for minimization of the pressure gradient,\nthe PMPG stands on its own philosophy independent of Navier-Stokes'. It turns\nany fluid mechanics problem into a minimization one. We demonstrate this\nintriguing property by solving three of the classical problems in fluid\nmechanics using the PMPG without resorting to Navier-Stokes' equation. In fact,\nthe inviscid version of the PMPG allowed solving the long-standing problem of\nthe aerohydrodynamic lift over smooth cylindrical shapes where Euler's equation\nfails to provide a unique answer. Moreover, the result challenges the accepted\nwisdom about lift generation on an airfoil, which has prevailed over a century.\nThe PMPG is expected to be transformative for theoretical modeling of fluid\nmechanics as it encodes a complicated nonlinear partial differential equation\ninto a simple minimization problem. The principle even transcends\nNavier-Stokes' equations in its applicability to non-Newtonian fluids with\narbitrary constitutive relations and fluids subject to arbitrary forcing (e.g.\nelectric or magnetic).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 22:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 19:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 19:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Classically, off-policy estimation\nbias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are\nre-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio (via\neligibility traces) after each action. Many important off-policy algorithms\nsuch as Tree Backup and Retrace rely on this mechanism along with differing\nprotocols for truncating (\"cutting\") the ratios (\"traces\") to counteract the\nexcessive variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, cutting traces on a\nper-decision basis is not necessarily efficient; once a trace has been cut\naccording to local information, the effect cannot be reversed later,\npotentially resulting in the premature truncation of estimated returns and\nslower learning. In the interest of motivating efficient off-policy algorithms,\nwe propose a multistep operator that permits arbitrary past-dependent traces.\nWe prove that our operator is convergent for policy evaluation, and for optimal\ncontrol when targeting greedy-in-the-limit policies. Our theorems establish the\nfirst convergence guarantees for many existing algorithms including Truncated\nIS, Non-Markov Retrace, and history-dependent TD($\\lambda$). Our theoretical\nresults also provide guidance for the development of new algorithms that\njointly consider multiple past decisions for better credit assignment and\nfaster learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

An outstanding feature\nis the ability of these entities to follow complex trajectories, ranging from\nstraight, curved (circular, helical...), to random-like ones. The non-straight\nnature of these trajectories is often explained as a consequence of the\nasymmetry of the particle or the medium in which it moves, or due to the\npresence of bounding walls, etc... Here, we show that straight, circular and\nhelical trajectories emerge naturally in the absence of asymmetry of the\nswimmer or that of suspending medium. Our first proof is based on general\nconsiderations, without referring to an explicit form of a model.

The photoexcitation induced modulation on charge population of the\nTi-Se bonds generates a laser-fluence-dependent interatomic-repulsive force\nalong each Ti-Se bond. The nonequal length of these six Ti-Se bonds gives rise\nto a net force exerted on the central distorted Ti atom to push it toward the\nsuppressing of the PLD and thus the CDW orders. We further illustrate that the\ndynamics of each distorted Ti atom behaves as though it attached to a spring in\na simple harmonic motion with a fluence-dependent oscillation frequency,\nuniting two previously reported scaling laws for phase transition time.

The current Reynolds number, $Re$, ranges from $6.5\\times10^3$\nto $2.6\\times10^4$, and the particle volume fraction, $\\Phi$, is up to $10\\%$.\nParticles with three kinds of aspect ratio, $\\lambda$, are used: $\\lambda=1/3$\n(oblate), $\\lambda=1$ (spherical) and $\\lambda=3$ (prolate). Unlike the case of\nbubbly TC flow, we find that the suspended finite-size particles increase the\ndrag of the TC system regardless of their aspect ratios. In addition, the\nnormalized friction coefficient, $c_{f,\\Phi}/c_{f,\\Phi=0}$, decreases with\nincreasing $Re$, the reason could be that in the current low volume fractions\nthe turbulent stress becomes dominant at higher $Re$. As $Re$ increases, the\nparticles distribute more evenly in the entire system, which results from both\nthe greater turbulence intensity and the more pronounced finite-size effects of\nthe particles at higher $Re$. Moreover, it is found that the variation of the\nparticle aspect ratios leads to different particle collective effects. The\nsuspended spherical particles, which tend to cluster near the walls and form a\nparticle layer, significantly affect the boundary layer and result in maximum\ndrag modification. The minimal drag modification is found in the oblate case,\nwhere the particles preferentially cluster in the bulk region, and thus the\nparticle layer is absent. Based on the optical measurement results, it can be\nconcluded that, in the low volume fraction ranges ($\\Phi=0.5\\%$ and $\\Phi =\n2\\%$ here), the larger drag modification is connected to the near-wall particle\nclustering. The present findings suggest that the particle shape plays a\nsignificant role in drag modification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 02:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

However, without\nadaptive time slot (TS) and power allocation schemes, NGMA systems relying on\nstochastic sampling instants might lead to tardy actions associated both with\nhigh age of information (AoI) as well as high power consumption. For mitigating\nthe energy consumption, we exploit a pair of sleep-scheduling policies, namely\nthe multiple vacation (MV) policy and start-up threshold (ST) policy, which are\ncharacterized in the context of three typical multiple access protocols,\nincluding time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple\naccess (FDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).

However, a test case can be flaky, i.e., passing and failing\nacross executions, even for the same version of the source code. Flaky test\ncases introduce overhead to software development as they can lead to\nunnecessary attempts to debug production or testing code. The state-of-the-art\nML-based flaky test case predictors rely on pre-defined sets of features that\nare either project-specific, require access to production code, which is not\nalways available to software test engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose Flakify, a black-box, language model-based predictor for flaky test\ncases. Flakify relies exclusively on the source code of test cases, thus not\nrequiring to (a) access to production code (black-box), (b) rerun test cases,\n(c) pre-define features. To this end, we employed CodeBERT, a pre-trained\nlanguage model, and fine-tuned it to predict flaky test cases using the source\ncode of test cases.

Furthermore, survey-based\nmeasures of student engagement are prone to subjectivity and various response\nbias. Therefore, in this research, we investigate how individual and group-wise\nclassroom seating experiences affect student engagement using wearable\nphysiological sensors. We conducted a field study at a high school and\ncollected survey and wearable data from 23 students in 10 courses over four\nweeks. We aim to answer the following research questions: 1.

Experiment results indicate that the individual and\ngroup-wise classroom seating experience is associated with perceived student\nengagement and physiologically-based engagement measured from electrodermal\nactivity. We also find that students who sit close together are more likely to\nhave similar learning engagement and tend to have high physiological synchrony.\nThis research opens up opportunities to explore the implications of flexible\nseating arrangements and has great potential to maximize student engagement by\nsuggesting intelligent seating choices in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 03:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 14:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 16:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

One critical inductive bias is that the model can\nmaintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation,\nrotation, and scaling. The existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can\nonly maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with\nrespect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design\nsophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally\nexpensive and difficult to be extended. To solve this problem, we revisit why\nthe existing neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance when\nhandling geometric data. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and\ndistance-preserving initial representations are sufficient to achieve\ntransformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer\ndesigns. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant\nNeural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general framework for geometric\ndata. Specifically, we realize transformation-invariant and distance-preserving\ninitial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling before\nfeeding the representations into neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can\nstrictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough\nto be combined with the existing neural networks.

One of the more prominent edge finding methods,\nknown as the level set method, evolves a zero-level contour in the image plane\nwith gradient descent until the contour has converged to the object boundaries.\nWhile the classical level set method and its variants have proved successful in\nsegmenting real images, they are susceptible to becoming stuck in noisy regions\nof the image plane without a priori knowledge of the image and they are unable\nto provide details beyond object outer boundary locations.

The response of a hybrid system to an\nexternal field is determined by two distinct mechanisms involving collective\nstates of emitters interacting with the plasmon mode. First is the near-field\ncoupling between the bright collective state and the plasmon mode which\nunderpins energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to\nexciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra in the weak coupling\nregime and to emergence of polaritonic bands as the system transitions to\nstrong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between\nthe plasmon dipole moment and plasmon-induced dipole moment of bright\ncollective state as the hybrid system interacts with the radiation field. The\nlatter mechanism is greatly facilitated by plasmon-induced coherence in a\nsystem with characteristic size below the diffraction limit as the individual\nemitters comprising the collective state are driven by same alternating plasmon\nnear field and therefore all oscillate in phase. This cooperative effect leads\nto scaling of the Fano asymmetry parameter and of the Fano function amplitude\nwith the ensemble size and therefore it strongly affects the shape of\nscattering spectra for large ensembles.

While the effects of chain entanglement on elasticity and\nviscoelasticity of polymer networks have been intensively studied, it remains\nelusive how chain entanglement affects fracture and fatigue of polymer\nnetworks. In this paper, using polyacrylamide hydrogels as a model material, we\nsystematically compare fracture toughness and fatigue threshold of polymer\nnetworks with various levels of chain entanglement. We find that the fracture\ntoughness and fatigue threshold of an unentangled polymer network are almost\nthe same, although the unentangled polymer network still contains non-ideal\nfeatures including topological defects (i.e., dangling chains and cyclic loops)\nand structural heterogeneity (i.e., non-uniform chain lengths and non-uniform\nfunctionalities). In contrast, the fracture toughness of an entangled polymer\nnetwork can be over ten times (up to 16 times) higher than its fatigue\nthreshold, indicating substantial toughness enhancement due to chain\nentanglement. Different from the conventional toughness enhancement due to bulk\ndissipation of polymer networks, the toughness enhancement by chain\nentanglement requires low stress-stretch hysteresis (<10%) of the bulk\nentangled polymer networks. We attribute the toughness enhancement in entangled\npolymer networks to a new dissipation mechanism, near-crack dissipation, which\nis possibly induced by pull-out of chains and delocalized damage of chains\naround the crack tip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 05:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

It is built\non min-max optimization (MMO), where the minimizer (i.e., defender) seeks a\nrobust model to minimize the worst-case training loss in the presence of\nadversarial examples crafted by the maximizer (i.e., attacker). However, the\nconventional MMO method makes AT hard to scale. Thus, Fast-AT (Wong et al.,\n2020) and other recent algorithms attempt to simplify MMO by replacing its\nmaximization step with the single gradient sign-based attack generation step.\nAlthough easy to implement, Fast-AT lacks theoretical guarantees, and its\nempirical performance is unsatisfactory due to the issue of robust catastrophic\noverfitting when training with strong adversaries. In this paper, we advance\nFast-AT from the fresh perspective of bi-level optimization (BLO). We first\nshow that the commonly-used Fast-AT is equivalent to using a stochastic\ngradient algorithm to solve a linearized BLO problem involving a sign\noperation. However, the discrete nature of the sign operation makes it\ndifficult to understand the algorithm performance. Inspired by BLO, we design\nand analyze a new set of robust training algorithms termed Fast Bi-level AT\n(Fast-BAT), which effectively defends sign-based projected gradient descent\n(PGD) attacks without using any gradient sign method or explicit robust\nregularization.

In this work, we show that the\neffect of catastrophic forgetting on the model prediction varies with the\nchange in orientation of the same image, which is a novel finding. Based on\nthis, we propose a novel data-ensemble approach that combines the predictions\nfor the different orientations of the image to help the model retain further\ninformation regarding the previously seen classes and thereby reduce the effect\nof forgetting on the model predictions. However, we cannot directly use the\ndata-ensemble approach if the model is trained using traditional techniques.\nTherefore, we also propose a novel dual-incremental learning framework that\ninvolves jointly training the network with two incremental learning objectives,\ni.e., the class-incremental learning objective and our proposed\ndata-incremental learning objective. In the dual-incremental learning\nframework, each image belongs to two classes, i.e., the image class (for\nclass-incremental learning) and the orientation class (for data-incremental\nlearning). In class-incremental learning, each new phase introduces a new set\nof classes, and the model cannot access the complete training data from the\nolder phases. In our proposed data-incremental learning, the orientation\nclasses remain the same across all the phases, and the data introduced by the\nnew phase in class-incremental learning acts as new training data for these\norientation classes. We empirically demonstrate that the dual-incremental\nlearning framework is vital to the data-ensemble approach.

Our question is\nwhy the first frame should be selected as a reference frame or why the entire\nvideo should be used to specify the mask. We believe that we can select a\nbetter reference frame to achieve the better UVOS performance than using only\nthe first frame or the entire video as a reference frame. In our paper, we\npropose Easy Frame Selector (EFS). The EFS enables us to select an 'easy'\nreference frame that makes the subsequent VOS become easy, thereby improving\nthe VOS performance. Furthermore, we propose a new framework named as Iterative\nMask Prediction (IMP). In the framework, we repeat applying EFS to the given\nvideo and selecting an 'easier' reference frame from the video than the\nprevious iteration, increasing the VOS performance incrementally. The IMP\nconsists of EFS, Bi-directional Mask Prediction (BMP), and Temporal Information\nUpdating (TIU). From the proposed framework, we achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in three UVOS benchmark sets: DAVIS16, FBMS, and SegTrack-V2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 07:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

The ellipsoidal\nshape of inclusions and orthotropic properties of phases are assumed. Extended\nequivalent inclusion method with linear eigenstrain is proposed to derive the\nexplicit relations between the Eshelby-like tensors and corresponding\nconcentration tensors that are used to define the averaged field variables\ninside the inclusions. Obtained analytical solutions allow to evaluate the\neffective classical and gradient elastic moduli of composite materials\naccounting for the phases properties, volume fraction, shape and size of\ninclusions.

In this\nstudy, we demonstrate that molecular-polariton BECs can be utilized for Bose\nenhancement of excitation-energy transfer (EET) in a molecular system with an\nexciton donor coupled to a group of exciton acceptors that are further strongly\ncoupled to a single mode of an optical cavity. Similar to the stimulated\nemission of light in which photons are bosonic particles, a greater rate of EET\nis observed if the group of acceptors is prepared in the exciton-polariton BEC\nstate than if the acceptors are initially either in their electronic ground\nstates or in a normal excited state with an equal average number of molecular\nexcitations. The Bose enhancement also manifests itself as the growth of the\nEET rate with an increasing number of exciton polaritons in the BEC. Finally, a\npermutation-symmetry-based approach to suppress the EET to the huge manifold of\ndark states in the acceptor group is proposed to facilitate the Bose-enhanced\nEET to the polariton BEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 10:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 02:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 11:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In the creeping\nregion, the dynamical equation of disturbed regolith grains is established\nbased on the assumption of \"trigger-slide\" motion mode. The equilibrium points,\nlocal manifolds and large-scale trajectories of the system are calculated to\nclarify the dynamical characteristics of long-term regolith movement.\nGenerally, we find for a low spin rate, the surface regolith grains flow toward\nthe middle latitudes from the polar/equatorial regions, which is dominated by\nthe gradient of the geopotential. While spun up to a high rate, regolith grains\ntend to migrate toward the equator, which happens in parallel with a\ntopological shift of the local equilibria at low latitudes. From a long-term\nperspective, we find the equilibrium points dominate the global trends of\nregolith movements.

In this work, we demonstrate that the figure of merit reflecting a\ndesign goal can be made differentiable with respect to the device and control\nparameters. In addition, we can compute the gradient of the design objective\nefficiently in a similar manner to the back-propagation algorithm and then\nutilize the gradient to optimize the device and the control parameters jointly\nand efficiently. This extends the scope of the quantum optimal control to\nsuperconducting device design.

That is, the domain may be split into several\nsubdomains, on which the optimisation problem is solved. In classic adaptive\nnumerical methods, the mesh as well as the domain may be refined or decomposed,\nrespectively, in order to improve accuracy. Also the degree of approximation\naccuracy may be adapted. It would be desirable to transfer such important and\nsuccessful strategies to the field of neural network based solutions.

Most recently, mobility data was\nextensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic to study the effects of\ngovernmental policies and to inform epidemic models. Large-scale mobility is\noften measured using digital tools such as mobile phones. However, it remains\nan open question how truthfully these digital proxies represent the actual\ntravel behavior of the general population. Here, we examine mobility datasets\nfrom multiple countries and identify two fundamentally different types of bias\ncaused by unequal access to, and unequal usage of mobile phones. We introduce\nthe concept of data generation bias, a previously overlooked type of bias,\nwhich is present when the amount of data that an individual produces influences\ntheir representation in the dataset. We find evidence for data generation bias\nin all examined datasets in that high-wealth individuals are overrepresented,\nwith the richest 20% contributing over 50% of all recorded trips, substantially\nskewing the datasets. This inequality is consequential, as we find mobility\npatterns of different wealth groups to be structurally different, where the\nmobility networks of high-wealth users are denser and contain more long-range\nconnections. To mitigate the skew, we present a framework to debias data and\nshow how simple techniques can be used to increase representativeness. Using\nour approach we show how biases can severely impact outcomes of dynamic\nprocesses such as epidemic simulations, where biased data incorrectly estimates\nthe severity and speed of disease transmission.

Furthermore, we show\nthat convex combinations of calibrated classifiers preserve volume estimation,\nbut do not preserve calibration. Therefore, we conclude that having a\ncalibrated predictor is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for obtaining\nan unbiased estimate of the volume. We validate our theoretical findings\nempirically on a collection of 18 different (calibrated) training strategies on\nthe tasks of glioma volume estimation on BraTS 2018, and ischemic stroke lesion\nvolume estimation on ISLES 2018 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 14:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Previous studies on the reliability of SSD arrays are\nbased on the deprecated SSD failure data, and only focus on limited failure\ntypes, device failures, and page failures caused by the bit errors, while\nrecent field studies have reported other failure types including bad blocks and\nbad chips, and a high correlation between failures.

The reliability is\nevaluated by statistical fault injections that post-process the usage logs from\nthe real-system implementation, while the fault/failure attributes are obtained\nfrom field data. As a case study, we examine conventional and emerging erasure\ncodes in terms of both reliability and performance using Linux MD RAID and\ncommercial SSDs.

In our previous paper\n(Shibata et al. 2020) we showed that planetesimal accretion during planetary\nmigration occurs in a rather narrow region of the protoplanetary disk, which we\nrefer as \"the sweet spot for accretion\". The goal of this paper is to reveal\nthe nature of the sweet spot and investigate the role of the sweet spot in\ndetermining the composition of gas giant planets. We analytically derive the\nrequired conditions for the sweet spot. Then, we compare the derived equations\nwith the numerical simulations. We find that the conditions required for the\nsweet spot can be expressed by the ratio of the gas damping timescale of the\nplanetesimal orbits and the planetary migration timescale. If the planetary\nmigration timescale depends on the surface density of disk gas inversely, the\nlocation of the sweet spot does not change with the disk evolution. The mass of\nplanetesimals accreted by the planet depends on the amount of planetesimals\nthat are shepherded by mean motion resonances. Our analysis suggests that tens\nEarth-mass of planetesimals can be shepherded into the sweet spot without\nplanetesimal collisions. However, as more planetesimals are trapped into mean\nmotion resonances, collisional cascade can lead to fragmentation of\nplanetesimals. This could affect the location of the sweet spot and the\npopulation of small objects in planetary systems. We conclude that the\ncomposition of gas giant planets depends on whether the planets crossed the\nsweet spot during their formation. Constraining the metallicity of cold giant\nplanets, that are expected to be outer than the sweet spot, would reveal key\ninformation for understanding the origin of heavy elements in giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 15:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Before obtaining more\ninsights into the run-time status of the software, a fundamental step of log\nanalysis, called log parsing, is employed to extract structured templates and\nparameters from the semi-structured raw log messages. However, current log\nparsers are all syntax-based and regard each message as a character string,\nignoring the semantic information included in parameters and templates.\n  Thus, we propose the semantic-based parser SemParser to unlock the critical\nbottleneck of mining semantics from log messages. It contains two steps, an\nend-to-end semantic miner and a joint parser. Specifically, the first step aims\nto identify explicit semantics inside a single log, and the second step is\nresponsible for jointly inferring implicit semantics and computing structural\noutputs based on the contextual knowledge base. To analyze the effectiveness of\nour semantic parser, we first demonstrate that it can derive rich semantics\nfrom log messages collected from six widely-applied systems with an average F1\nscore of 0.985.

RumbleML allows using a single platform for data\ncleaning, data preparation, training, and inference, as well as management of\nmodels and results. It does it using a purely declarative language (JSONiq) for\nall these tasks and without any performance loss over existing platforms (e.g.\nSpark).

We demonstrate\nhow heteroclinic units can act as pacemakers to entrain larger sets of units\nfrom a resting state to hierarchical heteroclinic motion that is able to\ndescribe fast oscillations modulated by slow oscillations. Such features are\nobserved in brain dynamics. The entrainment range depends on the type of\ncoupling, the spatial location of the pacemaker and the individual bifurcation\nparameters of the pacemaker and the driven units. Noise as well as a small\nback-coupling to the pacemaker facilitate synchronization. Units can be\nsynchronously entrained to different temporal patterns encoding transiently\nexcited neural populations, depending on the selected path in the heteroclinic\nnetwork. Via entrainment, these temporal patterns, locally generated by the\npacemakers, can be communicated to the resting units in target waves over a\nspatial grid. For getting entrained there is no need of fine-tuning the\nparameters of the resting units.

To address the -- still\nuncertain -- formation channels of the source compact binaries, their\npopulation properties must be characterized. The computational cost of the\nBayesian hierarchical methods employed thus far scales with the size of the\nevent catalogs, and such methods have until recently assumed fixed functional\nforms for the source distribution. Here we propose a fast and flexible method\nto reconstruct the population of LIGO--Virgo merging black hole (BH) binaries\nwithout such assumptions. For sufficiently high event statistics and\nsufficiently low individual event measurement error (relative to the scale of\npopulation features) a kernel density estimator (KDE) reconstruction of the\nevent distribution will be accurate. We improve the accuracy and flexibility of\nKDE for finite event statistics using an adaptive bandwidth KDE (awKDE). We\napply awKDE to publicly released parameter estimates for 44 significant (69) BH\nbinary mergers in GWTC-2 (GWTC-3), in combination with a fast polynomial fit of\nsearch sensitivity, to obtain a non-parametric estimate of the mass\ndistribution, and compare to Bayesian hierarchical methods.

However, most of\nthem share two main common limitations: 1) the CT physical imaging geometry\nconstraint is not comprehensively incorporated into deep network structures; 2)\nthe entire framework has weak interpretability for the specific MAR task;\nhence, the role of each network module is difficult to be evaluated. To\nalleviate these issues, in the paper, we construct a novel deep unfolding dual\ndomain network, termed InDuDoNet+, into which CT imaging process is finely\nembedded.

In this\npaper, for what we believe to be the first time, the capacity of the\npolarization drift channel under an average power constraint with imperfect\nchannel knowledge is characterized. An achievable information rate (AIR) is\nderived when imperfect channel knowledge is available and is shown to be highly\ndependent on the channel estimation technique.

Animal-infrastructure interactions vary across focal\nspecies and regions, underlining the need to study the animal-outage\nrelationship in more species and diverse systems. Animal activity has been used\nas an indicator of reliability in the electrical grid system and to describe\ntemporal patterns in AROs. However, these ARO models have been limited by a\nlack of available estimates of species activity, instead approximating activity\nbased on seasonal and weather patterns in animal-related outage records and\ncharacteristics of broad taxonomic groups, e.g., squirrels. We highlight\npublicly available resources to fill the ecological data gap that is limiting\njoint analyses between ecology and energy sectors. Species distribution models\n(SDMs), a common technique to model the distribution of a species across\ngeographic space and time, paired with data sourced from eBird, a community\nscience database for bird observations, provided us with species-specific\nestimates of activity to model spatio-temporal patterns of AROs. These\nflexible, species-specific estimates can allow future animal-indicators of grid\nreliability to be investigated in more diverse regions and ecological\ncommunities, providing a better understanding of the variation that exists in\nanimal-outage relationship. AROs were best modeled by accounting for multiple\noutage-prone species activity patterns and their unique relationships with\nseasonality and habitat availability. Different species were important for\nmodeling outages in different landscapes and seasons depending on their\ndistribution and migration behavior. We recommend that future models of AROs\ninclude species-specific activity data that account for the diverse spectrum of\nspatio-temporal activity patterns that outage-prone animals exhibit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 21:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

When\nvehicles are in need of repair outside of their scheduled time, depending on\ntheir priority level, the entire squadron's slated repair schedule is\ntransformed negatively. The repercussions of unscheduled maintenance are\nspecifically seen in the increase of man hours required to maintain vehicles\nthat should have been working well: this can include more man hours spent on\nmaintenance itself, waiting for parts to arrive, hours spent re-organizing the\nrepair schedule, and more. The dominant trend in the current maintenance system\nat LRSs is that they do not have predictive maintenance infrastructure to\ncounteract the influx of unscheduled repairs they experience currently, and as\na result, their readiness and performance levels are lower than desired.\n  We use data pulled from the Defense Property and Accountability System\n(DPAS), that the LRSs currently use to store their vehicle maintenance\ninformation.

Traditionally, water management associations operate large sensor\nnetworks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement\ndata to monitor and model physical processes within catchments. Implementing a\ncomprehensive monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ\ndata. Due to the evolvement of the Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader\navailability of satellite data provides a great potential for deriving\ncomplementary information from Earth Observation data. Although the number of\nsatellite data platforms that provide online processing environments is\ngrowing, it is still a big challenge to integrate those platforms into\ntraditional workflows of users from environmental domains such as hydrology.\nThus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the\ngeneration of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology.

The suitability of our system is proven as part of a\npre-operational deployment for a German water management association.

In this\npaper, a data exchange scheme is proposed utilizing unsupervised learning to\nenable efficient lost packet retrieval through reliable wireless transmissions\nbetween UAVs instead of through retransmissions of macro BSs with a longer\ndelay and higher overhead. With the proposed scheme, all UAVs are assigned to\nmultiple clusters and a UAV can only request its lost packets to UAVs in the\nsame cluster. By this way, UAVs in different clusters could carry out their\nlost packets retrieval processes simultaneously to expedite data exchange. The\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering, a type of unsupervised learning, is used\nto conduct clustering, guaranteeing that UAVs clustered together could supply\nand supplement each other's lost packets. To further enhance data exchange\nefficiency, a data exchange mechanism is designed, where the priority of UAVs\nperforming data exchange is determined by the number of their lost packets or\nthe number of requested packets that they can provide. The introduced data\nexchange mechanism can make each request-reply process maximally beneficial to\nother UAVs' lost packet retrieval in the same cluster.

In order to understand the\nconnection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze\ndifferences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a\nmeaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic\nstructure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly\nbetween individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common,\nlow-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable.\nSimilar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used\nlinear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we\npropose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder,\nautoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an\nexperiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI\nsignals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible\nmanifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves\nthe classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well\nas improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this\nframework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided\nbrain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 23:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

With recent\nadvances in information sharing technologies, upstream supply chain (SC)\ncompanies may have access to downstream point of sales (POS) data. Such data\ncan be used as an alternative source of information for forecasting. There are\na few studies that investigate the benefits of using orders versus POS data in\nupstream SC forecasting; the results are mixed and empirical evidence is\nlacking, particularly in the context of multi-echelon SCs and in the presence\nof promotions. We investigate an actual three-echelon SC with 684 series where\nthe manufacturer aims to forecast orders received from distribution centers\n(DCs) using either aggregated POS data at DC level or historical orders\nreceived from the DCs. Our results show that the order-based methods outperform\nthe POS-based ones by 6\\%-15\\%. We find that low values of mean, variance,\nnon-linearity and entropy of POS data, and promotion presence negatively impact\nthe performance of the POS-based forecasts.

It is generically\napplicable to systems satisfying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), among others.\nWhen we focus instead on stationary states of typical complex systems (e.g.,\nclassical long-range Hamiltonian systems), both the CLT and LDT need to be\ngeneralized. We focus here on a scale-invariant stochastic process involving\nstrongly-correlated exchangeable random variables which, through the Laplace-de\nFinetti theorem, is known to yield a long-tailed $Q$-Gaussian $N\\to\\infty$\nattractor in the space of distributions ($1 < Q<3)$.
