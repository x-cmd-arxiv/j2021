Our\nexperiment ran for 15 months during which time more than 14,000 study\nparticipants (employees of the company) received different simulated phishing\nemails in their normal working context. We also deployed a reporting button to\nthe company's email client which allowed the participants to report suspicious\nemails they received. We measured click rates for phishing emails, dangerous\nactions such as submitting credentials, and reported suspicious emails.\n  The results of our experiment provide three types of contributions. First,\nsome of our findings support previous literature with improved ecological\nvalidity. One example of such results is good effectiveness of warnings on\nemails. Second, some of our results contradict prior literature and common\nindustry practices. Surprisingly, we find that embedded training during\nsimulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does\nnot make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead it can have\nunexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to\nphishing. And third, we report new findings. In particular, we are the first to\ndemonstrate that using the employees as a collective phishing detection\nmechanism is practical in large organizations. Our results show that such\ncrowd-sourcing allows fast detection of new phishing campaigns, the operational\nload for the organization is acceptable, and the employees remain active over\nlong periods of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

This generalization increases the number\nof possible delegation paths and enables higher participation rates because\nfewer votes are lost due to delegation cycles or abstaining agents.

However, the\nrobustness of deep learning based XMTC models against adversarial examples has\nbeen largely underexplored.\n  In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of XMTC models under adversarial\nattacks. To this end, first, we define adversarial attacks in multilabel text\nclassification problems. We categorize attacking multilabel text classifiers as\n(a) positive-targeted, where the target positive label should fall out of top-k\npredicted labels, and (b) negative-targeted, where the target negative label\nshould be among the top-k predicted labels. Then, by experiments on APLC-XLNet\nand AttentionXML, we show that XMTC models are highly vulnerable to\npositive-targeted attacks but more robust to negative-targeted ones.\nFurthermore, our experiments show that the success rate of positive-targeted\nadversarial attacks has an imbalanced distribution. More precisely, tail\nclasses are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks for which an attacker can\ngenerate adversarial samples with high similarity to the actual data-points. To\novercome this problem, we explore the effect of rebalanced loss functions in\nXMTC where not only do they increase accuracy on tail classes, but they also\nimprove the robustness of these classes against adversarial attacks.

As an alternative, we derive a particular form of cross-modal\nproxy objective for video-language pre-training, i.e., Contrastive Cross-modal\nmatching and denoising (CoCo). By viewing the masked frame/word sequences as\nthe noisy augmentation of primary unmasked ones, CoCo strengthens\nvideo-language association by simultaneously pursuing inter-modal matching and\nintra-modal denoising between masked and unmasked inputs in a contrastive\nmanner. Our CoCo proxy objective can be further integrated into any BERT-type\nencoder-decoder structure for video-language pre-training, named as Contrastive\nCross-modal BERT (CoCo-BERT). We pre-train CoCo-BERT on TV dataset and a newly\ncollected large-scale GIF video dataset (ACTION). Through extensive experiments\nover a wide range of downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval, video\nquestion answering, and video captioning), we demonstrate the superiority of\nCoCo-BERT as a pre-trained structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

It is therefore appealing for domain adaptation\napproaches to consider incorporating SSL. The intuition is to enforce\ninstance-level feature consistency such that the predictor becomes somehow\ninvariant across domains. However, most existing SSL methods in the regime of\ndomain adaptation usually are treated as standalone auxiliary components,\nleaving the signatures of domain adaptation unattended. Actually, the optimal\nregion where the domain gap vanishes and the instance level constraint that SSL\nperuses may not coincide at all. From this point, we present a particular\nparadigm of self-supervised learning tailored for domain adaptation, i.e.,\nTransferrable Contrastive Learning (TCL), which links the SSL and the desired\ncross-domain transferability congruently. We find contrastive learning\nintrinsically a suitable candidate for domain adaptation, as its instance\ninvariance assumption can be conveniently promoted to cross-domain class-level\ninvariance favored by domain adaptation tasks. Based on particular memory bank\nconstructions and pseudo label strategies, TCL then penalizes cross-domain\nintra-class domain discrepancy between source and target through a clean and\nnovel contrastive loss. The free lunch is, thanks to the incorporation of\ncontrastive learning, TCL relies on a moving-averaged key encoder that\nnaturally achieves a temporally ensembled version of pseudo labels for target\ndata, which avoids pseudo label error propagation at no extra cost. TCL\ntherefore efficiently reduces cross-domain gaps. Through extensive experiments\non benchmarks (Office-Home, VisDA-2017, Digits-five, PACS and DomainNet) for\nboth single-source and multi-source domain adaptation tasks, TCL has\ndemonstrated state-of-the-art performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Our framework is motivated by the fact that the risk-neutral LQ\ncontrollers, although optimal in expectation, might be ineffective under\nrelatively infrequent, yet statistically significant extreme events. To\neffectively trade between average and extreme event performance, we introduce a\nnew risk constraint, which explicitly restricts the total expected predictive\nvariance of the state penalty by a user-prescribed level. We show that, under\ncertain conditions on the process noise, the optimal risk-aware controller can\nbe evaluated explicitly and in closed form. In fact, it is affine relative to\nthe minimum mean square error (mmse) state estimate. The affine term pushes the\nstate away from directions where the noise exhibits heavy tails, by exploiting\nthe third-order moment~(skewness) of the noise. The linear term regulates the\nstate more strictly in riskier directions, where both the prediction error\n(conditional) covariance and the state penalty are simultaneously large; this\nis achieved by inflating the state penalty within a new filtered Riccati\ndifference equation.

So far, comparative studies of cancer genes have focused on mammals.\nHere, we provide the first comparative study of cancer-related gene copy number\nvariation in fish. As fish are evolutionarily older and genetically more\ndiverse than mammals, their tumour suppression mechanisms should not only\ninclude most of the mammalian mechanisms, but also reveal novel (but\npotentially phylogenetically older) previously undetected mechanisms. We have\nmatched the sequenced genomes of 65 fish species from the Ensemble database\nwith the cancer gene information from the COSMIC database. By calculating the\nnumber of gene copies across species using the Ensembl CAFE data (providing\nspecies trees for gene copy number counts), we were able to develop a novel,\nless resource demanding method for ortholog identification. Our analysis\ndemonstrates a masked relationship with cancer-related gene copy number\nvariation (CNV) and maximum lifespan in fish species, suggesting that higher\ntumour suppressor gene CNV lengthens and oncogene CNV shortens lifespan, when\nboth traits are added to the model. Based on the correlation between tumour\nsuppressor and oncogene CNV, we were able to show which species have more\ntumour suppressors in relation to oncogenes. It could therefore be suggested\nthat these species have stronger genetic defences against oncogenic processes.\nFish studies could yet be a largely unexplored treasure trove for understanding\nthe evolution and ecology of cancer, by providing novel insights into the study\nof cancer and tumour suppression, in addition to the study of fish evolution,\nlife-history trade-offs, and ecology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 17:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In this article, we construct the minimal\nembedding of the Standard Model (SM) into D-brane configurations with a gauged\nlepton number. In order to give rise to such KK modes, the lepton number gauge\nboson must live on an abelian $U(1)_L$ brane extended along at least one\n\"large\" extra dimension in the bulk, with a compactification scale\n$M_L\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10-10^2~{\\rm GeV})$ for a string scale $M_s\\sim 10~{\\rm\nTeV}$.

We prove that $S_n$-CQA\nare dense, thus expressible within each $S_n$-irrep block, which may serve as a\nuniversal model for potential future quantum machine learning and optimization\napplications. Our method provides another way to prove the universality of\nQuantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), from the\nrepresentation-theoretical point of view. Our framework can be naturally\napplied to a wide array of problems with global $\\operatorname{SU}(d)$\nsymmetry. We present numerical simulations to showcase the effectiveness of the\nans\\\"atze to find the sign structure of the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the rectangular and Kagome lattices.

In this paper, we first\npropose a new generation hybrid botnet that covertly and efficiently\ncommunicates over Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), called LNBot. Exploiting\nvarious anonymity features of LN, we show the feasibility of a scalable\ntwo-layer botnet which completely anonymizes the identity of the botmaster. In\nthe first layer, the botmaster anonymously sends the commands to the command\nand control (C&C) servers through regular LN payments. Specifically, LNBot\nallows botmaster's commands to be sent in the form of surreptitious multi-hop\nLN payments, where the commands are either encoded with the payments or\nattached to the payments to provide covert communications. In the second layer,\nC&C servers further relay those commands to the bots in their mini-botnets to\nlaunch any type of attacks to victim machines. We further improve on this\ndesign by introducing D-LNBot; a distributed version of LNBot that generates\nits C&C servers by infecting users on the Internet and forms the C&C\nconnections by opening channels to the existing nodes on LN. In contrary to the\nLNBot, the whole botnet formation phase is distributed and the botmaster is\nnever involved in the process. By utilizing Bitcoin's Testnet and the new\nmessage attachment feature of LN, we show that D-LNBot can be run for free and\ncommands are propagated faster to all the C&C servers compared to LNBot. We\npresented proof-of-concept implementations for both LNBot and D-LNBot on the\nactual LN and extensively analyzed their delay and cost performance. Finally,\nwe also provide and discuss a list of potential countermeasures to detect LNBot\nand D-LNBot activities and minimize their impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 18:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 15:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

We consider the effects of \"radio selection\", wherein FRBs with larger\ndispersion measures and scattering timescales are less likely to be detected,\nand the effects of \"optical selection\", wherein FRBs with fainter host galaxies\nare more likely to have unidentified or mis-identified hosts. We develop a\nplausible, illustrative model for these effects in observations of FRBs and\ntheir host galaxies by combining the output catalogues of a semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation model with a recently developed algorithm to associate FRBs\nwith host galaxies (PATH). We find that optical selection biases are most\nimportant for the host-galaxy $M_{*}$ and SFR distributions, and that radio\nselection biases are most important for the distribution of FRB projected\nphysical offsets. For our fiducial simulation of FRBs at $z<0.5$, the selection\nbiases cause the median host-galaxy SFR to be increased by $\\sim0.3$ dex, and\nthe median $M_{*}$ by $\\sim0.5$ dex. The median projected physical offset is\nincreased by $\\sim2$ kpc ($\\sim0.25$ dex).

Since these planets are\nexpected to rotate about axes normal to their orbital planes, with rotation\nperiods synchronized with their orbital periods, mapping provides a direct\ncorrespondence between orbital phase and planetary longitude. For planets with\nfewer constraints on their spin properties, the relationship between the shape\nof the eclipse light curve and the visible portion of the surface is more\ncomplex. We develop a framework to understand the information content of\nplanets where the rotation rate and/or axis orientation are not well\nconstrained, by constructing a basis of emission time series (\"light curves\")\nthat are orthogonal in integrated flux across secondary eclipse. The most\northogonal bases in eclipse consist of periodic functions - akin to sinusoids -\nand at slow enough rotation rates these follow a monotonic series in frequency.\nIf only data during eclipse are considered, we show that very similar light\ncurves at a given frequency can be generated by maps of similar complexity at a\nwide range of spin axis orientations. Constraining spin axis orientations from\neclipse data alone may therefore depend on strong prior knowledge of plausible\nemission map structures and/or rotation rates. When the planetary rotation\nperiod becomes shorter than the total eclipse duration, there will be an\nadditional ambiguity between the complexity of the emission map and observable\nvariations due to rotation, as both can in principle generate similar signals.\nBy modeling example eclipse observations of the Warm Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we\ndemonstrate that the available signal-to-noise for $\\sim 10$ orbits is just\nsufficient to derive map structure beyond the eclipse depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 18:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The mass of dark matter candidates can span a wide range, and its\ncoupling with the Standard Model sector remains uncertain.

Ultralight dark matter,\nwith $m \\sim10^{-22}$ eV, is proposed to reconcile the disagreements between\nobservations and predictions from simulations of small-scale structures in the\ncold dark matter paradigm, while remaining consistent with other observations.\nBecause of its large de Broglie wavelength and large local occupation number\nwithin galaxies, ultralight dark matter behaves like a coherently oscillating\nbackground field with an oscillating frequency dependent on its mass. If the\ndark matter particle is a spin-1 dark photon, such as the $U(1)_B$ or\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, it can induce an external oscillating force and lead\nto displacements of test masses.

No comprehensive work has been done to explore the s-process in\nthese types of stars, however one particular RCB star, U Aqr, has been under\nscrutiny for its extraordinary Sr enhancement. Aims: We aim to identify RCB and\ndLHdC stars that have significantly enhanced Sr abundances, such as U Aqr, and\nuse stellar evolution models to begin to estimate the type of neutron exposure\nthat occurs in a typical HdC star. Methods: We compare the strength of the Sr\nII 4077 $\\AA$ spectral line to Ca II H to identify the new subclass of Sr-rich\nHdCs. We additionally use the structural and abundance information from\nexisting RCB MESA models to calculate the neutron exposure parameter, $\\tau$\nResults: We identify six stars in the Sr-rich class. Two are RCBs, and four are\ndLHdCs. We additionally find that the preferred RCB MESA model has a neutron\nexposure $\\tau$ ~ 0.1 mb$^{-1}$, which is lower than the estimated $\\tau$\nbetween 0.15 and 0.6 mb$^{-1}$ for the Sr-rich star U Aqr found in the\nliterature. We find trends in the neutron exposure corresponding to He-burning\nshell temperature, metallicity, and assumed s-processing site. Conclusions: We\nhave found a sub-class of 6 HdCs known as the Sr-rich class, which tend to lie\nin the halo, outside the typical distribution of RCBs and dLHdCs. We find that\ndLHdC stars are more likely to be Sr-rich than RCBs, with an occurrence rate of\n~13\\% for dLHdCs and ~2\\% for RCBs.

Typically this control is achieved through strain or\nexternal electric fields, which require energy consumption to be maintained. On\nthe contrary, a non-volatile mechanism would be highly beneficial and could be\nrealized through ferroelectricity if opposite polarization states are\nassociated with different topological phases. While this is not possible in a\nsingle ferroelectric material where the two polarization states are related by\ninversion, the necessary asymmetry could be introduced by combining a\nferroelectric layer with another two-dimensional (2D) trivial insulator. Here,\nby means of first-principles simulations, not only we propose that this is a\npromising strategy to engineer non-volatile ferroelectric control of\ntopological order in 2D heterostructures, but also that the effect is robust\nand can survive up to room temperature, irrespective of the weak van der Waals\ncoupling between the layers. We illustrate the general idea by considering a\nheterostructure made of a well-known ferroelectric material, In$_2$Se$_3$, and\na suitably chosen, easily exfoliable trivial insulator, CuI. In one\npolarization state the system is trivial, while it becomes a QSHI with a robust\nband gap upon polarization reversal. Remarkably, the topological band gap is\nmediated by the interlayer hybridization and allows to maximise the effect of\nintralayer spin-orbit coupling, promoting a robust ferroelectric topological\nphase that could not exist in monolayer materials and is resilient against\nrelative orientation and lattice matching between the layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 12:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Model-based RL\nalgorithms hold promise for reducing unsafe real-world actions: they may\nsynthesize policies that obey all constraints using simulated samples from a\nlearned model. However, imperfect models can result in real-world constraint\nviolations even for actions that are predicted to satisfy all constraints. We\npropose Conservative and Adaptive Penalty (CAP), a model-based safe RL\nframework that accounts for potential modeling errors by capturing model\nuncertainty and adaptively exploiting it to balance the reward and the cost\nobjectives. First, CAP inflates predicted costs using an uncertainty-based\npenalty. Theoretically, we show that policies that satisfy this conservative\ncost constraint are guaranteed to also be feasible in the true environment. We\nfurther show that this guarantees the safety of all intermediate solutions\nduring RL training. Further, CAP adaptively tunes this penalty during training\nusing true cost feedback from the environment. We evaluate this conservative\nand adaptive penalty-based approach for model-based safe RL extensively on\nstate and image-based environments. Our results demonstrate substantial gains\nin sample-efficiency while incurring fewer violations than prior safe RL\nalgorithms.

The antibiotic TB drugs require\nstrict adherence to prevent both disease relapse and mutation of drug- and\nmultidrug-resistant strains. To overcome the constraints of pathogen-directed\ntherapy, host-directed therapy has attracted more attention in recent years as\nan adjunct therapy to enhance host immunity to fight against this intractable\npathogen. The goal of this paper is to investigate in-host tuberculosis models\nto provide insights into therapy development.

Interestingly, the ODE model also demonstrates\nthat the immune responses can both benefit and impede disease progression,\ndepending on the number of bacteria engulfed and released by macrophages.

To date, the exact\naccretion mechanism of the system is still unknown, and standard accretion\nmodels fail to accurately predict the peculiar behavior of its lightcurve. We\npresent the K2 Campaign~11 light curve of V2400 Oph recording 74.19 days of\nphotometric data cadenced at 1 minute. The light curve is dominated by\naperiodic flickering and quasi-periodic oscillations, which make the beat and\nspin signals inconspicuous on short timescales. Notably, a log-log full power\nspectrum shows a break frequency at $\\sim10^2$ cycles~d$^{-1}$ similar to some\ndisk-fed systems. Through power spectral analysis, the beat and spin periods\nare measured as $1003.4\\pm0.2$ seconds and $ 927.7\\pm 0.1$ seconds\nrespectively. A power spectrum of the entire K2 observation demonstrates beat\nperiod dominance. However, time-resolved power spectra reveals a strong\ndependence between observation length and the dominant frequency of the light\ncurve. For short observations (2-12 hrs) the beat, spin, or first beat harmonic\ncan be observed as the dominant periodic signal. Such incoherence and\nvariability indicate a dynamical accretion system more complex than current\nintermediate polar theories can explain.

These zeroth-order optimizers require\nsampling a large number of trajectory rollouts to select an optimal action,\nwhich scales poorly for large prediction horizons or high dimensional action\nspaces. First-order methods that use the gradients of the rewards with respect\nto the actions as an update can mitigate this issue, but suffer from local\noptima due to the non-convex optimization landscape. To overcome these issues\nand achieve the best of both worlds, we propose a novel planner, Cross-Entropy\nMethod with Gradient Descent (CEM-GD), that combines first-order methods with\nCEM. At the beginning of execution, CEM-GD uses CEM to sample a significant\namount of trajectory rollouts to explore the optimization landscape and avoid\npoor local minima. It then uses the top trajectories as initialization for\ngradient descent and applies gradient updates to each of these trajectories to\nfind the optimal action sequence. At each subsequent time step, however, CEM-GD\nsamples much fewer trajectories from CEM before applying gradient updates. We\nshow that as the dimensionality of the planning problem increases, CEM-GD\nmaintains desirable performance with a constant small number of samples by\nusing the gradient information, while avoiding local optima using initially\nwell-sampled trajectories. Furthermore, CEM-GD achieves better performance than\nCEM on a variety of continuous control benchmarks in MuJoCo with 100x fewer\nsamples per time step, resulting in around 25% less computation time and 10%\nless memory usage.

This mechanism is at the origin of defect modes in photonic\nbandgaps, bound states in the continuum and compact localised states in flat\nbands. Here we show that in lattices of lossy resonators, the addition of\nexternal optical drives with controlled phase enlarges the possibilities of\nmanipulating interference effects and allows designing novel types of localised\nmodes. Using a honeycomb lattice of coupled micropillars resonantly driven with\nseveral laser spots at energies within its photonic bands we demonstrate the\nlocalisation of light in at-will geometries down to a single site. These\nlocalised modes can be seen as fully reconfigurable optical cavities with the\npotentiality of enhancing nonlinear effects and of controlling light-matter\ninteractions with single site resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 21:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

We briefly\nreview the definition of separate exchangeability. We then discuss two specific\nmodels that implement separate exchangeability. One example is about nested\nrandom partitions for a data matrix, defining a partition of columns and nested\npartitions of rows, nested within column clusters. Many recently proposed\nmodels for nested partitions implement partially exchangeable models.

Recent\nendeavors based on network controllability provided fresh insights into the\npotential ability of single regions to influence whole brain dynamics through\nthe underlying structural connectome. However, controlling the entire brain\nactivity is often unfeasible and might not always be necessary. The question\nwhether single areas can control specific target subsystems remains crucial,\nalbeit still poorly explored. Furthermore, the structure of the brain network\nexhibits progressive changes across the lifespan, but little is known about the\npossible consequences in the controllability properties. To address these\nquestions, we adopted a novel target controllability approach that quantifies\nthe centrality of brain nodes in controlling specific target anatomo-functional\nsystems. We then studied such target control centrality in human connectomes\nobtained from healthy individuals aged from 5 to 85. Main results showed that\nthe sensorimotor system has a high influencing capacity, but it is difficult\nfor other areas to influence it.

By simulating targeted attacks, such as those 19 occurring in focal\nstroke, we showed that the ipsilesional hemisphere is the most affected one\nregardless of the damaged area.

Such division of a player move\ninto a sequence of simpler / lower level moves is called \\emph{splitting}. So\nfar, split moves have been applied only in forementioned straightforward cases,\nand furthermore, there was almost no study revealing its impact on agents'\nplaying strength. Taking the knowledge-free perspective, we aim to answer how\nto effectively use split moves within Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and what\nis the practical impact of split design on agents' strength. This paper\nproposes a generalization of MCTS that works with arbitrarily split moves.

The tests are carried out on a set of board games and\nperformed using the Regular Boardgames General Game Playing formalism, where\nsplit strategies of different granularity can be automatically derived based on\nan abstract description of the game. The results give an overview of the\nbehavior of agents using split design in different ways.

Human interaction with autonomous systems is broadly studied, but\nresearch has hitherto under-explored interactions that occur while the system\nis actively learning, and can noticeably change its behaviour in minutes. In\nthis pilot study, we investigate how the interaction between a human and a\ncontinually learning prediction agent develops as the agent develops\ncompetency. Additionally, we compare two different agent architectures to\nassess how representational choices in agent design affect the human-agent\ninteraction. We develop a virtual reality environment and a time-based\nprediction task wherein learned predictions from a reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithm augment human predictions. We assess how a participant's performance\nand behaviour in this task differs across agent types, using both quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our findings suggest that human trust of the system\nmay be influenced by early interactions with the agent, and that trust in turn\naffects strategic behaviour, but limitations of the pilot study rule out any\nconclusive statement. We identify trust as a key feature of interaction to\nfocus on when considering RL-based technologies, and make several\nrecommendations for modification to this study in preparation for a\nlarger-scale investigation.

We analysed the dependence of the osculating orbital elements and of\nthe observables on true anomaly, and we compared these functions for models\nwith and without extended mass. We then translated the maximum astrometric\nimpacts within one orbit to detection thresholds given hypothetical data of\ndifferent accuracies. These theoretical investigations were then supported and\ncomplemented by an extensive mock-data fitting analysis.\n  Results. We have four main results. 1. While the mass precession almost\nexclusively impacts the orbit in the apocentre half, the Schwarzschild\nprecession almost exclusively impacts it in the pericentre half, allowing for a\nclear separation of the effects. 2. Data that are limited to the pericentre\nhalf are not sensitive to a dark mass, while data limited to the apocentre half\nare, but only to a limited extent. 3. A full orbit of data is required to\nsubstantially constrain a dark mass. 4.

However, these estimates lack transparency and are\nfrequently used in the investment decisions process with the same confidence as\ncorporate reported data.

Yet, these models often struggle with simultaneously addressing three\nkey requirements including: high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast\nsampling. We call the challenge imposed by these requirements the generative\nlearning trilemma, as the existing models often trade some of them for others.\nParticularly, denoising diffusion models have shown impressive sample quality\nand diversity, but their expensive sampling does not yet allow them to be\napplied in many real-world applications. In this paper, we argue that slow\nsampling in these models is fundamentally attributed to the Gaussian assumption\nin the denoising step which is justified only for small step sizes. To enable\ndenoising with large steps, and hence, to reduce the total number of denoising\nsteps, we propose to model the denoising distribution using a complex\nmultimodal distribution. We introduce denoising diffusion generative\nadversarial networks (denoising diffusion GANs) that model each denoising step\nusing a multimodal conditional GAN. Through extensive evaluations, we show that\ndenoising diffusion GANs obtain sample quality and diversity competitive with\noriginal diffusion models while being 2000$\\times$ faster on the CIFAR-10\ndataset. Compared to traditional GANs, our model exhibits better mode coverage\nand sample diversity. To the best of our knowledge, denoising diffusion GAN is\nthe first model that reduces sampling cost in diffusion models to an extent\nthat allows them to be applied to real-world applications inexpensively.\nProject page and code can be found at\nhttps://nvlabs.github.io/denoising-diffusion-gan\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 18:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

This approach recognises that extinction not only\nremoves species but also the branches of the tree on which unique features\nshared by the extinct species arose. In this paper, we investigate three\nquestions that are relevant to PD. The first asks how many sets of species of\ngiven size $k$ preserve the maximum possible amount of PD in a given tree. The\nnumber of such maximum PD sets can be very large, even for moderate-sized\nphylogenies. We provide a combinatorial characterisation of maximum PD sets,\nfocusing on the setting where the branch lengths are ultrametric (e.g.\nproportional to time). This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for\ncalculating the number of maximum PD sets of size $k$ by applying a generating\nfunction; we also investigate the types of tree shapes that harbour the most\n(or fewest) maximum PD sets of size $k$. Our second question concerns\noptimising a linear function on the species (regarded as leaves of the\nphylogenetic tree) across all the maximum PD sets of a given size. Using the\ncharacterisation result from the first question, we show how this optimisation\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time, even though the number of maximum PD\nsets can grow exponentially. Our third question considers a dual problem: If\n$k$ species were to become extinct, then what is the largest possible {\\em\nloss} of PD in the resulting tree? For this question, we describe a\npolynomial-time solution based on dynamical programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 03:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Different from\nthat usual setting, this work considers the tempered time-fractional operator,\nwhich reflects a finite waiting time probability density. Firstly, we analyse\nthe solution of a tempered benchmark problem, which shows a weak singularity\nnear the initial time. The L1 scheme on graded mesh and the WSGL formula with\ncorrection terms are adapted to deal with the non-smooth solution, in which we\ncompare these two methods systematically in terms of the convergence and\nconsumed CPU time. Furthermore, a fast calculation for the time tempered Caputo\nfractional derivative is developed based on a sum-of-exponentials\napproximation, which significantly reduces the running time.

We understand well how they use lateral body bending to push\nagainst asperities on flat ground for propulsion, and snake robots are already\neffective in this. Recent studies revealed that snakes also use vertical\nbending to push against uneven terrain of large height variation for propulsion\nand can adjust vertical bending to adapt to novel terrain, presumably using\nmechano-sensing feedback control. Although some snake robots can move through\nuneven terrain, few have deliberately used vertical bending for propulsion,\nlargely because how to control vertical bending to generate propulsion against\nthe environment is poorly understood. To make progress, here we systematically\nstudied a snake robot with force sensors traversing large obstacles using\nvertical bending. To test whether and how well sensory feedback control helps\nadapt to perturbations, we compared a feedforward and three feedback\ncontrollers that generate distinct bending patterns and body-terrain\ninteractions. To test whether and how well each controller adapts to various\nperturbations, we challenged the robot with various perturbations that break\nits contact with the terrain. Using feedforward propagation of a vertical\nbending shape, the robot could generate large propulsion when its bending shape\nconformed to the terrain. However, when contact was lost under perturbations,\nthe robot easily lost propulsion and overloaded its motors. Contact feedback\ncontrol helped the robot maintain propulsion by regaining contact. Unlike\npropulsion generation using lateral bending, during propulsion generation using\nvertical bending weight can help maintain contact with the environment but may\noverload actuators.

We present a model for epidemic spreading in temporal networks of\nmobile agents that incorporates local behavioral responses. Susceptible agents\nare allowed to move towards the opposite direction of infected agents in their\nneighborhood. We show that this mechanism considerably decreases the stationary\nprevalence when the spatial density of agents is low.

The applied magnetic field $h_z$ is parallel to\nthe anisotropy axis. It has been assumed that the variation of the band width\n$W$ is sensitive to pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, the increase\nof $W$ takes the system from the phase AF$_1$ to another phase AF$_2$.

Tracing text provenance can help claim the ownership of text\ncontent or identify the malicious users who distribute misleading content like\nmachine-generated fake news. There have been some attempts to achieve this,\nmainly based on watermarking techniques. Specifically, traditional text\nwatermarking methods embed watermarks by slightly altering text format like\nline spacing and font, which, however, are fragile to cross-media transmissions\nlike OCR. Considering this, natural language watermarking methods represent\nwatermarks by replacing words in original sentences with synonyms from\nhandcrafted lexical resources (e.g., WordNet), but they do not consider the\nsubstitution's impact on the overall sentence's meaning. Recently, a\ntransformer-based network was proposed to embed watermarks by modifying the\nunobtrusive words (e.g., function words), which also impair the sentence's\nlogical and semantic coherence. Besides, one well-trained network fails on\nother different types of text content. To address the limitations mentioned\nabove, we propose a natural language watermarking scheme based on context-aware\nlexical substitution (LS).

Based on this, a selection strategy in terms of\nsynchronicity and substitutability is further designed to test whether a word\nis exactly suitable for carrying the watermark signal. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that, under both objective and subjective metrics, our watermarking\nscheme can well preserve the semantic integrity of original sentences and has a\nbetter transferability than existing methods.

Without understanding their cost, crucial\ntradeoffs made by garbage collectors (GCs) go unnoticed. This can lead to\nmisguided design constraints and evaluation criteria used by GC researchers and\nusers, hindering the development of high-performance, low-cost GCs. In this\npaper, we develop a methodology that allows us to empirically estimate the cost\nof GC for any given set of metrics. By distilling out the explicitly\nidentifiable GC cost, we estimate the intrinsic application execution cost\nusing different GCs. The minimum distilled cost forms a baseline. Subtracting\nthis baseline from the total execution costs, we can then place an empirical\nlower bound on the absolute costs of different GCs. Using this methodology, we\nstudy five production GCs in OpenJDK 17, a high-performance Java runtime. We\nmeasure the cost of these collectors, and expose their respective key\nperformance tradeoffs. We find that with a modestly sized heap, production GCs\nincur substantial overheads across a diverse suite of modern benchmarks,\nspending at least 7-82% more wall-clock time and 6-92% more CPU cycles relative\nto the baseline cost. We show that these costs can be masked by concurrency and\ngenerous provisioning of memory/compute. In addition, we find that newer\nlow-pause GCs are significantly more expensive than older GCs, and,\nsurprisingly, sometimes deliver worse application latency than stop-the-world\nGCs. Our findings reaffirm that GC is by no means a solved problem and that a\nlow-cost, low-latency GC remains elusive. We recommend adopting the\ndistillation methodology together with a wider range of cost metrics for future\nGC evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 04:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 07:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Although robots are already excellent at avoiding sparse\nobstacles, they still struggle in traversing cluttered large obstacles. To make\nprogress, we need to better understand how to use and control the physical\ninteraction with obstacles to traverse them. Forest floor-dwelling cockroaches\ncan use physical interaction to transition between different locomotor modes to\ntraverse flexible, grass-like beams of a large range of stiffness. Inspired by\nthis, here we studied whether and how environmental force sensing helps robots\nmake active adjustments to traverse cluttered large obstacles. We developed a\nphysics model and a simulation of a minimalistic robot capable of sensing\nenvironmental forces during traversal of beam obstacles. Then, we developed a\nforce-feedback control strategy, which estimated beam stiffness from the sensed\ncontact force using the physics model. Then in simulation we used the estimated\nstiffness to control the robot to either stay in or transition to the more\nfavorable locomotor modes to traverse. When beams were stiff, force sensing\ninduced the robot to transition from a more costly pitch mode to a less costly\nroll mode, which helped the robot traverse with a higher success rate and less\nenergy consumed. By contrast, if the robot simply pushed forward or always\navoided obstacles, it would consume more energy, become stuck in front of\nbeams, or even flip over. When the beams were flimsy, force sensing guided the\nrobot to simply push across the beams. In addition, we demonstrated the\nrobustness of beam stiffness estimation against body oscillations, randomness\nin oscillation, and uncertainty in position sensing. We also found that a\nshorter sensorimotor delay reduced energy cost of traversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 05:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 02:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Most of existing contrastive models for graph\nrepresentation learning either focus on maximizing mutual information between\nlocal and global embeddings, or primarily depend on contrasting embeddings at\nnode level. However, they are still not exquisite enough to comprehensively\nexplore the local and global views of network topology. Although the former\nconsiders local-global relationship, its coarse global information leads to\ngrudging cooperation between local and global views. The latter pays attention\nto node-level feature alignment, so that the role of global view appears\ninconspicuous. To avoid falling into these two extreme cases, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised graph representation model by contrasting cluster\nassignments, called as GRCCA. It is motivated to make good use of local and\nglobal information synthetically through combining clustering algorithms and\ncontrastive learning. This not only facilitates the contrastive effect, but\nalso provides the more high-quality graph information. Meanwhile, GRCCA further\nexcavates cluster-level information, which make it get insight to the elusive\nassociation between nodes beyond graph topology. Specifically, we first\ngenerate two augmented graphs with distinct graph augmentation strategies, then\nemploy clustering algorithms to obtain their cluster assignments and prototypes\nrespectively. The proposed GRCCA further compels the identical nodes from\ndifferent augmented graphs to recognize their cluster assignments mutually by\nminimizing a cross entropy loss. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we compare\nwith the state-of-the-art models in three different downstream tasks. The\nexperimental results show that GRCCA has strong competitiveness in most tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 07:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

In one-player case, i.e., constrained discounted Markov decision\nmodels, it is possible to formulate a static optimisation problem whose\nsolution determines a stationary optimal strategy (alias control or policy) in\nthe dynamical infinite horizon model. This solution lies in the compact convex\nset of all occupation measures induced by strategies, defined on the set of\nstate-action pairs. In case of n-person discounted games the occupation\nmeasures are induced by strategies of all players. Therefore, it is difficult\nto generalise the approach for constrained discounted Markov decision processes\ndirectly. It is not clear how to define the domain for the best-response\ncorrespondence whose fixed point induces a stationary equilibrium in the Markov\ngame. This domain should be the Cartesian product of compact convex sets in\nlocally convex topological vector spaces. One of our main results shows how to\novercome this difficulty and define a constrained non-cooperative static game\nwhose Nash equilibrium induces by a stationary Nash equilibrium in the Markov\ngame. This is done for games with bounded cost functions and positive initial\nstate distribution. An extension to a class of Markov games with unbounded\ncosts and arbitrary initial state distribution relies on approximation of the\nunbounded game by bounded ones with positive initial state distributions. In\nthe unbounded case, we assume the uniform integrability of the discounted costs\nwith respect to all probability measures induced by strategies of the players,\ndefined on the space of plays (histories) of the game.

This task has two\ncharacteristics: 1) the zero-shot setting requires a metric space with good\nwithin-class compactness and the between-class discrepancy for recognizing the\nnovel classes and 2) the sketch query and the photo gallery are in different\nmodalities. The metric learning viewpoint benefits ZS-SBIR from two aspects.\nFirst, it facilitates improvement through recent good practices in deep metric\nlearning (DML). By combining two fundamental learning approaches in DML, e.g.,\nclassification training and pairwise training, we set up a strong baseline for\nZS-SBIR. Without bells and whistles, this baseline achieves competitive\nretrieval accuracy. Second, it provides an insight that properly suppressing\nthe modality gap is critical. To this end, we design a novel method named\nModality-Aware Triplet Hard Mining (MATHM). MATHM enhances the baseline with\nthree types of pairwise learning, e.g., a cross-modality sample pair, a\nwithin-modality sample pair, and their combination.\\We also design an adaptive\nweighting method to balance these three components during training dynamically.\nExperimental results confirm that MATHM brings another round of significant\nimprovement based on the strong baseline and sets up new state-of-the-art\nperformance.

The magneto-electrocaloric\neffect of a multiferroic antiferromagnetic spin system with the Dzyaloshinskii\nMoriya (DM) interaction is investigated in this paper. The DM interaction is\nassimilated to a coupling between an external site-dependent electric field and\na local electric polarization. The external magnetic is also considered as a\nsite-dependent magnetic field. The spin-wave theory is used as a\ndiagonalization method and through the canonical partition function, some\nthermodynamic properties such as the Boltzmann entropy and the specific heat\ncapacity are obtained. Then, the adiabatic magnetic, electric, and\nmagnetoelectric cooling rates are also derived. The graphs obtained for the\nadiabatic magnetic, electric, and magnetoelectric cooling rate show a\ncharacteristic behavior of the caloric or multi-caloric effect which is in good\nagreement with some experimental and theoretical works. Besides, the entropy\nresponse due to the variation of the external site-dependent magnetic field\nexhibits two anomalous entropy peaks indicating the existence of an\nintermediate phase tuneable by the magnetic and electric site-dependent\nparameters. Overall, it is demonstrated that the cumulative influence of the\nsite-dependent magnetic and electric fields allows us not only to reveal\nquantum critical points hidden in a multiferroic quantum spin system but also\nto control the caloric or multi-caloric effect essential in the construction of\nsolid-state refrigeration devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 08:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

In the case of the time domain radiating system, the\nparameter studied is the action, A, associated with the radiation. The action\nis defined as the product of the energy and the duration of the radiation. In\nthe case of the frequency domain radiating system, which produces radiation in\nbursts of duration T/2 where T is the period of oscillation, the parameter\nstudied is the energy, U, dissipated in a single burst of radiation of duration\nT/2. In this paper, we have studied how A and U vary as a function of the\ncharge associated with the current in the radiating system and the ratio of the\nlength of the radiating system and its radius. We have observed remarkable\nresults when this ratio is equal to the ratio of the radius of the universe to\nthe Bohr radius.

We show that such a\nprescription can be implemented in the presence of a scalar field. For\nconcreteness, we consider the model of Garay et al., in which the potential is\na sum of exponentials, and which lends itself to an analytical treatment.\nCompared to the earlier implementation, we find that saddle points with\nunstable fluctuations can be eliminated by imposition of an appropriate\nregularity condition. This leads to the appearance of additional saddle points,\ncorresponding to unclosed geometries. We argue that such saddles will occur\ngenerically, though we also find in our example that they are subdominant to\nthe closed, Hartle-Hawking, saddle points. When the potential is positive,\nclassical spacetime is only predicted for inflationary histories. When the\npotential is negative, we recover the AdS gravitational path integral, with a\nstable scalar field included. One puzzle that we find is that in general the\npath integral must be restricted to sum only over specific, discrete and late\ntime dependent initial values of the scalar field. Only when the scalar is\nrequired to take real values is this puzzle eliminated, a situation that\nmoreover leads to advantageous phenomenological characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 09:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

A key feature of the signals generated within the TPC is that they\nallow localization of particle interactions through a process called\nreconstruction. While multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have emerged as a leading\ncontender for reconstruction in TPCs, such a black-box approach does not\nreflect prior knowledge of the underlying scientific processes. This paper\nlooks anew at neural network-based interaction localization and encodes prior\ndetector knowledge, in terms of both signal characteristics and detector\ngeometry, into the feature encoding and the output layers of a multilayer\nneural network. The resulting Domain-informed Neural Network (DiNN) limits the\nreceptive fields of the neurons in the initial feature encoding layers in order\nto account for the spatially localized nature of the signals produced within\nthe TPC. This aspect of the DiNN, which has similarities with the emerging area\nof graph neural networks in that the neurons in the initial layers only connect\nto a handful of neurons in their succeeding layer, significantly reduces the\nnumber of parameters in the network in comparison to an MLP. In addition, in\norder to account for the detector geometry, the output layers of the network\nare modified using two geometric transformations to ensure the DiNN produces\nlocalizations within the interior of the detector. The end result is a neural\nnetwork architecture that has 60% fewer parameters than an MLP, but that still\nachieves similar localization performance and provides a path to future\narchitectural developments with improved performance because of their ability\nto encode additional domain knowledge into the architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 09:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 20:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

This debate is of central\nimportance for policy-makers and applied practitioners in health technology\nassessment. Misunderstandings are based on properties inherent to estimators,\nnot estimands, and on generalizing conclusions based on linear regression to\nnon-linear models. Estimators of marginal estimands need not be unadjusted and\nmay be covariate-adjusted. The population-level interpretation of conditional\nestimates follows from collapsibility and does not necessarily hold for the\nunderlying conditional estimands. For non-collapsible effect measures, neither\nconditional estimates nor estimands have a population-level interpretation.\nEstimators of marginal effects tend to be more precise and efficient than\nestimators of conditional effects where the measure of effect is\nnon-collapsible. In any case, such comparisons are inconsequential for\nestimators targeting distinct estimands. Statistical efficiency should not\ndrive the choice of the estimand. On the other hand, the estimand, selected on\nthe basis of relevance to decision-making, should drive the choice of the most\nefficient estimator. Health technology assessment agencies make reimbursement\ndecisions at the population level. Therefore, marginal estimands are required.\nCurrent pairwise population adjustment methods such as matching-adjusted\nindirect comparison are restricted to target marginal estimands that are\nspecific to the comparator study sample. These may not be relevant for\ndecision-making. Multilevel network meta-regression (ML-NMR) can potentially\ntarget marginal estimands in any population of interest. Such population could\nbe characterized by decision-makers using increasingly available \"real-world\"\ndata sources. Therefore, ML-NMR presents new directions and abundant\nopportunities for evidence synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 10:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 22:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 15:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Of particular interest\nare magnetic nanodisks, in which the vortex state emerges as a stable spin\nconfiguration. Here, we focus on how the vortex core polarisation can be\nreversed periodically by an oscillating magnetic field, applied perpendicularly\nto the disk's surface. By means of micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate\nthe presence of several subharmonic switching modes, i.e., the commensurate\nratio between the switching frequency of the core and the driving frequency.\nThe underlying mechanism of this periodic behaviour depends on the disk\nthickness. For thin disks, the core switches periodically due to resonant\nexcitation of radial spin wave modes, while it is due to the breathing mode in\nthe case of thick disks. However, overlap of both modes impedes periodic vortex\ncore switching. For thin disks, the threshold field amplitude required for\nperiodic switching can be lowered to about 30~mT by increasing the disk\ndiameter. For thick disks, in contrast, the minimal field is largely unaffected\nby the disk diameter, as only the energy density of a central region around the\nvortex core is relevant to excite the breathing mode.

A hallmark of\nthis dynamical heterogeneity is the spontaneous emergence of cooperative\nrearranging regions (CRRs) composed of fast moving particles. While these CRRs\nin passive glass formers have been explored in great detail, thus understanding\nis severely limited in active glass formers. The existing consensus on the\nmorphology of CRRs in a passive glass former prioritizes its fast subsets,\ncomposed of fast moving particles. In the present study, we focus on a\nsynthetic athermal active glass former and show an equal contribution for the\nmorphology of CRRs from slow subsets as well. Both these subsets exhibit an\nexponential distribution in their structure which strongly correlates with the\nexistence of CRRs.

More precisely, molecules\nare loosely bound in a structure for which boundary is rough and thereby this\ncondition facilitates its structural change in terms of size and shape.

One prominent technique for depth estimation\nis stereo matching which has several advantages: it is considered more\naccessible than other depth-sensing technologies, can produce dense depth\nestimates in real-time, and has benefited greatly from the advances of deep\nlearning in recent years. However, current techniques for depth estimation from\nstereoscopic images still suffer from a built-in drawback. To reconstruct\ndepth, a stereo matching algorithm first estimates the disparity map between\nthe left and right images before applying a geometric triangulation. A simple\nanalysis reveals that the depth error is quadratically proportional to the\nobject's distance. Therefore, constant disparity errors are translated to large\ndepth errors for objects far from the camera. To mitigate this quadratic\nrelation, we propose a simple but effective method that uses a refinement\nnetwork for depth estimation.

Extensive research has been\nconducted on single-mode demand prediction, ignoring the fact that the demands\nfor different transportation modes can be correlated with each other. Despite\nsome recent efforts, existing approaches to multimodal demand prediction are\ngenerally not flexible enough to account for multiplex networks with diverse\nspatial units and heterogeneous spatiotemporal correlations across different\nmodes. To tackle these issues, this study proposes a multi-relational\nspatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-MRGNN) for multimodal demand\nprediction. Specifically, the spatial dependencies across modes are encoded\nwith multiple intra- and inter-modal relation graphs. A multi-relational graph\nneural network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture cross-mode heterogeneous\nspatial dependencies, consisting of generalized graph convolution networks to\nlearn the message passing mechanisms within relation graphs and an\nattention-based aggregation module to summarize different relations. We further\nintegrate MRGNNs with temporal gated convolution layers to jointly model\nheterogeneous spatiotemporal correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted\nusing real-world subway and ride-hailing datasets from New York City, and the\nresults verify the improved performance of our proposed approach over existing\nmethods across modes. The improvement is particularly large for demand-sparse\nlocations. Further analysis of the attention mechanisms of ST-MRGNN also\ndemonstrates its good interpretability for understanding cross-mode\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 12:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

In this regard, we propose a new efficient method for sympathetic\ncooling of ions: the use for this purpose of cold buffer atoms in the region of\natom-ion confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) [V.S.

We investigate the effect of\nsympathetic cooling around CIRs in atom-ion, and atom-atom confined collisions\nwithin the quantum-quasiclassical approach using the Li-Yb$^+$ and Li-Yb\nconfined systems as an example. In this approach, the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nfor a cold light atom is integrated simultaneously with the classical Hamilton\nequations for a hotter heavy-ion or atom during a collision.

We perform Monte Carlo exercises to demonstrate the gain in power\nfrom testing restrictions jointly and distillation. We apply our test procedure\nto the college proximity instrument of Card1 (1993), the same-sex instrument of\nAngrist and Evans (1998), the school leaving age instrument of Oreopoulos\n(2006), and the mean land gradient instrument of Dinkelman (2011). We find that\nthe null of instrument validity conditional on covariates cannot be rejected\nfor Card (1993) and Dinkelman (2011), but it can be rejected at the 10% level\nof significance for Angrist and Evans (1998) for some levels of a tuning\nparameter, and it is rejected at all conventional levels of significance in the\ncase of Oreopoulos (2006).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 13:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

To this aim, several methods such as\nevolutionary strategies, random search, Bayesian optimization and heuristic\nrules of thumb have been proposed. In reinforcement learning (RL), the\ninformation content of data gathered by the learning agent while interacting\nwith its environment is heavily dependent on the setting of many\nhyper-parameters. Therefore, the user of an RL algorithm has to rely on\nsearch-based optimization methods, such as grid search or the Nelder-Mead\nsimplex algorithm, that are very inefficient for most RL tasks, slows down\nsignificantly the learning curve and leaves to the user the burden of\npurposefully biasing data gathering. In this work, in order to make an RL\nalgorithm more user-independent, a novel approach for autonomous\nhyper-parameter setting using Bayesian optimization is proposed. Data from past\nepisodes and different hyper-parameter values are used at a meta-learning level\nby performing behavioral cloning which helps improving the effectiveness in\nmaximizing a reinforcement learning variant of an acquisition function. Also,\nby tightly integrating Bayesian optimization in a reinforcement learning agent\ndesign, the number of state transitions needed to converge to the optimal\npolicy for a given task is reduced. Computational experiments reveal promising\nresults compared to other manual tweaking and optimization-based approaches\nwhich highlights the benefits of changing the algorithm hyper-parameters to\nincrease the information content of generated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 13:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

One widely adopted assumption of depth and\nego-motion self-supervised learning is that the image brightness remains\nconstant within nearby frames. Unfortunately, the endoscopic scene does not\nmeet this assumption because there are severe brightness fluctuations induced\nby illumination variations, non-Lambertian reflections and interreflections\nduring data collection, and these brightness fluctuations inevitably\ndeteriorate the depth and ego-motion estimation accuracy. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel concept referred to as appearance flow to address the\nbrightness inconsistency problem. The appearance flow takes into consideration\nany variations in the brightness pattern and enables us to develop a\ngeneralized dynamic image constraint. Furthermore, we build a unified\nself-supervised framework to estimate monocular depth and ego-motion\nsimultaneously in endoscopic scenes, which comprises a structure module, a\nmotion module, an appearance module and a correspondence module, to accurately\nreconstruct the appearance and calibrate the image brightness. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on the SCARED dataset and EndoSLAM dataset, and the\nproposed unified framework exceeds other self-supervised approaches by a large\nmargin. To validate our framework's generalization ability on different\npatients and cameras, we train our model on SCARED but test it on the SERV-CT\nand Hamlyn datasets without any fine-tuning, and the superior results reveal\nits strong generalization ability.

Previous CRSs use knowledge graph (KG) based\nrecommendation modules and integrate KG with language models for response\ngeneration. Although KG-based approaches prove effective, two issues remain to\nbe solved. First, KG-based approaches ignore the information in the\nconversational context but only rely on entity relations and bag of words to\nrecommend items. Second, it requires substantial engineering efforts to\nmaintain KGs that model domain-specific relations, thus leading to less\nflexibility. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture\ncomprising a pre-trained language model (PLM) and an item metadata encoder. The\nencoder learns to map item metadata to embeddings that can reflect the semantic\ninformation in the dialog context. The PLM then consumes the semantic-aligned\nitem embeddings together with dialog context to generate high-quality\nrecommendations and responses. Instead of modeling entity relations with KGs,\nour model reduces engineering complexity by directly converting each item to an\nembedding.

In this\ntheory, the galaxy-wide IMF is calculated by summing all the IMFs in all\nembedded star clusters which formed throughout the galaxy in 10 Myr time\nepochs. The GalIMF code recalculates the galaxy-wide IMF at each time step\nbecause the integrated galaxy-wide IMF depends on the galactic star formation\nrate and metallicity.

However, study heterogeneity of two association studies required in\nMR is often overlooked. When dealing with large studies, recently developed\nBayesian MR is limited by its computational expensiveness. Methods: We\naddressed study heterogeneity by proposing a random effect Bayesian MR model\nwith multiple exposures and outcomes. For large studies, we adopted a subset\nposterior aggregation method to tackle the problem of computation. In\nparticular, we divided data into subsets and combine estimated subset causal\neffects obtained from the subsets\". The performance of our method was evaluated\nby a number of simulations, in which part of exposure data was missing.\nResults: Random effect Bayesian MR outperformed conventional inverse-variance\nweighted estimation, whether the true causal effects are zero or non-zero. Data\npartitioning of large studies had little impact on variations of the estimated\ncausal effects, whereas it notably affected unbiasedness of the estimates with\nweak instruments and high missing rate of data. Our simulation results indicate\nthat data partitioning is a good way of improving computational efficiency, for\nlittle cost of decrease in unbiasedness of the estimates, as long as the sample\nsize of subsets is reasonably large. Conclusions: We have further advanced\nBayesian MR by including random effects to explicitly account for study\nheterogeneity. We also adopted a subset posterior aggregation method to address\nthe issue of computational expensiveness of MCMC, which is important especially\nwhen dealing with large studies.

Through extensive experiments on different MT\nbenchmarks, we show that \\textbf{Faster $k$NN-MT} is faster than Fast $k$NN-MT\n\\citep{meng2021fast} and only slightly (1.2 times) slower than its vanilla\ncounterpart while preserving model performance as $k$NN-MT. Faster $k$NN-MT\nenables the deployment of $k$NN-MT models on real-world MT services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

Its conventional setup consists of measuring\nwall-normal velocity in the buffer layer and opposing it at the wall. This work\nexplores the possibility of implementing this strategy with a detection plane\nin the logarithmic layer, where control could be feasible experimentally. We\napply control on a channel flow at $Re_\\tau = 932$, only on the eddies with\nrelatively large wavelengths ($\\lambda / h > 0.1$). Similarly to the buffer\nlayer opposition control, our control strategy results in a virtual-wall effect\nfor the wall-normal velocity, creating a minimum in its intensity. However, it\nalso induces a large response in the streamwise velocity and Reynolds stresses\nnear the wall, with a substantial drag increase. When the phase of the control\nlags with respect to the detection plane, spanwise-homogeneous rollers are\nobserved near the channel wall. We show that they are a result of a linear\ninstability. In contrast, when the control leads with respect to the detection\nplane, this instability is inactive and oblique waves are observed. Their\nwall-normal profiles can be predicted linearly as a response of the turbulent\nchannel flow to a forcing with the advection velocity of the detection plane.\nThe linearity, governing the flow, opens a possibility to affect large scales\nof the flow in a controlled manner, when enhanced turbulence intensity or\nmixing is desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Furthermore, multi-view matching can fail for texture-less surfaces,\nreflective surfaces and moving objects. For such failure modes, single-view\ndepth estimation methods are often more reliable. To this end, we propose\nMaGNet, a novel framework for fusing single-view depth probability with\nmulti-view geometry, to improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of\nmulti-view depth estimation. For each frame, MaGNet estimates a single-view\ndepth probability distribution, parameterized as a pixel-wise Gaussian. The\ndistribution estimated for the reference frame is then used to sample per-pixel\ndepth candidates. Such probabilistic sampling enables the network to achieve\nhigher accuracy while evaluating fewer depth candidates.

The final step in the pipeline is a sequence to sequence model that\ntakes parallel corpus as input and gives us a translation model. Lesan's\ntranslation model is based on the Transformer architecture. After constructing\na base model, back translation, is used to leverage monolingual corpora.\nCurrently Lesan supports translation to and from Tigrinya, Amharic and English.\nWe perform extensive human evaluation and show that Lesan outperforms\nstate-of-the-art systems such as Google Translate and Microsoft Translator\nacross all six pairs. Lesan is freely available and has served more than 10\nmillion translations so far. At the moment, there are only 217 Tigrinya and\n15,009 Amharic Wikipedia articles. We believe that Lesan will contribute\ntowards democratizing access to the Web through MT for millions of people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

However, the popular neural accelerators on FPGA (e.g.,\nXilinx DPU) mainly utilize the DSP resources for constructing their processing\nunits, while the rich LUT resources are not well exploited. Via the\nsoftware-hardware co-design approach, in this work, we develop an FPGA-based\nheterogeneous computing system for neural network acceleration. From the\nhardware perspective, the proposed accelerator consists of DSP- and LUT-based\nGEneral Matrix-Multiplication (GEMM) computing cores, which forms the entire\ncomputing system in a heterogeneous fashion. The DSP- and LUT-based GEMM cores\nare computed w.r.t a unified Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and unified\nbuffers. Along the data flow of the neural network inference path, the\ncomputation of the convolution/fully-connected layer is split into two\nportions, handled by the DSP- and LUT-based GEMM cores asynchronously. From the\nsoftware perspective, we mathematically and systematically model the latency\nand resource utilization of the proposed heterogeneous accelerator, regarding\nvarying system design configurations. Through leveraging the reinforcement\nlearning technique, we construct a framework to achieve end-to-end selection\nand optimization of the design specification of target heterogeneous\naccelerator, including workload split strategy, mixed-precision quantization\nscheme, and resource allocation of DSP- and LUT-core. In virtue of the proposed\ndesign framework and heterogeneous computing system, our design outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art Mix&Match design with latency reduced by 1.12-1.32x with\nhigher inference accuracy.

In this doctoral thesis,\nsignatures of Dark Matter candidates which can leave an impact on the process\nof formation of structures and on the evolution of the Intergalactic Medium are\nstudied. This thesis is organized in three parts. Part I is devoted to a broad\nintroduction to the fundamentals, describing the state of the art of the topics\nconsidered. The basics of the $\\Lambda$CDM are presented in Chapter 1. Chapter\n2 overviews the historical progress of evidences of Dark Matter, followed by a\ndiscussion of the status and small-scale issues of the Cold Dark Matter\nparadigm, examining two alternative non-standard scenarios: Warm Dark Matter\nand Interacting Dark Matter. Chapter 3 considers Primordial Black Holes as\nanother Dark Matter candidate, discussing the effects of accretion of\nsurrounding matter and the enhancement of small-scale fluctuations due to the\nPoisson shot noise, both of which could leave an observational impact in the\nIntergalactic Medium. The fundamentals of the 21 cm cosmological signal are\nreviewed in Chapter 4, summarizing the main processes which drive the\nbrightness temperature, and discussing its spatial fluctuations via the power\nspectrum. Finally, Chapter 5 is dedicated to the ionization and thermal\nevolution of the Intergalactic Medium during the Cosmic Dawn and the\nReionization epochs. Part II includes seven original scientific articles\npublished during the development of the PhD, which constitute the main work of\nthis thesis. Finally, Part III contains a summary of the main results in\nSpanish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

We introduce a new market equilibrium\nnotion, called two-price equilibrium (2PE). A 2PE is a relaxation of Walrasian\nequilibrium, where instead of a single price per item, every item has two\nprices: one for the item's owner and a (possibly) higher one for all other\nbuyers. Thus, a 2PE is given by a tuple\n$(\\textbf{S},\\mathbf{\\hat{p}},\\mathbf{\\check{p}})$ of an allocation\n$\\textbf{S}$ and two price vectors $\\mathbf{\\hat{p}},\\mathbf{\\check{p}}$, where\nevery buyer $i$ is maximally happy with her bundle $S_i$, given prices\n$\\mathbf{\\check{p}}$ for items in $S_i$ and prices $\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}$ for all\nother items. 2PE generalizes previous market equilibrium notions, such as\nconditional equilibrium, and is related to relaxed equilibrium notions like\nendowment equilibrium. We define the {\\em discrepancy} of a 2PE -- a measure of\ndistance from Walrasian equilibrium -- as the sum of differences\n$\\hat{p}_j-\\check{p}_j$ over all items (normalized by social welfare). We show\nthat the social welfare degrades gracefully with the discrepancy; namely, the\nsocial welfare of a 2PE with discrepancy $d$ is at least a fraction\n$\\frac{1}{d+1}$ of the optimal welfare. We use this to establish welfare\nguarantees for markets with subadditive valuations over identical items. In\nparticular, we show that every such market admits a 2PE with at least $1/7$ of\nthe optimal welfare. This is in contrast to Walrasian equilibrium or\nconditional equilibrium which may not even exist. Our techniques provide new\ninsights regarding valuation functions over identical items, which we also use\nto characterize instances that admit a WE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

Residual learning and shortcuts\nhave been evidenced as an important approach for training deep neural networks,\nbut rarely did previous work assess their applicability to the characteristics\nof spike-based communication and spatiotemporal dynamics. In this paper, we\nfirst identify that this negligence leads to impeded information flow and the\naccompanying degradation problem in previous residual SNNs. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel SNN-oriented residual architecture termed MS-ResNet,\nwhich establishes membrane-based shortcut pathways, and further prove that the\ngradient norm equality can be achieved in MS-ResNet by introducing block\ndynamical isometry theory, which ensures the network can be well-behaved in a\ndepth-insensitive way. Thus we are able to significantly extend the depth of\ndirectly trained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on\nImageNet, without observing any slight degradation problem. To validate the\neffectiveness of MS-ResNet, experiments on both frame-based and neuromorphic\ndatasets are conducted. MS-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02%\naccuracy on ImageNet, which is the highest to our best knowledge in the domain\nof directly trained SNNs. Great energy efficiency is also observed, with an\naverage of only one spike per neuron needed to classify an input sample.

Par-regularity was proved to be equivalent\nto having positive reach or to belong to the class C 1,1 of curves with\nLipschitz derivative. Recently, we proposed to use a larger class that\nencompasses polygons with obtuse angles, the locally turn-bounded curves. The\naim of this technical report is to define the class of par-regular curves\ninside the class of locally turn-bounded curves using only the notion of turn,\nthat is of integral curvature. To be more precise, in a previous article, we\nhave already proved that par-regular curves are locally turn-bounded.\nIncidentally this proof lead us to show that the turn of par-regular curves is\na Lipschitz function of their length. We call the class of curves verifying\nthis latter property the curves with Lipschitz turn. In this technical report,\nwe prove the converse assertion : locally turn-bounded curves with Lipschitz\nturn are par-regular. The equivalence is stated in Theorem 3.1 and the converse\nassertion is proved in Lemma 3.2. In section 1, we recall the definition of\npar-regularity and equivalently of sets with positive reach. In section 2, we\npresent the notions of curves locally turn-bounded and of curves with Lipschitz\nturn. Throughout this latter section, some of intermediate steps (Lemmas 2.3\nand 2.11) are proved just after the introduction of their related notions. The\nlast section (section 3) is dedicated to the proof of the equivalence of the\nnotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 10:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

A correlation analysis was\nconducted to evaluate the influence of different factors on bus OTP. The\nresults show that a higher congestion ranking of the cities i.e. lesser traffic\nhas a positive correlation with OTP while a lower number of passengers per hour\nhas a negative correlation with OTP, both at a 95% confidence interval. Total\nmiles per active vehicle and average speed of the bus were found to have a\npositive correlation with OTP at a 90% confidence interval. This potentially\nsuggests that, if the average speed of the bus is higher i.e. if the bus\noperates at its scheduled speed, total miles per active vehicle will increase,\nwhich will in turn lead to a better on-time performance.

As has been shown using public data from the ALICE experiment, its\ntwo-dimensional representation of a sphere containing pixels of equal area has\na broader application to heavy ion collisions. The angular power spectrum, an\napplication of HEALPix, is directly related to the particle flow and is\ncalculated through the angles theta and phi on the sphere. The elliptic flow is\ncalculated from simulated AMPT events and publicly available CMS data. We show\nthat HEALPix can be used to detect the presence of elliptic flow for lead-lead\ncollisions and thus has broader applications in the study of QGP in heavy ion\ncollisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 18:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Prominent\nexamples are saturable absorption (SA) and two-photon absorption (TPA), which\ndynamically increase and decrease the transmission of a sample depending on\npulse intensity, respectively. The availability of intense soft X-ray pulses\nfrom free-electron lasers (FEL) has led to observations of SA and TPA in\nseparate experiments, leaving open questions about the possible interplay\nbetween and relative strength of the two phenomena. Here, we systematically\nstudy both phenomena in one experiment by exposing graphite films to soft X-ray\nFEL pulses of varying intensity, with the FEL energy tuned to match carbon 1s\nto $\\pi^*$ or 1s to $\\sigma^*$ transitions. It is observed for lower\nintensities that the nonlinear contribution to the absorption is dominated by\nSA attributed to ground-state depletion; for larger intensities ($>10^{14}$\nW/cm$^2$), TPA becomes more dominant. The relative strengths of the two\nphenomena depend in turn on the specific transition driven by the X-ray pulse.\nBoth observations are consistent with our real-time electronic structure\ncalculations. Our results reveal the competing contributions of distinct\nnonlinear material responses to spectroscopic signals measured in the X-ray\nregime, demonstrating an approach of general utility for interpreting FEL\nspectroscopies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 04:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 22:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Especially, intraday trading is one of the most profitable\nand risky tasks because of the intraday behaviors of the financial market that\nreflect billions of rapidly fluctuating capitals. However, a vast majority of\nexisting RL methods focus on the relatively low frequency trading scenarios\n(e.g., day-level) and fail to capture the fleeting intraday investment\nopportunities due to two major challenges: 1) how to effectively train\nprofitable RL agents for intraday investment decision-making, which involves\nhigh-dimensional fine-grained action space; 2) how to learn meaningful\nmulti-modality market representation to understand the intraday behaviors of\nthe financial market at tick-level. Motivated by the efficient workflow of\nprofessional human intraday traders, we propose DeepScalper, a deep\nreinforcement learning framework for intraday trading to tackle the above\nchallenges. Specifically, DeepScalper includes four components: 1) a dueling\nQ-network with action branching to deal with the large action space of intraday\ntrading for efficient RL optimization; 2) a novel reward function with a\nhindsight bonus to encourage RL agents making trading decisions with a\nlong-term horizon of the entire trading day; 3) an encoder-decoder architecture\nto learn multi-modality temporal market embedding, which incorporates both\nmacro-level and micro-level market information; 4) a risk-aware auxiliary task\nto maintain a striking balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world market data spanning over three\nyears on six financial futures, we demonstrate that DeepScalper significantly\noutperforms many state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial\ncriteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 13:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 05:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}
