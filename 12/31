While sharing genomic data across\nresearchers is an essential driver of advances in health and biomedical\nresearch, the sharing process is often infeasible due to data privacy concerns.\nDifferential privacy is one of the rigorous mechanisms utilized to facilitate\nthe sharing of aggregate statistics from genomic datasets without disclosing\nany private individual-level data. However, differential privacy can still\ndivulge sensitive information about the dataset participants due to the\ncorrelation between dataset tuples. Results: Here, we propose GenShare model\nbuilt upon Laplace-perturbation-mechanism-based DP to introduce a\nprivacy-preserving query-answering sharing model for statistical genomic\ndatasets that include dependency due to the inherent correlations between\ngenomes of individuals (i.e., family ties). We demonstrate our privacy\nimprovement over the state-of-the-art approaches for a range of practical\nqueries including cohort discovery, minor allele frequency, and chi^2\nassociation tests. With a fine-grained analysis of sensitivity in the Laplace\nperturbation mechanism and considering joint distributions, GenShare results\nnear-achieve the formal privacy guarantees permitted by the theory of\ndifferential privacy as the queries that computed over independent tuples (only\nup to 6% differences). GenShare ensures that query results are as accurate as\ntheoretically guaranteed by differential privacy. For empowering the advances\nin different scientific and medical research areas, GenShare presents a path\ntoward an interactive genomic data sharing system when the datasets include\nparticipants with familial relationships.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Tuned hydrodynamic simulations suggest that\nthe RPS event is occurring almost face-on, making NGC 4330 the ideal candidate\nto study the effects of the perturbation in the direction perpendicular to the\ndisc plane.

Allowing for the value of the gravitational\nconstant today to depart from the Newton constant, we find that the addition of\nSNe further tightens the constraints obtained by CMB and BAO data on the\nstandard cosmological parameters and by 22\\% on the coupling parameter, i.e.,\n$\\xi < 0.00064$ at 95\\% CL. We finally show that in this class of modified\ngravity models the use a prior on the absolute magnitude $M_B$ in combination\nwith the Pantheon SNe sample leads to results which are very consistent with\nthose obtained by imposing a prior on $H_0$, as happens for other {\\em\nearly-type} models which accommodate a larger value of $H_0$ compared to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 13:43:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 14:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 11:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In this paper we leverage equilibrium concepts from behavioral economics\nfor this purpose and ask how well they perform compared to the quantal regret\nand Nash equilibrium methods. We develop four estimation methods based on\nestablished behavioral equilibrium models to infer the utilities of human\nagents from observed data of normal-form games. The equilibrium models we study\nare quantal-response equilibrium, action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling\nequilibrium, and impulse-balance equilibrium. We show that in some of these\nconcepts the inference is achieved analytically via closed formulas, while in\nthe others the inference is achieved only algorithmically. We use experimental\ndata of 2x2 games to evaluate the estimation success of these behavioral\nequilibrium methods. The results show that the estimates they produce are more\naccurate than the estimates of the Nash equilibrium. The comparison with the\nquantal-regret method shows that the behavioral methods have better hit rates,\nbut the quantal-regret method performs better in terms of the overall mean\nsquared error, and we discuss the differences between the methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 18:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

This paper identifies a pervasive source of naturally occurring,\nquasi-experimental variation in user-level ad-exposure in digital advertising\ncampaigns. It shows how this variation can be utilized by ad-publishers to\nidentify the causal effect of advertising campaigns. The variation pertains to\nauction throttling, a probabilistic method of budget pacing that is widely used\nto spread an ad-campaign`s budget over its deployed duration, so that the\ncampaign`s budget is not exceeded or overly concentrated in any one period. The\nthrottling mechanism is implemented by computing a participation probability\nbased on the campaign`s budget spending rate and then including the campaign in\na random subset of available ad-auctions each period according to this\nprobability. We show that access to logged-participation probabilities enables\nidentifying the local average treatment effect (LATE) in the ad-campaign. We\npresent a new estimator that leverages this identification strategy and outline\na bootstrap procedure for quantifying its variability.

It consists in introducing data several times along a computation\naccompanied by tunable parameters. This process permits the circuit to learn\nand mimic any behavior. This capability emerges naturally from the quantum\nproperties of the circuit. Second, the unary strategy aims to reduce the\ndensity of information stored in a quantum circuit to increase its resilience\nagainst noise.

However, traditional methods on PID tuning often require\nextensive domain knowledge and field experience. To address the issue, this\nwork proposes an automatic PID tuning framework based on reinforcement learning\n(RL), particularly the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) method. Different\nfrom existing studies on using RL for PID tuning, in this work, we consider the\nclosed-loop stability throughout the RL-based tuning process. In particular, we\npropose a novel episodic tuning framework that allows for an episodic\nclosed-loop operation under selected PID parameters where the actor and critic\nnetworks are updated once at the end of each episode. To ensure the closed-loop\nstability during the tuning, we initialize the training with a conservative but\nstable baseline PID controller and the resultant reward is used as a benchmark\nscore. A supervisor mechanism is used to monitor the running reward (e.g.,\ntracking error) at each step in the episode. As soon as the running reward\nexceeds the benchmark score, the underlying controller is replaced by the\nbaseline controller as an early correction to prevent instability. Moreover, we\nuse layer normalization to standardize the input to each layer in actor and\ncritic networks to overcome the issue of policy saturation at action bounds, to\nensure the convergence to the optimum. The developed methods are validated\nthrough setpoint tracking experiments on a second-order plus dead-time system.\nSimulation results show that with our scheme, the closed-loop stability can be\nmaintained throughout RL explorations and the explored PID parameters by the RL\nagent converge quickly to the optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 19:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 17:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

When the environment only provides observations giving partial\ninformation about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent\nstate based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned\ndirectly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent\nneural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are\ncomputationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them\nunideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the\ngenerate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test\nalgorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their\nusefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent's performance on the\ntask are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly\ngenerated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online\nmulti-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses\non the agent's ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into\nthe future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn\npatterns in the observation signals and remember them for future predictions.\nWe show that our proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online\nand produce accurate predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 23:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

We present a Stokesian\nDynamics study of the dynamical properties and efficiency of one of the\nsimplest artificial swimmer, the three linked spheres swimmer (TLS),\nextensively shown to be an excellent and model example of a deformable\nmicromachine. Results for two different swimming strokes are compared with an\napproximate solution based on point force interactions. While this\napproximation accurately reproduces the solutions for swimmers with long arms\nand strokes of small amplitude, it fails when the amplitude of the stroke is\nsuch that the spheres come close together, a condition where indeed the largest\nefficiencies are obtained. We find that swimmers with a \"square stroke cycle\"\nresult more efficient than those with \"circular stroke cycle\" when the swimmer\narms are long compared with the sphere radius, but the differences between the\ntwo strokes are smaller when the arms of the swimmers are short. This extended\ntheoretical research of TLS incorporates a much precise description of the\nswimmer hydrodynamics, demonstrating the relevance of considering the finite\nsize of the constitutive microswimmers spheres.

The construction resolves the open problem of\ndetermining the expanding waves created behind a shock-wave explosion into a\nstatic isothermal sphere with an inverse square density and pressure profile.\nThe construction involves matching two self-similar families of solutions to\nthe perfect fluid Einstein field equations across a spherical shock surface.\nThe matching is accomplished in Schwarzschild coordinates where the shock waves\nappear one derivative less regular than they actually are. Separately, both\nfamilies contain singularities, but as matched shock-wave solutions, they are\nsingularity free. There was no guarantee ahead of time that the matching of the\ntwo families could be achieved within the regions where both families are\nnonsingular. Indeed, for pure radiation equations of state, the matching occurs\nnear the sonic point of the interior expanding wave and this makes the analysis\nquite delicate, both numerically and formally. It is for this reason the\nconstruction is accompanied by a rigorous existence proof in the pure radiation\ncase. The analysis is extended to demonstrate Lax stability in the pure\nradiation case and provide a criterion for Lax stability in all other cases.\nThese shock-wave solutions represent an intriguing new mechanism in General\nRelativity for exhibiting accelerations in asymptotically Friedmann spacetimes,\nanalogous to the accelerations modelled by the cosmological constant in the\nStandard Model of Cosmology. However, unlike in the Standard Model of\nCosmology, these shock-wave solutions solve the Einstein field equations in the\nabsence of a cosmological constant, opening up the question of whether a purely\nmathematical mechanism could account for the cosmic acceleration observed\ntoday, rather than dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 23:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 00:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Then, based on the equivalence, we discuss\nthe issue that the internal-stage controls produced by direct approach may have\nlower order accuracy than the RK method used. We propose order conditions for\ninternal-stage controls and then demonstrate that third or fourth order\nexplicit RK discretization cannot avoid the order reduction phenomenon.

In this\nregard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of\nlow latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the\nsystolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed\nframework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective\nmemory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual\ndialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential\nof deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and\nenhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)\nand Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of\nhand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions.

We investigate here the possible variations of the size\nfrequency distributions of impactors from the record of small craters of 521\nmartian impact craters larger than 20 km in diameter. We show that 49 craters\n(out of the 521) correspond to the complete crater population of this size\nformed over the last 600 Ma.

On Earth,\nwe infer the formation location of a set of impact craters thanks to plate\ntectonic reconstruction and show that a cluster of craters formed during the\nOrdovician period, about 470 Ma ago, appears to be a preservation bias. On the\nMoon, the late increase seen in the crater age signal can be due to the\nuncertain calibration method used to date those impacts (i.e. rock abundance in\nlunar impact ejecta), and other calibrations are consistent with a constant\ncrater production rate. We conclude to a coupling of the crater production rate\nbetween kilometer-size craters and down to ~100 m in diameter in the inner\nSolar System. This is consistent with the traditional model for delivering\nasteroids to planet-crossing orbits: the Yarkovsky effect slowly pushes the\nlarge debris from asteroid break-ups towards orbital resonances while smaller\ndebris are grinded through collisional cascades.

Transformer, designed initially as a\nsequence-to-sequence model, excels at capturing global contexts due to the\nself-attention-based architectures even though it may be equipped with limited\nlocalization abilities. This paper proposes CSformer, a hybrid framework that\nintegrates the advantages of leveraging both detailed spatial information from\nCNN and the global context provided by transformer for enhanced representation\nlearning.

Spin injection acts as a moving piston that\ngenerates nonlinear, dynamical spin textures in the ferromagnetic channel with\ndownstream quiescent spin density set by the external field. In contrast to the\nclassical problem of a piston accelerating a compressible gas, here, variable\nspin injection and field lead to a rich variety of nonlinear wave phenomena\nfrom oscillatory spin shocks to solitons and rarefaction waves. A full\nclassification of solutions is provided using nonlinear wave modulation theory\nby identifying two key aspects of the fluid-like dynamics: subsonic/supersonic\nconditions and convex/nonconvex hydrodynamic flux.

A key feature\nof the AMP-type algorithms is that their dynamics can be correctly described by\nstate evolution. However, the state evolution does not necessarily be\nconvergent. To solve the convergence problem of the state evolution of AMP-type\nalgorithms in principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a\nsufficient statistic condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We\nshow that the covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given\nan arbitrary MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only\nensures the convergence of the state evolution, but also preserves the\northogonality, i.e., its dynamics can be correctly described by state\nevolution. As a byproduct, we prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector\nAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting\nproperties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are\nL-banded and are convergent, and 2) damping and memory are not needed (i.e., do\nnot bring performance improvement). As an example, we construct a sufficient\nstatistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (SS-BO-MAMP) whose state evolution converges to\nthe minimum (i.e., Bayes-optimal) mean square error (MSE) predicted by replica\nmethods. In addition, the MSE of SS-BO-MAMP is not worse than the original\nBO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 07:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 14:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 08:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

(ii) Furthermore, previous\nmethods also ignore the multi-form temporal information, which is significant\nsignal to obtain current intention for SBR. To address the limitations\nmentioned above, we propose a novel method, called \\emph{Temporal aware\nMulti-Interest Graph Neural Network} (TMI-GNN) to disentangle multi-interest\nand yield refined intention representations with the injection of two level\ntemporal information. Specifically, by appending multiple interest nodes, we\nconstruct a multi-interest graph for current session, and adopt the GNNs to\nmodel the item-item relation to capture adjacent item transitions,\nitem-interest relation to disentangle the multi-interests, and interest-item\nrelation to refine the item representation.

To ensure data locality and load balancing, DistDGLv2\npartitions heterogeneous graphs by using a multi-level partitioning algorithm\nwith min-edge cut and multiple balancing constraints. DistDGLv2 deploys an\nasynchronous mini-batch generation pipeline that makes computation and data\naccess asynchronous to fully utilize all hardware (CPU, GPU, network, PCIe).\nThe combination allows DistDGLv2 to train high-quality models while achieving\nhigh parallel efficiency and memory scalability. We demonstrate DistDGLv2 on\nvarious GNN workloads. Our results show that DistDGLv2 achieves 2-3X speedup\nover DistDGL and 18X speedup over Euler. It takes only 5-10 seconds to complete\nan epoch on graphs with hundreds of millions of vertices on a cluster with 64\nGPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 08:32:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 23:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

However, mainstream 3D lane detectors rely on perfect camera poses\nprovided by other sensors, which is expensive and encounters multi-sensor\ncalibration issues. To overcome this problem, we propose to predict 3D lanes by\nestimating camera pose from a single image with a two-stage framework.

This mask-specific\ntraining style will lead to a hardware miscalibration issue, which sets up\nbarriers to deploying deep HSI models among different hardware and noisy\nenvironments. To address this challenge, we introduce mask uncertainty for HSI\nwith a complete variational Bayesian learning treatment and explicitly model it\nthrough a mask decomposition inspired by real hardware.

On the one hand, residual connections and dense\nconnections have been used widely to ease forward information and backward\ngradient flows to boost performance. However, current methods use residual\nconnections and dense connections separately in most network layers in a\nsub-optimal way. On the other hand, although various networks and methods have\nbeen designed to improve computation efficiency, save parameters, or utilize\ntraining data of multiple scale factors for each other to boost performance, it\neither do super-resolution in HR space to have a high computation cost or can\nnot share parameters between models of different scale factors to save\nparameters and inference time. To tackle these challenges, we propose an\nefficient single image super-resolution network using dual path connections\nwith multiple scale learning named as EMSRDPN. By introducing dual path\nconnections inspired by Dual Path Networks into EMSRDPN, it uses residual\nconnections and dense connections in an integrated way in most network layers.\nDual path connections have the benefits of both reusing common features of\nresidual connections and exploring new features of dense connections to learn a\ngood representation for SISR. To utilize the feature correlation of multiple\nscale factors, EMSRDPN shares all network units in LR space between different\nscale factors to learn shared features and only uses a separate reconstruction\nunit for each scale factor, which can utilize training data of multiple scale\nfactors to help each other to boost performance, meanwhile which can save\nparameters and support shared inference for multiple scale factors to improve\nefficiency.

Until now, this has been successfully modeled exclusively at the disk's\nsnowline, whereas rocky planetesimals in the inner disk were obtained only by\nassuming either unrealistically large particle sizes or an enhanced global disk\nmetallicity. However, planetesimal formation solely at the snowline is\ndifficult to reconcile with the early and contemporaneous formation of iron\nmeteorite parent bodies with distinct oxidation states and isotopic\ncompositions, indicating formation at different radial locations in the disk.\nHere, by modeling the evolution of a disk with ongoing accretion of material\nfrom the collapsing molecular cloud, we show that planetesimal formation may\nhave been triggered within the first 0.5 million years by dust pileup at both\nthe snowline (at approximately 5 au) and the silicate sublimation line (at\napproximately 1 au), provided turbulent diffusion was low. Particle\nconcentration at approximately 1 au is due to the early outward radial motion\nof gas and is assisted by the sublimation and recondensation of silicates.

Thus, provided that the isotopic\ncomposition of the delivered material changed with time, these two planetesimal\npopulations should have distinct isotopic compositions, consistent with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 12:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

We argue that\nthe complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive\npower to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the\nfield of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We\nthus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this\nfield but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and\ntherefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first\nsection, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of\nintelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and\nempirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of\nresearch that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to\ndeveloping socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First,\nneuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global\nworkspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological\nplausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social\ntheories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to\nover time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third,\nembodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of\ncommunicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference,\nwhich offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological\nrealism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 13:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 14:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 16:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In the present work, we associate mesoscale\nDislocation Dynamics simulations and Finite Element simulations to identify two\noriginal dislocation mechanisms at the origin of the traction/compression\nasymmetry and quantify their impacts on the cyclic behaviour of FCC\nsingle-crystals. After demonstrating that no long-range internal stresses can\nbe measured in the simulations, careful analysis of the dislocation network\nshow that the Bauschinger effect is caused by an asymmetry in the stability of\njunctions formed from segments whose curvature is determined by the applied\nstress, and a significant portion of the stored dislocation segments is easily\nrecovered during the backward motion of dislocations in previously explored\nregions of the crystal. These mechanisms are incorporated into a modified\ncrystal plasticity framework with few parameters quantified from statistical\nanalysis of Dislocation Dynamics simulations or from the literature.

However, as the challenging scale variations and complex scenes\nexisted in crowds, neither traditional convolution networks nor recent\nTransformer architectures with fixed-size attention could handle the task well.\nTo address this problem, this paper proposes a scene-adaptive attention\nnetwork, termed SAANet. First of all, we design a deformable attention in-built\nTransformer backbone, which learns adaptive feature representations with\ndeformable sampling locations and dynamic attention weights. Then we propose\nthe multi-level feature fusion and count-attentive feature enhancement modules\nfurther, to strengthen feature representation under the global image context.\nThe learned representations could attend to the foreground and are adaptive to\ndifferent scales of crowds. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nchallenging crowd counting benchmarks, demonstrating that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale\ngeologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution\ngrids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to\nbe effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency\nremains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed\nto upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve\nupscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship\nbetween the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic\nheads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while\nsolving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws\n(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be\nincorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed\nthe theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical\ninformation considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep\nlearning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are\nintroduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based\nupscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic\ncases.

A simple mixture of monoclinic WO$_3$\npowder and polyolefin (polypropylene) is used to obtain H$_x$WO$_3$\nnanoparticles that show high crystallinity even through high-energy ball\nmilling synthesis. The composite of H$_x$WO$_3$ nanoparticles and nanocarbon\nby-products exhibit unique optoelectronic properties along with outstanding\nenhancement of photocatalytic performance in the decomposition of azo-dye water\npollutants under visible light.

Specifically, the social human behavior consists of many\nphysiological and psychological processes which are still largely unknown. To\nmodel reliably such human crowd systems with complex social interactions,\nstochastic tools play an important role for the setting of mathematical\nformulations of the problems. In this work, using the description based on an\nexclusion principle, we study a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model\nfor active-passive population dynamics with an application to human crowd\nbehaviors. We provide representative numerical examples for the evacuation\ndynamics of human crowds, where the main focus in our considerations is given\nto an interacting particle system of active and passive human groups.\nFurthermore, our numerical results show that the communication between active\nand passive humans strongly influences the evacuation time of the whole\npopulation even when the \"faster-is-slower\" phenomenon is taken into account.\nFinally, to provide an additional inside into the problem, a stationary state\nof our model is analyzed via current representations and heat map techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 15:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In case the network is affected by disturbances, a\nstochastic linearized system of the coupled phase oscillators may be used to\ndetermine the fluctuations of phase differences in the lines between the nodes\nand to identify the vulnerable lines that may lead to desynchronization. The\nmain result is the derivation of the asymptotic variance matrix of the phase\ndifferences which characterizes the severity of the fluctuations. It is found\nthat the cycle space of the graph of the system plays a role in this\ncharacterization. With theory of the cycle space, the effect of forming small\ncycles on the fluctuations are evaluated. It is proven that adding a new line\nor increasing the coupling strength of a line affect the fluctuations in the\nlines in any cycle including this line while it does not affect the\nfluctuations in the other lines. In particular, if the phase differences at the\nsynchronous state are not changed by these actions, then the affected\nfluctuations reduce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 08:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 13:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 08:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

The basic purpose of controls is to manage the internal\noperations of the system and detect any unwanted or uncertain situation.\nFailure in any system may be caused by various reasons and need to be\nrestricted to save other components of the system. event-triggered control\nsystems manage errors and failures by identifying particular events caused by\nfailure and then mitigate the effect of that failure as much as possible. These\nsystems have become prominent due to their smooth and autonomous way of\ndetecting and minimizing risk in any system. The input to state stability\nproperty and a perfectly stabilized control are assumed for applying\nevent-triggered control systems. Switching topologies can be utilized as an\nalternative to ISS assumptions to design triggering events. There are some\nissues related to this approach like non-linearity of systems, multi-agent\ncommunication, heterogeneity and Zeno effect in systems while monitoring,\ncontrolling faults and taking feedbacks. The efficiency of neural networks and\nfuzzy technologies are considered in this regard which are investigated by many\nresearchers in the last decade. This survey reviews all work related to\nevent-triggered control systems, their applications, challenges and possible\nsolutions. The adaptability of these controls is evaluated based on the\nsolutions available as well as the applicability of solutions proposed by\nresearchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 15:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}
