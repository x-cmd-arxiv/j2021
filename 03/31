Recently, segment-based approaches for SER have been\nevolving, which train backbone networks on shorter segments instead of whole\nutterances, and thus naturally augments training examples without additional\nresources. However, one core challenge remains for segment-based approaches:\nmost emotional corpora do not provide ground-truth labels at the segment level.\nTo supervisely train a segment-based emotion model on such datasets, the most\ncommon way assigns each segment the corresponding utterance's emotion label.\nHowever, this practice typically introduces noisy (incorrect) labels as\nemotional information is not uniformly distributed across the whole utterance.\nOn the other hand, DNNs have been shown to easily over-fit a dataset when being\ntrained with noisy labels. To this end, this work proposes a simple and\neffective deep self-learning (DSL) framework, which comprises a procedure to\nprogressively correct segment-level labels in an iterative learning manner. The\nDSL method produces dynamically-generated and soft emotion labels, leading to\nsignificant performance improvements. Experiments on three well-known emotional\ncorpora demonstrate noticeable gains using the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 16:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

In this paper we give a new direct method to prove\nstrong locality in two-dimensional conformal field theory.

First, we conduct\nmagnitude estimation experiments to investigate the role of normal force and\nsliding velocity on the perceived tactile intensity for a step increase and\ndecrease in friction, called as rising friction (RF) and falling friction (FF).\nTo investigate the contact mechanics involved in RF and FF, we then measure the\nfrictional force, the apparent contact area, and the strains acting on the\nfingerpad during sliding at a constant velocity under three different normal\nloads using a custom-made experimental set-up. The results show that the\nparticipants perceived RF stronger than FF, and both the normal force and\nsliding velocity significantly influenced their perception. These results are\nsupported by our mechanical measurements; the relative change in friction, the\napparent contact area, and the strain in the sliding direction were all higher\nfor RF than those for FF, especially for low normal forces. Taken together, our\nresults suggest that different contact mechanics take place during RF and FF\ndue to the viscoelastic behavior of fingerpad skin, and those differences\ninfluence our tactile perception of a step change in friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 16:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

To display a rich set of haptic\neffects for both static and dynamic gestures, we integrated electromechanical\nand electrostatic actuation techniques effectively on tabletop surface of\nHapTable, which is a surface capacitive touch screen. We attached four piezo\npatches to the edges of tabletop to display vibrotactile feedback for static\ngestures. For this purpose, the vibration response of the tabletop, in the form\nof frequency response functions (FRFs), was obtained by a laser Doppler\nvibrometer for 84 grid points on its surface. Using these FRFs, it is possible\nto display localized vibrotactile feedback on the surface for static gestures.\nFor dynamic gestures, we utilize the electrostatic actuation technique to\nmodulate the frictional forces between finger skin and tabletop surface by\napplying voltage to its conductive layer. Here, we present two examples of such\napplications, one for static and one for dynamic gestures, along with detailed\nuser studies. In the first one, user detects the direction of a virtual flow,\nsuch as that of wind or water, by putting their hand on the tabletop surface\nand feeling a vibrotactile stimulus traveling underneath it.

To obtain a human-explainable data intelligence model for\ndecision making, in this study, we investigate explainable fuzzy-theoretic\nutility mining on multi-sequences. Meanwhile, a more normative formulation of\nthe problem of fuzzy utility mining on sequences is formulated. By exploring\nfuzzy set theory for utility mining, we propose a novel method termed pattern\ngrowth fuzzy utility mining (PGFUM) for mining fuzzy high-utility sequences\nwith linguistic meaning. In the case of sequence data, PGFUM reflects the fuzzy\nquantity and utility regions of sequences. To improve the efficiency and\nfeasibility of PGFUM, we develop two compressed data structures with\nexplainable fuzziness. Furthermore, one existing and two new upper bounds on\nthe explainable fuzzy utility of candidates are adopted in three proposed\npruning strategies to substantially reduce the search space and thus expedite\nthe mining process. Finally, the proposed PGFUM algorithm is compared with\nPFUS, which is the only currently available method for the same task, through\nextensive experimental evaluation.

To compute this six\nDegrees-of-Freedom (DoF) relative transformation, the proposed formulation\nrequires only sparse depth information in one of the images, which is often the\nonly available depth source in visual-inertial odometry or Simultaneous\nLocalization and Mapping (SLAM) pipelines. In an optional subsequent step, the\nframework further refines feature locations and the relative pose using\nindividual feature alignment and bundle adjustment for pose and structure\nre-alignment. The resulting sparse point correspondences with subpixel-accuracy\nand refined relative pose can be used for depth map generation, or the image\nalignment module can be embedded in an odometry or mapping framework.\nExperiments with rendered imagery show that the forward SD-6DoF-ICLK runs at\n145 ms per image pair with a resolution of 752 x 480 pixels each, and vastly\noutperforms the classical, sparse 6DoF-ICLK algorithm, making it the ideal\nframework for robust image alignment under severe conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 17:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Answering this question is not only practically relevant for\nefficient \"once-for-all\" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically\nappealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We\nconduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety\nof strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the\nsame model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the\nElastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or\ndropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning\nticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper\n(or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the\nsame competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP. We have\nalso extensively compared E-LTH with pruning-at-initialization and dynamic\nsparse training methods, as well as discussed the generalizability of E-LTH to\ndifferent model families, layer types, and across datasets.

It is believed that the waves are driven at the\nphotosphere and propagate along the magnetic field lines up to prominences\nsuspended in the corona. The dissipation of MHD wave energy in the partially\nionized prominence plasma is a heating mechanism whose relevance needs to be\nexplored. Here we consider a simple 1D model for a non-uniform thin thread and\ninvestigate the heating associated with dissipation of Alfven waves. The model\nassumes an ad hoc density profile and a uniform pressure, while the temperature\nand ionization degree are self-consistently computed considering either LTE or\nnon-LTE approximations for the hydrogen ionization. A broadband driver for\nAlfven waves is placed at one end of the magnetic field line, representing\nphotospheric excitation. The Alfvenic perturbations along the thread are\nobtained by solving the linearized MHD equations for a partially ionized plasma\nin the single-fluid approximation.We find that wave heating in the partially\nionized part of the thread is significant enough to compensate for energy\nlosses due to radiative cooling. A greater amount of heating is found in the\nLTE case because the ionization degree for core prominence temperatures is\nlower than that in the non-LTE approximation. This results in a greater level\nof dissipation due to ambipolar diffusion in the LTE case. Conversely, in the\nhot coronal part of the model, the plasma is fully ionized and wave heating is\nnegligible. The results of this simple model suggest that MHD wave heating can\nbe relevant for the energy balance in prominences. Further studies based on\nmore elaborate models are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 18:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Previous querying algorithms,\nsuch as frequent itemset querying and sequential pattern querying (SPQ) have\nfocused on the measurement of frequency, which does not involve the concept of\nutility, which is helpful for users to discover more informative patterns. To\napply the querying technology for wider applications, we incorporate utility\ninto target-oriented SPQ and formulate the task of targeted utility-oriented\nsequence querying. To address the proposed problem, we develop a novel\nalgorithm, namely targeted high-utility sequence querying (TUSQ), based on two\nnovel upper bounds suffix remain utility and terminated descendants utility as\nwell as a vertical Last Instance Table structure. For further efficiency, TUSQ\nrelies on a projection technology utilizing a compact data structure called the\ntargeted chain.

Although a number of\nmodality-agnostic segmentation networks have been developed over the past few\nyears, they have been met with limited success in the context of enhancing\npathology segmentation.

This study evaluates methods for\nmaintaining the computational viability of these models by ana-lyzing different\ntemporal aggregation techniques that reduce the number of time steps in their\nin-put time series. Two commonly-employed approaches are the representation of\ntime series by a subset of single (typical) time steps, or by groups of\nconsecutive time steps (typical periods). We test these techniques for two\ndifferent energy system models that are implemented using the Frame-work for\nIntegrated Energy System Assessment (FINE) by benchmarking the optimization\nresults based on aggregation to those of the fully resolved models and\ninvestigating whether the optimal aggregation method can, a priori, be\ndetermined based on the clustering indicators.

The standard approach\nconsists in performing an iterative search for the shift akin to solving the\nsecular equation in trust-region methods. Such search requires computing the\nCholesky factorization of a tentative shifted Hessian at each iteration, which\nlimits the size of problems that can be reasonably considered. We propose a\nscalable implementation of ARC named ARCqK in which we solve a set of shifted\nsystems concurrently by way of an appropriate modification of the Lanczos\nformulation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method. At each iteration of ARCqK\nto solve a problem with n variables, a range of m << n shift parameters is\nselected. The computational overhead in CG beyond the Lanczos process is\nthirteen scalar operations to update five vectors of length m and two n-vector\nupdates for each value of the shift. The CG variant only requires one\nHessian-vector product and one dot product per iteration, independently of the\nnumber of shift parameters. Solves corresponding to inadequate shift parameters\nare interrupted early. All shifted systems are solved inexactly. Such modest\ncost makes our implementation scalable and appropriate for large-scale\nproblems.

We\ndescribe our implementation and provide preliminary numerical observations that\nconfirm that for problems of size at least 100, our implementation of ARCqK is\nmore efficient than a classic Steihaug-Toint trust region method.

The focus of this\npaper is on problem (i), where we seek to characterize the impact of the\ndivision of resources on the best-case efficiency of the resulting collective\nbehavior. Specifically, we focus on a team Colonel Blotto game where there are\ntwo sub-colonels competing against a common adversary in a two battlefield\nenvironment. Here, each sub-colonel is assigned a given resource budget and is\nrequired to allocate these resources independent of the other sub-colonel.\nHowever, their success is dependent on the allocation strategy of both\nsub-colonels. The central focus of this manuscript is on how to divide a common\npool of resources among the two sub-colonels to optimize the resulting\nbest-case efficiency guarantees. Intuitively, one would imagine that the more\nbalanced the division of resources, the worse the performance, as such\ndivisions restrict the sub-colonels' ability to employ joint randomized\nstrategies that tend to be necessary for optimizing performance guarantees.\nHowever, the main result of this paper demonstrates that this intuition is\nactually incorrect. A more balanced division of resources can offer better\nperformance guarantees than a more centralized division. Hence, this paper\ndemonstrates that the resource division problem is highly non-trivial in such\nenmeshed environments and worthy of significant future research efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

Despite their widespread use, however, until\nrecently, little was known about their inner-workings and about which aspects\nof the procedure were driving their success. Very recently, two competing\nhypotheses have emerged -- one based on interpolation and the other based on\nregularization. This work argues in favor of the latter by utilizing the\nregularization framework to reexamine the decades-old question of whether\nindividual trees in an ensemble ought to be pruned. Despite the fact that\ndefault constructions of random forests use near full depth trees in most\npopular software packages, here we provide strong evidence that tree depth\nshould be seen as a natural form of regularization across the entire procedure.\nIn particular, our work suggests that random forests with shallow trees are\nadvantageous when the signal-to-noise ratio in the data is low. In building up\nthis argument, we also critique the newly popular notion of \"double descent\" in\nrandom forests by drawing parallels to U-statistics and arguing that the\nnoticeable jumps in random forest accuracy are the result of simple averaging\nrather than interpolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

This\nconvoluted relationship has implications for early literacy software,\nparticularly for open-ended, child-driven designs. A tempting way to bypass\nthis issue is to use manipulables (blocks) that are directly tied to phonemes.\nHowever, creating phoneme-based blocks leads to two design challenges: (a) how\nto represent phonemes visually in a child-accessible way and (b) how to account\nfor context-dependent spelling. In the present work, we approached these\nchallenges by developing a set of animated, onomatopoeia-based mnemonic\ncharacters, one per phoneme, that can take the shape of different graphemes.We\napplied the characters to a construction-based literacy app to simplify\nindependent word-building for literacy beginners. We tested the app during a\n13-week-long period with 4- to 5-year-olds in kindergarten classrooms. Children\nshowed visible interest in the characters and properly grasped the principles\nof their functioning. However, the blocks were not sufficient to scaffold\nindependent word building, leading children to rely on other scaffolding\nmechanisms. To test the characters' efficiency as mnemonics, we evaluated their\neffect on the speed and accuracy of finding phonemes on a keyboard. The results\nsuggest that there were both children who benefitted from the characters in\nthis task and those who performed better without them. The factors that\ndifferentiated these two categories are currently unclear. To help further\nresearch on phonetic mnemonics in literacy learning software, we are making the\ncharacters available to the research community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 22:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

Kepler has observed stellar\noscillation for four years, which gave access to excellent frequency resolution\nthat enables deciphering the oscillation spectrum of evolved red giant branch\nand asymptotic giant branch stars. The internal structure of stars in the upper\nparts of the red and asymptotic giant branches is poorly constrained, which\nmakes the distinction between red and asymptotic giants difficult. We perform a\nthorough seismic analysis to address the physical conditions inside these stars\nand to distinguish them. We studied the oscillation mode properties of about\n2.000 evolved giants in a model described by the asymptotic pressure-mode\npattern of red giants, which includes the signature of the helium\nsecond-ionisation zone. We extracted the mode properties up to the degree l = 3\nand investigated their dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, and\nevolutionary status. We identify a clear difference in the signature of the\nhelium second-ionisation zone between red and asymptotic giants. We also detect\na clear shortage of the energy of l = 1 modes after the core-He-burning phase.\nFurthermore, we note that the mode damping observed on the asymptotic giant\nbranch is similar to that observed on the red giant branch. We highlight that\nthe signature of the helium second-ionisation zone varies with stellar\nevolution. This provides us with a physical basis for distinguishing red giant\nbranch stars from asymptotic giants. Here, our investigation of stellar\noscillations allows us to constrain the physical processes and the key events\nthat occur during the advanced stages of stellar evolution, with emphasis on\nthe ascent along the asymptotic giant branch, including the asymptotic giant\nbranch bump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 23:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

O forms stable\nspecies on the surface, and chemical attack occurs by H that breaks the Si-C\nbonds. This so-called hydrogen scission reaction is enabled by a newly\ndiscovered metastable bridging hydroxyl group that can form during water\ndissociation.

Namely, they exhibited that quantum kernels can learn specific\ndatasets with lower generalization error over the optimal classical kernel\nmethods. However, most of their results are established on the ideal setting\nand ignore the caveats of near-term quantum machines. To this end, a crucial\nopen question is: does the power of quantum kernels still hold under the NISQ\nsetting? In this study, we fill this knowledge gap by exploiting the power of\nquantum kernels when the quantum system noise and sample error are considered.\nConcretely, we first prove that the advantage of quantum kernels is vanished\nfor large size of datasets, few number of measurements, and large system noise.\nWith the aim of preserving the superiority of quantum kernels in the NISQ era,\nwe further devise an effective method via indefinite kernel learning.

The frequent and\nintense magnetic reconnection on the dayside magnetopause, which is represented\nby the flux transfer event \"shower\", is reviewed on how they depend on\nmagnetosheath plasma beta and magnetic shear angle across the magnetopause,\nfollowing by how they contribute to the flux circulation and\nmagnetosphere-surface-exosphere coupling. In the next, the progress of\nMercury's magnetosphere under extreme solar events, including the core\ninduction and the reconnection erosion on the dayside magnetosphere, the\nresponses of the nightside magnetosphere, are reviewed. Then, the dawn-dusk\nproperties of the plasma sheet, including the features of the ions, the\nstructure of the current sheet, and the dynamics of magnetic reconnection, are\nsummarized.

Nowadays, one common use of euphemisms is to evade content\nmoderation policies enforced by social media platforms. Existing tools for\nenforcing policy automatically rely on keyword searches for words on a \"ban\nlist\", but these are notoriously imprecise: even when limited to swearwords,\nthey can still cause embarrassing false positives. When a commonly used\nordinary word acquires a euphemistic meaning, adding it to a keyword-based ban\nlist is hopeless: consider \"pot\" (storage container or marijuana?) or \"heater\"\n(household appliance or firearm?) The current generation of social media\ncompanies instead hire staff to check posts manually, but this is expensive,\ninhumane, and not much more effective. It is usually apparent to a human\nmoderator that a word is being used euphemistically, but they may not know what\nthe secret meaning is, and therefore whether the message violates policy.

The present work is motivated by\nthe possible development of interfacial instabilities that can occur in porous\nmedia during the process of CO$_2$ sequestration, but does not pretend to\nanalyse this complex problem. Instead, we present a detailed study of the\nanalogous problem occurring in a Hele-Shaw cell, giving indications of possible\nplume patterns that can develop during the CO$_2$ injection. The numerical\nscheme utilises a boundary element method in which the normal velocity at the\ninterface of the two fluids is directly computed through the evaluation of a\nhypersingular integral. The boundary integral equation is solved using a\nNeumann convergent series with cubic B-Spline boundary discretisation,\nexhibiting 6th order spatial convergence. The convergent series allows the long\nterm non-linear dynamics of growing viscous fingers to be explored accurately\nand efficiently. Simulations in low mobility ratio regimes reveal large\ndifferences in fingering patterns compared to those predicted by previous high\nmobility ratio models. Most significantly, classical finger shielding between\ncompeting fingers is inhibited. Secondary fingers can possess significant\nvelocity, allowing greater interaction with primary fingers compared to high\nmobility ratio flows. Eventually, this interaction can lead to base thinning\nand the breaking of fingers into separate bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 06:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

Different from previous\npure CNNs based methods, we argue that it is feasible and practical to\ntranslate facial images into sequences of visual words and perform expression\nrecognition from a global perspective. Therefore, we propose the Visual\nTransformers with Feature Fusion (VTFF) to tackle FER in the wild by two main\nsteps. First, we propose the attentional selective fusion (ASF) for leveraging\ntwo kinds of feature maps generated by two-branch CNNs. The ASF captures\ndiscriminative information by fusing multiple features with the global-local\nattention. The fused feature maps are then flattened and projected into\nsequences of visual words. Second, inspired by the success of Transformers in\nnatural language processing, we propose to model relationships between these\nvisual words with the global self-attention. The proposed method is evaluated\non three public in-the-wild facial expression datasets (RAF-DB, FERPlus and\nAffectNet). Under the same settings, extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod shows superior performance over other methods, setting new state of the\nart on RAF-DB with 88.14%, FERPlus with 88.81% and AffectNet with 61.85%. The\ncross-dataset evaluation on CK+ shows the promising generalization capability\nof the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 03:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 01:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

We show that the first component (PC1) is related to solar\ncycle, and accounts for 41.5 % of the variance of the data. The second\ncomponent (PC2) is related to 22-year Hale cycle, and explains 23.6% of the\nvariance of the data. The PC1 time series of aa cycles 10-23 has only one peak\nin its power spectrum at the period 10.95 years, which is the average solar\ncycle period for the interval SC10-SC23. The PC2 time series of the same cycles\nhas a clear peak at period 21.90 (Hale cycle) and a smaller peak at 3/4 of that\nperiod. We also study the principal component of sunspot numbers (SSN) for\ncycles 10-23, and compare mutual behavior of the PC2 components of aa-index and\nSSN PCA analyses. We note that they are in the same phase in all other cycles\nthan Solar Cycles 15 and 20. The aa cycle 20 also differs from other even aa\ncycles in its shape, especially in anomalously high peaks during its descending\nphase. Even though there is a coherence in the PC2 time series phases of\naa-index and sunspot number, this effect is too small to cause all of the\ndifference of the shape of even and odd aa cycles. We estimate that 30% of the\nshape of the PC2 component of aa-index is due to sunspot number and the rest to\nother recurrent events in Sun/solar-wind. The first maximum of aa-data (typical\nto odd cycles), during sunspot maximum, has been shown to be related to coronal\nmass ejections (CME), while the second maximum (typical to even cycles) in the\ndeclining phase of cycle, is probably related to high-speed streams (HSS).

To address this problem, this paper proposes a\nnovel feature descriptor named the Histogram of Orientated Phase Congruency\n(HOPC), which is based on the structural properties of images. Furthermore, a\nsimilarity metric named HOPCncc is defined, which uses the normalized\ncorrelation coefficient (NCC) of the HOPC descriptors for multimodal\nregistration. In the definition of the proposed similarity metric, we first\nextend the phase congruency model to generate its orientation representation,\nand use the extended model to build HOPCncc. Then a fast template matching\nscheme for this metric is designed to detect the control points between images.\nThe proposed HOPCncc aims to capture the structural similarity between images,\nand has been tested with a variety of optical, LiDAR, SAR and map data. The\nresults show that HOPCncc is robust against complex non-linear radiometric\ndifferences and outperforms the state-of-the-art similarities metrics (i.e.,\nNCC and mutual information) in matching performance.

In\nthis work, we prove that dynamically adapting network architectures tailored\nfor each domain task along with weight finetuning benefits in both efficiency\nand effectiveness, compared to the existing image recognition pipeline that\nonly tunes the weights regardless of the architecture. Our method can be easily\ngeneralized to an unsupervised paradigm by replacing supernet training with\nself-supervised learning in the source domain tasks and performing linear\nevaluation in the downstream tasks. This further improves the search efficiency\nof our method. Moreover, we also provide principled and empirical analysis to\nexplain why our approach works by investigating the ineffectiveness of existing\nneural architecture search. We find that preserving the joint distribution of\nthe network architecture and weights is of importance. This analysis not only\nbenefits image recognition but also provides insights for crafting neural\nnetworks. Experiments on five representative image recognition tasks such as\nperson re-identification, age estimation, gender recognition, image\nclassification, and unsupervised domain adaptation demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 08:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

On the other hand, it has been shown that\nincorporating a priori knowledge, such as expert knowledge or empirical\nfindings, can significantly improve the performance of an EA. However,\nintegrating knowledge in EAs poses numerous challenges. It is often the case\nthat the features of the search space are unknown, hence any knowledge\nassociated with the search space properties can be hardly used. In addition, a\npriori knowledge is typically problem-specific and hard to generalize. In this\npaper, we propose a framework, called Knowledge Integrated Evolutionary\nAlgorithm (KIEA), which facilitates the integration of existing knowledge into\nEAs. Notably, the KIEA framework is EA-agnostic (i.e., it works with any\nevolutionary algorithm), problem-independent (i.e., it is not dedicated to a\nspecific type of problems), expandable (i.e., its knowledge base can grow over\ntime). Furthermore, the framework integrates knowledge while the EA is running,\nthus optimizing the use of the needed computational power. In the preliminary\nexperiments shown here, we observe that the KIEA framework produces in the\nworst case an 80% improvement on the converge time, w.r.t. the corresponding\n\"knowledge-free\" EA counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 08:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

This work also provides tight bounds on the R\\'{e}nyi entropy of a\nfunction of a discrete random variable with a finite number of possible values,\nwhere the considered function is not one-to-one, and their derivation is based\non majorization and the Schur-concavity of the R\\'{e}nyi entropy. One\napplication of the $f$-divergence inequalities refers to the performance\nanalysis of list decoding with either fixed or variable list sizes; some\nearlier bounds on the list decoding error probability are reproduced in a\nunified way, and new bounds are obtained and exemplified numerically.

However,\nthese studies involved limited scales, which hinders multi-scale map creation.\nBy extending their method, multi-scale RSIs can be trivially translated to\nmulti-scale maps (multi-scale rs2map translation) through scale-wise rs2map\nmodels trained for certain scales (parallel strategy). However, this strategy\nhas two theoretical limitations. First, inconsistency between various spatial\nresolutions of multi-scale RSIs and object generalization on multi-scale maps\n(RS-m inconsistency) increasingly complicate the extraction of geographical\ninformation from RSIs for rs2map models with decreasing scale. Second, as\nrs2map translation is cross-domain, generators incur high computation costs to\ntransform the RSI pixel distribution to that on maps. Thus, we designed a\nseries strategy of generators for multi-scale rs2map translation to address\nthese limitations. In this strategy, high-resolution RSIs are inputted to an\nrs2map model to output large-scale maps, which are translated to multi-scale\nmaps through series multi-scale map translation models. The series strategy\navoids RS-m inconsistency as inputs are high-resolution large-scale RSIs, and\nreduces the distribution gap in multi-scale map generation through similar\npixel distributions among multi-scale maps.

The proposed DFA-RPL method identifies intrusive nodes in\nseveral steps to exclude them from continuing routing operations. Thus, in the\nDFA-RPL method, it first builds a cluster and selects the most appropriate node\nas a cluster head in DODAG, then, due to the vulnerability of the RPL protocol\nto Flooding attacks, it uses an ant colony algorithm (ACO) using five steps to\ndetect attacks. Use Flooding to prevent malicious activity on the IoT network.\nIn other words, if it detects a node as malicious, it puts that node on the\ndetention list and quarantines it for a certain period of time.

We show that the\ncondensate fraction in the upper closed channel gradually becomes smaller than\nthat in the lower open channel, as one moves from the strong- to the\nweak-coupling regime, because the OFR-pairing mechanism tunes the interaction\nstrengths by adjusting the energy difference between the two bands.

As the reason for this, we point out a pair-tunneling\neffect by the OFR-induced inter-band interaction. Besides these superfluid\nquantities, we also examine collective modes, such as the Goldstone mode,\nSchmid (Higgs) mode, as well as Leggett mode, to clarify how they appear in the\nspectral weights of pair-correlation functions in each band. Since the\nrealization of a multi-band superfluid Fermi gas is a crucial issue in cold\nFermi gas physics, our results would contribute to the basic understanding of\nthis type of Fermi superfluid in the BCS-BEC crossover region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 09:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 07:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Unfortunately, most computational representations of surface maps\ndo not lend themselves to manipulation and optimization, usually entailing\nhard, discrete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they\nare problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in\nneed. In this paper, we advocate considering neural networks as encoding\nsurface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are\ndifferentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases,\ncompose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable\nobjectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial\nmanner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map\nthat approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model.

However, predictive models for realistic SHS\ngeometries do not yet exist, which has limited the understanding and mitigation\nof these adverse surfactant effects. To address this issue, we derive a model\nfor laminar, three-dimensional flow over SHS gratings as a function of geometry\nand soluble surfactant properties, which together encompass 10 dimensionless\ngroups.

Our model also enables the estimation, based\non velocity measurements, of a priori unknown properties of surfactants\ninherently present in microfluidic systems. For SHSs, we show that surfactant\neffects can be predicted by a single parameter, representing the ratio between\nthe grating length and the interface length scale beyond which the flow\nmobilizes the air-water interface. This mobilization length is more sensitive\nto the surfactant chemistry than to its concentration, such that even\ntrace-level contaminants may significantly increase drag if they are highly\nsurface active.

We study the electrical properties of the molecular junctions\nformed with the tip of a conductive atomic force microscope under ultra-high\nvacuum. The statistical analysis of the current-voltage curves shows two\ndistinct states of the molecule conductance, suggesting the coexistence of both\nthe trans and cis azobenzene isomers on the surface. The cis isomer population\n(trans isomer) increases (decreases) upon UV light irradiation. The situation\nis reversed under blue light irradiation. The experiments are confronted to\nfirst-principle calculations performed on the molecular junctions with the\nNon-Equilibrium Green's Function formalism combined with Density Functional\nTheory (NEGF/DFT). The theoretical results consider two different molecular\norientations for each isomer. Whereas the orientation does not affect the\nconductance of the trans isomer, it significantly modulates the conductance of\nthe cis isomer and the resulting conductance ON/OFF ratio of the molecular\njunction. This helps identifying the molecular orientation at the origin of the\nobserved current differences between the trans and cis forms.

Here we\nreport on an investigation of the spatial distribution of Galactic SNRs. Given\nthe limited number of SNRs it is common to assume a functional form for the\nGalactocentric distribution of SNRs. However, several functional forms have\nbeen used in the past, without much justification for the radial distribution.\nFor example, one often used functional form implies that no supernova activity\nis present in the Galactic Centre region. However, the presence of a magnetar\nand a SNR near the Galactic Centre suggest that a spatial distribution with\nzero SNRs at the Galactic Centre is not realistic. In light of these concerns\nwe reevaluate the Galactic SNR distribution. We provide a brief outline of the\nmain detection biases in finding SNRs and we investigate whether or not the use\nof the most common functional form is justified and how it compares to other\nmodels for the SNR distribution.

Random walk based network embedding methods such as DeepWalk and\nnode2vec have shown outstanding performance in the aspect of preserving the\nnetwork topological structure. However, these approaches either predict the\ndistribution of a node's neighbors in both direction together, which makes them\nunable to capture any asymmetric relationship in a network; or preserve\nasymmetric relationship in only one direction and hence lose the one in another\ndirection. To address these limitations, we propose bidirectional group random\nwalk based network embedding method (BiGRW), which treats the distributions of\na node's neighbors in the forward and backward direction in random walks as two\ndifferent asymmetric network structural information. The basic idea of BiGRW is\nto learn a representation for each node that is useful to predict its\ndistribution of neighbors in the forward and backward direction separately.\nApart from that, a novel random walk sampling strategy is proposed with a\nparameter {\\alpha} to flexibly control the trade-off between breadth-first\nsampling (BFS) and depth-first sampling (DFS). To learn representations from\nnode attributes, we design an attributed version of BiGRW (BiGRW-AT).\nExperimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art plain and\nattributed network embedding methods on tasks of node classification and\nclustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 11:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

The standard\nIrwin's crack closure integral, widely used for the computation of the Energy\nRelease Rate, also relies upon this assumption. However, there are practical\nsituations where the load acting on the crack boundaries is singular. This is\nthe case, for instance, in hydraulic fracturing, where the fluid inside the\ncrack exerts singular tangential tractions at its front. Another example of\nunbounded tractions is the case of a rigid line inclusion (anticrack) embedded\ninto an elastic body. In such situations, the classical Irwin's crack closure\nintegral fails to provide the correct value of the Energy Release Rate. In this\npaper, we address the effects occurring when square-root singular tractions act\nat the boundary of a line defect in an elastic solid and provide a\ngeneralisation of Irwin's crack closure integral. The latter yields the correct\nEnergy Release Rate and allows broad applications, including, among others,\nhydraulic fracturing, soft materials containing stiff inclusions, rigid\ninclusions, shear bands and cracks characterized by the Gurtin-Murdoch surface\nstress elasticity. We present the results in the most general form, where six\nStress Intensity Factors are present: three of them are classical SIFs\ncorresponding to the modes I-II-III and computed under the assumption of\nhomogeneous boundary conditions at the defect surfaces, while the other three\nSIFs are associated with singular admissible tractions (those that lead to a\nfinite ERR value). It is demonstrated that this approach resolves an ambiguity\nin using the same SIF's terminology in the cases of open cracks and rigid\ninclusions, among other benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 11:46:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 13:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

The\nproblem was shown to have an $f(k)n^3$ algorithm by Robertson and Seymour. In\nmodern terminology, this means that Disjoint Paths is fixed parameter tractable\n(FPT), parameterized by the number of vertex pairs. This algorithm is the\ncornerstone of the entire graph minor theory, and a vital ingredient in the\n$g(k)n^3$ algorithm for Minor Testing (given two undirected graphs, $G$ and $H$\non $n$ and $k$ vertices, respectively, the objective is to check whether $G$\ncontains $H$ as a minor). All we know about $f$ and $g$ is that these are\ncomputable functions. Thus, a challenging open problem in graph algorithms is\nto devise an algorithm for Disjoint Paths where $f$ is single exponential. That\nis, $f$ is of the form $2^{{\\sf poly}(k)}$. The algorithm of Robertson and\nSeymour relies on topology and essentially reduces the problem to\nsurface-embedded graphs. Thus, the first major obstacle that has to be overcome\nin order to get an algorithm with a single exponential running time for\nDisjoint Paths and {\\sf Minor Testing} on general graphs is to solve Disjoint\nPaths in single exponential time on surface-embedded graphs and in particular\non planar graphs. Even when the inputs to Disjoint Paths are restricted to\nplanar graphs, a case called the Planar Disjoint Paths problem, the best known\nalgorithm has running time $2^{2^{O(k)}}n^2$. In this paper, we make the first\nstep towards our quest for designing a single exponential time algorithm for\nDisjoint Paths by giving a $2^{O(k^2)}n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for Planar\nDisjoint Paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 12:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

The result is that\ncurrent approaches exhibit unreliable encryption detection performance when\ncompressed data appears in the dataset. Furthermore, proposed approaches are\ntypically evaluated over few data types and fragment sizes, making it hard to\nassess their practical applicability. This paper compares existing statistical\ntests on a large, standardized dataset and shows that current approaches\nconsistently fail to distinguish encrypted and compressed data on both small\nand large fragment sizes. We address these shortcomings and design EnCoD, a\nlearning-based classifier which can reliably distinguish compressed and\nencrypted data.

Some recent deep learning-based\nmatting networks rely on large-scale composite datasets for training to improve\nperformance, resulting in the occasional appearance of obvious artifacts when\nprocessing natural images. In this article, we explore the intrinsic\nrelationship between user input and alpha mattes and strike a balance between\nuser effort and the quality of alpha mattes. In particular, we propose an\ninteractive framework, referred to as smart scribbles, to guide users to draw\nfew scribbles on the input images to produce high-quality alpha mattes. It frst\ninfers the most informative regions of an image for drawing scribbles to\nindicate different categories (foreground, background, or unknown) and then\nspreads these scribbles (i.e., the category labels) to the rest of the image\nvia our well-designed two-phase propagation. Both neighboring low-level\nafnities and high-level semantic features are considered during the propagation\nprocess. Our method can be optimized without large-scale matting datasets and\nexhibits more universality in real situations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that smart scribbles can produce more accurate alpha mattes with\nreduced additional input, compared to the state-of-the-art matting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 13:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

Such relaxation can be either long-lasting,\nwhich usually involves the growth of a shear band that can be only transient or\nthat may persist at steady-state, or abrupt, in which case the solid-to-liquid\ntransition resembles the failure of a brittle material, involving avalanches.\nHere we use a continuum model based on a spatially-resolved fluidity approach\nto rationalize the complete scenario associated with the shear-induced yielding\nof YSFs.

As the spacetime is only approximately diffeomorphism\ninvariant up to powers of $\\hbar$, it is not straight forwardly possible to\nfind global conformally compactified coordinates and to construct the Penrose\ndiagram. Therefore, radial in- and outgoing light rays are studied to extract\nthe causal features and sketch a causal diagram. It was found that the eternal\nmetric [2], which is the vacuum solution of the collapse model, has a causal\nhorizon. However, in the collapsing case light rays travel through matter to\ncausally connect the regions in- and outside the horizon -- the causal horizon\nis not present in the collapsing scenario. It is worked out that this is\nrelated to the shock wave and spacetime discontinuity, which allows matter\ntravelling super-luminal along a space-like trajectory from the vacuum point of\nview, but remaining time-like from the matter perspective. The final causal\ndiagram is a compact patch of a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om causal diagram. Further,\npossibilities of a continuous matter collapse with only time-like evolution are\nstudied. It was found that the time-reversed vacuum metric is also a solution\nof the dynamical equations and a once continuously differentiable matching of\nthe vacuum spacetime across the minimal radius is possible. This allows an\neverywhere continuous and time-like collapse process at the cost of an infinite\nextended causal diagram.

We report a new approach to\nmeasure RDF and RV near contact ($r/a\\: \\approx$ 2.07, $a$ particle radius)\novercoming these limitations. Three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry\nusing four-pulse Shake-the-Box algorithm recorded short particle tracks with\nthe interpolated midpoints registered as particle positions to avoid image\noverlap. This strategy further allows removal of mismatched tracks using their\ncharacteristic false RV.

Such extreme clustering and relative\nvelocity enhancement can be attributed to particle-particle interactions.\nUncertainty analysis substantiates the observed trends.

We also\ndesign a new entropy-based metric for connectivity evaluation, which could\nbetter handle noises or outliers. We implement and evaluate 3\nsegmentation-based baselines and 5 graph-based baselines using the dataset. We\nalso propose a new imitation-learning-based baseline which is enhanced from our\nprevious work. The superiority of our enhancement is demonstrated from the\ncomparison. The dataset and our-implemented code for the baselines are\navailable at \\texttt{\\url{https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/Topo-boundary/}}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 14:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 08:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

To give a promising direction to solve this task, we propose a\nnovel graph-based exploration (GBE) method, which models the navigation state\nas a graph and introduces a novel graph-based exploration approach to learn\nknowledge from the graph and stabilize training by learning sub-optimal\ntrajectories. We also propose a new large-scale benchmark named From Anywhere\nto Object (FAO) dataset. To avoid target ambiguity, the descriptions in FAO\nprovide rich semantic scene information includes: object attribute, object\nrelationship, region description, and nearby region description. Our\nexperiments reveal that the proposed GBE outperforms various state-of-the-arts\non both FAO and R2R datasets. And the ablation studies on FAO validates the\nquality of the dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 15:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 10:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

Variational calculation of the two-electron reduced density\nmatrix (2-RDM) without the many-electron wave function exploits the pairwise\nnature of the electronic Coulomb interaction to compute a lower bound on the\nground-state energy with polynomial computational scaling. Recently, a\ndual-cone formulation of the variational 2-RDM calculation was shown to\ngenerate the ground-state energy, albeit not the 2-RDM, at a substantially\nreduced computational cost, especially for higher $N$-representability\nconditions such as the T2 constraint. Here we generalize the dual-cone\nvariational 2-RDM method to compute not only the ground-state energy but also\nthe 2-RDM. The central result is that we can compute the 2-RDM from a\ngeneralization of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Specifically, we prove that in\nthe Lagrangian formulation of the dual-cone optimization the 2-RDM is the\nLagrange multiplier. We apply the method to computing the energies and\nproperties of strongly correlated electrons -- including atomic charges,\nelectron densities, dipole moments, and orbital occupations -- in an\nillustrative hydrogen chain and the nitrogen-fixation catalyst FeMoco.

Central to this is the wide\ndeployment of smart sensing devices and accordingly the large amount of\nharvested information to be processed for timely decision making. Robust\nnetwork access is, hence, essential for offloading the collected data before a\nset deadline, beyond which the data loses its value. In environments where\ndirect communication can be impaired by, for instance, blockages such as in\nurban cities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be considered as an\nalternative for providing and enhancing connectivity, particularly when IoT\ndevices (IoTD) are constrained with their resources. Also, to conserve energy,\nIoTDs are assumed to alternate between their active and passive modes. This\npaper, therefore, considers a time-constrained data gathering problem from a\nnetwork of sensing devices and with assistance from a UAV. A Reconfigurable\nIntelligent Surface (RIS) is deployed to further improve both the connectivity\nand energy efficiency of the UAV, particularly when multiple devices are served\nconcurrently and experience different channel impairments.

We also present maps of the SiO,\nN2H+, HCN, and HCO+ emission obtained with the IRAM30m telescope. The cloud\nenvironment dominates the emitted FIR (80%), H2O 752 GHz (60 %) mid-J CO (91%),\nand [CI] (93 %) luminosity. The region shows very extended [NII] emission\n(spatially correlated with the 24 and 70 um dust emission). The observed FIR\nluminosities imply G_0~10^3. The extended [CI] emission arises from a pervasive\ncomponent of neutral gas with n_H~10^3 cm-3. The high ionization rates,\nproduced by enhanced cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes, drive the gas heating to Tk~40-60\nK. The mid-J CO emission arises from a similarly extended but more pressurized\ngas component (P_th~10^7 K cm-3). Specific regions of enhanced SiO emission and\nhigh CO-to-FIR intensity ratios (>10^-3) show mid-J CO emission compatible with\nshock models. A major difference compared to more quiescent star-forming clouds\nin the disk of our Galaxy is the extended nature of the SiO and N2H+ emission\nin Sgr B2. This can be explained by the presence of cloud-scale shocks, induced\nby cloud-cloud collisions and stellar feedback, and the much higher CR\nionization rate (>10^-15 s-1) leading to overabundant H3+ and N2H+. Hence, Sgr\nB2 hosts a more extreme environment than star-forming regions in the disk of\nthe Galaxy. As a usual template for extragalactic comparisons, Sgr B2 shows\nmore similarities to ultra luminous infrared galaxies such as Arp 220,\nincluding a \"deficit\" in the [CI]/FIR and [NII]/FIR intensity ratios, than to\npure starburst galaxies such as M82.

Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian\nspectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a\nshape. Some recent works show how the intrinsic geometry of a full shape can be\nrecovered from its spectrum, but there are approaches that consider the more\nchallenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of\npartial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We\nintroduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the\nunion of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D\ngeometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do\nso by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union\noperation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated\nunion spectrum can be used as-is to reconstruct the complete geometry [MRC*19],\nperform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a\ndatabase, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with\neigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling,\nand different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this\noperation especially robust and general.

An effective solution is to\nbuild a computational model over the diverse omics data, including genomic,\nmolecular, and environmental information.

We propose DIVERSE, a framework of Bayesian importance-weighted tri-\nand bi-matrix factorization(DIVERSE3 or DIVERSE2) to predict drug responses\nfrom data of cell lines, drugs, and gene interactions. DIVERSE integrates the\ndata sources systematically, in a step-wise manner, examining the importance of\neach added data set in turn.

Here we present a method that directly measures the volatility of\nparticulate matter (PM) using computational microscopy and deep learning. This\nmethod was applied to aerosols generated by electronic cigarettes (e-cigs),\nwhich vaporize a liquid mixture (e-liquid) that mainly consists of propylene\nglycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and flavoring compounds. E-cig\ngenerated aerosols were recorded by a field-portable computational microscope,\nusing an impaction-based air sampler. A lensless digital holographic microscope\ninside this mobile device continuously records the inline holograms of the\ncollected particles. A deep learning-based algorithm is used to automatically\nreconstruct the microscopic images of e-cig generated particles from their\nholograms, and rapidly quantify their volatility. To evaluate the effects of\ne-liquid composition on aerosol dynamics, we measured the volatility of the\nparticles generated by flavorless, nicotine-free e-liquids with various PG/VG\nvolumetric ratios, revealing a negative correlation between the particles'\nvolatility and the volumetric ratio of VG in the e-liquid. For a given PG/VG\ncomposition, the addition of nicotine dominated the evaporation dynamics of the\ne-cig aerosol and the aforementioned negative correlation was no longer\nobserved. We also revealed that flavoring additives in e-liquids significantly\ndecrease the volatility of e-cig aerosol. The presented holographic volatility\nmeasurement technique and the associated mobile device might provide new\ninsights on the volatility of e-cig generated particles and can be applied to\ncharacterize various volatile PM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 06:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

A related\nheuristic is that fitting parameters should be fewer than measurements (Occam's\nRazor). Surprisingly, contemporary machine learning (ML) approaches, cf. deep\nnets (DNNs), generalize well despite interpolating noisy data. This may be\nunderstood via Statistically Consistent Interpolation (SCI), i.e. data\ninterpolation techniques that generalize optimally for big data. In this\narticle we elucidate SCI using the weighted interpolating nearest neighbors\n(wiNN) algorithm, which adds singular weight functions to kNN (k-nearest\nneighbors). This shows that data interpolation can be a valid ML strategy for\nbig data. SCI clarifies the relation between two ways of modeling natural\nphenomena: the rationalist approach (strong priors) of theoretical physics with\nfew parameters and the empiricist (weak priors) approach of modern ML with more\nparameters than data. SCI shows that the purely empirical approach can\nsuccessfully predict. However data interpolation does not provide theoretical\ninsights, and the training data requirements may be prohibitive.

A nested document collection is\nwhere documents are nested inside a higher order structure such as stories in a\nbook, articles in a journal, or web pages in a web site. In a single collection\nof documents, topics are global, or shared across all documents. For web pages\nnested in web sites, topic frequencies likely vary between web sites.

A\nhierarchical prior for topic frequencies models this hierarchical structure and\nspecifies a global topic distribution. Web site topic distributions vary around\nthe global topic distribution and web page topic distributions vary around the\nweb site topic distribution. In a nested collection of web pages, some topics\nare likely unique to a single web site. Local topics in a nested collection of\nweb pages are topics unique to one web site. For US local health department web\nsites, brief inspection of the text shows local geographic and news topics\nspecific to each department that are not present in others. Topic models that\nignore the nesting may identify local topics, but do not label topics as local\nnor do they explicitly identify the web site owner of the local topic. For web\npages nested inside web sites, local topic models explicitly label local topics\nand identifies the owning web site. This identification can be used to adjust\ninferences about global topics. In the US public health web site data, topic\ncoverage is defined at the web site level after removing local topic words from\npages. Hierarchical local topic models can be used to identify local topics,\nadjust inferences about if web sites cover particular health topics, and study\nhow well health topics are covered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 23:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

The first stage\nranks documents using Wordfish, a Poisson-based document scaling method, to\nestimate document positions that serve, in the second stage, as a dependent\nvariable to learn relevant topics via a supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation.\nThis novelty brings two innovations in text mining as it explains document\npositions, whose scale is a latent variable, and ranks the inferred topics on\nthe document scale to match their occurrences within the corpus and track their\nevolution. Tested on the U.S. State Of The Union two-party addresses, this\ninductive approach reveals that each party dominates one end of the learned\nscale with interchangeable transitions that follow the parties' term of office.\nBesides a demonstrated high accuracy in predicting in-sample documents'\npositions from topic scores, this method reveals further hidden topics that\ndifferentiate similar documents by increasing the number of learned topics to\nunfold potential nested hierarchical topic structures. Compared to other\npopular topic models, Topic Scaling learns topics with respect to document\nsimilarities without specifying a time frequency to learn topic evolution, thus\ncapturing broader topic patterns than dynamic topic models and yielding more\ninterpretable outputs than a plain latent Dirichlet allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 12:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In this\npaper, we introduce the homotopy equivalence relation (HER) to make the neural\nnetworks learn the data distribution from a high-dimension manifold. A shuffle\noperation is adopted to construct HER for its randomness and zero-parameter. In\naddition, inspired by prior works, we propose a local mutual information\nregularizer (LMIR) to cut off the trivial path that leads to a classification\nerror from HER. LMIR utilizes mutual information to measure the distance\nbetween the original feature and HER transformed feature and learns common\nfeatures in a contrastive learning scheme. Thus, we combine HER and LMIR to\ngive our model the ability to learn non-Euclidean features from a\nhigh-dimension manifold. This is named the non-Euclidean feature learner.\nFurthermore, we propose a new heuristics and efficiency point sampling\nalgorithm named ClusterFPS to obtain approximate uniform sampling but at faster\nspeed. ClusterFPS uses a cluster algorithm to divide a point cloud into several\nclusters and deploy the farthest point sampling algorithm on each cluster in\nparallel.

In this paper, we start by presenting a universal approach\nto deriving a formula for liquidity provisioning for AMMs. Next, we show that\nthe constant function market maker and token swap market maker models are\ntheoretically equivalent when liquidity reserves are uniform. Proceeding with\nan examination of AMM market microstructure, we show how non-linear price\neffect translates into slippage for traders and impermanent losses for\nliquidity providers. We proceed by showing how impermanent losses are a\nfunction of both volatility and market depth and discuss the implications of\nthese findings within the context of the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 09:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

Finally, we discussed and made\nsuggestions based on the current development of SGADs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 14:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}
