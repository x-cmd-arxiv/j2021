It is still unclear, however, that which\naugmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a\nwider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way\nto address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation\nlearning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This \"fusion\"\nenables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without\nincreasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator\noverfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the\ncontrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by\nmaintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a\nstrong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are\nalso good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show\nthat GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent\ntechniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly\ndiscriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation.\nFinally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised\nmanner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a\nsimple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD.

To cope with this issue, we propose a diversified multiscale graph\nlearning model equipped with two core ingredients: a graph self-correction\n(GSC) mechanism to generate informative embedded graphs, and a diversity\nboosting regularizer (DBR) to achieve a comprehensive characterization of the\ninput graph. The proposed GSC mechanism compensates the pooled graph with the\nlost information during the graph pooling process by feeding back the estimated\nresidual graph, which serves as a plug-in component for popular graph pooling\nmethods. Meanwhile, pooling methods enhanced with the GSC procedure encourage\nthe discrepancy of node embeddings, and thus it contributes to the success of\nensemble learning strategy.

We propose a general model, Temporal Cluster\nMatching (TCM), for detecting building changes in time series of remotely\nsensed imagery when footprint labels are observed only once. The intuition\nbehind the model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and\noutside of building's footprint will change when a building is constructed (or\ndemolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may\nlook similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.\nSimilarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different\nfrom the surrounding environment until construction.

For example, the perovskite (PV) SrCoO3 is a\nFM metal while the oxygen-deficient (n-doped) brownmillerite (BM) SrCoO2.5 is\nan anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) insulator. Given the magnetic and structural\ntransitions that accompany the MIT, the driver for such a MIT transition is\nunclear. We also observe that the perovskite metals LaNiO3, SrFeO3, and SrCoO3\nalso undergo MIT when n-doped via high-to-low valence compositional changes.\nAlso, pressurizing the insulating BM SrCoO2.5 phase, drives a gap closing.\nUsing DFT and correlated diffusion Monte Carlo approaches we demonstrate that\nthe ABO3 perovskites most prone to MIT are self hole-doped materials,\nreminiscent of a negative charge-transfer system. Upon n-doping away from the\nnegative-charge transfer metallic phase, an underlying charge-lattice (or\ne-phonon) coupling drives the system to a bond-disproportionated gapped state,\nthereby achieving ligand hole passivation at certain sites only, leading to\ncharge-disproportionated states. The size of the gap opened is correlated with\nthe size of the hole-filling at these ligand sites. This suggests that the\ninteractions driving the gap opening to realize a MIT even in correlated metals\nis the charge-transfer energy, but it couples with the underlying phonons to\nenable the transition to the insulating phase. Other orderings (magnetic,\ncharge, etc.) driven by weaker interactions are secondary and may assist gap\nopenings at small dopings, but its the charge-transfer energy that\npredominantly determines the bandgap, with a negative energy preferring the\nmetallic phase. This n-doping can be achieved by modulations in stoichiometry\nor composition or pressure. Hence, controlling the amount of the ligand-hole is\nkey in controlling MIT.

We leverage the\ncorrespondence between excursion set methods and the integrated flux from\nionizing sources to define two physically-motivated prescriptions of the mean\nfree path of ionizing photons that smoothly attenuate the contribution from\ndistant sources. Implementation of these methods in semi-numerical reionization\ncodes requires only modest additional computational effort due to the fact that\nspatial filtering is still performed on scales larger than the characteristic\nabsorption distance.

Using the Cloudy code, we model the photoionization and\nphotodissociation of a slab of gas of optical depth AV{\\leq}30mag at constant\npressure, in order to calculate self-consistently all of the gas phases, from\nionized gas to molecular gas. The ionizing source is the EUV and soft X-ray\nradiation emitted by the cooling gas. We test these models comparing their\npredictions to the rich multi-wavelength observations, from optical to\nsubmillimeter. These models reproduce most of the multi-wavelength spectra\nobserved in the nebulae surrounding the BCGs, not only the LINER-like optical\ndiagnostics: [O iii]{\\lambda} 5007 {\\AA}/H\\b{eta}, [N ii]{\\lambda} 6583\n{\\AA}/H{\\alpha} and ([S ii]{\\lambda} 6716 {\\AA}+[S ii]{\\lambda} 6731\n{\\AA})/H{\\alpha} but also the infrared emission lines from the atomic gas. The\nmodeled ro-vib H2 lines also match observations, which indicates that near and\nmid-IR H2 lines are mostly excited by collisions between H2 molecules and\nsecondary electrons produced naturally inside the cloud by the interaction\nbetween the X-rays and the cold gas in the filament. However, there is still\nsome tension between ionized and molecular line tracers (i.e. CO), which\nrequires to optimize the cloud structure and the density of the molecular zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 18:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Although both object recognition and pose estimation use visual\ninput, most state-of-the-art tackles them as two separate problems since the\nformer needs a view-invariant representation while object pose estimation\nnecessitates a view-dependent description. Nowadays, multi-view Convolutional\nNeural Network (MVCNN) approaches show state-of-the-art classification\nperformance. Although MVCNN object recognition has been widely explored, there\nhas been very little research on multi-view object pose estimation methods, and\neven less on addressing these two problems simultaneously. The pose of virtual\ncameras in MVCNN methods is often predefined in advance, leading to bound the\napplication of such approaches.

This is particularly important with M\ndwarfs, which emit a large and variable fraction of their luminosity in the UV\nand can display strong flaring behavior. The warm Neptune GJ3470b, hosted by an\nM2 dwarf, was found to harbor a giant hydrogen exosphere thanks to 3 transits\nobserved with the HST/STIS. Here we report on 3 additional transit observations\nfrom the PanCET program, obtained with the HST/COS. These data confirm the\nabsorption signature from GJ3470b's exosphere in the stellar Ly-alpha line and\ndemonstrate its stability over time. No planetary signatures are detected in\nother lines, setting a 3sigma limit on GJ3470b's FUV radius at 1.3x its Roche\nlobe radius. We detect 3 flares from GJ3470. They show different spectral\nenergy distributions but peak consistently in the Si III line, which traces\nintermediate-temperature layers in the transition region. These layers appear\nto play a particular role in GJ3470's activity as emission lines that form at\nlower or higher temperatures than Si III evolved differently over the long\nterm. Based on the measured emission lines, we derive synthetic XUV spectra for\nthe 6 observed quiescent phases, covering one year, as well as for the 3\nflaring episodes. Our results suggest that most of GJ3470's quiescent\nhigh-energy emission comes from the EUV domain, with flares amplifying the FUV\nemission more strongly. The hydrogen photoionization lifetimes and mass loss\nderived for GJ3470b show little variation over the epochs, in agreement with\nthe stability of the exosphere.

In the literature,\ndisturbances are widely rejected by using velocity models, disturbance model\nwith observer approach or a scheme that combines the compensation of a\ndisturbance observer and the feedback regulation of MPC. Contrary to the widely\nused methods, the technique proposed in this research utilises the increment\nmodel of plants, with the assumption of fast-changing disturbances, to\nformulate a control law to reject the varying-disturbances. The uniqueness of\nthe method stems from the compensation of the disturbance magnitude and rate of\nchange. By proposing a cost function where the increment form of the system\ndisturbance is taken as an optimisation variable, a control signal that is a\nfunction of a computed optimal disturbance increment is formulated to ensure\nthat the plant is driven according to the minimisation of the cost function.\nThe degree of freedom introduced by using the optimal disturbance in the\ncontrol law was exploited to introduce the estimated disturbance increment into\nthe control signal such that it is always in opposition to the external\ndisturbance increment. Moreover, the proposed cost function provides a\nweighting matrix that can be used to manipulate the impacts of the exogenous\ndisturbances on the response of the system. To estimate the unmeasurable\ndisturbances, a combined state and disturbance observer is designed based on a\nconvex optimisation stated in terms of an H2-minimisation problem. Simulations\nof three different systems are used to show the benefits of the proposed\nalgorithm when compared with conventional offset-free MPC techniques. The\nresults demonstrated that the proposed scheme can give significantly improved\noutput tracking and regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 19:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 12:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 16:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

In sharp contrast,\nthe artifact \"THE\", or two-component AHE occurs well beyond the saturation of\nthe \"AHE component\" (under the false assumption of THE+AHE).

Minor loops of genuine THE with\nAHE are always within the full loop, while minor loops of the artifact \"THE\"\nmay reveal a single loop that cannot fit into the \"AHE component\".

Therefore, the models that are\nconstructed by the lower frame-rate of speech encoder lead to better\nperformance. For Transformer-based ASR, the lower frame-rate is not only\nimportant for learning better semantic representation but also for reducing the\ncomputational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism which has O(n^2)\norder of complexity in both training and inference.

The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment,\na 20 kton liquid scintillator detector with excellent energy resolution is\ncurrently under construction in China. JUNO will be able to detect several\natmospheric neutrinos per day given the large volume. A study on the JUNO\ndetection and reconstruction capabilities of atmospheric $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$\nfluxes is presented in this paper. In this study, a sample of atmospheric\nneutrino Monte Carlo events has been generated, starting from theoretical\nmodels, and then processed by the detector simulation. The excellent timing\nresolution of the 3'' PMT light detection system of JUNO detector and the much\nhigher light yield for scintillation over Cherenkov allow to measure the time\nstructure of the scintillation light with very high precision. Since $\\nu_e$\nand $\\nu_\\mu$ interactions produce a slightly different light pattern, the\ndifferent time evolution of light allows to discriminate the flavor of primary\nneutrinos. A probabilistic unfolding method has been used, in order to infer\nthe primary neutrino energy spectrum from the detector experimental\nobservables. The simulated spectrum has been reconstructed between 100 MeV and\n10 GeV, showing a great potential of the detector in the atmospheric low energy\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 21:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 09:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The set of feasible\ndistributions obeys thermodynamics: the most probable distribution is the\ncanonical distribution, it maximizes the functionals of statistical mechanics,\nand its parameters satisfy the same Legendre relationships. Thus the formalism\nof thermodynamics -- no new functionals beyond those already encountered in\nstatistical physics -- is shown to be a stochastic calculus, a universal\nlanguage of probability distributions and stochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 21:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

While several codes have been developed over the years to compute\ngeneric quasi-equilibrium configurations of binaries comprising either two\nblack holes, or two neutron stars, or a black hole and a neutron star, these\ncodes are often not publicly available or they provide only a limited\ncapability in terms of mass ratios and spins of the components in the binary.\nWe here present a new open-source collection of spectral elliptic solvers that\nare capable of exploring the major parameter space of binary black holes\n(BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), and mixed binaries of black holes and\nneutron stars (BHNSs). Particularly important is the ability of the\nspectral-solver library to handle neutron stars that are either irrotational or\nwith an intrinsic spin angular momentum that is parallel to the orbital one. By\nsupporting both analytic and tabulated equations of state at zero or finite\ntemperature, the new infrastructure is particularly geared towards allowing for\nthe construction of BHNS and BNS binaries. For the latter, we show that the new\nsolvers are able to reach the most extreme corners in the physically plausible\nspace of parameters, including extreme mass ratios and spin asymmetries, thus\nrepresenting the most extreme BNS computed to date. Through a systematic series\nof examples, we demonstrate that the solvers are able to construct\nquasi-equilibrium and eccentricity-reduced initial data for BBHs, BNSs, and\nBHNSs, achieving spectral convergence in all cases. Furthermore, using such\ninitial data, we have carried out evolutions of these systems from the inspiral\nto after the merger, obtaining evolutions with eccentricities $\\lesssim\n10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, and accurate gravitational waveforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 21:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

This supervisory loop is configured using only a few scalar\nparameters, and automatically controls the modal gains to closely match\ntransfer functions achieving minimum variance control. This optimization is\nproven to work throughout the range of noise and seeing conditions relevant to\nthe AO system.

Gravitational microlensing is a proposed technique to\nsearch for isolated BHs, which to date have not been detected. Two microlensing\nevents, MACHO-1996-BLG-5 (M96-B5) and MACHO-1998-BLG-6 (M98-B6), initially\nobserved near the lens-source minimum angular separation in 1996 and 1998,\nrespectively, have long Einstein crossing times (>300 days), identifying the\nlenses as candidate black holes. Twenty years have elapsed since the time of\nlens-source closest approach for each of these events, indicating that if the\nlens and source are both luminous, and if their relative proper motion is\nsufficiently large, the two components should be spatially resolvable. We\nattempt to eliminate the possibility of a stellar lens for these events by: (1)\nusing Keck near-infrared adaptive optics images to search for a potentially\nnow-resolved, luminous lens; and (2) examining multi-band photometry of the\nsource to search for flux contributions from a potentially unresolved, luminous\nlens.

We then\npresent two information-theoretic lower bounds on the average rate for caching\nwith uncoded placement, one for general cache placements and the other\nrestricted to the popularity-first placements. By comparing the average rate of\nthe optimized MCCS with the lower bounds, we prove that the optimized MCCS\nattains the general lower bound for the two-user case, providing the exact\nmemory-rate tradeoff. Furthermore, it attains the popularity-first-based lower\nbound for the case of general K users with distinct file requests. In these two\ncases, our results also reveal that the popularity-first placement is optimal\nfor the MCCS, and zero-padding used in coded delivery incurs no loss of\noptimality. For the case of K users with redundant file requests, our analysis\nshows that there may exist a gap between the optimized MCCS and the lower\nbounds due to zero-padding. We next fully characterize the optimal\npopularity-first cache placement for the MCCS, which is shown to possess a\nsimple file-grouping structure and can be computed via an efficient algorithm\nusing closed-form expressions. Finally, we extend our study to accommodate both\nnonuniform file popularity and sizes, where we show that the optimized MCCS\nattains the lower bound for the two-user case, providing the exact memory-rate\ntradeoff.

Indeed, we show that the typical linear resizer can be replaced with\nlearned resizers that can substantially improve performance.

The\nparameters of the proposed model maximize the neural response at a given OP\nwith an OP tuning curve fitted to experimental results.

Here, we propose a new mechanism\nfor generating entangled and squeezed photon pairs using superluminal and/or\naccelerating modulations of the refractive index in a medium. By leveraging\ntime-changing dielectric media, where quantum vacuum fluctuations of the\nelectromagnetic field can be converted into photon pairs, we show that energy-\nand momentum-conservation in multi-mode systems give rise to frequency and\nangle correlations of photon pairs which are controlled by the trajectory of\nthe index modulation. These radiation effects are two-photon analogues of\nCherenkov and synchrotron radiation by moving charged particles such as free\nelectrons.

The objective of my thesis was to\ninvestigate the physical properties of the photosphere and circumstellar\nenvironment of massive hot stars confronting multi-band spectroscopic or\nspectro-interferometric observations and sophisticated non-LTE radiative\ntransfer codes. My work was focused on two main lines of research. The first\nconcerns radiative line-driven winds.

This study shows for the first time that\nthe weak wind phenomenon, originally found for O dwarfs, also exists on more\nevolved O stars and that future studies must evaluate its impact on the\nevolution of massive stars. My other line of research concerns the study of\nclassical Be stars, the fastest rotators among the non-degenerated stars, and\nwhich are surrounded by rotating equatorial disks. I studied the Be star\n$\\omicron$ Aquarii using H$\\alpha$ (CHARA/VEGA) and Br$\\gamma$ (VLTI/AMBER)\nspectro-interferometric observations, the radiative transfer code HDUST, and\ndeveloping new automatic procedures to better constrain the kinematics of the\ndisk.

In this paper, we updated an analytic magnetar-powered model for\nfitting the multi-band light curves of double-peaked SLSNe-I: the early bump is\npowered by magnetar-driven shock breakout thermal emission, and the main peak\nis powered by a radiative diffusion through the SN ejecta as in the standard\nmagnetar-powered model. Generally, the diffusive luminosity is greater than the\nshock breakout luminosity at the early time, which makes the shock breakout\nbumps usually not clearly seen as observed. To obtain a clear double-peaked\nlight curve, inefficient magnetar heating at early times is required. This\nmodel is applied to three well-observed double-peaked SLSNe-I (i.e., SN2006oz,\nLSQ14bdq, and DES14Xtaz). We find that a relative massive SN ejecta with\n$M_{\\mathrm{ej}} \\simeq 10.2-18.1 M_{\\odot}$ and relative large kinetic energy\nof SN ejecta $E_{\\mathrm{sn}} \\simeq (3.8-6.5) \\times 10^{51}$ erg are\nrequired, and the thermalization efficiency of the magnetar heating is\nsuppressed before $t_{\\mathrm{delay}}$, which are in the range of $\\simeq 15-\n43$ days.

A point-cloud consists of a sparse, unstructured, and unordered set of\npoints. To understand a point-cloud, previous point-based methods, such as\nPointNet++, extract visual features through hierarchically aggregation of local\nfeatures. However, such methods have several critical limitations: 1) Such\nmethods require several sampling and grouping operations, which slow down the\ninference speed. 2) Such methods spend an equal amount of computation on each\npoints in a point-cloud, though many of points are redundant. 3) Such methods\naggregate local features together through downsampling, which leads to\ninformation loss and hurts the perception performance. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a novel, simple, and elegant deep learning model called\nYOGO (You Only Group Once). Compared with previous methods, YOGO only needs to\nsample and group a point-cloud once, so it is very efficient. Instead of\noperating on points, YOGO operates on a small number of tokens, each of which\nsummarizes the point features in a sub-region. This allows us to avoid\ncomputing on the redundant points and thus boosts efficiency.Moreover, YOGO\npreserves point-wise features by projecting token features to point features\nalthough the computation is performed on tokens. This avoids information loss\nand can improve point-wise perception performance. We conduct thorough\nexperiments to demonstrate that YOGO achieves at least 3.0x speedup over\npoint-based baselines while delivering competitive classification and\nsegmentation performance on the ModelNet, ShapeNetParts and S3DIS datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 01:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

The workhorse of deep learning is the optimization of loss\nfunctions by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Traditionally in deep learning,\nneural networks are differentiable mathematical functions, and the loss\ngradients required for SGD are computed with the backpropagation algorithm.\nHowever, the computer architectures on which these neural networks are\nimplemented and trained suffer from speed and energy inefficiency issues, due\nto the separation of memory and processing in these architectures. To solve\nthese problems, the field of neuromorphic computing aims at implementing neural\nnetworks on hardware architectures that merge memory and processing, just like\nbrains do. In this thesis, we argue that building large, fast and efficient\nneural networks on neuromorphic architectures also requires rethinking the\nalgorithms to implement and train them. We present an alternative mathematical\nframework, also compatible with SGD, which offers the possibility to design\nneural networks in substrates that directly exploit the laws of physics. Our\nframework applies to a very broad class of models, namely those whose state or\ndynamics are described by variational equations. This includes physical systems\nwhose equilibrium state minimizes an energy function, and physical systems\nwhose trajectory minimizes an action functional. We present a simple procedure\nto compute the loss gradients in such systems, called equilibrium propagation\n(EqProp), which requires solely locally available information for each\ntrainable parameter. Since many models in physics and engineering can be\ndescribed by variational principles, our framework has the potential to be\napplied to a broad variety of physical systems whose applications extend to\nvarious fields of engineering, beyond neuromorphic computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 02:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 23:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

We\nfirst prove a general theoretical result: even if the exact set of factors\ncannot be identified, any risky asset can use some portfolio of similar peer\nassets to hedge against its own factor exposures. A long position of a risky\nasset and a short position of a \"replicate portfolio\" of its peers represent\nthat asset's factor residual risk. We coin the expected return of an asset's\nfactor residual risk as its Statistical Arbitrage Risk Premium (SARP). The\nchallenge in empirically estimating SARP is finding the peers for each asset\nand constructing the replicate portfolios. We use the elastic-net, a machine\nlearning method, to project each stock's past returns onto that of every other\nstock. The resulting high-dimensional but sparse projection vector serves as\ninvestment weights in constructing the stocks' replicate portfolios. We say a\nstock has high (low) Statistical Arbitrage Risk (SAR) if it has low (high)\nR-squared with its peers. The key finding is that \"unique\" stocks have both a\nhigher SARP and higher excess returns than \"ubiquitous\" stocks: in the\ncross-section, high SAR stocks have a monthly SARP (monthly excess returns)\nthat is 1.101% (0.710%) greater than low SAR stocks.

The\nHRBs and HUBs are used to assist the HD decoders to prevent miscorrections and\nto decode those originally uncorrectable cases via bit flipping (BF),\nrespectively. In this paper, an improved SABM algorithm (called iSABM) is\nproposed for staircase codes (SCCs). Similar to the SABM, iSABM marks bits with\nthe help of channel reliabilities, i.e., using the absolute values of the\nlog-likelihood ratios. The improvements offered by iSABM include: (i) HUBs\nbeing classified using a reliability threshold, (ii) BF randomly selecting\nHUBs, and (iii) soft-aided decoding over multiple SCC blocks. The decoding\ncomplexity of iSABM is comparable of that of SABM. This is due to the fact that\non the one hand no sorting is required (lower complexity) because of the use of\na threshold for HUBs, while on the other hand multiple SCC blocks use soft\ninformation (higher complexity). Additional gains of up to 0.53 dB with respect\nto SABM and 0.91 dB with respect to standard SCC decoding at a bit error rate\nof $10^{-6}$ are reported. Furthermore, it is shown that using 1-bit\nreliability marking, i.e., only having HRBs and HUBs, only causes a gain\npenalty of up to 0.25 dB with a significantly reduced memory requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 02:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

This unitary stabilizer nullity extends the state-stabilizer\nnullity by Beverland et al. to a dynamic version.

To complete\nthis totally new task, a modal translation network (MT-Net) from visual to\nauditory sense is proposed. The proposed MT-Net includes three progressive\nsub-networks: 1) feature learning, 2) cross-modal mapping, and 3) audio\ngeneration. First, the feature learning sub-network aims to learn semantic\nfeatures from image and audio, including image feature learning and audio\nfeature learning. Second, the cross-modal mapping sub-network transforms the\nimage feature into a cross-modal representation with the same semantic concept\nas the audio feature. In this way, the correlation of inter-modal data is\neffectively mined for easing the heterogeneous gap between image and audio.\nFinally, the audio generation sub-network is designed to generate the audio\nwaveform from the cross-modal representation.

We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting,\nwhere the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a\ndifferent structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately\nby augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical\nvector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical\narchitecture isentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the\nvector quantization in VQVAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete\ndistribution over the structural information.

In the second stage, we propose a structural attention\nmodule inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the\nstructural information to capture distant correlations.

Photometric and spectroscopic studies reveal that almost all ancient\nglobular clusters in the Milky Way and our neighbouring galaxies exhibit\nstar-to-star light-element abundance variations, typically known as 'multiple\npopulations' (MPs). Here, we analyse photometric $\\it Hubble$ $\\it Space$ $\\it\nTelescope$ observations of three young ($<$2 Gyr-old) Large and Small\nMagellanic Cloud clusters, NGC 411, NGC 1718 and NGC 2213. We measure the\nwidths of their red-giant branches (RGBs). For NGC 411, we also use a\npseudo-colour--magnitude diagram (pseudo-CMD) to assess its RGB for evidence of\nMPs. We compare the morphologies of the clusters' RGBs with artificially\ngenerated SSPs. We conclude that their RGBs do not show evidence of significant\nbroadening beyond intrinsic photometric scatter, suggesting an absence of\nsignificant chemical abundance variations in our sample clusters. Specifically,\nfor NGC 411, NGC 1718 and NGC 2213 we derive maximum helium-abundance\nvariations of delta_Y=0.003$\\pm$0.001 Y=0.300), 0.002$\\pm$0.001 (Y=0.350) and\n0.004$\\pm$0.002 (Y=0.300), respectively. We determined an upper limit to the\nNGC 411 nitrogen-abundance variation of $\\Delta$[N/Fe] = 0.3 dex; the available\ndata for our other clusters do not allow us to determine useful upper limits.\nIt thus appears that the transition from SSPs to MPs occurs at an age of ~2\nGyr, implying that age might play an important role in this transition. This\nraises the question as to whether this is indeed a fundamental minimum-age\nlimit for the formation of MPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 06:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

This article presents a miniaturized LF magnetoelectric(ME)\nreceiving antenna with an integrated DC magnetic bias. The antenna is based on\nthe magnetoelectric effect and operates by resonance at its mechanical resonant\nfrequency. Thus, compared with traditional LF wire antennas, the dimension of\nME antenna is reduced significantly. Compared with prior art of ME antennas\nwhich do not have DC magnetic bias, higher performance can be achieved by\nintegrating the miniaturized DC magnetic bias.

A maximum operation distance of 2.5m is demonstrated with the DC\nmagnetic field bias, 2.27 times of the maximum operation distance of the\nantenna without DC magnet field bias.

Fazekas scale\nfacilitates an accurate quantitative assessment of the severity of white matter\nlesions and hence the disease. Imaging Biomarkers of dementia are multiple and\ncomprehensive documentation of them is time-consuming. Therefore, any effort to\nautomatically extract these biomarkers will be of clinical value while reducing\ninter-rater discrepancies. To tackle this problem, we propose to classify the\ndisease severity based on the Fazekas scale through the visual biomarkers,\nnamely the Periventricular White Matter (PVWM) and the Deep White Matter (DWM)\nchanges, in the real-world setting of thick-slice MRI. Small training sample\nsize and weak supervision in form of assigning severity labels to the whole MRI\nstack are among the main challenges.

The effect of one-ways\non the pattern of shortest paths is then twofold: they mitigate local traffic\nin certain areas but create bottlenecks elsewhere.

At a first glance it can be observed that the\ncapability of a time differential dual-phase-lag model of heat conduction to\ndescribe real phenomena depends on the properties of the differential operators\ninvolved in the related constitutive equation. In fact, the constitutive\nequation is viewed as an ordinary differential equation in terms of the heat\nflux components (or in terms of the temperature gradient) and it results that,\nfor approximation orders greater than or equal to five, the corresponding\ncharacteristic equation has at least a complex root having a positive real\npart. That leads to a heat flux component (or temperature gradient) that grows\nto infinity when the time tends to infinity and so there occur some\ninstabilities. Instead, when the approximation orders are lower than or equal\nto four, this is not the case and there is the need to study the compatibility\nwith the Second Law of Thermodynamics. To this aim the related constitutive\nequation is reformulated within the system of the fading memory theory, and\nthus the heat flux vector is written in terms of the history of the temperature\ngradient and on this basis the compatibility of the model with the\nthermodynamical principles is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 08:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

This certitude has recently been challenged by the\npossible detection of anti-helium nuclei by AMS-02. Should the observation be\nconfirmed, the existence of nearby antistars would make a plausible hypothesis\nto explain the origin of the antinuclei. In this paper we use the 10-years\nFermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray source catalog to set constraints on\nthe abundance of antistars around the Sun. We identify in the catalog 14\nantistar candidates not associated with any objects belonging to established\ngamma-ray source classes and with a spectrum compatible with baryon-antibaryon\nannihilation. We use them along with an estimate of the LAT sensitivity to\nantistars to set upper limits on the local antistar fraction $f_{\\bar{\\ast}}$\nwith respect to normal stars. We provide parametric limits as a function of the\nclosest antistar mass, velocity, and surrounding matter density. We also employ\na novel Monte~Carlo method to set limits for a few hypotheses about the\nantistar population. For a population with properties equivalent to those of\nregular stars concentrated in the Galactic disk we obtain $f_{\\bar{\\ast}} < 2.5\n\\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\\% confidence level, which is 20 times more constraining\nthan limits previously available. For a primordial population of antistars\ndistributed in the Galactic halo we obtain new local upper limits which\ndecrease as a function of antistar mass $M$ from $f_{\\bar{\\ast}} < 0.2$ at 95\\%\nconfidence level for $M = 1 \\; M_\\odot$ to $f_{\\bar{\\ast}} < 1.6 \\times\n10^{-4}$ at 95\\% confidence level for $M = 10 \\; M_\\odot$. By combining these\nlimits with existing microlensing constraints for lighter objects in the\nMagellanic clouds, we infer that a primordial population of halo antistars must\nhave a density lower than $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}\\;\\text{pc}^{-3})$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}\\;\\text{pc}^{-3})$ depending on their masses.

However, the\nunderstanding of multi-scale topography, and its effect on properties, has been\nhindered by conventional measurement methods, which capture only a single\nlength scale. Here, four different polycrystalline diamond coatings are\ncharacterized using transmission electron microscopy to assess the roughness\ndown to the sub-nanometer scale. Then these measurements are combined, using\nthe power spectral density (PSD), with conventional methods (stylus\nprofilometry and atomic force microscopy) to characterize all scales of\ntopography. The results demonstrate the critical importance of measuring\ntopography across all length scales, especially because their PSDs cross over\none another, such that a surface that is rougher at a larger scale may be\nsmoother at a smaller scale and vice versa. Furthermore, these measurements\nreveal the connection between multi-scale topography and grain size, with\ncharacteristic scaling behavior at and slightly below the mean grain size, and\nself-affine fractal-like roughness at other length scales. At small (subgrain)\nscales, unpolished surfaces exhibit a common form of residual roughness that is\nself-affine in nature but difficult to detect with conventional methods. This\napproach of capturing topography from the atomic- to the macro-scale is termed\ncomprehensive topography characterization, and all of the topography data from\nthese surfaces has been made available for further analysis by experimentalists\nand theoreticians.

In this paper, firstly, a brand new\nNetwork design mechanism TPPI (training based on pixel and prediction based on\nimage) is proposed for HSI classification, which makes it possible to provide\nefficient and practical HSI classification with the restrictive conditions\nattached to the hyperspectral dataset. And then, according to the TPPI\nmechanism, TPPI-Net is derived based on the state of the art networks for HSI\nclassification. Experimental results show that the proposed TPPI-Net can not\nonly obtain high classification accuracy equivalent to the state of the art\nnetworks for HSI classification, but also greatly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of hyperspectral image prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 08:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

Two main factors\nare responsible for this: 1) the IoU threshold faces a dilemma that a lower one\nwill result in more false positives, while a higher one will filter out the\nmatched positives; 2) the IoU-based GT-Proposal assignment suffers from the\ninconsistent supervision problem that spatially adjacent proposals with similar\nfeatures are assigned to different ground-truth boxes, which means some very\nsimilar proposals may be forced to regress towards different targets, and thus\nconfuses the bounding-box regression when predicting the location results. In\nthis paper, we first put forward the question that \\textbf{Regression\nDirection} would affect the performance for pedestrian detection. Consequently,\nwe address the weakness of IoU by introducing one geometric sensitive search\nalgorithm as a new assignment and regression metric. Different from the\nprevious IoU-based \\textbf{one-to-one} assignment manner of one proposal to one\nground-truth box, the proposed method attempts to seek a reasonable matching\nbetween the sets of proposals and ground-truth boxes. Specifically, we boost\nthe MR-FPPI under R$_{75}$ by 8.8\\% on Citypersons dataset. Furthermore, by\nincorporating this method as a metric into the state-of-the-art pedestrian\ndetectors, we show a consistent improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 08:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

Approved treatment includes up to 3, in palmar\nfibromatosis or up to 8, in penile fibromatosis, injections followed by finger\nextension or penile modelling procedures, typically causing severe pain.\nFrequently single injections are enough to treat palmar fibromatosis. 3, The\nneed to inject repeatedly doses of this enzyme can be originated by by the\nlabile nature of collagenase which exhibits a complete activity loss after\nshort periods of time. Herein, a novel strategy to manage this enzyme based on\nthe synthesis of polymeric nanocapsules which contains collagenase housed\nwithin their matrix is presented. These nanocapsules have been engineered for\nachieving a gradual release of the encapsulated enzyme for longer times which\ncan be up to ten days. The efficacy of these nanocapsules have been tested in\nmurine model of local dermal fibrosis yielding higher fibrosis reduction in\ncomparison with the injection of free enzyme which represent a significant\nimprovement over conventional therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 09:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

It\nhas been proposed that they arise from particle acceleration induced by\nturbulence and weak shocks, injected in the intracluster medium (ICM) during\nmergers. MACS J1149.5+2223 (MACS J1149) is a high redshift ($z=0.544$) galaxy\ncluster possibly hosting a radio halo and a relic. We analysed LOFAR, GMRT, and\nJVLA radio data at 144, 323, 1500 MHz, and Chandra X-ray data to characterise\nthe thermal and non-thermal properties of the cluster. We obtained radio images\nat different frequencies to investigate the spectral properties of the radio\nhalo. We used Chandra X-ray images to constrain the thermal properties of the\ncluster. We measured a steep spectrum of the halo, with $\\alpha=1.49\\pm 0.12$\nbetween 144 and 1500 MHz. The radio surface brightness distribution across the\nhalo is found to correlate with the X-ray brightness of the ICM, with a\nsub-linear slope in the range 0.4 to 0.6. We also report two possible cold\nfronts in north-east and north-west, but deeper X-ray observations are required\nto firmly constrain the properties of the upstream emission. We show that the\ncombination of high redshift, steep radio spectrum, and sub-linear radio-X\nscaling of the halo rules out hadronic models. An old ($\\sim 1 $ Gyr ago) major\nmerger likely induced the formation of the halo through stochastic\nre-acceleration of relativistic electrons. We suggest that the two possible\nX-ray discontinuities may actually be part of the same cold front. In this\ncase, the coolest gas pushed towards the north-west might be associated with\nthe cool core of a sub-cluster involved in the major merger. The peculiar\norientation of the south-east relic might indicate a different nature of this\nsource and requires further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 09:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

In this protocol, an\nuntrusted third party (TP) only needs to perform the quantum operations related\nto single photons and the participants only have to perform two quantum\noperations: (1) reflecting qubits without disturbance (2) performing unitary\noperations on single photons. In addition, this protocol is showed to be robust\nunder the collective attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 09:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

This tilt is understood as a consequence\nof a quasi de Sitter classical equation of state describing the inflationary\ndark energy dominated era. Here, following previous work, we find a departure\nof scale invariance for the quantum Fisher information associated to de Sitter\nvacuum for scalar quantum spectator modes. This gives rise to a purely quantum\ncosmological tilt with a well defined dependence on energy scale. This quantum\ntilt is imprinted, in a scale dependent energy uncertainty for the spectator\nmodes. The effective quasi de Sitter description of this model independent\nenergy uncertainty uniquely sets the effective quasi de Sitter parameters at\nall energy scales. In particular, in the slow-roll regime characterized by an\nalmost constant $\\epsilon$, the quantum Fisher -- model independent --\nprediction for the spectral index is $(1-n_s) = 0.0328$ ($n_s=0.9672$).\nMoreover, the energy scale dependence of the quantum cosmological tilt implies\nthe existence of a cosmological phase transition at energies higher than the\nCMB scale where the tilt goes from red into blue. This strongly suggest the\nexistence of a pre-inflationary phase where the effective scalaron contributes\nto the spectral index as normal relativistic matter and where the corresponding\ngrowth of the power spectrum can result in dark matter in the form of small\nmass primordial black holes. The source and features of the quantum\ncosmological tilt leading to these predictions are determined by the\nentanglement features of the de Sitter vacuum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 10:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 17:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 12:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

To this end, this\npaper proposes a physics-based and data-driven linear three-phase power flow\nmodel for DPSs. We first formulate how to amalgamate data-driven techniques\ninto a physics-based power flow model to obtain our linear model. This\namalgamation makes our linear model independent of the assumptions commonly\nused in the literature (e.g., nodal voltages are nearly 1.0 p.u.) and thus have\na relatively high accuracy generally - even when those assumptions become\ninvalid. We then reveal how to apply our model to the DPSs with ZIP loads. We\nalso show that with the Huber penalty function employed, the adverse impact of\nbad data on our model's accuracy is significantly reduced, rendering our model\nrobust against poor data quality. Case studies have demonstrated that our model\ngenerally has 2 to over 10-fold smaller average errors than other linear power\nflow models, enjoys a satisfying accuracy against bad data, and facilitates a\nfaster solution to DPS analysis and optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 10:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

In the configuration space, the infinite coherence\ncorresponds to equality of the (effective) group velocities of the eigenstates.\nIn constant density medium, there is a unique $E_0$, which coincides with the\nMSW resonance energy of oscillations of mass states and is close to the MSW\nresonance energy of flavor states.

As a result, they\ninevitably undergo secular evolution (`relaxation') causing their mean\ndistribution function (DF) to evolve on long timescales. On one hand, this\nlong-term evolution may be interpreted as driven by the accumulation of local\ndeflections along each star's mean field trajectory -- so-called `non-resonant\nrelaxation'. On the other hand, it can be thought of as driven by non-local,\ncollectively dressed and resonant couplings between stellar orbits, a process\ntermed `resonant relaxation'. In this paper we consider a model globular\ncluster represented by a spherical, isotropic isochrone DF, and compare in\ndetail the predictions of both resonant and non-resonant relaxation theories\nagainst tailored direct $N$-body simulations. In the space of orbital actions\n(namely the radial action and total angular momentum), we find that both\nresonant and non-resonant theories predict the correct morphology for the\nsecular evolution of the cluster's DF, although non-resonant theory\nover-estimates the amplitude of the relaxation rate by a factor ${\\sim 2}$. We\nconclude that the secular relaxation of hot isotropic spherical clusters is not\ndominated by collectively amplified large-scale potential fluctuations, despite\nthe existence of a strong ${\\ell = 1}$ damped mode.

Most existing research focuses on\nactivities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code\nbrought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the\nevolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams\nrely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon.\nMoreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused. Method: We\ncollected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from DEVPOST -- a\nhackathon database -- and obtained related code (blobs), authors, and project\ncharacteristics from the World of Code. We investigated if code blobs in\nhackathon projects were created before, during, or after an event by\nidentifying the original blob creation date and author, and also checked if the\noriginal author was a hackathon project member. We tracked code reuse by first\nidentifying all commits containing blobs created during an event before\ndetermining all projects that contain those commits. Result: While only\napproximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during hackathons, this\namount is still significant considering the time and member constraints of such\nevents. Approximately a third of these code blobs get reused in other projects.\nConclusion: Our study demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and\nnew code is created during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere\nafterwards.

It is\nbased on the process of activating vertices of a graph $G$ starting from a set\nof vertices that are already active, and applying the rule that an active\nvertex with exactly one non-active neighbor forces that neighbor to become\nactive. A set $S\\subset V(G)$ is called a zero forcing set of $G$ if initially\nonly vertices of $S$ are active and the described process enforces all vertices\nof $G$ to become active. The size of a minimum zero forcing set in $G$ is\ncalled the zero forcing number of $G$. While a minimum zero forcing set can\nonly be unique in edgeless graphs, we consider the weaker uniqueness condition,\nnotably that for every two minimum zero forcing sets in a graph $G$ there is an\nautomorphism that maps one to the other. We characterize the class of trees\nthat enjoy this condition by using properties of minimum path covers of trees.\nIn addition, we investigate both variations of uniqueness for several concepts\nof Grundy domination, which first appeared in the context of domination games,\nyet they are also closely related to zero forcing. For each of the four\nvariations of Grundy domination we characterize the graphs that have only one\nGrundy dominating set of the given type, and characterize those forests that\nenjoy the weaker (isomorphism based) condition of uniqueness. The latter\ncharacterizations lead to efficient algorithms for recognizing the\ncorresponding classes of forests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 11:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

Spin transport properties such as spin\npolarization and spin diffusion length in this material were precisely\nextracted in order to estimate the spin Hall angle $\\theta_{\\textrm{SH}}$,\nwhich was found to be $-0.19\\pm0.04$ and is among the highest reported for a\nferromagnet. Although this value is on the same order of magnitude of known\nheavy metals, the significantly higher resistivity of Co$_2$MnGa implies an\nimprovement on the magnitude of detection voltages, while its ferromagnetic\nnature allows controlling the intensity of SHE through the magnetization\ndirection.

Hence, there are certain affinity features between facial\nexpressions, receiving little attention in the FER literature. Convolution\npadding, despite helping capture the edge information, causes erosion of the\nfeature map simultaneously. After multi-layer filling convolution, the output\nfeature map named albino feature definitely weakens the representation of the\nexpression. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named\nAmending Representation Module (ARM). ARM is a substitute for the pooling\nlayer. Theoretically, it can be embedded in the back end of any network to deal\nwith the Padding Erosion. ARM efficiently enhances facial expression\nrepresentation from two different directions: 1) reducing the weight of eroded\nfeatures to offset the side effect of padding, and 2) decomposing facial\nfeatures to simplify representation learning. Experiments on public benchmarks\nprove that our ARM boosts the performance of FER remarkably. The validation\naccuracies are respectively 90.42% on RAF-DB, 65.2% on Affect-Net, and 58.71%\non SFEW, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods.

The core feature of OTFS is that the time-variant channel is\nconverted into a non-fading 2D channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain so that\nall symbols experience the same channel gain. In now available literature, the\nchannel is assumed to be quasi-static over an OTFS frame. As for more practical\nchannels, the input-output relation will be time-variant as the environment or\nmedium changes. In this paper, we analyze the characterizations of OTFS\nmodulation over a more general multipath channel, where the signal of each path\nhas experienced a unique rapid fading. First, we derive the explicit\ninput-output relationship of OTFS in the DD domain for the case of ideal pulse\nand rectangular pulse. It is shown that the rapid fading will produce extra\nDoppler dispersion without impacting on delay domain. We next demonstrate that\nOTFS can be interpreted as an efficient time diversity technology that combines\nspace-time encoding and interleaving.

Kochmann et al. [2019] defined the reduced set of frequencies\nby using a fixed sampling pattern, which is most general but leads to poor\nmicrostructural results when considering only a few frequencies.

Based on the idea, that the micromechanical material\nresponse strongly depends on the phase-wise material behavior, we propose the\nusage of sampling patterns adapted to the spatial arrangement of the individual\nphases. This leads to significantly improved microscopic and overall results.\nHence, the time-consuming reconstruction in the post-processing step that was\nnecessary in the earlier work is no longer required.

This\ndataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart\nfrom pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer.

With the impressive development of deep-learning\ntechnologies, imitation learning-based path planning approaches have achieved\neffective results in recent years. However, the disadvantages of these\napproaches are twofold: 1) they may need extensive time and labor to record\nexpert demonstrations as training data; and 2) existing approaches could only\nreceive high-level commands, such as turning left/right. These commands could\nbe less sufficient for the navigation of mobile robots (e.g., robotic\nwheelchairs), which usually require exact poses of goals. We contribute a\nsolution to this problem by proposing S2P2, a self-supervised goal-directed\npath planning approach. Specifically, we develop a pipeline to automatically\ngenerate planned path labels given as input RGB-D images and poses of goals.\nThen, we present a best-fit regression plane loss to train our data-driven path\nplanning model based on the generated labels. Our S2P2 does not need pre-built\nmaps, but it can be integrated into existing map-based navigation systems\nthrough our framework. Experimental results show that our S2P2 outperforms\ntraditional path planning algorithms, and increases the robustness of existing\nmap-based navigation systems.

Recent papers have ported these methods from still images\nto videos and found that leveraging both audio and video signals yields strong\ngains; however, they did not find that spatial augmentations such as cropping,\nwhich are very important for still images, work as well for videos. In this\npaper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal\naspect of videos. First, for space, we show that spatial augmentations such as\ncropping do work well for videos too, but that previous implementations, due to\nthe high processing and memory cost, could not do this at a scale sufficient\nfor it to work well. To address this issue, we first introduce Feature Crop, a\nmethod to simulate such augmentations much more efficiently directly in feature\nspace. Second, we show that as opposed to naive average pooling, the use of\ntransformer-based attention improves performance significantly, and is well\nsuited for processing feature crops. Combining both of our discoveries into a\nnew method, Space-Time Crop & Attend (STiCA) we achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple video-representation learning benchmarks.

Methods for inducing effective\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ in such materials have recently opened new opportunities.

We confirm the phenomenon by two-photon imaging of\nthe inscribed $\\chi^{(2)}$ grating structures within the microresonators as\nwell as by dynamic tracking of both the pump and second-harmonic mode\nresonances. These results unambiguously establish that the photogalvanic\neffect, responsible for all-optical poling, can overcome phase mismatch\nconstraints even in resonant systems, and simultaneously allow for the combined\nrecord of output power and tunability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 12:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

We first show that the Larmor precession timescale is some three\norders of magnitude longer than the damping time for millimeter-sized grains\nunder conditions typical of PPDs, making the magnetic alignment unlikely. The\nprecession time can be shortened by superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs), but\nthe reduction factor strongly depends on the size of the SPI clusters, which we\nfind is limited by the so-called \"N\\'{e}el's relaxation process.\" In\nparticular, the size limit of SPIs is set by the so-called \"anisotropic energy\nconstant\" of the SPI material, which describes the energy barrier needed to\nchange the direction of the magnetic moment of an SPI. For the most common\niron-bearing materials, we find maximum SPI sizes corresponding to a reduction\nfactor of the Larmor precession timescale of order $10^3$. We also find that\nreaching this maximum reduction factor requires fine-tuning on the SPI sizes.\nLastly, we illustrate the effects of the SPI size limits on magnetic alignment\nof dust grains with a simple disk model, and we conclude that it is unlikely\nfor relatively large grains of order 100 $\\mu$m or more to be aligned with\nmagnetic fields even with SPIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 13:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Two mechanisms for quenching are possible: halo\nmass quenching of central galaxies and environmental quenching of satellite\ngalaxies. This thesis describes the satellite galaxies (SG) quenching process\nand its primary causes. The analysis contains a study of a large sample of 118\nSGs within the Vela cosmological simulation, identified by a specific SG merger\ntree algorithm.\n  We find that the quenching evolves through a typical path in the diagram of\nspecific star formation (sSFR) vs. inner stellar surface density\n($\\Sigma_{\\star, 0.5\\textrm kpc}$), with the inner surface density defined as\nthe density within 0.5kpc from the center of mass of the SG. Three discrete\nphases characterize this path: 1. Halt in gas accretion with SG compaction at\nhigh sSFR as the SG keeps forming stars 2. Gas removal and rapid drop in the\nsSFR at the peri-center of its orbit within the host halo 3. Stellar heating\nand stripping may lead to coalescing with the halo center, an ultra-diffuse\ngalaxy (UDG), a compact elliptical galaxy (eCg), or a globular cluster (GC).\n  We find that the main drivers of SG evolution are ram pressure stripping at\nthe initial stages and tidal forces at the final stages, aided by starvation,\nsuppression of gas accretion. We show that other processes, such as gas\ndepletion by star formation or stellar feedback are secondary.\n  Moreover, we present an innovative method for constructing merger trees in\nsimulations that solve systemic errors.

The aim of the present paper is to contribute to the better\nknowledge of the WMP and its limitations. Namely, we provide sufficient\nconditions for a pair of Banach spaces to fail the WMP and study the behaviour\nof this property with respect to quotients, subspaces, and direct sums, which\nopen the gate to present several consequences. For instance, we deal with pairs\nof the form $(L_p[0,1], L_q[0,1])$, proving that these pairs fail the WMP\nwhenever $p>2$ or $q<2$. We also show that, under certain conditions on $E$,\nthe assumption that $(E, F)$ has the WMP for every Banach space $F$ implies\nthat $E$ must be finite dimensional. On the other hand, we show that $(E, F)$\nhas the WMP for every reflexive space $E$ if and only if $F$ has the Schur\nproperty.

It is not\nuncommon for errors in these measurements to be present resulting in image\ndefocusing. To overcome this, an \\emph{autofocus} algorithm is employed as a\npost-processing step after image reconstruction to improve image focus. A\nparticular class of these algorithms can be framed as a sharpness/contrast\nmetric-based optimization. To improve convergence, a hand-crafted weighting\nfunction to remove \"bad\" areas of the image is sometimes applied to the\nimage-under-test before the optimization procedure. Additionally, dozens of\niterations are necessary for convergence which is a large compute burden for\nlow size, weight, and power (SWaP) systems. We propose a deep learning\ntechnique to overcome these limitations and implicitly learn the weighting\nfunction in a data-driven manner. Our proposed method, which we call Deep\nAutofocus, uses features from the single-look-complex (SLC) to estimate the\nphase correction which is applied in $k$-space. Furthermore, we train our\nalgorithm on batches of training imagery so that during deployment, only a\nsingle iteration of our method is sufficient to autofocus. We show results\ndemonstrating the robustness of our technique by comparing our results to four\ncommonly used image sharpness metrics.

Based on minorization-maximization, we propose a unified\noptimization framework to tackle the constrained waveform design problem.\nNumerical examples show the superiority of the waveforms synthesized by the\nproposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 15:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

This is a typical scenario when optimizing variable\nsettings that are very costly to evaluate, for example in the context of\nsimulation-based optimization or machine learning hyperparameterization. We\npropose an original method that uses established approaches to propose a set of\npoints for each batch and then down-selects from these candidate points to the\nnumber of trials that can be run in parallel. The key novelty of our approach\nlies in the introduction of a hyperparameterized method for down-selecting the\nnumber of candidates to the allowed batch-size, which is optimized offline\nusing automated algorithm configuration. We tune this method for black box\noptimization and then evaluate on classical black box optimization benchmarks.\nOur results show that it is possible to learn how to combine evaluation points\nsuggested by highly diverse black box optimization methods conditioned on the\nprogress of the optimization.

Recently, it has been applied in the context of non-invasive\ninspections of buildings in military and civilian services. Nowadays, any SAR\nimaging software is based on the Born approximation, which is a linearization\nof the original wave-like partial differential equation. One of the essential\nassumptions this linearization procedure needs is that only those dielectric\nconstants are imaged whose values are close to the constant background. In this\nwork, we propose a radically new idea: to work without any linearization while\nstill using the same data as the conventional SAR imaging technique uses.

The reason for the\ncontinued use of BM3D within the literature is due to its off-the-shelf\nease-of-use in any application, which alternative improved denoising algorithms\nsometimes fail to match. This article proposes a new variation of BM3D, which\nmaintains its ease of use but is notably faster.

Prior\nworks on randomized smoothing against L_1 adversarial attacks use additive\nsmoothing noise and provide probabilistic robustness guarantees. In this work,\nwe propose a non-additive and deterministic smoothing method, Deterministic\nSmoothing with Splitting Noise (DSSN). To develop DSSN, we first develop SSN, a\nrandomized method which involves generating each noisy smoothing sample by\nfirst randomly splitting the input space and then returning a representation of\nthe center of the subdivision occupied by the input sample. In contrast to\nuniform additive smoothing, the SSN certification does not require the random\nnoise components used to be independent. Thus, smoothing can be done\neffectively in just one dimension and can therefore be efficiently derandomized\nfor quantized data (e.g., images). To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to provide deterministic \"randomized smoothing\" for a norm-based\nadversarial threat model while allowing for an arbitrary classifier (i.e., a\ndeep model) to be used as a base classifier and without requiring an\nexponential number of smoothing samples. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we\nprovide substantially larger L_1 robustness certificates compared to prior\nworks, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

This includes a data analysis pipeline, containing e.g.\nvarious approaches for data preparation, feature engineering, clustering, and\nclassification where several steps can be realized classically, but also\nsupported by quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 16:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

We investigate this premise\nby including a canonical SU(2) Yang- Mills field to the total energy budget of\nthe universe coupled to the standard quintessential field by a disformal\ntransformation. From the dynamical system analysis, we study three cases of\ncosmological interest that span most of the physical phase space of the model:\nthe uncoupled limit, the isotropic, and the Abelian cases. New scaling\nsolutions with a non-vanishing gauge field are found in all cases which can be\ninteresting for early cosmological scenarios. Some of these scaling solutions\neven exhibit anisotropic features. Also, the background evolution of the\nuniverse is studied by means of numerical analysis. As an interesting result,\nthe disformal coupling changes the equation of state of the gauge field from\nradiation to matter at some stages of the evolution of the universe, thereby\nthe gauge field can contribute to some fraction of the total dark matter. We\nhave also quantified the redshift-dependent contribution of the gauge field in\nthe form of dark radiation during the radiation era to the effective number of\nrelativistic species. This depends essentially on the initial conditions and,\nmore importantly, on the disformal coupling function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 12:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 23:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 02:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 17:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

We find a general mechanism for the distribution. The distribution of\na geometrically growing system can be approximated by a log - completely\nsquared chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom (log-CS$\\chi_1$), which\nreaches asymptotically a power-law distribution, or by a log-normal\ndistribution, which has an infinite asymptotic slope, at the upper limit. For\nthe log-CS$\\chi_1$, the asymptotic exponent of the power-law or the slope in a\nlog-log diagram seems to be related only to the variances of the system\nparameters and their mutual correlation but independent of an initial\ndistribution of the system or any mean value of parameters. We can take the\nlog-CS$\\chi_1$ as a unique approximation when the system should have a singular\ninitial distribution. The mechanism shows a comprehensiveness to be applicable\nto wide practice. We derive a simple formula for the Zipf's exponent, which\nwill probably demand that the exponent should be near -1 rather than exactly\n-1. We show that this approach can explain statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 06:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 06:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 06:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

We use\nprogram obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at\nreverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations\nmodify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be\ncrafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general\nformulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple\nobfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop\nfirst-order optimization algorithms to efficiently determine two key aspects --\nwhich parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We\nshow that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best\nadversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we\nalso propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to\nease optimization. We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the\nproblem of program summarization. We show that our best attack proposal\nachieves a $52\\%$ improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation\napproach for programs trained on a seq2seq model.

Meanwhile, a vision-based\nfall detection system has shown some significant results to detect falls.\nStill, numerous challenges need to be resolved. The impact of deep learning has\nchanged the landscape of the vision-based system, such as action recognition.\nThe deep learning technique has not been successfully implemented in\nvision-based fall detection systems due to the requirement of a large amount of\ncomputation power and the requirement of a large amount of sample training\ndata. This research aims to propose a vision-based fall detection system that\nimproves the accuracy of fall detection in some complex environments such as\nthe change of light condition in the room. Also, this research aims to increase\nthe performance of the pre-processing of video images. The proposed system\nconsists of the Enhanced Dynamic Optical Flow technique that encodes the\ntemporal data of optical flow videos by the method of rank pooling, which\nthereby improves the processing time of fall detection and improves the\nclassification accuracy in dynamic lighting conditions. The experimental\nresults showed that the classification accuracy of the fall detection improved\nby around 3% and the processing time by 40 to 50ms. The proposed system\nconcentrates on decreasing the processing time of fall detection and improving\nclassification accuracy. Meanwhile, it provides a mechanism for summarizing a\nvideo into a single image by using a dynamic optical flow technique, which\nhelps to increase the performance of image pre-processing steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 08:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}
