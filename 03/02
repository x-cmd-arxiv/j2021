Some tools not normally used in the conventional\nsoftware approaches, like gamification, content analysis and grounded theory\nare also employed. However, Scrum like other software development approach\nfocuses on improvement of software process, software quality, business value,\nperformance, usability and efficiency and at the same time to reduce cost, risk\nand uncertainty.

Many methods attempt to directly\nestimate depth to assist in 3D detection, but show limited performance as a\nresult of depth inaccuracy.

Alternative formulations using a partial differential\nequation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also\nbeen introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful\ndescriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new\nvariation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs).

Accordingly, DDE models allow for a\nnatural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering\nadvantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the\nneed for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed\nindividuals) to incorporate time delays.

In this work, we assess the\nperformance of state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models, namely sGDML,\nSchNet, GAP/SOAP, and BPNN for reproducing such PES, while using limited\namounts of reference data. As a benchmark, we use the cis to trans thermal\nrelaxation in an azobenzene molecule, where at least three different transition\nmechanisms should be considered. Although GAP/SOAP, SchNet, and sGDML models\ncan globally achieve chemical accuracy of 1 kcal mol-1 with fewer than 1000\ntraining points, predictions greatly depend on the ML method used as well as\nthe local region of the PES being sampled. Within a given ML method, large\ndifferences can be found between predictions of close-to-equilibrium and\ntransition regions, as well as for different transition mechanisms. We identify\nkey challenges that the ML models face in learning long-range interactions and\nthe intrinsic limitations of commonly used atom-based descriptors.

It becomes energetically preferable with respect\nto an ordinary dislocation due to the high Coulomb energy at low concentration\nof carriers. Generation of these objects should form a sequence of pi-phase\nslips in accordance with experimental doubling of phase-slips rate.

GameStop stock increased around\n10 fold from its decade-long average to its peak at \\$485. In this paper, we\nhypothesize a buy-and-hold strategy can be outperformed in the presence of\nextreme volatility by predicting and trading consolidation breakouts. We\ninvestigate GME stock for its volatility and compare it to SPY as a benchmark\n(since it is a less volatile ETF fund) from February 2002 to February 2021. For\nstrategy 1, we develop a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to\npredict stock prices recurrently with a very short look ahead period in the\npresence of extreme volatility. For our strategy 2, we develop an LSTM\nautoencoder network specifically designed to trade only on consolidation\nbreakouts after predicting anomalies in the stock price. When back-tested in\nour simulations, our strategy 1 executes 863 trades for SPY and 452 trades for\nGME. Our strategy 2 executes 931 trades for SPY and 325 trades for GME. We\ncompare both strategies to buying and holding one single share for the period\nthat we picked as a benchmark.

In practice, however,\nrecursive updating often leads to poor trade-off solutions across tasks because\napproximate inference is necessary for most models of interest.

We offer a practical deep\nlearning implementation of our framework based on probabilistic\ntask-conditioned hypernetworks, an approach we term posterior meta-replay.\nExperiments on standard benchmarks show that our probabilistic hypernetworks\ncompress sequences of posterior parameter distributions with virtually no\nforgetting.

Most existing research focuses on\nactivities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code\nbrought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the\nevolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams\nrely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon.\nMoreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused, and what\nfactors affect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon\nprojects from DEVPOST -- a hackathon database -- and obtained related code\n(blobs), authors, and project characteristics from the World of Code. We\ninvestigated if code blobs in hackathon projects were created before, during,\nor after an event by identifying the original blob creation date and author,\nand also checked if the original author was a hackathon project member. We\ntracked code reuse by first identifying all commits containing blobs created\nduring an event before determining all projects that contain those commits.\nResult: While only approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during\nhackathons, this amount is still significant considering the time and member\nconstraints of such events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get\nreused in other projects. The number of associated technologies and the number\nof participants in a project increase reuse probability. Conclusion: Our study\ndemonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and new code is created\nduring a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere afterwards. Our\nfindings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon and the role of\nhackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point for further\nstudies in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 17:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 11:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

For example, constructing relations\nbetween adjacent geometries is often much more difficult than necessary --\nspacing a resonator structure a few micrometers from a readout structure often\nrequires manually-coding the placement arithmetic. While inconveniences like\nthis can be overcome by writing custom functions, they are often significant\nbarriers to entry for new users or those less familiar with programming. To\nhelp streamline the design process and reduce barrier to entry for scripting\ndesigns, we have developed PHIDL, an open-source GDSII-based CAD tool for\nPython 2 and 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 17:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The core of DA-MD is the minimization of a distance between an\nobservation and a prediction in distributional terms, with prior and posterior\ndistributions constrained on a statistical manifold defined by the MD. We\nleverage the information-geometric properties of the statistical manifold to\nreduce predictive uncertainty via data assimilation.

For 1,2,6-hexanetriol, the time-scale indices are\ntemperature-independent, while a decoupling of time scales is observed for\nsqualane in accordance with literature. An alternative evaluation approach is\nmade on the squalane data, extracting time scales from the terminal relaxation\nmode instead of the peak position, and in this case temperature-independent\ncoupling is also found for squalane, despite its strong secondary relaxation\ncontribution. Interestingly, the very same ordering of\nresponse-function-specific time scales is observed for these two liquids, which\nis also consistent with the observation made for simple van der Waals bonded\nliquids reported previously [Jakobsen \\textit{et al.}, J.

While\nsimulations provide insight into the performance of neural network controllers,\nthey are not enough to guarantee that the controller will perform safely in all\nscenarios. To address this problem, recent work has focused on formal methods\nto verify properties of neural network outputs.

It iteratively propagates information from a set of\nlatent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the\nrefinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of\ncompositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic\ntransformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows\nflexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of\nthe successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model's strength and\nrobustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from\nsimulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor\nscenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality\nand diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency.

Therefore, it is desirable to\ndesign parallel in-place algorithms that use sublinear (or even\npolylogarithmic) auxiliary space.\n  In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practice for parallel\nin-place (PIP) algorithms. We first define two computational models based on\nfork-join parallelism, which reflect modern parallel programming environments.\nWe then introduce a variety of new parallel in-place algorithms that are simple\nand efficient, both in theory and in practice. Our algorithmic highlight is the\nDecomposable Property introduced in this paper, which enables existing\nnon-in-place but highly-optimized parallel algorithms to be converted into\nparallel in-place algorithms.

At a fixed injected energy, the amount of\ntransferred energy is bigger - and the size of the DM core is larger - the\nfaster the energy injection occurs and the more compact the dwarf galaxy is.\nAnalyzing the orbital evolution of kinematic tracers, we demonstrate that a\ncore forms through SN feedback only if the energy injection is impulsive\nrelative to the dynamical timescale of particles in the inner halo. However,\nthere is no fundamental link between the total amount of injected energy and\nthe injection rate. Consequently, the presence of signatures of impulsive\nchanges of the gravitational potential is not a sufficient condition for\ndwarf-size halos to have cored density profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 15:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

We introduce an auxiliary 'AB$^*$' tiling obtained from the AB tiling by\ndeleting all 8-fold coordinated vertices. The AB$^*$ tiling is again\ntwo-dimensional, infinite, and quasiperiodic. The AB$^*$ tiling has a single\nconnected component, which admits perfect matchings. We find that in all\nperfect matchings, dimers on the AB$^*$ tiling lie along disjoint\none-dimensional loops and ladders, separated by 'membranes', sets of edges\nwhere dimers are absent. As a result, the dimer partition function of the\nAB$^*$ tiling factorizes into the product of dimer partition functions along\nthese structures. We compute the partition function and free energy per edge on\nthe AB$^*$ tiling using an analytic transfer matrix approach. Returning to the\nAB tiling, we find that membranes in the AB$^*$ tiling become\n'pseudomembranes', sets of edges which collectively host at most one dimer.\nThis leads to a remarkable discrete scale-invariance in the matching problem.\nThe structure suggests that the AB tiling should exhibit highly inhomogenous\nand slowly decaying connected dimer correlations. Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we find evidence supporting this supposition in the form of\nconnected dimer correlations consistent with power law behaviour. Within the\nset of perfect matchings we find quasiperiodic analogues to the staggered and\ncolumnar phases observed in periodic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 06:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

However, despite the availability of\nseveral candidate materials, such a current has not been observed in\nexperiments. In this article, we suggest an alternative probe in the form of\nimpurity-induced chiral currents. We first demonstrate that a single\nnon-magnetic impurity induces an encircling chiral current. Its direction\ndepends on the chirality of the order parameter and the sign of the impurity\npotential. Building on this observation, we consider the case of multiple\nimpurities, e.g., realized as adatoms deposited on the surface of a candidate\nchiral superconductor. We contrast the response that is obtained in two cases:\n(a) when the impurities are all identical in sign and (b) when the impurities\nhave mixed positive and negative signs. The former leads to coherent currents\nwithin the sample, arising from the fusion of individual current loops. The\nlatter produces loops of random chirality that lead to incoherent local\ncurrents. These two scenarios can be distinguished by measuring the induced\nmagnetic field using recent probes such as diamond NV centres. We argue that\nimpurity-induced currents may be easier to observe than edge currents, as they\ncan be tuned by varying impurity strength and concentration.

Even powerful state-of-the-art deep neural networks\ncould hardly recover traceless shadow-removed background. This paper proposes a\nnew solution for this task by formulating it as an exposure fusion problem to\naddress the challenges. Intuitively, we can first estimate multiple\nover-exposure images w.r.t. the input image to let the shadow regions in these\nimages have the same color with shadow-free areas in the input image. Then, we\nfuse the original input with the over-exposure images to generate the final\nshadow-free counterpart. Nevertheless, the spatial-variant property of the\nshadow requires the fusion to be sufficiently `smart', that is, it should\nautomatically select proper over-exposure pixels from different images to make\nthe final output natural. To address this challenge, we propose the\nshadow-aware FusionNet that takes the shadow image as input to generate fusion\nweight maps across all the over-exposure images. Moreover, we propose the\nboundary-aware RefineNet to eliminate the remaining shadow trace further.

This necessitates\nsampling rates exceeding the Nyquist rate and the use of a large number of\nantenna elements to ensure sufficient image quality. Recently we proposed\nmethods to reduce the sampling rate and the array size relying on image\nrecovery using iterative algorithms, based on compressed sensing (CS) and the\nfinite rate of innovation (FRI) frameworks. Iterative algorithms typically\nrequire a large number of iterations, making them difficult to use in\nreal-time. Here, we propose a reconstruction method from sub-Nyquist samples in\nthe time and spatial domain, that is based on unfolding the ISTA algorithm,\nresulting in an efficient and interpretable deep network. The inputs to our\nnetwork are the subsampled beamformed signals after summation and delay in the\nfrequency domain, requiring only a subset of the US signal to be stored for\nrecovery. Our method allows reducing the number of array elements, sampling\nrate, and computational time while ensuring high quality imaging performance.\nUsing \\emph{in vivo} data we demonstrate that the proposed method yields\nhigh-quality images while reducing the data volume traditionally used up to 36\ntimes. In terms of image resolution and contrast, our technique outperforms\npreviously suggested methods as well as DAS and minimum-variance (MV)\nbeamforming, paving the way to real-time applicable recovery methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 19:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

The\ndominant non-radiative loss is intrinsic to the active layer and can be\ndetermined from the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and the radiative\nthermodynamic limit of the photovoltage. Quantification of the QFLS in thin\nfilm devices with low mobility is challenging due to the excitonic nature of\nphotoexcitation and additional sources of nonradiative loss associated with the\ndevice structure. This work outlines an experimental approach based on\nelectro-modulated photoluminescence, which can be used to directly measure the\nintrinsic non-radiative loss to the open-circuit voltage; thereby, quantifying\nthe QFLS. Drift-diffusion simulations are carried out to show that this method\naccurately predicts the QFLS in the bulk of the device regardless of\ndevice-related non-radiative losses. State-of-the-art PM6:Y6-based organic\nsolar cells are used as a model to test the experimental approach, and the QFLS\nis quantified and shown to be independent of device architecture. This work\nprovides a method to quantify the QFLS of organic solar cells under operational\nconditions, fully characterizing the different contributions to the\nnon-radiative losses of the open-circuit voltage. The reported method will be\nuseful in not only characterizing and understanding losses in organic solar\ncells, but also other device platforms such as light-emitting diodes and\nphotodetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 19:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

This paper introduces an\nSDN-based self-configuration framework for the fully automated configuration of\nTSN networks. Unlike standard TSN configuration, we remove end-host-related\ndependencies and put flows initially on default paths to extract traffic\ncharacteristics by monitoring network traffic at edge switches. Communicated to\na central SDN controller, these characteristics allow to move the flows to\noptimal paths while maintaining hard real-time guarantees, for which we also\nformulate an optimization problem. Our simulation results indicate that the\nproposed self-configuration approach works properly for different network sizes\nand numbers of end-hosts. Even though it slightly increases the average latency\nof critical frames, it still provides a certain level of real-time guarantee\nwithout any prior knowledge of flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 19:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

While priority scheduling can be used\nto reduce tail latency for some traffic, this comes at a cost of much worse\ndelay behavior for all other traffic on the network. Most operators choose to\nrun their networks at very low average utilization, despite the added cost, and\nyet still suffer poor tail behavior.\n  This paper takes a different approach.

In recent years,\nmutation testing has been extended to machine learning (ML) systems, and deep\nlearning (DL) in particular; researchers have proposed approaches, tools, and\nstatistically sound heuristics to determine whether mutants in DL systems are\nkilled or not. However, as we will argue in this work, questions can be raised\nto what extent currently used mutation testing techniques in DL are actually in\nline with the classical interpretation of mutation testing. We observe that ML\nmodel development resembles a test-driven development (TDD) process, in which a\ntraining algorithm (`programmer') generates a model (program) that fits the\ndata points (test data) to labels (implicit assertions), up to a certain\nthreshold. However, considering proposed mutation testing techniques for ML\nsystems under this TDD metaphor, in current approaches, the distinction between\nproduction and test code is blurry, and the realism of mutation operators can\nbe challenged. We also consider the fundamental hypotheses underlying classical\nmutation testing: the competent programmer hypothesis and coupling effect\nhypothesis. As we will illustrate, these hypotheses do not trivially translate\nto ML system development, and more conscious and explicit scoping and concept\nmapping will be needed to truly draw parallels. Based on our observations, we\npropose several action points for better alignment of mutation testing\ntechniques for ML with paradigms and vocabularies of classical mutation\ntesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 22:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

There are\nvarious versions of zk-SNARK, among them, Quadratic Arithmetic Program\n(QAP)-based zk-SNARK has been widely used in practice, specially in Blockchain\ntechnology. This is attributed to two desirable features; its fixed-size proof\nand the very light computation load of the verifier. However, the computation\nload of the prover in QAP-based zkSNARKs, is very heavy, even-though it is\ndesigned to be very efficient. This load can be beyond the prover's computation\npower to handle, and has to be offloaded to some external servers. In the\nexisting offloading solutions, either (i) the load of computation, offloaded to\neach sever, is a fraction of the prover's primary computation (e.g., DZIK),\nhowever the servers need to be trusted, (ii) the servers are not required to be\ntrusted, but the computation complexity imposed to each one is the same as the\nprover's primary computation (e.g., Trinocchio).

Bayesian\nlearning provides a principled approach to address all these limitations, at\nthe cost of an increase in computational complexity. This paper studies\ndistributed Bayesian learning in a wireless data center setting encompassing a\ncentral server and multiple distributed workers. Prior work on wireless\ndistributed learning has focused exclusively on frequentist learning, and has\nintroduced the idea of leveraging uncoded transmission to enable \"over-the-air\"\ncomputing. Unlike frequentist learning, Bayesian learning aims at evaluating\napproximations or samples from a global posterior distribution in the model\nparameter space. This work investigates for the first time the design of\ndistributed one-shot, or \"embarrassingly parallel\", Bayesian learning protocols\nin wireless data centers via consensus Monte Carlo (CMC). Uncoded transmission\nis introduced not only as a way to implement \"over-the-air\" computing, but also\nas a mechanism to deploy channel-driven MC sampling: Rather than treating\nchannel noise as a nuisance to be mitigated, channel-driven sampling utilizes\nchannel noise as an integral part of the MC sampling process. A simple wireless\nCMC scheme is first proposed that is asymptotically optimal under Gaussian\nlocal posteriors. Then, for arbitrary local posteriors, a variational\noptimization strategy is introduced. Simulation results demonstrate that, if\nproperly accounted for, channel noise can indeed contribute to MC sampling and\ndoes not necessarily decrease the accuracy level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 23:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 20:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 08:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In addition to the nonlinear Zeeman splitting, the\ndifference between Zeeman resonances in the two hyperfine ground states can\nalso generate heading errors depending on initial spin polarization. We examine\nheading errors in an all-optical scalar magnetometer that uses free precession\nof polarized $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ atoms by varying the direction and magnitude of\nthe magnetic field at different spin polarization regimes. In the high\npolarization limit where the lower hyperfine ground state $F = 1$ is almost\ndepopulated, we show that heading errors can be corrected with an analytical\nexpression, reducing the errors by two orders of magnitude in Earth's field. We\nalso verify the linearity of the measured Zeeman precession frequency with the\nmagnetic field. With lower spin polarization, we find that the splitting of the\nZeeman resonances for the two hyperfine states causes beating in the precession\nsignals and nonlinearity of the measured precession frequency with the magnetic\nfield. We correct for the frequency shifts by using the unique probe geometry\nwhere two orthogonal probe beams measure opposite relative phases between the\ntwo hyperfine states during the spin precession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 23:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

AO's cornerstone research\ninstrument was the 305-m William E. Gordon telescope. On December 1, 2020, the\n305-m telescope collapsed and was irreparably damaged. In the three weeks\nfollowing the collapse, AO's scientific and engineering staff and the AO users\ncommunity initiated extensive discussions on the future of the observatory. The\ncommunity is in overwhelming agreement that there is a need to build an\nenhanced, next-generation radar-radio telescope at the AO site.

These requirements can be summarized briefly as: 5 MW of\ncontinuous wave transmitter power at 2 - 6 GHz, 10 MW of peak transmitter power\nat 430 MHz (also at 220MHz under consideration), zenith angle coverage 0 to 48\ndeg, frequency coverage 0.2 to 30 GHz and increased Field-of-View.

The NPP appears in many applications,\nincluding the design of randomized controlled trials, multiprocessor\nscheduling, and cryptography; and is also of theoretical significance. It\npossesses a so-called statistical-to-computational gap: when its input $X$ has\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$, its optimal value is\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}2^{-n})$ w.h.p.; whereas the best polynomial-time algorithm\nachieves an objective value of only $2^{-\\Theta(\\log^2 n)}$, w.h.p.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of the nature of this gap. Inspired by\ninsights from statistical physics, we study the landscape of NPP and establish\nthe presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), an intricate geometric property\nwhich is known to be a rigorous evidence of an algorithmic hardness for large\nclasses of algorithms. By leveraging the OGP, we establish that (a) any\nsufficiently stable algorithm, appropriately defined, fails to find a\nnear-optimal solution with energy below $2^{-\\omega(n \\log^{-1/5} n)}$; and (b)\na very natural MCMC dynamics fails to find near-optimal solutions.

When $m$ is constant we prove the presence of OGP in\nthe regime $2^{-\\Theta(n)}$, and the absence of it in the regime $2^{-o(n)}$.\nInterestingly, though, by considering overlaps with growing values of $m$ we\nprove the presence of the OGP up to the level $2^{-\\omega(\\sqrt{n\\log n})}$.\nOur proof of the failure of stable algorithms at values $2^{-\\omega(n\n\\log^{-1/5} n)}$ employs methods from Ramsey Theory from the extremal\ncombinatorics, and is of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 00:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Unfortunately, training a\nmodel on simulation data and then applying it to instrument data leads to a\nsubstantial and potentially even detrimental decrease in model accuracy on the\nnew target dataset. Simulated and instrument data represent different data\ndomains, and for an algorithm to work in both, domain-invariant learning is\nnecessary. Here we employ domain adaptation techniques$-$ Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD) as an additional transfer loss and Domain Adversarial Neural\nNetworks (DANNs)$-$ and demonstrate their viability to extract domain-invariant\nfeatures within the astronomical context of classifying merging and non-merging\ngalaxies. Additionally, we explore the use of Fisher loss and entropy\nminimization to enforce better in-domain class discriminability. We show that\nthe addition of each domain adaptation technique improves the performance of a\nclassifier when compared to conventional deep learning algorithms. We\ndemonstrate this on two examples: between two Illustris-1 simulated datasets of\ndistant merging galaxies, and between Illustris-1 simulated data of nearby\nmerging galaxies and observed data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The use\nof domain adaptation techniques in our experiments leads to an increase of\ntarget domain classification accuracy of up to ${\\sim}20\\%$.

To address this, data compression algorithms can be applied to data\narrays containing flow quantities of interest to reduce the overall amount of\nstorage. Compression methods either exactly reconstruct the original dataset\n(lossless compression) or provide an approximate representation of the original\ndataset (lossy compression). The matrix column interpolative decomposition (ID)\ncan be implemented as a type of lossy compression for data matrices that\nfactors the original data matrix into a product of two smaller factor matrices.\nOne of these matrices consists of a subset of the columns of the original data\nmatrix, while the other is a coefficient matrix which approximates the columns\nof the original data matrix as linear combinations of the selected columns.\nMotivating this work is the observation that the structure of ID algorithms\nmakes them a natural fit for the asynchronous nature of task-based parallelism;\nthey are able to operate independently on sub-domains of the system of interest\nand, as a result, provide varied levels of compression. Using the task-based\nLegion programming model, a single-pass ID algorithm (SPID) for CFD\napplications is implemented.

The primary challenge facing private inference is\nthat computing on encrypted data levies an impractically-high latency penalty,\nstemming mostly from non-linear operators like ReLU. Enabling practical and\nprivate inference requires new optimization methods that minimize network ReLU\ncounts while preserving accuracy. This paper proposes DeepReDuce: a set of\noptimizations for the judicious removal of ReLUs to reduce private inference\nlatency. The key insight is that not all ReLUs contribute equally to accuracy.\nWe leverage this insight to drop, or remove, ReLUs from classic networks to\nsignificantly reduce inference latency and maintain high accuracy.

However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial\nattacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for\nmodels, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we\nanalyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the\noptimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail.

We then formulate an Asynchronous Learning-aware transmission\nScheduling (ALS) problem to maximize the effectivity score and develop three\nALS algorithms, called ALSA-PI, BALSA, and BALSA-PO, to solve it.

In our study we use the prior distributions of the\nparameters for satellite density profiles in order to determine the J-factor,\nmaking most out of the recent developments in the N-body simulations and\nsemi-analytical modeling for the structure formation. As concrete models, we\nanalyze fermionic dark matter that annihilates via a light scalar and Wino dark\nmatter in supersymmetric models. We find that, with the more realistic prior\ndistributions that we adopt in this study, the J-factor of the most promising\ndSphs is decreased by a factor of a few, compared with earlier estimates based\non non-informative priors.

Five different phases exist. Three of them are spin polarized\nphases; an FM phase and two kinds of ferrimagnetic (FR) phases (referred to as\nFR1 and FR2 phases). The spontaneous magnetization per site is $m=1/2$, $1/3$,\nand $1/6$ in the FM, FR1, and FR2 phases, respectively. This can be understood\nfrom the fact that an effective spin-1 Heisenberg chain formed by the upper and\nlower leg spins has a three-step fractional quantization of the magnetization\nper site as $m=1$, $1/2$, and $0$. In particular, an anomalous \"intermediate\"\nstate $m=1/2$ of the effective spin-1 chain with the reduced Hilbert space of a\nspin from $3$ to $2$ dimensional is highly unexpected in the context of\nconventional spin-1 physics. Thus, surprisingly, the effective spin-1 chain\nbehaves like a spin-1/2 chain with SU(2) symmetry.

Audio-visual speech\nseparation is a technique to estimate the individual speech signals from a\nmixture using the visual signals of the speakers. Conventional studies on\naudio-visual speech separation mainly train the separation model on the\naudio-only loss, which reflects the distance between the source signals and the\nseparated signals. However, conventional losses do not reflect the\ncharacteristics of the speech signals, including the speaker's characteristics\nand phonetic information, which leads to distortion or remaining noise. To\naddress this problem, we propose the cross-modal correspondence (CMC) loss,\nwhich is based on the cooccurrence of the speech signal and the visual signal.\nSince the visual signal is not affected by background noise and contains\nspeaker and phonetic information, using the CMC loss enables the audio-visual\nspeech separation model to remove noise while preserving the speech\ncharacteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nlearns the cooccurrence on the basis of CMC loss, which improves separation\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 04:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Computer codes realizing semi-classical and\nquantum molecular dynamics (QMD) approaches are often employed to make up for\nthe lack of accelerator data on many nuclear reactions at intermediate and high\nenergies (>10s of MeV/n) and are in high demand. This contribution focuses on\nthe methodology of generating reliable proton-induced cross sections in the\nenergy range below 1 GeV. We developed a problem-oriented computer framework\nbased on MCNPX and CASCADE/INPE codes to calculate activation cross section\ndata at intermediate and high energies. Goodness of the fits of nucleon-nucleus\ninteraction models to the existing data is evaluated based on elaborated\nalgorithms. The method is based on the analysis of a large set of data and\ncalculated cross sections for different targets and residual nuclei in a wide\nrange of proton energies using numerous criteria. In practice, this could be\ndone by tuning the model parameters and algorithms to fit required experimental\ndata subset, or through achieving unification and consistency of fundamental\nparameters for all considered reactions. The presented framework is pursuing\nthe latter approach.

Most existing works of dictionary learning are\nin an offline manner. There are mainly two offline ways for dictionary\nlearning. One is to do an alternative optimization of both the dictionary and\nthe sparse code; the other way is to optimize the dictionary by restricting it\nover the orthogonal group. The latter one is called orthogonal dictionary\nlearning which has a lower complexity implementation, hence, it is more\nfavorable for lowcost devices. However, existing schemes on orthogonal\ndictionary learning only work with batch data and can not be implemented\nonline, which is not applicable for real-time applications. This paper proposes\na novel online orthogonal dictionary scheme to dynamically learn the dictionary\nfrom streaming data without storing the historical data. The proposed scheme\nincludes a novel problem formulation and an efficient online algorithm design\nwith convergence analysis. In the problem formulation, we relax the orthogonal\nconstraint to enable an efficient online algorithm. In the algorithm design, we\npropose a new Frank-Wolfe-based online algorithm with a convergence rate of\nO(ln t/t^(1/4)). The convergence rate in terms of key system parameters is also\nderived.

The foundation of GNNs is the message passing\nprocedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since\nthis procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information\npropagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the\nhigher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global\nstructural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN\nmodels suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local\ninformation, which would be essential for good model performance, through many\nmessage passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling\n(MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and\nglobal structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for\neach message passing step and computes the final graph representation by\nunifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows\nmodels to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of\nlocalities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due\nto oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture\nimproves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline\narchitectures.

A core challenge in designing such\nspecialized hardware architectures is how to perform mapping space search,\ni.e., search for an optimal mapping from algorithm to hardware. Prior work\nshows that choosing an inefficient mapping can lead to multiplicative-factor\nefficiency overheads. Additionally, the search space is not only large but also\nnon-convex and non-smooth, precluding advanced search techniques. As a result,\nprevious works are forced to implement mapping space search using expert\nchoices or sub-optimal search heuristics.\n  This work proposes Mind Mappings, a novel gradient-based search method for\nalgorithm-accelerator mapping space search. The key idea is to derive a smooth,\ndifferentiable approximation to the otherwise non-smooth, non-convex search\nspace. With a smooth, differentiable approximation, we can leverage efficient\ngradient-based search algorithms to find high-quality mappings. We extensively\ncompare Mind Mappings to black-box optimization schemes used in prior work.\nWhen tasked to find mappings for two important workloads (CNN and MTTKRP), the\nproposed search finds mappings that achieve an average $1.40\\times$,\n$1.76\\times$, and $1.29\\times$ (when run for a fixed number of steps) and\n$3.16\\times$, $4.19\\times$, and $2.90\\times$ (when run for a fixed amount of\ntime) better energy-delay product (EDP) relative to Simulated Annealing,\nGenetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning, respectively.

Over the past twenty\nyears, considerable effort has been extended to apply photothermal methods to\ndetect, spatially resolve, and perform absorption spectroscopy on single\nnon-emissive molecules and other absorbers like plasmonic nanoparticles at room\ntemperature conditions. Companion theoretical models have been developed to\ninterpret these experimental advances, yet it is not clear how they are related\nto each other nor how the effects of lock-in detection modify the theory. For\nlarger target systems that host their own intrinsic scattering resonances as\nwell as for background media that do not instantaneously thermalize with the\nabsorbing target, additional dependencies arise that are yet to be explored\ntheoretically. The aim of this Perspective is to overview the theory of\nphotothermal spectroscopy and microscopy and present a unifying theoretical\napproach that recovers past models in certain limits while explicitly including\nthe effects of target scattering resonances, thermal and optical retardation,\nand lock-in detection.

Finally, we propose and discuss an early experimental approach for\nthe detection of anomalies, based on a Faster R-CNN, and adopted in the\nproposed infrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 06:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

To this end, we propose\nan active DNN IP protection method based on adversarial examples against DNN\npiracy, named ActiveGuard. ActiveGuard aims to achieve authorization control\nand users' fingerprints management through adversarial examples, and can\nprovide ownership verification.

After learning, the resulting federated model\nshould be further personalized to each different client. While several methods\nhave been proposed to achieve personalization, they are typically limited to a\nsingle local device, which may incur bias or overfitting since data in a single\ndevice is extremely limited. In this paper, we attempt to realize\npersonalization beyond a single client. The motivation is that during FL, there\nmay exist many clients with similar data distribution, and thus the\npersonalization performance could be significantly boosted if these similar\nclients can cooperate with each other. Inspired by this, this paper introduces\na new concept called federated adaptation, targeting at adapting the trained\nmodel in a federated manner to achieve better personalization results. However,\nthe key challenge for federated adaptation is that we could not outsource any\nraw data from the client during adaptation, due to privacy concerns. In this\npaper, we propose PFA, a framework to accomplish Privacy-preserving Federated\nAdaptation. PFA leverages the sparsity property of neural networks to generate\nprivacy-preserving representations and uses them to efficiently identify\nclients with similar data distributions. Based on the grouping results, PFA\nconducts an FL process in a group-wise way on the federated model to accomplish\nthe adaptation. For evaluation, we manually construct several practical FL\ndatasets based on public datasets in order to simulate both the class-imbalance\nand background-difference conditions. Extensive experiments on these datasets\nand popular model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of PFA,\noutperforming other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while ensuring\nuser privacy.

This observation has motivated recent flurry of activity in developing\nheuristic alternatives following the intuitive mechanism of promoting larger\nmargin for minorities. In contrast to previous heuristics, we follow a\nprincipled analysis explaining how different loss adjustments affect margins.\nFirst, we prove that for all linear classifiers trained in TPT, it is necessary\nto introduce multiplicative, rather than additive, logit adjustments so that\nthe interclass margins change appropriately. To show this, we discover a\nconnection of the multiplicative CE modification to the cost-sensitive\nsupport-vector machines. Perhaps counterintuitively, we also find that, at the\nstart of training, the same multiplicative weights can actually harm the\nminority classes. Thus, while additive adjustments are ineffective in the TPT,\nwe show that they can speed up convergence by countering the initial negative\neffect of the multiplicative weights. Motivated by these findings, we formulate\nthe vector-scaling (VS) loss, that captures existing techniques as special\ncases. Moreover, we introduce a natural extension of the VS-loss to\ngroup-sensitive classification, thus treating the two common types of\nimbalances (label/group) in a unifying way. Importantly, our experiments on\nstate-of-the-art datasets are fully consistent with our theoretical insights\nand confirm the superior performance of our algorithms.

Existing methods mainly focus on extracting\ndiscriminative features, and directly compute the cosine or L2 distance by the\npoint-to-point way without considering the context information. In this study,\nwe make a key observation that the local con-text represented by the\nsimilarities between the instance and its inter-class neighbors1plays an\nimportant role forFR. Specifically, we attempt to incorporate the local\nin-formation in the feature space into the metric, and pro-pose a unified\nframework calledInter-class DiscrepancyAlignment(IDA), with two dedicated\nmodules, Discrepancy Alignment Operator(IDA-DAO) andSupport Set\nEstimation(IDA-SSE). IDA-DAO is used to align the similarity scores considering\nthe discrepancy between the images and its neighbors, which is defined by\nadaptive support sets on the hypersphere. For practical inference, it is\ndifficult to acquire support set during online inference. IDA-SSE can provide\nconvincing inter-class neighbors by introducing virtual candidate images\ngenerated with GAN. Further-more, we propose the learnable IDA-SSE, which can\nimplicitly give estimation without the need of any other images in the\nevaluation process. The proposed IDA can be incorporated into existing FR\nsystems seamlessly and efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this\nframe-work can 1) significantly improve the accuracy, and 2) make the model\nrobust to the face images of various distributions.Without bells and whistles,\nour method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple standard FR\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 08:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Such\nobjectivity of their internal representations enables deep CNNs to readily\ntransfer and successfully apply these representations to new classification\ntasks. Deep CNNs develop their internal representations through a challenging\nprocess of error backpropagation-based supervised training. In contrast, deep\nneural networks of the cerebral cortex develop their even more powerful\ninternal representations in an unsupervised process, apparently guided at a\nlocal level by contextual information. Implementing such local contextual\nguidance principles in a single-layer CNN architecture, we propose an efficient\nalgorithm for developing broad-purpose representations (i.e., representations\ntransferable to new tasks without additional training) in shallow CNNs trained\non limited-size datasets. A contextually guided CNN (CG-CNN) is trained on\ngroups of neighboring image patches picked at random image locations in the\ndataset. Such neighboring patches are likely to have a common context and\ntherefore are treated for the purposes of training as belonging to the same\nclass. Across multiple iterations of such training on different context-sharing\ngroups of image patches, CNN features that are optimized in one iteration are\nthen transferred to the next iteration for further optimization, etc. In this\nprocess, CNN features acquire higher pluripotency, or inferential utility for\nany arbitrary classification task, which we quantify as a transfer utility. In\nour application to natural images, we find that CG-CNN features show the same,\nif not higher, transfer utility and classification accuracy as comparable\ntransferable features in the first CNN layer of the well-known deep networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 08:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 21:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

While the minimum number of driver nodes needed for control is\nfixed in a given network, there are multiple choices for the driver node set. A\nquantity used to investigate this multiplicity is the fraction of redundant\nnodes in the network, referring to nodes that do not need any external control.\nPrevious work has discovered a bimodality feature characterized by a\nbifurcation diagram: networks with the same statistical property would stay\nwith equal probability to have a large or small fraction of redundant nodes.\nHere we find that this feature is rooted in the symmetry of the directed\nnetwork, where both the degree distribution and the degree correlation can play\na role. The in-in and out-out degree correlation will suppress the bifurcation,\nas networks with such degree correlations are asymmetric under network\ntranspose. The out-in and in-out degree correlation do not change the network\nsymmetry, hence the bimodality feature is preserved. However, the out-in degree\ncorrelation will change the critical average degree needed for the bifurcation.\nHence by fixing the average degree of networks and tuning out-in degree\ncorrelation alone, we can observe a similar bifurcation diagram.

However, to\nenable a trustworthy FR technology, it is essential to know the influence of an\nextended range of facial attributes on FR beyond demographics. Therefore, in\nthis work, we analyse FR bias over a wide range of attributes. We investigate\nthe influence of 47 attributes on the verification performance of two popular\nFR models. The experiments were performed on the publicly available MAADFace\nattribute database with over 120M high-quality attribute annotations. To\nprevent misleading statements about biased performances, we introduced control\ngroup based validity values to decide if unbalanced test data causes the\nperformance differences. The results demonstrate that also many non-demographic\nattributes strongly affect the recognition performance, such as accessories,\nhair-styles and colors, face shapes, or facial anomalies. The observations of\nthis work show the strong need for further advances in making FR system more\nrobust, explainable, and fair. Moreover, our findings might help to a better\nunderstanding of how FR networks work, to enhance the robustness of these\nnetworks, and to develop more generalized bias-mitigating face recognition\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 09:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Missing values are commonplace in\ndecision support platforms that aggregate data over long time stretches from\ndisparate sources, and reliable data analytics calls for careful handling of\nmissing data. One strategy is imputing the missing values, and a wide variety\nof algorithms exist spanning simple interpolation, matrix factorization methods\nlike SVD, statistical models like Kalman filters, and recent deep learning\nmethods. We show that often these provide worse results on aggregate analytics\ncompared to just excluding the missing data.

GAN and ResNet models were implemented for the\ngeneration of synthetic CTs from the 3D T1-weighted MR images using a six-fold\ncross-validation scheme. The resulting sCTs were compared, considering the CT\nimages as a reference using standard metrics such as the mean absolute error\n(MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index\n(SSIM). Overall, the ResNet model exhibited higher accuracy in relation to the\ndelineation of brain tissues. The ResNet model estimated the CT values for the\nentire head region with an MAE of 114.1 HU compared to MAE=-10.9 HU obtained\nfrom the GAN model. Moreover, both models offered comparable SSIM and PSNR\nvalues, although the ResNet method exhibited a slightly superior performance\nover the GAN method. We compared two state-of-the-art deep learning models for\nthe task of MR-based sCT generation. The ResNet model exhibited superior\nresults, thus demonstrating its potential to be used for the challenge of\nsynthetic CT generation in PET/MR AC and MR-only RT planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 10:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

On the\nimplementation level, we carefully investigate the physical measuring\nprinciples of LiDARs and propose an efficient and accurate LiDAR edge\nextraction method based on point cloud voxel cutting and plane fitting. Due to\nthe edges' richness in natural scenes, we have carried out experiments in many\nindoor and outdoor scenes. The results show that this method has high\nrobustness, accuracy, and consistency.

Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is\narguably the most compelling fairness notion in this context. However, the\nexistence of EFX allocations has not been settled and is one of the most\nimportant problems in fair division. Towards resolving this problem, many\nimpressive results show the existence of its relaxations, e.g., the existence\nof $0.618$-EFX allocations, and the existence of EFX at most $n-1$ unallocated\ngoods. The latter result was recently improved for three agents, in which the\ntwo unallocated goods are allocated through an involved procedure. Reducing the\nnumber of unallocated goods for arbitrary number of agents is a systematic way\nto settle the big question. In this paper, we develop a new approach, and show\nthat for every $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1/2]$, there always exists a\n$(1-\\varepsilon)$-EFX allocation with sublinear number of unallocated goods and\nhigh Nash welfare.\n  For this, we reduce the EFX problem to a novel problem in extremal graph\ntheory. We introduce the notion of rainbow cycle number $R(\\cdot)$. For all $d\n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, $R(d)$ is the largest $k$ such that there exists a $k$-partite\ndigraph $G =(\\cup_{i \\in [k]} V_i, E)$, in which\n  1) each part has at most $d$ vertices, i.e., $\\lvert V_i \\rvert \\leq d$ for\nall $i \\in [k]$,\n  2) for any two parts $V_i$ and $V_j$, each vertex in $V_i$ has an incoming\nedge from some vertex in $V_j$ and vice-versa, and\n  3) there exists no cycle in $G$ that contains at most one vertex from each\npart.\n  We show that any upper bound on $R(d)$ directly translates to a sublinear\nbound on the number of unallocated goods. We establish a polynomial upper bound\non $R(d)$, yielding our main result. Furthermore, our approach is constructive,\nwhich also gives a polynomial-time algorithm for finding such an allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 10:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

This\nproblem can be further understood as generating a sequence of coordinates\ndescribing the future motion of the tracked agent. Various proposed approaches\ndemonstrate significant benefits of using a rasterised top-down image of the\nroad, with a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for\nextraction of relevant features that define the road structure (eg. driveable\nareas, lanes, walkways). In contrast, this paper explores use of Capsule\nNetworks (CapsNets) in the context of learning a hierarchical representation of\nsparse semantic layers corresponding to small regions of the High-Definition\n(HD) map.

Deep, narrow-band images through the H$\\alpha$ and [SII]\nemission lines, and through an off-line continuum filter, covering a wide\n($\\sim15'$) field around the IRAS targets were acquired.

As intrinsic shape correlations\n(IAs) are caused by tidal gravitational fields acting on galaxies as a\ncollection of massive non-relativistic test particles, they are only sensitive\nto the gravitational potential, which forms in conjunction with the curvature\nperturbation. In contrast, the cosmic shear signal probes the sum of these two,\ni.e. both Bardeen-potentials. Combining these probes therefore constitutes a\ntest of gravity, derived from a single measurement.\n  Focusing on linear scales and alignments of elliptical galaxies, we study the\nimpact on inference of the braiding $\\hat{\\alpha}_B$ and the time evolution of\nthe Planck mass $\\hat{\\alpha}_M$ by treating IAs as a genuine signal\ncontributing to the overall ellipticity correlation.

Thus diminishing the benefit of IA for probing\nmodified gravitational theories.

Simple methods for enhancing the resolution of\nsuch images will exacerbate the artefacts, rendering them visually\nobjectionable. In spite of its high practical values, super-resolving\ncompressed images is not well studied in the literature. In this paper, we\npropose a novel compressed image super resolution (CISR) framework based on\nparallel and series integration of artefacts removal and resolution\nenhancement. Based on a mathematical inference model for estimating a clean\nlow-resolution (LR) image and a clean high-resolution (HR) image from a\ndown-sampled and compressed observation, we have designed a CISR architecture\nconsisting of two deep neural network modules: the artefacts removal module\n(ARM) and the resolution enhancement module (REM). The ARM and the REM work in\nparallel with both taking the compressed LR image as their inputs, at the same\ntime they also work in series with the REM taking the output of the ARM as one\nof its inputs and the ARM taking the output of the REM as its other input. A\ntechnique called unfolding is introduced to recursively suppress the\ncompression artefacts and restore the image resolution. A unique feature of our\nCISR system is that it exploits the parallel and series connections between the\nARM and the REM, and recursive optimization to reduce the model's dependency on\nspecific types of degradation thus making it possible to train a single model\nto super-resolve images compressed by different methods to different qualities.\nCodes and datasets are available at https://github.com/luohongming/CISR_PSI.git\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 13:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 01:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 03:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

The B[e] stars present in\ntheir spectra heterogeneous features that reveal the presence of regions with\nvery different properties in a gaseous and dusty envelope. Our goal is to study\nthe evolution of the disks around peculiar B stars through the variability of\ntheir physical properties and dynamical structure, as well as to set\nconstraints on different models and disk forming mechanisms. Throughout the\nlast decade, we have carried out temporal monitoring of a sample of objects in\nthe near infrared using spectroscopic facilities at the Gemini and Las Campanas\nObservatories. In the present work, we focus on the classical Be star 12 Vul,\nfor which also optical spectra have been collected quasi-simultaneously. We\nobserved variability in the hydrogen line profiles of 12 Vul, attributed to\ndissipating and building-up processes of the circumstellar envelope. Also, we\nfound that this Be star presented the $^{12}$CO band heads in emission in one\nobservation. The emission of this molecule has not been previously reported in\na Be star, while it is a common feature among B[e] stars.

First proposed in 1929 in particle physics, Weyl\nfermions have yet to be observed as elementary particles. In 2015, Weyl\nfermions were detected as collective electronic excitations in the strong\nspin-orbit coupled material tantalum arsenide, TaAs. This discovery was\nfollowed by a flurry of experimental and theoretical explorations of Weyl\nphenomena in materials. Weyl materials naturally lend themselves to the\nexploration of the topological index associated with Weyl fermions and their\ndivergent Berry curvature field, as well as the topological bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence giving rise to protected conducting surface states. Here, we\nreview the broader class of Weyl topological phenomena in materials, starting\nwith the observation of emergent Weyl fermions in the bulk and of Fermi arc\nstates on the surface of the TaAs family of crystals by photoemission\nspectroscopy. We then discuss some of the exotic optical and magnetic responses\nobserved in these materials, as well as the progress in developing some of the\nrelated chiral materials.

Accordingly, we here provide a quantitative\ninvestigation of the transportation density reduction before and after lockdown\nwas implemented in six epicenter cities (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, Paris, New York,\nand London) around the world during the COVID-19 epidemic, which is\naccomplished by extracting vehicles from the multi-temporal high-resolution\nremote sensing images. A novel vehicle detection model combining unsupervised\nvehicle candidate extraction and deep learning identification was specifically\nproposed for the images with the resolution of 0.5m. Our results indicate that\ntransportation densities were reduced by an average of approximately 50% (and\nas much as 75.96%) in these six cities following lockdown. The influences on\ntransportation density reduction rates are also highly correlated with policy\nstringency, with an R^2 value exceeding 0.83. Even within a specific city, the\ntransportation density changes differed and tended to be distributed in\naccordance with the city's land-use patterns. Considering that public\ntransportation was mostly reduced or even forbidden, our results indicate that\ncity lockdown policies are effective at limiting human transmission within\ncities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 13:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Given a face\nimage, face de-identification, also known as face anonymization, refers to\ngenerating another image with similar appearance and the same background, while\nthe real identity is hidden. Although extensive efforts have been made,\nexisting face de-identification techniques are either insufficient in\nphoto-reality or incapable of well-balancing privacy and utility.

A class of\nGNNs solves this problem by learning implicit weights to represent the\nimportance of neighbor nodes, which we call implicit GNNs such as Graph\nAttention Network. The basic idea of implicit GNNs is to introduce graph\ninformation with special properties followed by Learnable Transformation\nStructures (LTS) which encode the importance of neighbor nodes via a\ndata-driven way. In this paper, we argue that LTS makes the special properties\nof graph information disappear during the learning process, resulting in graph\ninformation unhelpful for learning node representations. We call this\nphenomenon Graph Information Vanishing (GIV). Also, we find that LTS maps\ndifferent graph information into highly similar results. To validate the above\ntwo points, we design two sets of 70 random experiments on five Implicit GNNs\nmethods and seven benchmark datasets by using a random permutation operator to\nrandomly disrupt the order of graph information and replacing graph information\nwith random values.

Previous studies have focused on the\neffect of neuronal heterogeneity in one neuronal population. Here we are\nspecifically interested in the effect of neuronal variability on the phase\nrelations between two populations, which can be related to different cortical\ncommunication hypotheses. It has been recently shown that two spiking neuron\npopulations unidirectionally connected in a sender-receiver configuration can\nexhibit anticipated synchronization (AS), which is characterized by a negative\nphase-lag. This phenomenon has been reported in electrophysiological data of\nnon-human primates and human EEG during a visual discrimination cognitive task.\nIn experiments, the unidirectional coupling could be accessed by Granger\ncausality and can be accompanied by both positive or negative phase difference\nbetween cortical areas.

Depending on the distribution of parameters characterizing the\nneuronal firing patterns, the system can exhibit both AS and the usual delayed\nsynchronization regime (DS, with positive phase) as well as a zero-lag\nsynchronization regime and phase bistability between AS and DS.

Situational awareness is the ability to\nperceive and comprehend a traffic situation and to predict the intent of\nvehicles and road users in the surrounding of the ego-vehicle. The main\nobjective of this paper is to propose a framework for how to automatically\nincrease the situational awareness for an automatic bus in a realistic scenario\nwhen a pedestrian behind a parked truck might decide to walk across the road.\nDepending on the ego-vehicle's ability to fuse information from sensors in\nother vehicles or in the infrastructure, shared situational awareness is\ndeveloped using a set-based estimation technique that provides robust\nguarantees for the location of the pedestrian. A two-level information fusion\narchitecture is adopted, where sensor measurements are fused locally, and then\nthe corresponding estimates are shared between vehicles and units in the\ninfrastructure. Thanks to the provided safety guarantees, it is possible to\nappropriately adjust the ego-vehicle speed to maintain a proper safety margin.\nIt is also argued that the framework is suitable for handling sensor failures\nand false detections in a systematic way.

We then alternatively investigate the possibility that the building\nblocks of the comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) agglomerated from grains and pebbles\nmade of pure condensates via the use of a disk model describing the radial\ntransport of volatiles. We show that N2/CO ratios reproducing the value\nestimated in this comet can be found in grains condensed in the vicinity of the\nCO and N2 icelines. Moreover, high CO/H2O ratios (>100 times the initial gas\nphase value) can be found in grains condensed in the vicinity of the CO\niceline. If the building blocks of a comet assembled from such grains, they\nshould present N2/CO and CO/H2O ratios consistent with the measurements made in\ncomet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)'s coma.

It is common to aim to maximize the mean outcome in the population,\nvia a regime assigning treatment only to those whose mean outcome is higher\nunder treatment versus control. However, the mean can be an unstable measure of\ncentrality, resulting in imprecise statistical procedures, as well as unrobust\ndecisions that can be overly influenced by a small fraction of subjects. In\nthis work, we propose a new median optimal treatment regime that instead treats\nindividuals whose conditional median is higher under treatment. This ensures\nthat optimal decisions for individuals from the same group are not overly\ninfluenced either by (i) a small fraction of the group (unlike the mean\ncriterion), or (ii) unrelated subjects from different groups (unlike marginal\nmedian/quantile criteria). We introduce a new measure of value, the Average\nConditional Median Effect (ACME), which summarizes across-group median\ntreatment outcomes of a policy, and which the median optimal treatment regime\nmaximizes. After developing key motivating examples that distinguish median\noptimal treatment regimes from mean and marginal median optimal treatment\nregimes, we give a nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating the ACME of a\npolicy, and propose a new doubly robust-style estimator that achieves the\nefficiency bound under weak conditions. To construct the median optimal\ntreatment regime, we introduce a new doubly robust-style estimator for the\nconditional median treatment effect.

This allows analysing parameters of a reservoir, discovery\ndependencies among parameters (including cause and effects relations), checking\nfor anomalies, prediction of expected values of missing parameters, looking for\nthe closest analogues, and much more. The method is based on extended algorithm\nMixLearn@BN for structural learning of Bayesian networks. Key ideas of\nMixLearn@BN are following: (1) learning the network structure on homogeneous\ndata subsets, (2) assigning a part of the structure by an expert, and (3)\nlearning the distribution parameters on mixed data (discrete and continuous).\nHomogeneous data subsets are identified as various groups of reservoirs with\nsimilar features (analogues), where similarity measure may be based on several\ntypes of distances. The aim of the described technique of Bayesian network\nlearning is to improve the quality of predictions and causal inference on such\nnetworks. Experimental studies prove that the suggested method gives a\nsignificant advantage in missing values prediction and anomalies detection\naccuracy.

Currently, limited testing locations and expensive equipment pose\ndifficulties for individuals trying to be tested, especially in low-resource\nsettings. Researchers have successfully presented models for detecting COVID-19\ninfection status using audio samples recorded in clinical settings [5, 15],\nsuggesting that audio-based Artificial Intelligence models can be used to\nidentify COVID-19. Such models have the potential to be deployed on smartphones\nfor fast, widespread, and low-resource testing.

To clearly\ninvestigate effects from different contributions to the Hamiltonian we study\nthe model in various limits. First, in the limit of a very thin material where\nthe linearly dispersive $z$-direction is frozen out at zero momentum and the\ndispersion in the $x$-$y$ plane is rotationally symmetric. In this limit we\nfind a Klein tunneling reminiscent of what is observed in single layer graphene\nand linearly dispersive Dirac semi-metals. Second, an increase in thickness of\nthe material leads to the possibility of a non-zero momentum eigenvalue $k_z$\nthat acts as an effective mass term in the Hamiltonian. We find that these lead\nto a suppression of Klein tunneling. Third, the inclusion of an anisotropy\nparameter $\\lambda\\neq 1$ leads to a breaking of rotational invariance.\nFurthermore, we observed that for different values of incident angle $\\theta$\nand anisotropy parameter $\\lambda$ the Hamiltonian supports different numbers\nof modes propagating to infinity. We display this effect in form of a diagram\nthat is similar to a phase diagram of a distant detector.

We do not find any\nevidence of a sizable COVID-19 harvesting effect, neither in the summer months\nafter the slowdown of the first wave nor at the beginning of the second wave.\nAccording to our estimates, only a minor share of the total excess deaths\ndetected in Northern Italian municipalities over the entire period under\nscrutiny (February - November 2020) can be attributed to an anticipatory role\nof COVID-19. A slightly higher share is detected for the most severely affected\nareas (the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, in particular), but even in these\nterritories, the harvesting effect can only account for less than 20% of excess\ndeaths.

Our\nfindings suggest that, in a phase with NPIs enacted but in-person education,\nchildren play a key role in the spreading of COVID-19. Interestingly, we show\nthat children's testing might be an important tool to flatten the epidemic\ncurve, in particular when combined with enacting temporary online education for\nclasses in which infected students are detected. Finally, we test a vaccination\nstrategy that prioritizes the members of large families and we demonstrate its\ngood performance. We believe that our modeling framework and our findings could\nbe of help for public health authorities for planning their current and future\ninterventions, as well as to increase preparedness for future epidemic\noutbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 07:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Such\nsolutions include wormholes, tunnels that connect distant regions in spacetime.\nAlthough not a single wormhole has yet been discovered, there is a large number\nof works devoted to their study, thanks to which wormholes as a class of\nsolutions become firmly established in modern science. In this paper, we\nconsider two topologically nontrivial types of solutions related to wormholes.\nFirst: wormholes that can open and close. In this relation, we will discuss\ntopological censorship theorems, which under certain conditions prohibit\nchanging topology. We will also discuss known ways to circumvent these\ntheorems. Using analytical and numerical methods, as well as visualization, we\nwill construct an example of an opening and closing wormhole with the\ndimensions of the central black hole in the Milky Way galaxy. Our construction\ncontinues the work by Kardashev, Novikov and Shatskiy, in which a static\nwormhole with the same parameters was considered. The second type is a\nmodification of Visser's dihedral wormhole solution for a dynamic case, which\ncan be considered as a model of a teleportation event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 14:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}
