This means that, when the\nfunctional motion of a protein is unknown, it should prove possible to predict\nit, since it amounts to guess a few values. However, without the help of\nadditional experimental data, using normal coordinates for generating accurate\nconformers far away from the initial one is not so straightforward. To do so, a\nnew approach is proposed: instead of building conformers directly with the\nvalues of a subset of normal coordinates, they are built in two steps, the\nconformer built with normal coordinates being just used for defining a set of\ndistance constraints, the final conformer being built so as to match them. Note\nthat this approach amounts to transform the problem of generating accurate\nprotein conformers using normal coordinates into a better known one: the\ndistance-geometry problem, which is herein solved with the help of the ROSETTA\nsoftware. In the present study, this approach allowed to rebuild accurately six\nlarge amplitude conformational changes, using at most six low-frequency normal\ncoordinates. As a consequence of the low-dimensionality of the corresponding\nsubspace, random exploration also proved enough for generating low-energy\nconformers close to the known end-point of the conformational change of the LAO\nbinding protein, lysozyme T4 and adenylate kinase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 16:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Environmentally induced\ndecoherence for a particle sliding over a dielectric sheet can be decomposed\ninto contributions of different signatures: one solely induced by the\nelectromagnetic vacuum in presence of the dielectric and another induced by\nmotion. As the geometric phase has been proved to be a fruitful venue of\ninvestigation to infer features of the quantum systems, herein we propose to\nuse the accumulated geometric phase acquired by a particle as a quantum\nfriction sensor. Furthermore, an innovative experiment designed to track traces\nof quantum friction by measuring the velocity dependence of corrections to the\ngeometric phase and coherence is proposed. The experimentally viable scheme\npresented can spark renewed optimism for the detection of non-contact friction,\nwith the hope that this non-equilibrium phenomenon can be readily measured\nsoon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 16:25:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 02:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

The SD samples the secondary\nparticle content (mostly photons, electrons, positrons and muons) of extensive\nair showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies ranging from $10^{17}~$eV up\nto more than $10^{20}~$eV. Measuring the independent contribution of the muon\ncomponent to the total registered signal is crucial to enhance the capability\nof the Observatory to estimate the mass of the cosmic rays on an event-by-event\nbasis. However, with the current design of the SD, it is difficult to\nstraightforwardly separate the contributions of muons to the SD time traces\nfrom those of photons, electrons and positrons. In this paper, we present a\nmethod aimed at extracting the muon component of the time traces registered\nwith each individual detector of the SD using Recurrent Neural Networks. We\nderive the performances of the method by training the neural network on\nsimulations, in which the muon and the electromagnetic components of the traces\nare known.

In a Kondo lattice, the\ninteraction between the localized moments gives rise to a band with heavy\neffective mass. This intriguing phenomenology has so far only been realized in\ncompounds containing rare-earth elements with 4f or 5f electrons.

We also prove that\n$FP(\\mathcal{F}, K_\\aleph)$ admits a solution whenever the cardinality\n$\\mathcal{F}$ coincide with the order and the domination numbers of its graphs.\n  For countable complete graphs, we show some non existence results when the\ndomination numbers of the graphs in $\\mathcal{F}$ are finite. More precisely,\nwe show that there is no factorization of $K_{\\mathbb{N}}$ into copies of a\n$k$-star (that is, the vertex disjoint union of $k$ countable stars) when\n$k=1,2$, whereas it exists when $k\\geq 4$, leaving the problem open for $k=3$.\n  Finally, we determine sufficient conditions for the graphs of a decomposition\nto be arranged into resolution classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 16:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

These relationships have multiple natures, ranging from providing\nhabitat for animal life to temperature and humidity dynamics. Several methods\nbased on area, size, shape, and distance have been considered in the\nliterature. Given that several important contributions of green regions to\nurban areas involve temperature, humidity and gases (e.g.~oxygen) exchanges,\nwhich are intrinsically related to physical diffusion, it becomes particularly\ninteresting to simulate the diffusion of green effects over urban areas as a\nmeans of better understanding the respective influences. The present work\nreports a related approach. Once the green regions of a given city are\nautomatically identified by semantic segmentation and have eventual artifacts\neliminated, successive convolutions are applied as a means to obtain the\nunfolding of the diffusion of the green effects along time. As illustrated, the\ndiffusion dynamics is intrinsically interesting because it can be strongly\naffected by the spatial distribution of the green mass. In particular, we\nobserved that smaller green regions could substantially contribute to the\ndiffusion.

By\nviewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),\nthe policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions\ngiven the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may\nyield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient\nexploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic\nRL with HMC, which is termed as {\\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to\nevolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method\nhas many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better\napproximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC\ncan also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher\nQ values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly\napplying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the\nHamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed\nmethod can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety\nconstraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions.

Based on\nthe composition of the offline dataset, two main categories of methods are\nused: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets and vanilla\noffline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical\nstandpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data\ncomposition is usually unknown a priori. To bridge this gap, we present a new\noffline RL framework that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of\ndata composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. The\nnew framework is centered around a weak version of the concentrability\ncoefficient that measures the deviation from the behavior policy to the expert\npolicy alone.\n  Under this new framework, we further investigate the question on algorithm\ndesign: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate and\nalso adapts to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider\na lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the\nface of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as\nwell as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual\nbandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising\nfacts about optimality rates. In particular, in all three settings, LCB\nachieves a faster rate of $1/N$ for nearly-expert datasets compared to the\nusual rate of $1/\\sqrt{N}$ in offline RL, where $N$ is the number of samples in\nthe batch dataset. In the case of contextual bandits with at least two\ncontexts, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data\ncomposition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to\noffline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 17:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

However, we\nobserve that most existing detectors based on unlabeled data perform poorly,\noften equivalent to a random prediction. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art\nOOD detectors achieve impressive performance but require access to fine-grained\ndata labels for supervised training. We propose SSD, an outlier detector based\non only unlabeled in-distribution data.

In this paper we explore a novel approach for classically simulating\nthe time dynamics of ASP with high accuracy, and with only modest computational\nresources via an adaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) scheme for\ntruncating the Hilbert space to only the most important determinants. We verify\nthat this truncation introduces negligible error, and use this new approach to\nsimulate ASP for sets of small molecular systems and Hubbard models. Further,\nwe examine two approaches to speeding up ASP when performed on quantum\nhardware: (i) using the complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI)\nwavefunction instead of the Hartree-Fock initial state and (ii)~a non-linear\ninterpolation between initial and target Hamiltonians. We find that starting\nwith a CASCI wavefunction with a limited active space yields substantial\nspeedups for many of the systems examined while non-linear interpolation does\nnot.

Ages are generally old, in agreement with the photometric\nones, and metallicities are almost always super-solar, confirming the\nmass-metallicity relation. The [Mg/Fe] ratio is also larger than solar for the\ngreat majority of the galaxies, as expected.

We model the local surroundings of the embedded\nBBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes\nbased on the local properties of the disk, which range from wind-dominated to\nquasi-spherical. We use our simulations to develop prescriptions for mass\naccretion and drag for embedded BBHs. We use these prescriptions, along with\nAGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN\ndisks, to study the long-term evolution of the BBHs as they migrate through the\ndisk. We find that BBHs typically merge within $\\lesssim 5-30\\,{\\rm Myr}$,\nincreasing their mass significantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or\ncross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The rate at which gas is\nsupplied to these BBHs often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several\norders of magnitude. We conclude that most embedded BBHs will merge before\nmigrating significantly in the disk. Depending on the conditions of the ambient\ngas and the distance to the system, LISA can detect the transition between the\ngas-dominated and gravitational wave dominated regime for inspiraling BBHs that\nare formed sufficiently close to the AGN ($\\lesssim$ 0.1 pc).

In contrast to the\nstatic fragile topology defined by Wannier obstruction, dynamical fragile\ntopology is defined for the nontrivial quantum dynamics characterized by the\nobstruction to static limits (OTSL). Specifically, the OTSL of a Floquet\ncrystal is fragile if and only if it disappears after adding a\nsymmetry-preserving static Hamiltonian in a direct-sum way preserving the\nrelevant gaps (RGs).

Despite hosting a ~1 kpc\ncircumnuclear starburst ring, NGC 3351 deviates from the IRX-beta relation, the\nrelation between the infrared-to-UV luminosity ratio and the UV continuum slope\n(beta) that other starburst galaxies follow. To understand the reason for the\ndeviation, we leverage the high angular resolution of archival nearUV-to-nearIR\nHST images to divide the ring into ~60-180 pc size regions and model each\nindividually. We find that the UV slope of the combined intrinsic (dust-free)\nstellar populations in the central region is redder than what is expected for a\nyoung model population. This is due to the region's complex star formation\nhistory, which boosts the nearUV emission relative to the farUV. The resulting\nnet attenuation curve has a UV slope that lies between those of the starburst\nattenuation curve (Calzetti et al. 2000) and the Small Magellanic Cloud\nextinction curve; the total-to-selective attenuation value, R'(V)=4.93, is\nlarger than both. As found for other star-forming galaxies, the stellar\ncontinuum of NGC 3351 is less attenuated than the ionized gas, with\nE(B-V)_{star}=0.40 E(B-V)_{gas}. The combination of the `red' intrinsic stellar\npopulation and the new attenuation curve fully accounts for the location of the\ncentral region of NGC 3351 on the IRX-beta diagram. Thus, the observed\ncharacteristics result from the complex mixture of stellar populations and dust\ncolumn densities in the circumnuclear region. Despite being a sample of one,\nthese findings highlight the difficulty of defining attenuation curves of\ngeneral applicability outside the regime of centrally-concentrated starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Tracking these black\nholes allows us to make robust predictions about the offset population. We find\nthat the number of wandering black holes scales roughly linearly with the halo\nmass, such that we expect thousands of wandering black holes in galaxy cluster\nhalos. Locally, these wanderers account for around 10 per cent of the local\nblack hole mass budget once seed masses are accounted for.

The elastic spring potential for\nthe bistable springs, consisting of 2 potential wells, is defined by the\nspacing between the potential minima and the depth of the potential wells. We\nperform simulations of VIV with linear spring, as well as bistable springs with\ntwo different inter-well separations, over a wide range of reduced velocity. As\nexpected, large oscillation amplitudes correspond to lock-in of the lift force\nwith the natural frequency of the spring-mass system. The range of reduced\nvelocity over which lock-in occurs is significantly higher for VIV with\nbistable springs compared to VIV with linear springs, although the maximum\npossible amplitude appears to be independent of the spring type. For VIV with\nbistable springs, the cylinder undergoes double-well oscillations in the\nlock-in regime. Range of reduced velocity over which lock-in occurs increases\nwhen the inter-well distance is reduced. The vortex shedding patterns and\namplitude trends look similar at the same equivalent reduced velocity for the\ndifferent springs. The results here are consistent with our prior theory, in\nwhich we propose a new \"Equilibrium-Constraint (EC)\" based on average kinetic\nenergy budget of the structure. For a given spring potential, the intersection\nof natural frequency curves with the EC curve yields the possible range of\nreduced velocities over which lock-in should occur. Our numerical simulations\nshow a collapse of the amplitude-versus-structure frequency data for all the\nsimulations onto roughly the same curve, thus supporting the existence of the\nEC, and providing an explanation for the trends in the VIV oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Establishing which physical and\nchemical processes create this differentiation can provide insights into the\nchemical evolution of water during star formation and the chemical diversity\nduring the star formation process and in young planetary systems. Methods: The\nevolution of water is modeled using 3D physicochemical models of a dynamic\nstar-forming environment. The physical evolution during the protostellar\ncollapse is described by tracer particles from a 3D MHD simulation of a\nmolecular cloud region. Each particle trajectory is post-processed using\nRADMC-3D to calculate the temperature and radiation field. The chemical\nevolution is simulated using a three-phase grain-surface chemistry model and\nthe results are compared with interferometric observations of H$_2$O, HDO, and\nD$_2$O in hot corinos toward low-mass protostars. Results: The physicochemical\nmodel reproduces the observed HDO/H$_2$O and D$_2$O/HDO ratios in hot corinos,\nbut shows no correlation with cloud environment for similar identical\nconditions. The observed dichotomy in water D/H ratios requires variation in\nthe initial conditions (e.g., the duration and temperature of the prestellar\nphase). Reproducing the observed D/H ratios in hot corinos requires a\nprestellar phase duration $t\\sim$1-3 Myr and temperatures in the range $T \\sim$\n10-20 K prior to collapse. This work demonstrates that the observed\ndifferentiation between clustered and isolated protostars stems from\ndifferences in the molecular cloud or prestellar core conditions and does not\narise during the protostellar collapse itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

In PI, servers only update the dispatcher when they become idle,\nand the dispatcher always sends jobs to the last server that reported being\nidle. PI is unique in that it does not seek to push the server queue lengths\ntowards equalization greedily. Rather, it aggressively pulls the servers away\nfrom starvation. As a result, PI's analysis requires different tools than other\nload balancing approaches. So far, PI was proven to achieve the stability\nregion for Bernoulli arrivals and deterministic and constant service\ncapacities.\n  Our main contribution is proving that PI achieves the stability region in a\nmodel with batch arrivals and random service capacities. Proving this result\nrequires developing tighter bounds on quantities of interest and proving the\nfulfillment of a generalized version of the state-dependent drift criteria\npreviously considered.

At present, there are several dozen TDE candidates, which share\nsome properties and differ in others. The range in properties is broad enough\nto overlap other transient types, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nsupernovae (SNe), which can make TDE classification ambiguous. A further\ncomplication is that \"TDE signatures\" have not been uniformly observed to\nsimilar sensitivities or even targeted across all candidates. This chapter\nreviews those events that are unusual relative to other TDEs, including the\npossibility of TDEs in pre-existing AGN, and summarises those characteristics\nthought to best distinguish TDEs from continuously accreting AGN, strongly\nflaring AGN, SNe, and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), as well as other potential\nimpostors like stellar collisions, \"micro-TDEs,\" and circumbinary accretion\nflows. We conclude that multiple observables should be used to classify any one\nevent as a TDE.

However, most solutions need expensive\nspecialized hardware and a careful calibration procedure that must be repeated\nover time.This paper proposes a fast and cheap patient positioning method based\non inexpensive consumer level RGB-D sensors.\n  METHODS: The proposed method relies on a 3D reconstruction approach that\nfuses, in real-time, artificial and natural visual landmarks recorded from a\nhand-held RGB-D sensor. The video sequence is transformed into a set of\nkeyframes with known poses, that are later refined to obtain a realistic 3D\nreconstruction of the patient. The use of artificial landmarks allows our\nmethod to automatically align the reconstruction to a reference one, without\nthe need of calibrating the system with respect to the linear accelerator\ncoordinate system.\n  RESULTS:The experiments conducted show that our method obtains a median of 1\ncm in translational error, and 1 degree of rotational error with respect to\nreference pose. Additionally, the proposed method shows as visual output\noverlayed poses (from the reference and the current scene) and an error map\nthat can be used to correct the patient's current pose to match the reference\npose.\n  CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach to obtain 3D body reconstructions for patient\npositioning without requiring expensive hardware or dedicated graphic cards is\nproposed. The method can be used to align in real time the patient's current\npose to a preview pose, which is a relevant step in radiation therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 20:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

As such, this analysis should explore the human and ML/AI roles\nprior to and during the experiment, and consider the latencies, biases, and\nknowledge priors of the decision-making process.

We further pose that the role of the AE in microscopy is\nnot the exclusion of human operators (as is the case for autonomous driving),\nbut rather automation of routine operations such as microscope tuning, etc.,\nprior to the experiment, and conversion of low latency decision making\nprocesses on the time scale spanning from image acquisition to human-level\nhigh-order experiment planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 20:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Surprisingly, we find that all\npopulations, regardless of their initial regime, evolve to be subcritical in\nsimple tasks and even strongly subcritical populations can reach comparable\nperformance. We hypothesize that the moderately subcritical regime combines the\nbenefits of generalizability and adaptability brought by closeness to\ncriticality with the stability of the dynamics characteristic for subcritical\nsystems. By a resilience analysis, we find that initially critical agents\nmaintain their fitness level even under environmental changes and degrade\nslowly with increasing perturbation strength. On the other hand, subcritical\nagents originally evolved to the same fitness, were often rendered utterly\ninadequate and degraded faster. We conclude that although the subcritical\nregime is preferable for a simple task, the optimal deviation from criticality\ndepends on the task difficulty: for harder tasks, agents evolve closer to\ncriticality. Furthermore, subcritical populations cannot find the path to\ndecrease their distance to criticality.

By averaging ~18 RRL\ntransitions, we detect RRL emission toward 206 previously known HII regions and\n436 HII region candidates. Including the northern sky surveys, over the last\ndecade the HII Region Discovery Surveys have more than doubled the number of\nknown Galactic HII regions. The census of HII regions in the WISE Catalog of\nGalactic HII Regions is now complete for nebulae with 9 GHz continuum flux\ndensities > 250 mJy. We compare the RRL properties of the newly discovered\nSHRDS nebulae with those of all previously known HII regions. The median RRL\nfull-width at half-maximum line width of the entire WISE Catalog HII region\npopulation is 23.9 km/s and is consistent between Galactic quadrants. The\nobserved Galactic longitude-velocity asymmetry in the population of HII regions\nprobably reflects underlying spiral structure in the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 22:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

To emulate the human ability in controlling caption\ngeneration, current CIC studies focus exclusively on control signals concerning\nobjective properties, such as contents of interest or descriptive patterns.\nHowever, we argue that almost all existing objective control signals have\noverlooked two indispensable characteristics of an ideal control signal: 1)\nEvent-compatible: all visual contents referred to in a single sentence should\nbe compatible with the described activity. 2) Sample-suitable: the control\nsignals should be suitable for a specific image sample. To this end, we propose\na new control signal for CIC: Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR). VSR consists\nof a verb and some semantic roles, which represents a targeted activity and the\nroles of entities involved in this activity. Given a designated VSR, we first\ntrain a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model to identify and ground all\nentities for each role. Then, we propose a semantic structure planner (SSP) to\nlearn human-like descriptive semantic structures. Lastly, we use a role-shift\ncaptioning model to generate the captions. Extensive experiments and ablations\ndemonstrate that our framework can achieve better controllability than several\nstrong baselines on two challenging CIC benchmarks. Besides, we can generate\nmulti-level diverse captions easily.

This can occur at the point of disease progression, whereby\npatients in the control arm may be offered the experimental treatment. It is\nwidely known that failure to account for treatment switching can seriously\ndilute the estimated effect of treatment on overall survival. In this paper, we\naim to account for the potential impact of treatment switching in a re-analysis\nevaluating the treatment effect of NucleosideReverse Transcriptase Inhibitors\n(NRTIs) on a safety outcome (time to first severe or worse sign or symptom) in\nparticipants receiving a new antiretroviral regimen that either included or\nomitted NRTIs in the Optimized Treatment That Includes or OmitsNRTIs (OPTIONS)\ntrial. We propose an estimator of a treatment causal effect under a structural\ncumulative survival model (SCSM) that leverages randomization as an\ninstrumental variable to account for selective treatment switching. Unlike\nRobins' accelerated failure time model often used to address treatment\nswitching, the proposed approach avoids the need for artificial censoring for\nestimation. We establish that the proposed estimator is uniformly consistent\nand asymptotically Gaussian under standard regularity conditions. A consistent\nvariance estimator is also given and a simple resampling approach provides\nuniform confidence bands for the causal difference comparing treatment groups\novertime on the cumulative intensity scale.

The tropospheric wind pattern in Jupiter consists of alternating\nprograde and retrograde zonal jets with typical velocities of up to 100 m/s\naround the equator. At much higher altitudes, in the ionosphere, strong auroral\njets have been discovered with velocities of 1-2 km/s. There is no such direct\nmeasurement in the stratosphere of the planet. Aims. In this paper, we bridge\nthe altitude gap between these measurements by directly measuring the wind\nspeeds in Jupiter's stratosphere. Methods. We use the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array's very high spectral and angular resolution\nimaging of the stratosphere of Jupiter to retrieve the wind speeds as a\nfunction of latitude by fitting the Doppler shifts induced by the winds on the\nspectral lines. Results. We detect for the first time equatorial zonal jets\nthat reside at 1 mbar, i.e. above the altitudes where Jupiter's\nQuasi-Quadrennial Oscillation occurs. Most noticeably, we find 300-400 m/s\nnon-zonal winds at 0.1 mbar over the polar regions underneath the main auroral\novals. They are in counter-rotation and lie several hundreds of kilometers\nbelow the ionospheric auroral winds. We suspect them to be the lower tail of\nthe ionospheric auroral winds. Conclusions. We detect directly and for the\nfirst time strong winds in Jupiter's stratosphere. They are zonal at low-to-mid\nlatitudes and non-zonal at polar latitudes. The wind system found at polar\nlatitudes may help increase the effciency of chemical complexification by\nconfining the photochemical products in a region of large energetic electron\nprecipitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 22:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

When trained sequentially on new or evolving\ntasks, their performance degrades sharply, making them inappropriate in\nreal-world use cases. Existing methods tackle it by either storing old data\nsamples or only updating a parameter set of DNNs, which, however, demands a\nlarge memory budget or spoils the flexibility of models to learn the\nincremented class distribution. In this paper, we shed light on an on-call\ntransfer set to provide past experiences whenever a new class arises in the\ndata stream. In particular, we propose a Zero-Shot Incremental Learning not\nonly to replay past experiences the model has learned but also to perform this\nin a zero-shot manner. Towards this end, we introduced a memory recovery\nparadigm in which we query the network to synthesize past exemplars whenever a\nnew task (class) emerges. Thus, our method needs no fixed-sized memory, besides\ncalls the proposed memory recovery paradigm to provide past exemplars, named a\ntransfer set in order to mitigate catastrophically forgetting the former\nclasses. Moreover, in contrast with recently proposed methods, the suggested\nparadigm does not desire a parallel architecture since it only relies on the\nlearner network. Compared to the state-of-the-art data techniques without\nbuffering past data samples, ZS-IL demonstrates significantly better\nperformance on the well-known datasets (CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet) in both\nTask-IL and Class-IL settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 22:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The\ndecomposition and superposition of the perturbation fields provide a new\ninsight into the origin of Reynolds stresses. Conventionally, only the\nstatistics of horizontal and vertical velocity perturbation pairs, ($u',w'$),\nare presented to show the degree of anisotropy in turbulent fields. Here, we\npresent these ($u',w'$)-pairs using both theory-based and statistical\napproaches to reveal the mechanism of the anisotropy of perturbation field. For\nan individual Holmboe mode, both the simulations and linear theory show that\n($u',w'$)-pairs tilt towards the 2nd and 4th quadrants ($u'w'<0$) within upper\nand lower vorticity interfaces, indicating an anisotropic perturbation field.\nAs a result, a negative correlation between the horizontal and vertical\nvelocity perturbation is produced, $i.e.$ negative Reynolds stresses on\naverage.

Moreover, the feature enhancement is often only\nperformed by channel or space dimension in action recognition. To address these\nissues, we first devise a Channel-wise Motion Enhancement (CME) module to\nadaptively emphasize the channels related to dynamic information with a\nchannel-wise gate vector.

Identifying predicate heads is critical to understanding\na sentence. It plays the leading role in organizing the relevant syntactic\nelements in a sentence, including subject elements, adverbial elements, etc.\nFor some languages, such as English, word morphologies are valuable for\nidentifying predicate heads. However, Chinese offers no morphological\ninformation to indicate words` grammatical roles. A Chinese sentence often\ncontains several verbal expressions; identifying the expression that plays the\nrole of the predicate head is not an easy task. Furthermore, Chinese sentences\nare inattentive to structure and provide no delimitation between words.\nTherefore, identifying Chinese predicate heads involves significant challenges.\nIn Chinese information extraction, little work has been performed in predicate\nhead recognition. No generally accepted evaluation dataset supports work in\nthis important area. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an\nannotation guideline for Chinese predicate heads and their relevant syntactic\nelements. This annotation guideline emphasizes the role of the predicate as the\nstructural center of a sentence. The design of relevant syntactic element\nannotation also follows this principle. Many considerations are proposed to\nachieve this goal, e.g., patterns of predicate heads, a flattened annotation\nstructure, and a simpler syntactic unit type. Based on the proposed annotation\nguideline, more than 1,500 documents were manually annotated. The corpus will\nbe available online for public access. With this guideline and annotated\ncorpus, our goal is to broadly impact and advance the research in the area of\nChinese information extraction and to provide the research community with a\ncritical resource that has been lacking for a long time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 03:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 07:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

We minimise user error by automating the data selection process\naccording to a metric, called Variability of Quality (VOQ) that gives a score\nto each calibration set of samples. We show that this VOQ score is correlated\nwith the estimated calibration parameter's ability to generalise well to the\nentire scene, thereby overcoming the overfitting problems of existing\ncalibration algorithms. Our approach has the benefits of simplifying the\ncalibration process for practitioners of any calibration expertise level and\nproviding an objective measure of the quality for our calibration pipeline's\ninput and output data. We additionally use a novel method of assessing the\naccuracy of the calibration parameters. It involves computing reprojection\nerrors for the entire scene to ensure that the parameters are well fitted to\nall features in the scene. Our proposed calibration pipeline takes 90s, and\nobtains an average reprojection error of 1-1.2cm, with standard deviation of\n0.4-0.5cm over 46 poses evenly distributed in a scene. This process has been\nvalidated by experimentation on a high resolution, software definable lidar,\nBaraja Spectrum-Scan; and a low, fixed resolution lidar, Velodyne VLP-16.

In particular we\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions for universality on one or two such\nqudits, in terms of simple arithmetic conditions on the associated partitions.\nWe also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for universality on\narbitrarily many such qudits, in terms of Littlewood--Richardson coefficients.\nAmong other results, we prove that universal families of multiple qudits are\nupward closed, that universality is guaranteed for sufficiently many qudits,\nand that any family that is not universal can be made so by simply adding at\nmost five ancillae. We also obtain results for 2-state systems as a special\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 04:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

While there has been much progress in\nsuppressing single-qubit gate errors in superconducting qubit systems,\ntwo-qubit gates still suffer from error rates that are orders of magnitude\nhigher. One limiting factor is the residual ZZ-interaction, which originates\nfrom a coupling between computational states and higher-energy states. While\nthis interaction is usually viewed as a nuisance, here we experimentally\ndemonstrate that it can be exploited to produce a universal set of fast single-\nand two-qubit entangling gates in a coupled transmon qubit system. To implement\narbitrary single-qubit rotations, we design a new protocol called the two-axis\ngate that is based on a three-part composite pulse. It rotates a single qubit\nindependently of the state of the other qubit despite the strong ZZ-coupling.\nWe achieve single-qubit gate fidelities as high as 99.1% from randomized\nbenchmarking measurements. We then demonstrate both a CZ gate and a CNOT gate.\nBecause the system has a strong ZZ-interaction, a CZ gate can be achieved by\nletting the system freely evolve for a gate time $t_g=53.8$ ns. To design the\nCNOT gate, we utilize an analytical microwave pulse shape based on the SWIPHT\nprotocol for realizing fast, low-leakage gates. We obtain fidelities of 94.6%\nand 97.8% for the CNOT and CZ gates respectively from quantum progress\ntomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 04:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

When the drive is applied along a symmetry\ndirection of the array, we find a clog-free uniform liquid state for low\nactivity, while at higher activity, the density becomes increasingly\nheterogeneous and an active clogged state emerges in which the mobility is\nstrongly reduced. For driving along non-symmetry or incommensurate directions,\nthere are two different clogging behaviors consisting of a drive dependent\nclogged state in the low activity thermal limit and a drive independent clogged\nstate at high activity. These regimes are separated by a uniform flowing liquid\nat intermediate activity. There is a critical activity level above which the\nthermal clogged state does not occur, as well as an optimal activity level that\nmaximizes the disk mobility. Thermal clogged states are dependent on the\ndriving direction while active clogged states are not. In the low activity\nregime, diluting the obstacles produces a monotonic increase in the mobility;\nhowever, for large activities, the mobility is more robust against obstacle\ndilution. We also examine the velocity-force curves for driving along\nnon-symmetry directions, and find that they are linear when the activity is low\nor intermediate, but become nonlinear at high activity and show behavior\nsimilar to that found for the plastic depinning of solids. At higher drives the\nactive clustering is lost. For low activity we also find a reentrant fluid\nphase, where the system transitions from a high mobility fluid at low drives to\na clogged state at higher drives and then back into another fluid phase at very\nhigh drives.

In this method, a surrogate model was proposed in\nthe form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, and\nwas iteratively solved to obtain the optimal solution of the black-box\nobjective function. In the present study, we employ the D-Wave 2000Q quantum\nannealer, which can solve QUBO by driving the binary variables by quantum\nfluctuations. The D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer does not necessarily output the\nground state at the end of the protocol due to freezing effect during the\nprocess. We investigate effects from the output of the D-Wave quantum annealer\nin performing black-box optimization. We demonstrate a benchmark test by\nemploying the sparse Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model as the black-box\nobjective function, by introducing a parameter controlling the sparseness of\nthe interaction coefficients. Comparing the results of the D-Wave quantum\nannealer to those of the simulated annealing (SA) and semidefinite programming\n(SDP), our results by the D-Wave quantum annealer and SA exhibit superiority in\nblack-box optimization with SDP. On the other hand, we did not find any\nadvantage of the D-Wave quantum annealer over the simulated annealing. As far\nas in our case, any effects by quantum fluctuation are not found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 05:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

To deal with a large amount of semantic diversity in images, a\ntrimap is conventionally required as it provides important guidance about\nobject semantics to the matting process. However, creating a good trimap is\noften expensive and timeconsuming. The SIM framework simultaneously deals with\nthe challenge of learning a wide range of semantics and salient object types in\na fully automatic and an end to end manner. Specifically, our framework is able\nto produce accurate alpha mattes for a wide range of foreground objects and\ncases where the foreground class, such as human, appears in a very different\ncontext than the train data directly from an RGB input. This is done by\nemploying a salient object detection model to produce a trimap of the most\nsalient object in the image in order to guide the matting model about\nhigher-level object semantics. Our framework leverages large amounts of coarse\nannotations coupled with a heuristic trimap generation scheme to train the\ntrimap prediction network so it can produce trimaps for arbitrary foregrounds.\nMoreover, we introduce a multi-scale fusion architecture for the task of\nmatting to better capture finer, low-level opacity semantics. With high-level\nguidance provided by the trimap network, our framework requires only a fraction\nof expensive matting data as compared to other automatic methods while being\nable to produce alpha mattes for a diverse range of inputs.

Recent advances in DA mainly proceed by\naligning the source and target distributions. Despite the significant success,\nthe adaptation performance still degrades accordingly when the source and\ntarget domains encounter a large distribution discrepancy. We consider this\nlimitation may attribute to the insufficient exploration of domain-specialized\nfeatures because most studies merely concentrate on domain-general feature\nlearning in task-specific layers and integrate totally-shared convolutional\nnetworks (convnets) to generate common features for both domains. In this\npaper, we relax the completely-shared convnets assumption adopted by previous\nDA methods and propose Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network (DCAN), which\nintroduces domain conditioned channel attention module with a multi-path\nstructure to separately excite channel activation for each domain. Such a\npartially-shared convnets module allows domain-specialized features in\nlow-level to be explored appropriately. Further, given the knowledge\ntransferability varying along with convolutional layers, we develop Generalized\nDomain Conditioned Adaptation Network (GDCAN) to automatically determine\nwhether domain channel activations should be separately modeled in each\nattention module. Afterward, the critical domain-specialized knowledge could be\nadaptively extracted according to the domain statistic gaps. As far as we know,\nthis is the first work to explore the domain-wise convolutional channel\nactivations separately for deep DA networks. Additionally, to effectively match\nhigh-level feature distributions across domains, we consider deploying feature\nadaptation blocks after task-specific layers, which can explicitly mitigate the\ndomain discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 06:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

After training and validating, the DNN is deployed as an\nirrevocable component and applied in real-world scenarios. Although most DNNs\nare built meticulously with huge volumes of training data, data in the real\nworld still remain unknown to the DNN model, which leads to the crucial\nrequirement of runtime out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, many\nexisting approaches 1) need OOD data for classifier training or parameter\ntuning, or 2) simply combine the scores of each hidden layer as an ensemble of\nfeatures for OOD detection. In this paper, we present a novel outlook on\nin-distribution data in a generative manner, which takes their latent features\ngenerated from each hidden layer as a joint distribution across representation\nspaces. Since only the in-distribution latent features are comprehensively\nunderstood in representation space, the internal difference between\nin-distribution and OOD data can be naturally revealed without the intervention\nof any OOD data. Specifically, We construct a generative model, called Latent\nSequential Gaussian Mixture (LSGM), to depict how the in-distribution latent\nfeatures are generated in terms of the trace of DNN inference across\nrepresentation spaces. We first construct the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nbased on in-distribution latent features for each hidden layer, and then\nconnect GMMs via the transition probabilities of the inference traces.\nExperimental evaluations on popular benchmark OOD datasets and models validate\nthe superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in OOD\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 06:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 03:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

For example, symmetric functions,\nthat is, functions that are invariant under the action of $S_n$, is an\nimportant class of functions in the study of Boolean functions. A function\n$f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ is called transitive (or weakly-symmetric) if there\nexists a transitive group $G$ of $S_n$ such that $f$ is invariant under the\naction of $G$ - that is the function value remains unchanged even after the\nbits of the input of $f$ are moved around according to some permutation $\\sigma\n\\in G$. Understanding various complexity measures of transitive functions has\nbeen a rich area of research for the past few decades.\n  In this work, we study transitive functions in light of several combinatorial\nmeasures. We look at the maximum separation between various pairs of measures\nfor transitive functions. Such study for general Boolean functions has been\ngoing on for past many years. The best-known results for general Boolean\nfunctions have been nicely compiled by Aaronson et. al (STOC, 2021).\n  The separation between a pair of combinatorial measures is shown by\nconstructing interesting functions that demonstrate the separation. But many of\nthe celebrated separation results are via the construction of functions (like\n\"pointer functions\" from Ambainis et al. (JACM, 2017) and \"cheat-sheet\nfunctions\" Aaronson et al. (STOC, 2016)) that are not transitive. Hence, we\ndon't have such separation between the pairs of measures for transitive\nfunctions.\n  In this paper we show how to modify some of these functions to construct\ntransitive functions that demonstrate similar separations between pairs of\ncombinatorial measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 16:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

The paramount demand of extended qubit storage time can be\nmet by using quantum-dot-confined dark exciton: a longlived electron-hole pair\nwith parallel spins. Despite its name the dark exciton reveals weak\nluminescence that can be directly measured. The origins of this optical\nactivity remain largely unexplored. In this work, using the atomistic\ntight-binding method combined with configuration-interaction approach, we\ndemonstrate that atomic-scale randomness strongly affects oscillator strength\nof dark excitons confined in self-assembled cylindrical InGaAs quantum dots\nwith no need for faceting or shape-elongation. We show that this process is\nmediated by two mechanisms: mixing dark and bright configurations by exchange\ninteraction, and equally important appearance of non-vanishing optical\ntransition matrix elements that otherwise correspond to nominally forbidden\ntransitions in a non-alloyed case. The alloy randomness has essential impact on\nboth bright and dark exciton states, including their energy, emission\nintensity, and polarization angle. We conclude that, due to the atomic-scale\nalloy randomness, finding dots with desired dark exciton properties may require\nexploration of a large ensemble, similarly to how dots with low bright exciton\nsplitting are selected for entanglement generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Unfortunately, this issue is rarely explored in\npast works.\n  We present the first systematic investigation about the function interactions\nin common robot apps. First, we disclose the potential risks and damages caused\nby malicious interactions. We introduce a comprehensive graph to model the\nfunction interactions in robot apps by analyzing 3,100 packages from the Robot\nOperating System (ROS) platform.

However, offline\ninteraction between these two steps may allow noisy pseudo labels to\nsubstantially hinder the capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a\nGroup-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm, which enables the online\ninteraction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation\nlearning. Specifically, a label transfer algorithm simultaneously uses pseudo\nlabels to train the data while refining the pseudo labels as an online\nclustering algorithm. It treats the online label refinery problem as an optimal\ntransport problem, which explores the minimum cost for assigning M samples to N\npseudo labels.

However, practical constraints prevent arbitrary increase of n due\nto the imperfections of a practical detector, especially when the detector\nresponse is dominated by saturation effect. In this work, we show that a\nmodified weak measurement protocol, namely, biased weak measurement\nsignificantly improves the precision of optical metrology in the presence of\nsaturation effect. This method detects an ultra-small fraction of photons while\nmaintains considerable amount of metrological information. The biased\npre-coupling leads to an additional reduction of photons in the post-selection\nand generates an extinction point in the spectrum distribution, which is\nextremely sensitive to the estimated parameter and difficult to be saturated.\nTherefore, the Fisher information can be persistently enhanced by increasing\nthe photon number. In our magnetic-sensing experiment, biased weak measurement\nachieves precision approximately one order of magnitude better than those of\npreviously used methods. The proposed method can be applied in various optical\nmeasurement schemes to circumvent detector saturation effect with low-cost\napparatuses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 08:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

It consists\nmainly of 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings and causes a small bottleneck. In\naddition, further growth of the initial amorphous patch under electron\nirradiation takes place. Two-coordinated atoms are found to play a crucial role\nin the latter process, analogous to autocatalisys of rearrangements of rings in\nfullerenes. The principal rearrangements in the presence of two-coordinated\natoms can be described as generalized sp-defect migration: a bond is broken\nbetween two three-coordinated atoms and one of them forms a new bond with a\nnearby two-coordinated atom. If the new and former two-coordinated atoms are\nnot bonded, the reaction leads both to displacement of the sp defect and\nchanges in rings of the sp$^2$ carbon structure. Migration by hopping of\ntwo-coordinated atoms and other reactions involving simultaneous breakage of\ntwo bonds are also detected but much rarely. Long-living two-coordinated atoms\nin the patch structure and related fast growth of the patch are observed in\nmore than half of the simulation runs.

Numerous approaches exist, but they merely\nwork well for mean differences in biomarkers between cases and controls.\nBiological processes are however much more heterogeneous, and differences could\nalso occur in other distributional characteristics (e.g. variances, skewness).\nMany machine learning techniques are better capable of utilizing these higher\norder distributional differences, sometimes at cost of explainability.\n  In this study we propose quantile based prediction (QBP), a binary\nclassification method that is based on the selection of multiple continuous\nbiomarkers. QBP generates a single score using the tails of the biomarker\ndistributions for cases and controls. This single score can then be evaluated\nby ROC analysis to investigate its predictive power.\n  The performance of QBP is compared to supervised learning methods using\nextensive simulation studies, and two case studies: major depression disorder\nand trisomy. Simultaneously, the classification performance of the existing\ntechniques in relation to each other is assessed. The key strengths of QBP are\nthe opportunity to select relevant biomarkers and the outstanding\nclassification performance in the case biomarkers predominantly show variance\ndifferences between cases and controls. When only shifts in means were present\nin the biomarkers, QBP obtained an inferior performance. Lastly, QBP proved to\nbe unbiased in case of absence of disease relevant biomarkers and outperformed\nthe other methods on the MDD case study.\n  More research is needed to further optimize QBP, since it has several\nopportunities to improve its performance.

The properties of the adsorbed He-4 atoms have been computed\nat finite temperature with path integral Monte Carlo and at T=0 K with\nvariational path integral. From both methods we find that the lowest energy\nstate of He-4 on GF is a superfluid.

However, whether NAS methods can efficiently and effectively handle\ndiversified search spaces with disparate candidates (e.g. CNNs and\ntransformers) is still an open question. In this work, we present Block-wisely\nSelf-supervised Neural Architecture Search (BossNAS), an unsupervised NAS\nmethod that addresses the problem of inaccurate architecture rating caused by\nlarge weight-sharing space and biased supervision in previous methods. More\nspecifically, we factorize the search space into blocks and utilize a novel\nself-supervised training scheme, named ensemble bootstrapping, to train each\nblock separately before searching them as a whole towards the population\ncenter. Additionally, we present HyTra search space, a fabric-like hybrid\nCNN-transformer search space with searchable down-sampling positions. On this\nchallenging search space, our searched model, BossNet-T, achieves up to 82.5%\naccuracy on ImageNet, surpassing EfficientNet by 2.4% with comparable compute\ntime. Moreover, our method achieves superior architecture rating accuracy with\n0.78 and 0.76 Spearman correlation on the canonical MBConv search space with\nImageNet and on NATS-Bench size search space with CIFAR-100, respectively,\nsurpassing state-of-the-art NAS methods.

We introduce a finer-grained categorization scheme that sheds\nmore light on the impact of absent keyphrases on scientific document retrieval.\nUnder this scheme, we find that only a fraction (around 20%) of the words that\nmake up keyphrases actually serves as document expansion, but that this small\nfraction of words is behind much of the gains observed in retrieval\neffectiveness. We also discuss how the proposed scheme can offer a new angle to\nevaluate the output of neural keyphrase generation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 10:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 14:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In this regime, the inclusion of magnetic fields\nslightly decreases the amplitude without changing the spectrum significantly\ncompared to a non-magnetised simulation. Fast rotation changes both the\namplitude and spectrum dramatically. The amplitude is increased by a factor of\nup to a few thousands. The spectrum is characterized by several peaks\nassociated to inertial modes, whose frequency scales with the rotation\nfrequency. Using simple physical arguments, we derive scalings that reproduce\nquantitatively several aspects of these numerical results. We also observe an\nexcess of low-frequency gravitational waves, which appears at the transition to\na strong field dynamo characterized by a strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic\nfield.

The comparison of the fits to the continuum excess emission obtained\nwith a slab model on the X-Shooter spectra and the HST/STIS spectra shows a\nshortcoming in the X-Shooter estimates of <10%, well within the assumed\nuncertainty. Its origin can be either a wrong UV extinction curve or due to the\nsimplicity of this modelling, and will be investigated in the course of the\nPENELLOPE program.

However, these data\nstreams are multi-source and heterogeneous, containing complex temporal\nstructures with local contextual and global temporal aspects, which makes the\nfeature learning and data joint utilization challenging. We propose to model\nthe behavior-related multi-source data streams with a local-global graph, which\ncontains multiple local context sub-graphs to learn short term local context\ninformation with heterogeneous graph neural networks and a global temporal\nsub-graph to learn long term dependency with self-attention networks. Then\nhealth status is predicted based on the structure-aware representation learned\nfrom the local-global behavior graph. We take experiments on StudentLife\ndataset, and extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 11:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

We consider tailored dissipative coupling between resonators that are\nparametrically driven and feature an on-site nonlinearity, which is either a\nKerr-type nonlinearity or an engineered two-photon loss. For both types of\nnonlinearity, we find the same exact closed-form solutions for the\ntwo-dimensional steady-state manifold spanned by superpositions of multi-mode\nSchrodinger cat states. We further show that, in the Zeno limit of strong\ndissipative coupling, the even parity multi-mode cat state can be\ndeterministically prepared from the vacuum. Remarkably, engineered two-photon\nloss gives rise to a fast relaxation towards the steady state, protecting the\nstate preparation against decoherence due to intrinsic single-photon losses and\nimperfections in tailored dissipative coupling, which sets in at longer times.\nThe relaxation time is independent of system size making the state preparation\nscalable.

As a consequence,\nwe propose to supplement the usual loss with aloss that places challenging\ncases closer to each other. This triggers sharing information among challenging\ncases andlearning specific predictive features. We show on four public datasets\nthat this leads to improved performance on the challenging scenarios while the\noverall performance stays stable. The approach is agnostic w.r.t. the used\nnetwork architecture, input modality or viewpoint, and can be integrated into\nexisting solutions easily.

For categories with enough projective or\nenough injective morphisms, we prove that these are right derived functors of\nthe $\\operatorname{Hom}$-bifunctor in either argument.\n  Since $\\operatorname{Hom}$ is only half-exact in each argument, it is natural\nto expect \"negative extensions\", i.e. its left derived functors, to exist and\nnot necessarily vanish.

As such, RECT maps nodes from the\nraw-input feature space into an intermediate-level semantic space that connects\nthe raw-input features to both seen and unseen classes. This mechanism makes\nRECT work well on both seen and unseen classes, which however also reduces the\ndiscrimination. To realize its full potentials, we propose two label expansion\nstrategies.

However, the architectures obtained by existing NAS approaches\nare optimized only for classification performance and do not adapt to devices\nwith limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a\nneural network architecture search algorithm aiming to simultaneously improve\nnetwork performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and reduce network\ncomplexity. The proposed framework automatically builds the network\narchitecture at two stages: block-level search and network-level search. At the\nstage of block-level search, a relaxation method based on the gradient is\nproposed, using an enhanced gradient to design high-performance and\nlow-complexity blocks. At the stage of network-level search, we apply an\nevolutionary multi-objective algorithm to complete the automatic design from\nblocks to the target network. The experiment results demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms all evaluated hand-crafted networks in image classification,\nwith an error rate of on CIFAR10 and an error rate of on CIFAR100, both at\nnetwork parameter size less than one megabit. Moreover, compared with other\nneural architecture search methods, our method offers a tremendous reduction in\ndesigned network architecture parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 13:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

There is an increasing interest in ultra-thin film oxide\nnanostructures from applied points of view. In this perspective paper, recent\nprogress in understanding the fundamental properties of 2D oxides is discussed.\nTwo families of 2D oxides are considered: (1) van der Waals bonded layered\nmaterials in which the transition metal is in its highest valence state\n(represented by V$_2$O$_5$ and MoO$_3$) and (2) layered materials with ionic\nbonding between positive alkali cation layers and negatively charged transition\nmetal oxide layers (LiCoO$_2$). The chemical exfoliation process and its\ncombinaton with mechanical exfoliation are presented for the latter. Structural\nphase stability of the resulting nanoflakes, the role of cation size and the\nimportance of defects in oxides are discussed. Effects of two-dimensionality on\nphonons, electronic band structures and electronic screening are placed in the\ncontext of what is known on other 2D materials, such as transition metal\ndichalcogenides. Electronic structure is discussed at the level of\nmany-body-perturbation theory using the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$\nmethod, the accuracy of which is critically evaluated including effects of\nelectron-hole interactions on screening and electron-phonon coupling. The\npredicted occurence of a two-dimensional electron gas on Li covered surfaces of\nLiCoO$_2$ and its relation to topological aspects of the band structure and\nbonding is presented as an example of the essential role of the surface in\nultrathin materials.

Some\npreferences drift quite abruptly (short-term preferences), while others change\nover a longer period of time (long-term preferences). Although the existing\nnews recommender systems consider the reader's full history, they often ignore\nthe dynamics in the reader's behavior. Thus, they cannot meet the demand of the\nnews readers for their time-varying preferences. In addition, the\nstate-of-the-art news recommendation models are often focused on providing\naccurate predictions, which can work well in traditional recommendation\nscenarios. However, in a news recommender system, diversity is essential, not\nonly to keep news readers engaged, but also to play a key role in a democratic\nsociety. In this PhD dissertation, our goal is to build a news recommender\nsystem to address these two challenges. Our system should be able to: (i)\naccommodate the dynamics in reader behavior; and (ii) consider both accuracy\nand diversity in the design of the recommendation model. Our news recommender\nsystem can also work for unprofiled, anonymous and short-term readers, by\nleveraging the rich side information of the news items and by including the\nimplicit feedback in our model. We evaluate our model with multiple evaluation\nmeasures (both accuracy and diversity-oriented metrics) to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 13:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

While the superposition of oscillations at multiple\nfrequencies necessarily causes beating in the signal acquired by a localized\nexternal probe, self-consistent hybrid simulations of chirping EP modes in a\nJT-60U tokamak plasma have demonstrated the possibility of global beating,\nwhere the electromagnetic field vanishes globally between beats and reappears\nwith opposite phase. This implies that there can be a single field mode that\noscillates at multiple frequencies simultaneously when resonantly driven by\nmultiple density waves in EP phase space. Conversely, this means that the EP\ndensity waves are mutually coupled and interfere with each other via the\njointly driven field, a mechanism ignored in some theories. In this treatise,\nwe study the role of field pulsations in general and beating in particular\nusing the Hamiltonian guiding center orbit-following code ORBIT with a reduced\nwave-particle interaction model in realistic geometry. Through amplitude\npulsations and phase jumps, beating is found to drive the evolution of EP phase\nspace structures. Observations: (1) Beating causes density wave fronts to\nadvance radially in pulses. The resulting chirps become staircase-like. (2) The\nbeats facilitate convective transfer of material between neighboring layers of\nphase space density waves. On the one hand, this may delay detachment of\nsolitary vortices. On the other hand, it facilitates the accumulation of hole\nand clump fragments into larger structures. (3) Long-range chirping occurs when\nmassive holes or clumps detach and drift away from the turbulent belt around\nthe seed resonance. The detached vortices can remain robust and, on average,\nmaintain their concentric nested layers while being perturbed by the field's\ncontinued beating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 05:53:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 17:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Most\nexisting domain adaptation algorithms attend to adapting feature\nrepresentations across two domains with the guidance of a shared\nsource-supervised classifier. However, such classifier limits the\ngeneralization ability towards unlabeled target recognition. To remedy this, we\npropose a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) approach to enhance the\nclassifier adaptation ability through implicitly generating source features\ntowards target semantics. Specifically, TSA is inspired by the fact that deep\nfeature transformation towards a certain direction can be represented as\nmeaningful semantic altering in the original input space. Thus, source features\ncan be augmented to effectively equip with target semantics to train a more\ntransferable classifier. To achieve this, for each class, we first use the\ninter-domain feature mean difference and target intra-class feature covariance\nto construct a multivariate normal distribution. Then we augment source\nfeatures with random directions sampled from the distribution class-wisely.\nInterestingly, such source augmentation is implicitly implemented through an\nexpected transferable cross-entropy loss over the augmented source\ndistribution, where an upper bound of the expected loss is derived and\nminimized, introducing negligible computational overhead. As a light-weight and\ngeneral technique, TSA can be easily plugged into various domain adaptation\nmethods, bringing remarkable improvements. Comprehensive experiments on\ncross-domain benchmarks validate the efficacy of TSA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

An important aspect of MHMMs, as of any clustering\napproach, is that they can be interpretable, allowing for novel insights to be\ngained from the data. However, without a proper way of measuring\ninterpretability, the evaluation of novel contributions is difficult and it\nbecomes practically impossible to devise techniques that directly optimize this\nproperty. In this work, an information-theoretic measure (entropy) is proposed\nfor interpretability of MHMMs, and based on that, a novel approach to improve\nmodel interpretability is proposed, i.e., an entropy-regularized Expectation\nMaximization (EM) algorithm. The new approach aims for reducing the entropy of\nthe Markov chains (involving state transition matrices) within an MHMM, i.e.,\nassigning higher weights to common state transitions during clustering. It is\nargued that this entropy reduction, in general, leads to improved\ninterpretability since the most influential and important state transitions of\nthe clusters can be more easily identified. An empirical investigation shows\nthat it is possible to improve the interpretability of MHMMs, as measured by\nentropy, without sacrificing (but rather improving) clustering performance and\ncomputational costs, as measured by the v-measure and number of EM iterations,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

For\nsuch high-precision contouring tasks, it is the typical situation that the\ninvolved multi-axis cooperation is one of the most challenging problems. As\nalso would be inevitably encountered, various factors render the multi-axis\ncooperation rather difficult; such as the strong coupling (which naturally\nbrings nonlinearity) between different axes due to its mechanical structure,\nthe backlash and deadzone caused by the friction, and the difficulties in\nsystem identification, etc. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this work\ninvestigates an intelligent model-free contouring control method for such a\nmulti-axis motion stage. Essentially in the methodology developed here, it is\nfirstly ensured that all the coupling, friction, nonlinearity, and disturbance\n(regarded as uncertain dynamics in each axis) are suitably posed as\n`uncertainties'. Then, a varying-gain sliding mode control method is proposed\nto adaptively compensate for the matched unknown dynamics in the time domain,\nwhile an iterative learning law is applied to suppress the undesirable effects\n(arising from the repetitive matched and unmatched uncertainties in the\niteration domain). With this approach, the chattering that typically results\nfrom the overestimated control gains in the sliding mode control is thus\nsuppressed during the iterations. To analyze the contouring performance and\nshow the improved outcomes, rigorous proof is furnished on both the stability\nin the time domain and the convergence in the iteration domain; and the\nreal-time experiments also illustrate that the requirements of precision motion\ncontrol towards high-speed and complex-curvature references can be satisfied\nusing the proposed method, without prior knowledge of the boundary to the\nunknown dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:33:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 10:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

Besides computational complexity -- optimal graph partitioning\nis NP-hard -- another important consideration is the memory overhead.\nReal-world graphs often have an immense size, such that loading the complete\ngraph into memory for partitioning is not economical or feasible. Currently,\nthe common approach to reduce memory overhead is to rely on streaming\npartitioning algorithms. While the latest streaming algorithms lead to\nreasonable partitioning quality on some graphs, they are still not completely\ncompetitive to in-memory partitioners. In this paper, we propose a new system,\nHybrid Edge Partitioner (HEP), that can partition graphs that fit partly into\nmemory while yielding a high partitioning quality. HEP can flexibly adapt its\nmemory overhead by separating the edge set of the graph into two sub-sets. One\nsub-set is partitioned by NE++, a novel, efficient in-memory algorithm, while\nthe other sub-set is partitioned by a streaming approach. Our evaluations on\nlarge real-world graphs show that in many cases, HEP outperforms both in-memory\npartitioning and streaming partitioning at the same time. Hence, HEP is an\nattractive alternative to existing solutions that cannot fine-tune their memory\noverheads. Finally, we show that using HEP, we achieve a significant speedup of\ndistributed graph processing jobs on Spark/GraphX compared to state-of-the-art\npartitioning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

This phenomenon\n(rheological or mechanical percolation) is well-known to occur in many\ncomposites at a critical density that exceeds the conductivity percolation\nthreshold. Conductivity percolation occurs as a consequence of contact\npercolation, which refers to the conducting particles' formation of a connected\ncomponent that spans the composite. Rheological percolation, however, has\nevaded a complete theoretical explanation and predictive description. A natural\nhypothesis is that rheological percolation arises due to rigidity percolation,\nwhereby a rigid component of inclusions spans the composite. We model\ncomposites as random isotropic dispersions of soft-core rods, and study\nrigidity percolation in such systems. Building on previous results for\ntwo-dimensional systems, we develop an approximate algorithm that identifies\nspanning rigid components through iteratively identifying and compressing\nprovably rigid motifs -- equivalently, decomposing giant rigid components into\nrigid assemblies of successively smaller rigid components. We apply this\nalgorithm to random rod systems to estimate a rigidity percolation threshold\nand explore its dependence on rod aspect ratio. We show that this transition\npoint, like the contact percolation transition point, scales inversely with the\naverage (aspect ratio-dependent) rod excluded volume. However, the scaling of\nthe rigidity percolation threshold, unlike the contact percolation scaling, is\nvalid for relatively low aspect ratio. Moreover, the critical rod contact\nnumber is constant for aspect ratio above some relatively low value; and lies\nbelow the prediction from Maxwell's isostatic condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 15:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

In contrast to this diamagnetic behavior, odd-frequency superconducting\npairing has often been seen to produce a paramagnetic Meissner effect, which\ninstead makes the superconductor unstable due to the attraction of magnetic\nfield. In this work we study how both even- and odd-frequency superconducting\npairing contributes to the Meissner effect in a generic two-orbital\nsuperconductor with a tunable odd-frequency pairing component. By dividing the\ncontributions to the Meissner effect into intra- and inter-band processes, we\nfind that the odd-frequency pairing actually generates both dia- and\nparamagnetic Meissner responses, determined by the normal-state band structure.\nMore specifically, for materials with two electron-like (hole-like) low-energy\nbands we find that the odd-frequency inter-band contribution is paramagnetic\nbut nearly canceled by a diamagnetic odd-frequency intra-band contribution.\nCombined with a diamagnetic even-frequency contribution, such superconductors\nthus always display a large diamagnetic Meissner response to an external\nmagnetic field, even in the presence of large odd-frequency pairing. For\nmaterials with an inverted, or topological, band structure, we find the\nodd-frequency inter-band contribution to instead be diamagnetic and even the\ndominating contribution to the Meissner effect in the near-metallic regime.\nTaken together, our results show that odd-frequency pairing in multi-orbital\nsuperconductors does not generate a destabilizing paramagnetic Meissner effect\nand can even generate a diamagnetic response in topological materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 15:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

As a\nconsequence, the hitting missile would have to move along a \"confocal ellipse\"\n(centered at the Earth) uniquely determined by the NEO's incoming hyperbola.\nThe author further shows in this paper that: 1) The proposed defense system\nwould be ideal to deflect NEOs that are small, i.e. less than one kilometer in\ndiameter. 2) The traditional theory of Keplerian orbits can successfully be\napplied to get an excellent first-order approximation of the mathematical\nformulae of the energy-momentum requested to achieve the NEO deflection. Many\nengineering details about the missiles shot from L1 and L3, however, still have\nto be implemented into our simulations. 3) Was one missile not enough to\ndeflect the NEO completely, it is a great advantage of the \"confocal conics\"\nused here that the new, slightly deflected NEO's hyperbola would certainly be\nhit at nearly 90 degrees by another and slightly more eccentric elliptical\nmissile trajectory. A sufficient number of missiles could thus be launched in a\nsequence from the Earth-Moon Lagrangian points L1 and L3 with the result that\nthe SUM of all these small and repeated deflections will finally throw the NEO\noff its collision hyperbola with the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 23:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

It is characterized by more complex dynamics and a\nwider range of applications as compared to those non-time-delay chaotic\nsystems. In a three-dimensional general Lorenz chaotic system, time delays can\nbe applied at different positions to build multiple heterogeneous Lorenz\nsystems with a single time delay. Despite the same equilibrium point for\nmultiple heterogeneous Lorenz systems with single time delay, their stability\nand Hopf bifurcation conditions are different due to the difference in time\ndelay position. In this paper, the theory of nonlinear dynamics is applied to\ninvestigate the stability of the heterogeneous single-time-delay Lorenz system\nat the zero equilibrium point and the conditions required for the occurrence of\nHopf bifurcation. First of all, the equilibrium point of each heterogeneous\nLorenz system is calculated, so as to determine the condition that only zero\nequilibrium point exists. Then, an analysis is conducted on the distribution of\nthe corresponding characteristic equation roots at the zero equilibrium point\nof the system to obtain the critical point of time delay at which the system is\nasymptotically stable at the zero equilibrium point and the Hopf bifurcation.\nFinally, mathematical software is applied to carry out simulation verification.\nHeterogeneous Lorenz systems with time delay have potential applications in\nsecure communication and other fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 04:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

In general these\nsystems use gamification principles in non-games contexts. Over the years,\ngamification has gained consensus among researchers and practitioners as a tool\nto motivate people to perform activities with the ultimate goal of promoting\nbehavioural change, or engaging the users to perform activities that can offer\nrelevant benefits but which can be seen as unrewarding and even tedious.\n  There exists a plethora of heterogeneous application scenarios towards\nreaching the common good that can benefit from gamification. However, an open\nproblem is how to effectively combine multiple motivational campaigns to\nmaximise the degree of participation without exposing the system to\ncounterproductive behaviours.\n  We conceive motivational digital systems as multi-agent systems:\nself-adaptation is a feature of the overall system, while individual agents may\nself-adapt in order to leverage other agents' resources, functionalities and\ncapabilities to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively. Consequently,\nmultiple campaigns can be run and adapted to reach common good. At the same\ntime, agents are grouped into micro-communities in which agents contribute with\ntheir own social capital and leverage others' capabilities to balance their\nweaknesses.\n  In this paper we propose our vision on how the principles at the base of the\nautonomous and multi-agent systems can be exploited to design multi-challenge\nmotivational systems to engage smart communities towards common goals. We\npresent an initial version of a general framework based on the MAPE-K loop and\na set of research challenges that characterise our research roadmap for the\nimplementation of our vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In a previous work,\nthe general applicability of this representation has been proved. The model is\nadjusted by fitting to it the sum of spherical radiations emitted by the\ncomposing \"stars\". The huge ratio distance/wavelength needs to implement a\nnumerical precision better than the quadruple precision. The model passes a\nvalidation test based on a spherically symmetric solution. The results for a\nset of \"stars\" representative of a disk galaxy indicate that the field is\nhighest near to the disk axis, and there the axial component of ${\\bf E}$\ndominates over the radial one. This work will allow us in the future to check\nif the interaction energy predicted by an alternative theory of gravitation\nmight be a component of dark matter.\n  {\\bf Keywords:} Disk galaxy; Maxwell equations; axial symmetry; exact\nsolutions; numerical model; dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 08:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}
