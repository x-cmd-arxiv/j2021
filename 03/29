In contrast, extrinsic bugs are\ncaused by external changes to a software, such as errors in external APIs;\nthereby they do not have an explicit bug introducing change in the version\ncontrol system. Although most previous research literature has assumed that all\nbugs are of intrinsic nature, in a previous study, we show that not all bugs\nare intrinsic. This paper shows an example of how considering extrinsic bugs\ncan affect software engineering research. Specifically, we study the impact of\nextrinsic bugs in Just In Time bug prediction by partially replicating a recent\nstudy by McIntosh and Kamei on JIT models. These models are trained using\nproperties of earlier bug-introducing changes. Since extrinsic bugs do not have\nbug introducing changes in the version control system, we manually curate\nMcIntosh and Kamei's dataset to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic\nbugs. Then, we address their original research questions, this time removing\nextrinsic bugs, to study whether bug-introducing changes are a moving target in\nJust-In-Time bug prediction. Finally, we study whether characteristics of\nintrinsic and extrinsic bugs are different. Our results show that intrinsic and\nextrinsic bugs are of different nature. When removing extrinsic bugs the\nperformance is different up to 16 % Area Under the Curve points. This indicates\nthat our JIT models obtain a more accurate representation of the real world. We\nconclude that extrinsic bugs negatively impact Just-In-Time models.\nFurthermore, we offer evidence that extrinsic bugs should be further\ninvestigated, as they can significantly impact how software engineers\nunderstand bugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 17:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In particular, we show that differences in\ncross-sectional market power are significant and higher than variations over\nthe ten-year time span of our data. In contrast to findings of labour market\npower in developed countries such as the US, we document significant market\npower of employers in Peru vis-\\`a-vis the tertiary educated workforce,\nregardless of age and sector. In contrast, for the primary educated workforce,\nmarket power seems to be high in (private) services and manufacturing. For\nsecondary educated workers, only the mining sector stands out as moderately\nmore monopsonistic than the rest of the labour market. We also show that at\nleast for the 2010s, labour market power declined in Peru.

We establish that the criterion of\nthe confinement is color neutrality of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases: vortices\nexhibiting color non-singlet AB phases are confined by the so-called AB defects\nto form color-singlet bound states.

In 1991, Abello et al. asked for a classification of the\ncomputational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target\ngraph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many\ngeneral results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of\nthat, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of\nnormal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges.\nSemi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph\ntheory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the\nlocal computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering\ngraph. We show that the presence of semi-edges makes the covering problem\nconsiderably harder; e.g., it is no longer sufficient to specify the vertex\nmapping induced by the covering, but one necessarily has to deal with the edge\nmapping as well. We show some solvable cases, and completely characterize the\ncomplexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and\ntwo-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven\nfor simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs,\neven for bipartite ones. This provides a strengthening of previously known\nresults for covering graphs without semi-edges, and may contribute to better\nunderstanding of this notion and its complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 20:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

An important theoretical result shows that scale is no longer in\nthe right nullspace of the observability matrix for zero or constant\nacceleration motion. In practical terms, this means that scale becomes\nobservable under constant-velocity motion, which enables simple and robust\nautonomous operations over arbitrary terrain. Due to the small range finder\nfootprint, range-VIO retains the minimal size, weight, and power attributes of\nVIO, with similar runtime. The benefits are evaluated on real flight data\nrepresentative of common aerial robotics scenarios. Robustness is demonstrated\nusing indoor stress data and fullstate ground truth.

Probability distributions of the actual durations of elective\nand emergency surgeries are unknown, and only a possibly small set of\nhistorical realizations may be available. To address distributional\nuncertainty, we first construct an ambiguity set that encompasses all possible\ndistributions of surgery durations within a 1-Wasserstein distance from the\nempirical distribution.

Existing TAL methods rely on pre-training a video encoder\nthrough action classification supervision. This results in a task discrepancy\nproblem for the video encoder -- trained for action classification, but used\nfor TAL. Intuitively, end-to-end model optimization is a good solution.\nHowever, this is not operable for TAL subject to the GPU memory constraints,\ndue to the prohibitive computational cost in processing long untrimmed videos.\nIn this paper, we resolve this challenge by introducing a novel low-fidelity\nend-to-end (LoFi) video encoder pre-training method. Instead of always using\nthe full training configurations for TAL learning, we propose to reduce the\nmini-batch composition in terms of temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal\nresolution so that end-to-end optimization for the video encoder becomes\noperable under the memory conditions of a mid-range hardware budget. Crucially,\nthis enables the gradient to flow backward through the video encoder from a TAL\nloss supervision, favourably solving the task discrepancy problem and providing\nmore effective feature representations. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed LoFi pre-training approach can significantly enhance the performance\nof existing TAL methods. Encouragingly, even with a lightweight ResNet18 based\nvideo encoder in a single RGB stream, our method surpasses two-stream ResNet50\nbased alternatives with expensive optical flow, often by a good margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 22:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 09:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

In particular, precise\nconditions are given on the nonlinearity powers in this equation under which a\ntravelling wave can be cut off to obtain a compacton. It is shown that there\nare no compactons which are classical (strong) solutions. Instead, the\ncompactons consist of pointwise distributional solutions as well as weak\nsolutions of an integrated from of the ODE for travelling waves. Weak-compacton\nsolutions constitute a new type of solution which has not been studied\npreviously. An explicit example is obtained in which the compacton profile is a\npower of an expression that is linear in the travelling wave variable and its\nsine. Explicit compactons with profiles given by powers of a cosine, a sine,\nJacobi sn and cn functions, and a quadratic function are also derived. In\ncomparison, explicit solitary waves of the generalized KP equation are found to\nhave profiles given by a power of a sech and a reciprocal quadratic function.\nKinematic properties of all of the different types of compactons and solitary\nwaves are discussed, along with conservation laws of the generalized KP\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 00:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

The distinguishing feature of DTI is that the\nvoxel-wise variable is a 3x3 positive definite matrix other than a scalar,\ndescribing the diffusion process at the voxel. Recently, several statistical\nmethods have been proposed to analyze the DTI data. This paper focuses on the\nstatistical inference of eigenvalues of DTI because it provides more\ntransparent clinical interpretations. However, the statistical inference of\neigenvalues is statistically challenging because few treat these responses as\nrandom eigenvalues. In our paper, we rely on the distribution of the Wishart\nmatrix's eigenvalues to model the random eigenvalues. A hierarchical model\nwhich captures the eigenvalues' randomness and spatial auto-correlation is\nproposed to infer the local covariate effects. The Monte-Carlo\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm is implemented for parameter estimation.\nBoth simulation studies and application to IXI data-set are used to demonstrate\nour proposal.

To retain the high performance of full-precision models, most existing\nquantization methods focus on fine-tuning quantized model by assuming training\ndatasets are accessible. However, this assumption sometimes is not satisfied in\nreal situations due to data privacy and security issues, thereby making these\nquantization methods not applicable. To achieve zero-short model quantization\nwithout accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt\neither post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data\ngeneration for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low\nperformance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training\nsupport for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully\nrestore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for\ndiverse data generation. To address the above issues, we propose a zero-shot\nadversarial quantization (ZAQ) framework, facilitating effective discrepancy\nestimation and knowledge transfer from a full-precision model to its quantized\nmodel. This is achieved by a novel two-level discrepancy modeling to drive a\ngenerator to synthesize informative and diverse data examples to optimize the\nquantized model in an adversarial learning fashion.

In this work, we discuss a novel\napproach to probe chemical inhomogeneities within long Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)\nhost galaxies, by comparing the absorption metallicity, Z_abs, from the GRB\nafterglow (which probes the environment along the line of sight) with the\nemission-line metallicity, Z_emiss, measured via slit spectroscopy. Using the\nIllustrisTNG simulation, the theoretical relationship between these metallicity\nmetrics is explored for a range of GRB formation models, varying the GRB\nprogenitor metallicity threshold. For galaxies with fixed Z_emiss, the median\nvalue of Z_abs depends strongly on the GRB progenitor threshold metallicity,\nwith Z_abs significantly lower than Z_emiss for high metallicity hosts.\nConversely, at fixed Z_abs, the median value of Z_emiss depends primarily on\nthe metallicity distribution of galaxies in IllustrisTNG and their chemical\ninhomogeneities, offering a GRB-model-independent way to constrain these\nprocesses observationally. Currently, only one host galaxy has data for both\nabsorption and emission metallicities (GRB121014A). We re-analyse the emission\nspectrum and compare the inferred metallicity Z_emiss to a recent Bayesian\ndetermination of Z_abs, finding $\\log(Z_{\\rm emiss}/Z_{\\odot}) = \\log(Z_{\\rm\nabs}/Z_{\\odot}) +0.35^{+ 0.14}_{- 0.25}$, within ~2 standard deviations of\npredictions from the IllustrisTNG simulation.

The enclave-OS\ninterface on SGX, however, can be extremely large if we wish to run existing\nunmodified binaries inside enclaves. This paper presents Ratel, a dynamic\nbinary translation engine running inside SGX enclaves on Linux.

To begin with, we analyze and demonstrate the transitionality of\ndegradations as interpretable prior information to indirectly infer the unknown\ndegradation model, including the widely used additive and convolutive\ndegradations.

We augment pre and\npost condition specifications with Jones' rely and guarantee conditions, which\nwe encode as commands within a wide-spectrum language. Program components are\nspecified using either partial and total correctness versions of end-to-end\nspecifications. Operations on shared data structures and atomic machine\noperations (e.g. compare-and-swap) are specified using an atomic specification\ncommand. All the above constructs are defined in terms of a simple core\nlanguage, based on four primitive commands and a handful of operators, and for\nwhich we have developed an extensive algebraic theory in Isabelle/HOL. For\nshared memory programs, expression evaluation is subject to fine-grained\ninterference and we have avoided atomicity restrictions other than for read and\nwrite of primitive types (words).

Based on the behavioral research,\nthe focus of an individual during face-to-camera communication leads to a\nspecial type of eye contact, i.e., the individual-camera eye contact, which is\na powerful signal in social communication and plays a crucial role in\nrecognizing irregular individual status (e.g., lying or suffering mental\ndisease) and special purposes (e.g., seeking help or attracting fans). Thus,\ndeveloping effective onfocus detection algorithms is of significance for\nassisting the criminal investigation, disease discovery, and social behavior\nanalysis. However, the review of the literature shows that very few efforts\nhave been made toward the development of onfocus detector due to the lack of\nlarge-scale public available datasets as well as the challenging nature of this\ntask. To this end, this paper engages in the onfocus detection research by\naddressing the above two issues. Firstly, we build a large-scale onfocus\ndetection dataset, named as the OnFocus Detection In the Wild (OFDIW). It\nconsists of 20,623 images in unconstrained capture conditions (thus called ``in\nthe wild'') and contains individuals with diverse emotions, ages, facial\ncharacteristics, and rich interactions with surrounding objects and background\nscenes. On top of that, we propose a novel end-to-end deep model, i.e., the\neye-context interaction inferring network (ECIIN), for onfocus detection, which\nexplores eye-context interaction via dynamic capsule routing. Finally,\ncomprehensive experiments are conducted on the proposed OFDIW dataset to\nbenchmark the existing learning models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed ECIIN.

It greatly affects generalization performance but the underlying\nmechanisms are not fully understood. Recent works show that for layers followed\nby normalizations, weight decay mainly affects the effective learning rate.\nHowever, despite normalizations have been extensively adopted in modern DNNs,\nlayers such as the final fully-connected layer do not satisfy this\nprecondition. For these layers, the effects of weight decay are still unclear.\nIn this paper, we comprehensively investigate the mechanisms of weight decay\nand find that except for influencing effective learning rate, weight decay has\nanother distinct mechanism that is equally important: affecting generalization\nperformance by controlling cross-boundary risk. These two mechanisms together\ngive a more comprehensive explanation for the effects of weight decay. Based on\nthis discovery, we propose a new training method called FixNorm, which discards\nweight decay and directly controls the two mechanisms.

Existing approaches generalize from a\nlimited number of traces or use simple test generation strategies.\nUnfortunately, these strategies may not exercise uncommon usage patterns of a\nsoftware system. To address this problem, we propose a new approach,\nadversarial specification mining, and develop a prototype, DICE (Diversity\nthrough Counter-Examples).

Next, we propose a new specification inference algorithm,\nDICE-Miner, to infer FSAs using the traces, guided by the temporal\nspecifications.

For the first time, we applied\ndiffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to evaluate the adsorption characteristics of a\nhydrogen molecule on a (5,5) armchair silicon-carbide nanotube (H$_2$-SiCNT).\nWithin the framework of density functional theory (DFT), we also benchmarked\nvarious exchange-correlation functionals, including those recently developed\nfor treating dispersion or vdW interactions. We found that the vdW-corrected\nDFT methods agree well with DMC, whereas the local (semilocal) functional\nsignificantly over (under)-binds. Furthermore, we fully optimized the\nH$_2$-SiCNT geometry within the DFT framework and investigated the correlation\nbetween structure and charge density. The vdW contribution to adsorption was\nfound to be non-negligible at approximately 1 kcal/mol per hydrogen molecule,\nwhich amounts to 9-29 % of the ideal adsorption energy required for hydrogen\nstorage applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

By\nperforming realistic first-principles calculations we capture the essential BLG\nband structure features, including layer- and sublattice-resolved proximity\nspin-orbit or exchange couplings. For different relative twist angles (0 or\n60$^{\\circ}$) of the WS$_2$ layers, and the magnetizations (parallel or\nantiparallel) of the CGT layers, with respect to BLG, the low energy bands are\nfound and characterized by a series of fit parameters of model Hamiltonians.\nThese effective models are then employed to investigate the tunability of the\nrelevant energy dispersions by a gate field. For WS$_2$/BLG/WS$_2$\nencapsulation we find that twisting allows to turn off the spin splittings away\nfrom the $K$ points, due to opposite proximity-induced valley-Zeeman couplings\nin the two sheets of BLG. Close to the $K$ points the electron spins are\npolarized out of the plane. This polarization can be flipped by applying a gate\nfield. As for magnetic CGT/BLG/CGT structures, we realize the recently proposed\nspin-valve effect, whereby a gap opens for antiparallel magnetizations of the\nCGT layers. Furthermore, we find that for the antiferromagnetic orientation the\nelectron states away from $K$ have vanishingly weak proximity exchange, while\nthe states close to $K$ remain spin polarized in the presence of an electric\nfield. The induced magnetization can be flipped by changing the gate field.\nThese findings should be useful for spin transport, spin filtering, and spin\nrelaxation anisotropy studies of BLG-based vdW heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 05:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

The detection of lensed images with\nmillisecond-to-second time delays provides evidence for intermediate-mass black\nholes, a population that has been difficult to observe. Several studies have\nsearched for these delays in gamma-ray burst light curves, which would indicate\nan intervening gravitational lens. Among the $\\sim 10^4$ gamma-ray bursts\nobserved, there have been a handful of claimed lensing detections, but none\nhave been statistically robust. Here we present a Bayesian analysis identifying\ngravitational lensing in the light curve of GRB950830. The inferred lens mass\ndepends on the unknown lens redshift $z_l$, and is given by $(1+z_l)M_l =\n5.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9}\\times 10^4 $ M$_\\odot$ (90% credibility), which we interpret\nas evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole.

Quantitative photodesorption yields from\nwater ice are crucial for astrochemical models. We aim to provide the first\nquantitative photon-energy dependent photodesorption yields from water ice in\nthe VUV. This information is important to understand the photodesorption\nmechanisms and to account for the variation of the yields under interstellar\nirradiation conditions. Experiments have been performed on the DESIRS beamline\nat the SOLEIL synchrotron, delivering tunable VUV light, using the SPICES\n(Surface Processes and ICES) set-up. Compact amorphous solid water ice (H$_2$O\nand D$_2$O) has been irradiated from 7 to 13.5 eV. Quantitative yields have\nbeen obtained by detection in the gas phase with mass-spectrometry for sample\ntemperatures ranging from 15 K to 100 K. Photodesorption spectra of H$_2$O\n(D$_2$O), OH (OD), H$_2$ (D$_2$) and O$_2$ peak around 9-10 eV and decrease at\nhigher energies. Average photodesorption yields of intact water at 15 K are 5\n$\\times$ 10$^{-4}$ molecule/photon for H$_2$O and 5 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$\nmolecule/photon for D$_2$O over the 7-13.5 eV range. The strong isotopic effect\ncan be explained by a differential chemical recombination between OH (OD) and H\n(D) photofragments originating from lower kinetic energy available for the OH\nphotofragments upon direct water photodissociation and/or possibly by an\nelectronic relaxation process. It is expected to contribute to water\nfractionation during the building-up of the ice grain mantles in molecular\nclouds and to favor OH-poor chemical environment in comet-formation regions of\nprotoplanetary disks. The yields of all the detected species except OH (OD) are\nenhanced above (70 $\\pm$10) K, suggesting an ice restructuration at this\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 09:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

We present a quantum routine to initialize the GWF that comprises two\nparts. In the first, the noninteracting state associated with the $U = 0$ limit\nof the model is prepared. In the second, the non-unitary Gutzwiller projection\nthat selectively removes states with doubly-occupied sites from the wave\nfunction is performed by adding to every lattice site an ancilla qubit, the\nmeasurement of which in the $|0\\rangle$ state confirms the projection was made.\nDue to its non-deterministic nature, we estimate the success rate of the\nalgorithm in generating the GWF as a function of the lattice size and the\ninteraction strength $U/t$. The scaling of the quantum circuit metrics and its\nintegration in general quantum simulation algorithms are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 09:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Further insight into this phenomenon is hampered by the\ndifficulty to objectively assess FOG. To meet this clinical need, this paper\nproposes an automated motion-capture-based FOG assessment method driven by a\nnovel deep neural network. Automated FOG assessment can be formulated as an\naction segmentation problem, where temporal models are tasked to recognize and\ntemporally localize the FOG segments in untrimmed motion capture trials. This\npaper takes a closer look at the performance of state-of-the-art action\nsegmentation models when tasked to automatically assess FOG. Furthermore, a\nnovel deep neural network architecture is proposed that aims to better capture\nthe spatial and temporal dependencies than the state-of-the-art baselines. The\nproposed network, termed multi-stage spatial-temporal graph convolutional\nnetwork (MS-GCN), combines the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network\n(ST-GCN) and the multi-stage temporal convolutional network (MS-TCN). The\nST-GCN captures the hierarchical spatial-temporal motion among the joints\ninherent to motion capture, while the multi-stage component reduces\nover-segmentation errors by refining the predictions over multiple stages. The\nexperiments indicate that the proposed model outperforms four state-of-the-art\nbaselines. Moreover, FOG outcomes derived from MS-GCN predictions had an\nexcellent (r=0.93 [0.87, 0.97]) and moderately strong (r=0.75 [0.55, 0.87])\nlinear relationship with FOG outcomes derived from manual annotations.

On the one hands, in a learning\nperspective of human's perception, it is natural to learn a task by using\nvarious information from multiple sources. However, in the previous GAN works\non SAR target image generation, the information on target classes has only been\nused. Due to the backscattering characteristics of SAR image signals, the\nshapes and structures of SAR target images are strongly dependent on their pose\nangles. Nevertheless, the pose angle information has not been incorporated into\nsuch generative models for SAR target images. In this paper, we firstly propose\na novel GAN-based multi-task learning (MTL) method for SAR target image\ngeneration, called PeaceGAN that uses both pose angle and target class\ninformation, which makes it possible to produce SAR target images of desired\ntarget classes at intended pose angles. For this, the PeaceGAN has two\nadditional structures, a pose estimator and an auxiliary classifier, at the\nside of its discriminator to combine the pose and class information more\nefficiently. In addition, the PeaceGAN is jointly learned in an end-to-end\nmanner as MTL with both pose angle and target class information, thus enhancing\nthe diversity and quality of generated SAR target images The extensive\nexperiments show that taking an advantage of both pose angle and target class\nlearning by the proposed pose estimator and auxiliary classifier can help the\nPeaceGAN's generator effectively learn the distributions of SAR target images\nin the MTL framework, so that it can better generate the SAR target images more\nflexibly and faithfully at intended pose angles for desired target classes\ncompared to the recent state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 10:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Mechanics is critical during the healing process, as the\ndamaged extracellular matrix (ECM) tends to be replaced with a new undamaged\nECM supporting homeostatic stresses. Computational modeling has been commonly\nused to simulate the healing process. However, there is a pressing need to have\na unified thermodynamics theory for healing. From the viewpoint of continuum\ndamage mechanics, some key parameters related to healing processes, for\ninstance, the volume fraction of newly grown soft tissue and the growth\ndeformation, can be regarded as internal variables and have related evolution\nequations. This paper is aiming to establish this unified framework inspired by\nthermodynamics for continuum damage models for the healing of soft biological\ntissues. The significant advantage of the proposed model is that no \\textit{ad\nhoc} equations are required for describing the healing process. Therefore, this\nnew model is more concise and offers a universal approach to simulate the\nhealing process. Three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model, which is in good agreement with the\nexisting works, including an application for balloon angioplasty in an\narteriosclerotic artery with a fiber cap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 10:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

CIL tends to learn new concepts perfectly, but not at the\nexpense of performance and accuracy for old data. Learning new knowledge in the\nabsence of data instances from previous classes or even imbalance samples of\nboth old and new classes makes CIL an ongoing challenging problem. These issues\ncan be tackled by storing exemplars belonging to the previous tasks or by\nutilizing the rehearsal strategy. Inspired by the rehearsal strategy with the\napproach of using generative models, we propose ClaRe, an efficient solution\nfor CIL by remembering the representations of learned classes in each\nincrement. Taking this approach leads to generating instances with the same\ndistribution of the learned classes. Hence, our model is somehow retrained from\nthe scratch using a new training set including both new and the generated\nsamples. Subsequently, the imbalance data problem is also solved.

However, the lack of annotated scene text video\ndatasets has become one of the most important problems, which hinders the\ndevelopment of video scene text detection. The existing scene text video\ndatasets are not large-scale due to the expensive cost caused by manual\nlabeling. In addition, the text instances in these datasets are too clear to be\na challenge. To address the above issues, we propose a tracking based\nsemi-automatic labeling strategy for scene text videos in this paper. We get\nsemi-automatic scene text annotation by labeling manually for the first frame\nand tracking automatically for the subsequent frames, which avoid the huge cost\nof manual labeling. Moreover, a paired low-quality scene text video dataset\nnamed Text-RBL is proposed, consisting of raw videos, blurry videos, and\nlow-resolution videos, labeled by the proposed convenient semi-automatic\nlabeling strategy. Through an averaging operation and bicubic down-sampling\noperation over the raw videos, we can efficiently obtain blurry videos and\nlow-resolution videos paired with raw videos separately. To verify the\neffectiveness of Text-RBL, we propose a baseline model combined with the text\ndetector and tracker for video scene text detection. Moreover, a failure\ndetection scheme is designed to alleviate the baseline model drift issue caused\nby complex scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Text-RBL with paired\nlow-quality videos labeled by the semi-automatic method can significantly\nimprove the performance of the text detector in low-quality scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 10:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

While it was\nhypothesized to play an important role in the mixing of plasmas and in\ntriggering solar wind fluctuations, its direct and unambiguous observation in\nthe solar wind was still lacking.

The KHI is found\nin a shear layer in the slow solar wind in the close vicinity of the\nHeliospheric Current Sheet, with properties satisfying linear theory for its\ndevelopment. An analysis is performed to derive the local configuration of the\nKHI. A 2-D MHD simulation is also set up with empirical values to test the\nstability of the shear layer. In addition, magnetic spectra of the KHI event\nare analyzed.

The anisotropy axes of the MNPs are assumed to have\nrandom orientation to mimic the real system. In the absence of thermal\nfluctuations and dipolar interaction, the hysteresis follows the Stoner and\nWohlfarth model irrespective of $D$, as expected. The hysteresis loop area is\nminimal for particle sizes $D \\approx8-16$ nm at $T=300$ K and $\\lambda=0.0$,\nindicating the dominance of superparamagnetic character. Switching magnetic\ninteraction on is able to move the MNPs from superparamagnetic to a\nferromagnetic state even at room temperature; therefore, magnetic interaction\nof enough strength enhances the hysteresis loop area. Interestingly, the\nhysteresis loop area is significant and is the same as that of Stoner and\nWohlfarth particle even $T=300$ K and negligible dipolar interaction for\nferromagnetic MNPs ($D>16$ nm). The coercive field $\\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ and\nblocking temperature $T^{}_B$ also get enhanced with an increase in $\\lambda$\nand $D$. The rigorous analysis of the coercive field $\\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ vs\ntemperature data also reveals significant deviation from $T^{3/4}$ dependence\nof $\\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ because of dipolar interaction. The amount of heat\ndissipated $E^{}_H$ and $\\mu_oH^{}_c$ decrease rapidly with $T$ for $D\\approx\n8-16$ nm and $\\lambda\\leq0.6$. On the other hand, $E^{}_H$ and $\\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$\ndepend weakly on $T$ with $D>16$ nm, even in the weak dipolar limit. The\npresent work should provide a better understanding of magnetic hyperthermia to\nresearchers working on this subject.

Then we build the\nshort-term interest first module, which can to capture the user's general\ninterest from the session in the context of long-term memory, at the same time\nget the user's current interest from the item of the last click. In the end,\nthe short-term and long-term interest are combined as the final interest and\nmultiplied by the candidate vector to obtain the recommendation probability.\nFinally, a large number of experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 11:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In this paper, we propose a graph signal processing\n(GSP) framework for random graph signal recovery that utilizes the information\nof the structure behind the data. First, we develop the GSP-linear minimum\nmean-squared-error (GSP-LMMSE) estimator, which minimizes the mean-squared\nerror (MSE) among estimators that are represented as an output of a graph\nfilter. The GSP-LMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in the\ngraph frequency domain, and thus, has reduced complexity compared with the\nLMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the\nsample-mean versions of these estimators that are based on a training dataset.\nWe then state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-LMMSE estimator\ncoincides with the optimal LMMSE estimator. Next, we develop the approximated\nparametrization of the GSP-LMMSE estimator by shift-invariant graph filters by\nsolving a weighted least squared (WLS) problem.

Recently, however, Single Image GANs were introduced both as\na superior solution for such manipulation tasks, but also for remarkable novel\ngenerative tasks. Despite their impressiveness, single image GANs require long\ntraining time (usually hours) for each image and each task. They often suffer\nfrom artifacts and are prone to optimization issues such as mode collapse.

Though adversarial attacks have\nachieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing\nadversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting,\nespecially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In\nthis work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class\nof iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack\ntransferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation,\ninstead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation,\nwe further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the\ncurrent gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor\nlocal optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate\nthat our method could significantly improve the transferability of\ngradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack\nensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations.\nIncorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative\ngradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could\nachieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods,\nimproving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1% .

Here we offer a stochastic agent-based model to investigate social\nrestriction measures in a community where the feelings of loneliness of the\nagents dwindle when they are socializing and grow when they are alone. In\naddition, the intensity of those feelings, which are measured by a real\nvariable that we term degree of loneliness, determines whether the agent will\nseek social contact or not. We find that decrease of the number, quality or\nduration of social contacts lead the community to enter a regime of burnout in\nwhich the degree of loneliness diverges, although the number of lonely agents\nat a given moment amounts to only a fraction of the total population. This\nregime of mental breakdown is separated from the healthy regime, where the\ndegree of loneliness is finite, by a continuous phase transition.

Generally, a plant re-searcher\ninspects the visual attributes of a seed such as size, shape, area, color and\ntexture to identify the seed type, a process that is tedious and\nlabor-intensive. Advances in the areas of computer vision and deep learning\nhave led to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that aid in\nclassification using images.

This provides a real-world\nopportunity to study the problems due to hidden-node scenarios between LAA and\nWi-Fi. The hidden node problem has been well studied in the context of\noverlapping Wi-Fi APs. However, when Wi-Fi coexists with LAA, the hidden node\nproblem is exacerbated since LAA cannot use the well-known Request-to-Send\n(RTS)/Clear to-Send (CTS) mechanism to resolve contentions, resulting in\nthroughput degradation for Wi-Fi. In this paper, we describe detailed\nmeasurements and conclusions from experiments on the campus of the University\nof Chicago which presents a perfect hidden node scenario where Wi-Fi access\npoints (APs) controlled by us and an LAA base-station (BS) deployed by AT&T are\nhidden from each other, but the clients are not.

Our results show that in a situation where LAA\nuses an aggregate of three unlicensed channels (60 MHz bandwidth) which overlap\nwith an 80 MHz Wi-Fi transmission, the Wi-Fi throughput at client devices\nsuffers considerably. Overall, Wi-Fi performance is impacted by the hidden node\nproblem more severely than LAA. In the best outdoor conditions, the throughput\nof LAA and Wi-Fi is reduced by 35% and 97% respectively when coexisting with\neach other as compared when the other system is not present.

Despite multiple\nattempts, reversible declensions of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS)\ndo not offer satisfactory adaptation of notions that are usual in\n''forward-only'' process algebras, such as replication or context. They also\nseem to fail to leverage possible new features stemming from reversibility,\nsuch as the capacity of distinguishing between multiple replications, based on\nhow they replicate the memory mechanism allowing to reverse the computation.\nExisting formalisms disallow the ''hot-plugging'' of processes during their\nexecution in contexts that also have a past. Finally, they assume the existence\nof ''eternally fresh'' keys or identifiers that, if implemented poorly, could\nresult in unnecessary bottlenecks and look-ups involving all the threads. In\nthis paper, we begin investigating those issues, by first designing a process\nalgebra endowed with a mechanism to generate identifiers without the need to\nconsult with the other threads. We use this calculus to recast the possible\nrepresentations of non-determinism in CCS, and as a by-product establish a\nsimple and straightforward definition of concurrency. Our reversible calculus\nis then proven to satisfy expected properties, and allows to lay out precisely\ndifferent representations of the replication of a process with a memory. We\nalso observe that none of the reversible bisimulations defined thus far are\ncongruences under our notion of ''reversible'' contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Since each experiment has costs associated\nwith it, selecting statistically significant experiments becomes necessary.\nClassic linear experimental design deals with experiment selection so as to\nminimize (functions of) variance in estimation of regression parameter.\nTypically, standard algorithms for solving this problem assume that data\nassociated with each experiment is fully known. This isn't often true since\nmissing data is a common problem. For instance, remote sensors often miss data\ndue to poor connection. Hence experiment selection under such scenarios is a\nwidespread but challenging task. Though decoupling the tasks and using standard\ndata imputation methods like matrix completion followed by experiment selection\nmight seem a way forward, they perform sub-optimally since the tasks are\nnaturally interdependent. Standard design of experiments is an NP hard problem,\nand the additional objective of imputing for missing data amplifies the\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a maximum-entropy-principle\nbased framework that simultaneously addresses the problem of design of\nexperiments as well as the imputation of missing data. Our algorithm exploits\nhomotopy from a suitably chosen convex function to the non-convex cost\nfunction; hence avoiding poor local minima. Further, our proposed framework is\nflexible to incorporate additional application specific constraints.\nSimulations on various datasets show improvement in the cost value by over 60%\nin comparison to benchmark algorithms applied sequentially to the imputation\nand experiment selection problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Systematic biases in the temperature\nstructure are found at about 80-100 km and above 130 km at the terminator,\npossibly due to assumptions on the CO2 mixing ratio made for stellar/solar\noccultation retrievals and uncertainties on the collisional rate coefficients\nused in the non-LTE parameterization, respectively.

Each type of agent use\nMarkov localization to update the probability distribution of the other type. A\nsearch-based control strategy is developed for the pursuers that intrinsically\ntakes the probability distribution of the evaders into account. Pursuers are\nassigned using an assignment algorithm that takes redundancy (i.e., an excess\nin the number of pursuers than the number of evaders) into account, such that\nthe total or maximum estimated time to capture the evaders is minimized. In\nthis respect we assume the pursuers to have clear advantage over the evaders.\nHowever, the objective of this work is to use assignment strategies that\nminimize the capture time. This assignment strategy is based on a modified\nHungarian algorithm as well as a novel algorithm for determining assignment of\nredundant pursuers. The evaders, in order to effectively avoid the pursuers,\npredict the assignment based on their probabilistic knowledge of the pursuers\nand use a control strategy to actively move away from those pursues. Our\nexperimental evaluation shows that the redundant assignment algorithm performs\nbetter than an alternative nearest-neighbor based assignment algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

We argue that the foundation of Bayesian\ninference is to assign a distribution on missing observations conditional on\nwhat has been observed. In the conditionally i.i.d. setting with an observed\nsample of size $n$, the Bayesian would thus assign a predictive distribution on\nthe missing $Y_{n+1:\\infty}$ conditional on $Y_{1:n}$, which then induces a\ndistribution on the parameter.

We introduce the \\textit{martingale posterior distribution}, which\nreturns Bayesian uncertainty directly on any statistic of interest without the\nneed for the likelihood and prior, and this distribution can be sampled through\na computational scheme we name \\textit{predictive resampling}.

The algorithm is simple and effective and has been used successfully to\naddress problems in various fields of applied science. However, the approximate\nnature of the algorithm has prevented it from being widely used: the Markov\nchains generated by the Griddy Gibbs sampling method are not reversible in\ngeneral, so the existence and uniqueness of its invariant measure is not\nguaranteed. Even when such an invariant measure uniquely exists, there was no\nestimate of the distance between it and the probability distribution of\ninterest, hence no means to ensure the validity of the algorithm as a means to\nsample from the true distribution.\n  In this paper, we show, subject to some fairly natural conditions, that the\nGriddy Gibbs method has a unique, invariant measure. Moreover, we provide $L^p$\nestimates on the distance between this invariant measure and the corresponding\nmeasure obtained from Gibbs sampling. These results provide a theoretical\nfoundation for the use of the Griddy Gibbs sampling method. We also address a\nmore general result about the sensitivity of invariant measures under small\nperturbations on the transition probability.

Existing approaches for this task all focus on how to design\nencoding model through a hard negative ranking loss, leaving two key problems\nunaddressed during this procedure. First, in the training stage, only a\nmini-batch of instance pairs is available in each iteration. Therefore, this\nkind of hard negatives is locally mined inside a mini-batch while ignoring the\nglobal negative samples among the dataset. Second, there are many text\ndescriptions for one video and each text only describes certain local features\nof a video. Previous works for this task did not consider to fuse the multiply\ntexts corresponding to a video during the training. In this paper, to solve the\nabove two problems, we propose a novel memory enhanced embedding learning\n(MEEL) method for videotext retrieval. To be specific, we construct two kinds\nof memory banks respectively: cross-modal memory module and text center memory\nmodule. The cross-modal memory module is employed to record the instance\nembeddings of all the datasets for global negative mining. To avoid the fast\nevolving of the embedding in the memory bank during training, we utilize a\nmomentum encoder to update the features by a moving-averaging strategy. The\ntext center memory module is designed to record the center information of the\nmultiple textual instances corresponding to a video, and aims at bridging these\ntextual instances together. Extensive experimental results on two challenging\nbenchmarks, i.e., MSR-VTT and VATEX, demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel ICI-aware sensing algorithm for MIMO-OFDM JRC systems to\ndetect the presence of multiple targets and estimate their delay-Doppler-angle\nparameters. First, leveraging the observation that spatial covariance matrix is\nindependent of target delays and Dopplers, we perform angle estimation via the\nMUSIC algorithm. For each estimated angle, we next formulate the radar\ndelay-Doppler estimation as a joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel\nestimation problem via an APES (amplitude and phase estimation) spatial\nfiltering approach by transforming the delay-Doppler parameterized radar\nchannel into an unstructured form. To account for the presence of multiple\ntargets at a given angle, we devise an iterative interference cancellation\nbased orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure, where at each iteration the\ngeneralized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is employed to form decision\nstatistics, providing as by-products the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of\nradar channels and CFOs. In the final step, target detection is performed in\ndelay-Doppler domain using target-specific, ICI-decontaminated channel\nestimates over time and frequency, where CFO estimates are utilized to resolve\nDoppler ambiguities, thereby turning ICI from foe to friend. The proposed\nalgorithm can further exploit the ICI effect to introduce an additional\ndimension (namely, CFO) for target resolvability, which enables resolving\ntargets located at the same delay-Doppler-angle cell. Simulation results\nillustrate the ICI exploitation capability of the proposed approach and\nshowcase its superior detection and estimation performance in high-mobility\nscenarios over conventional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

To this end we use a coinductive representation of reals\nas streams of binary signed digits. The main objective of this paper is the\nformalisation of a constructive proof that real numbers are closed with respect\nto limits. All the proofs of the main theorem and the first application are\nimplemented in the Minlog proof system and the extracted terms are further\ntranslated into Haskell. We compare two approaches. The first approach is a\ndirect proof. In the second approach we make use of the representation of reals\nby a Cauchy-sequence of rationals. Utilizing translations between the two\nrepresenation and using the completeness of the Cauchy-reals, the proof is very\nshort. In both cases we use Minlog's program extraction mechanism to\nautomatically extract a formally verified program that transforms a converging\nsequence of reals, i.e.~a sequence of streams of binary signed digits together\nwith a modulus of convergence, into the binary signed digit representation of\nits limit. The correctness of the extracted terms follows directly from the\nsoundness theorem of program extraction. As a first application we use the\nextracted algorithms together with Heron's method to construct an algorithm\nthat computes square roots with respect to the binary signed digit\nrepresentation.

There is a long history of algorithmic\ndevelopment for efficiently computing vertex connectivity. Recently, two near\nlinear-time algorithms for small k were introduced by [Forster et al.

An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this\nstyle diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a\nnovel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed.

Two situations are considered. In the\nfirst, the asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. In the second, the\nasset price follows a stochastic volatility process. The paper extends the\nbasic reinforcement learning approach in a number of ways.

In\nparticular, for homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates as well as for the\nBose-Hubbard dimer it has been recently shown that the relevant density\nfunctional exhibits a repulsive gradient (called the Bose-Einstein condensation\nforce) which diverges when the fraction of non-condensed bosons tends to zero.\nIn this paper, we show that the existence of the Bose-Einstein condensation\nforce is completely universal for any type of pair-interaction and also in the\nnon-homogeneous gases. To this end, we construct a universal family of\nvariational trial states which allows us to suitably approximate the relevant\ndensity functional in a finite region around the set of the completely\ncondensed states.

Carotid surgery can reduce the stroke risk\nassociated with stenoses, however, the procedure entails risks itself.\nTherefore, a thorough assessment of each case is necessary. In routine\ndiagnostics, the morphology and hemodynamics of an afflicted vessel are\nseparately analyzed using angiography and sonography, respectively. Blood flow\nsimulations based on computational fluid dynamics could enable the visual\nintegration of hemodynamic and morphological information and provide a higher\nresolution on relevant parameters. We identify and abstract the tasks involved\nin the assessment of stenoses and investigate how clinicians could derive\nrelevant insights from carotid blood flow simulations. We adapt and refine a\ncombination of techniques to facilitate this purpose, integrating\nspatiotemporal navigation, dimensional reduction, and contextual embedding. We\nevaluated and discussed our approach with an interdisciplinary group of medical\npractitioners, fluid simulation and flow visualization researchers. Our initial\nfindings indicate that visualization techniques could promote usage of carotid\nblood flow simulations in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

It does so by exploring a landscape of possible laws, which we\nexpress as a certain class of matrix models. We discover maps that put each of\nthese matrix models in correspondence with both a gauge/gravity theory and a\nmathematical model of a learning machine, such as a deep recurrent, cyclic\nneural network. This establishes a correspondence between each solution of the\nphysical theory and a run of a neural network. This correspondence is not an\nequivalence, partly because gauge theories emerge from $N \\rightarrow \\infty $\nlimits of the matrix models, whereas the same limits of the neural networks\nused here are not well-defined. We discuss in detail what it means to say that\nlearning takes place in autodidactic systems, where there is no supervision. We\npropose that if the neural network model can be said to learn without\nsupervision, the same can be said for the corresponding physical theory. We\nconsider other protocols for autodidactic physical systems, such as\noptimization of graph variety, subset-replication using self-attention and\nlook-ahead, geometrogenesis guided by reinforcement learning, structural\nlearning using renormalization group techniques, and extensions. These\nprotocols together provide a number of directions in which to explore the\norigin of physical laws based on putting machine learning architectures in\ncorrespondence with physical theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 02:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 13:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Certified control is a new safety\narchitecture whose goal is two-fold: to achieve a very high level of safety,\nand to provide a framework for justifiable confidence in that safety. The key\nidea is a runtime monitor that acts, along with sensor hardware and low-level\ncontrol and actuators, as a small trusted base, ensuring the safety of the\nsystem as a whole.\n  Unfortunately, in current systems complex perception makes the verification\neven of a runtime monitor challenging. Unlike traditional runtime monitoring,\ntherefore, a certified control monitor does not perform perception and analysis\nitself. Instead, the main controller assembles evidence that the proposed\naction is safe into a certificate that is then checked independently by the\nmonitor. This exploits the classic gap between the costs of finding and\nchecking. The controller is assigned the task of finding the certificate, and\ncan thus use the most sophisticated algorithms available (including\nlearning-enabled software); the monitor is assigned only the task of checking,\nand can thus run quickly and be smaller and formally verifiable.\n  This paper explains the key ideas of certified control and illustrates them\nwith a certificate for LiDAR data and its formal verification. It shows how the\narchitecture dramatically reduces the amount of code to be verified, providing\nan end-to-end safety analysis that would likely not be achievable in a\ntraditional architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 01:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The knowledge of artificial intelligence,\nparticularly, the machine learning techniques can be used to tackle these\nissues. However, the effectiveness of a learning-based security model may vary\ndepending on the security features and the data characteristics. In this paper,\nwe present \"CyberLearning\", a machine learning-based cybersecurity modeling\nwith correlated-feature selection, and a comprehensive empirical analysis on\nthe effectiveness of various machine learning based security models. In our\nCyberLearning modeling, we take into account a binary classification model for\ndetecting anomalies, and multi-class classification model for various types of\ncyber-attacks. To build the security model, we first employ the popular ten\nmachine learning classification techniques, such as naive Bayes, Logistic\nregression, Stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, Support vector\nmachine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting, as well as Linear discriminant analysis. We then present the\nartificial neural network-based security model considering multiple hidden\nlayers. The effectiveness of these learning-based security models is examined\nby conducting a range of experiments utilizing the two most popular security\ndatasets, UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a\nreference point for data-driven security modeling through our experimental\nanalysis and findings in the context of cybersecurity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 18:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}
