In particular, it is always analytically dense when\nthe pull-push form does not vanish. When the weight is $2$, the Hodge numbers\nare $(q,p,q)$ and the dimension of $S$ is least $rq$, we prove that the typical\nlocus where the Picard rank is at least $r$ is equidistributed in $S$ with\nrespect to the volume form $c_q^r$, where $c_q$ is the $q$\\textsuperscript{th}\nChern form of the Hodge bundle.

However, when applied to long sequence data, its\naccuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average\noperator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which\nresults in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this\nissue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention\n(RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of\nself-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the\nlocal window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different\ntest data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window\nlength is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further\ngeneralize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the\nperformance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based\nspeech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin\nspeech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate\n(CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the\nSA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is\nonly slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to\ntune the window length manually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 16:09:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 16:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 01:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 05:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

So far,\nresults are limited to the regime of noisy intermediate scale qubits (NISQ),\nwith a small number of qubits and a limited connectivity, and it is likely that\nfuture QC hardware will utilize several existing platforms in different ways.\nThus, it currently makes sense to invest resources broadly and explore the full\nrange of promising routes to quantum technology. Rare-earth ions in solids\nconstitute one of the most versatile platforms for future quantum technology.\nOne advantage is good coherence properties even when confined in strong natural\ntraps inside a solid-state matrix. This confinement allows very high qubit\ndensities and correspondingly strong ion-ion couplings. In addition, although\ntheir fluorescence is generally weak, cavity integration can enhance the\nemission greatly and enable very good connections to photonic circuits,\nincluding at the telecom wavelengths, making them promising systems for\nlong-term scalability. The primary aim of this roadmap is to provide a complete\npicture of what components a RE quantum computer would consist of, to describe\nthe details of all parts required to achieve a scalable system, and to discuss\nthe most promising paths to reach it. In brief, we find that clusters of 50-100\nsingle RE ions can act as high fidelity qubits in small processors, occupying\nonly about (10 nm)^3. Due to the high capacity for integration of the RE\nsystems, they be optically read out and connected to other such clusters for\nlarger scalability.

Motivated by the possibility of other universes, where the strong\nforce could be stronger, this paper considers the effects of bound diprotons\nand dineutrons on stars. We find that the existence of additional stable nuclei\nwith $A=2$ has relatively modest effects on the universe. Previous work\nindicates that Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) produces more deuterium, but does\nnot lead to catastrophic heavy element production. This paper revisits BBN\nconsiderations and confirms that the universe is left with an ample supply of\nhydrogen and other light nuclei for typical cosmological parameters.

Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying\nvariables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to\ncoarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum\nfor such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a\nreference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying\nthat to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to\nexist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual\ntransformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via\ncompositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to\ndevelop our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce\na category of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of\nenriched categories, prove the desired compositionality properties for our\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 16:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 08:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

The positive and negative phases\nof MISO lead to alternate epochs of above-normal (active) and below-normal\n(break) spells of rainfall. LPSs are embedded within the different phases of\nMISO and are known to produce heavy precipitation events over central India.\nWhether the interaction with the MISO phases modulates the precipitation\nresponse of LPSs, and thereby the characteristics of extreme rainfall events\n(EREs) remains unaddressed in the available literature. In this study, we\nanalyze the LPSs that produce EREs of various spatial extents viz., Small,\nMedium, and Large over central India from 1979 to 2012. We also compare them\nwith the LPSs that pass through central India and do not give any ERE\n(LPS-noex). We find that thermodynamic characteristics of LPSs that trigger\ndifferent spatial extents of EREs are similar. However, they show differences\nin their dynamic characteristics. The ERE producing LPSs are slower, moister\nand more intense than LPS-noex. The LPSs that lead to Medium and Large EREs\ntend to occur during the positive phase of MISO when an active monsoon trough\nis present over central India. On the other hand, LPS-noex and the LPSs that\ntrigger Small EREs occur mainly during the neutral or negative phases of the\nMISO. The large-scale dynamic forcing, intensification of LPSs, and diabatic\ngeneration of low-level potential vorticity due to the presence of active\nmonsoon trough help in the organization of convection and lead to Medium and\nLarge EREs. On the other hand, the LPSs that form during the negative or\nneutral phases of MISO do not intensify much during their lifetime and trigger\nscattered convection, leading to EREs of small size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 16:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

This code transformation is principled in the sense that it is the unique\nhomomorphic (structure preserving) extension to expressive languages of\nElliott's well-known and unambiguous definitions of AD for a first-order\nfunctional language. Correctness of the method follows by a (compositional)\nlogical relations argument that shows that the semantics of the syntactic\nderivative is the usual calculus derivative of the semantics of the original\nprogram.\n  In their most elegant formulation, the transformations generate code with\nlinear types. However, the code transformations can be implemented in a\nstandard functional language lacking linear types: while the correctness proof\nrequires tracking of linearity, the actual transformations do not. In fact,\neven in a standard functional language, we can get all of the type-safety that\nlinear types give us: we can implement all linear types used to type the\ntransformations as abstract types, by using a basic module system.\n  In this paper, we detail the method when applied to a simple higher-order\nlanguage for manipulating statically sized arrays. However, we explain how the\nmethodology applies, more generally, to functional languages with other\nexpressive features. Finally, we discuss how the scope of CHAD extends beyond\napplications in AD to other dynamic program analyses that accumulate data in a\ncommutative monoid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 10:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 09:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

However, we observe that\nthe generator tends to find a tricky way to hide information from the original\nimage to satisfy the constraint of cycle consistency, making it impossible to\nmaintain the rich details (e.g., wrinkles and moles) of non-editing areas. In\nthis work, we propose a simple yet effective method named HifaFace to address\nthe above-mentioned problem from two perspectives. First, we relieve the\npressure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the\nhigh-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator.\nSecond, we adopt an additional discriminator to encourage the generator to\nsynthesize rich details. Specifically, we apply wavelet transformation to\ntransform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the\nhigh-frequency parts can be used to recover the rich details. We also notice\nthat a fine-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great\nimportance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute\nregression loss.

The birth environments of planetary systems are thought to influence\nplanet formation and orbital evolution, through external photoevaporation and\nstellar flybys. Recent work has claimed observational support for this, in the\nform of a correlation between the properties of planetary systems and the local\nGalactic phase space density of the host star. In particular, Hot Jupiters are\nfound overwhelmingly around stars in regions of high phase space density, which\nmay reflect a formation environment with high stellar density. Aims. We instead\ninvestigate whether the high phase space density may have a galactic kinematic\norigin: Hot Jupiter hosts may be biased towards being young and therefore\nkinematically cold, because tidal inspiral leads to the destruction of the\nplanets on Gyr timescales, and the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galaxy\nincreases on similar timescales. Methods. We use 6D positions and kinematics\nfrom Gaia for the Hot Jupiter hosts and their neighbours, and construct\ndistributions of the phase space density. We investigate correlations between\nthe stars' local phase space density and peculiar velocity. Results. We find a\nstrong anticorrelation between the phase space density and the host star's\npeculiar velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. Therefore, most\nstars in \"high-density\" regions are kinematically cold, which may be caused by\nthe aforementioned bias towards detecting Hot Jupiters around young stars\nbefore the planets' tidal destruction.

As an\nexample, we examine whether the electron recoil excess recently reported by the\nXENON1T collaboration can be explained by chameleon-screened dark energy, and\nfind that such a model is preferred over the background-only hypothesis at the\n$2.0\\sigma$ level, in a large range of parameter space not excluded by stellar\n(or other) probes. This raises the tantalizing possibility that XENON1T may\nhave achieved the first direct detection of dark energy. Finally, we study the\nprospects for confirming this scenario using planned future detectors such as\nXENONnT, PandaX-4T, and LUX-ZEPLIN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Using a coronagraph is an efficient solution for removing\ndiffraction but requires an incoming wavefront with good quality to maximize\nstarlight rejection. On the ground, the most advanced exoplanet imagers use\nextreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems that are based on a deformable mirror\n(DM) with a large number of actuators to efficiently compensate for high-order\naberrations and provide diffraction-limited images. While several exoplanet\nimagers with DMs using around 1500 actuators are now routinely operating on\nlarge telescopes to observe gas giant planets, future systems may require a\ntenfold increase in the number of degrees of freedom to look for rocky planets.\nIn this paper, we explore wavefront correction with a secondary adaptive optics\nsystem that controls a very large number of degrees of freedom that are not\ncorrected by the primary ExAO system.

The numerical setup\nis chosen to allow direct comparison to analytic predictions for DF in the\nrange of Mach 0.2<M<3. We investigate, in detail, the DF drag force, the radial\nstructure of the wake, and their time evolution. The subsonic forces are shown\nto be well resolved, except at Mach numbers close to M=1. The supersonic cases,\nclose to M=1, significantly under-shoot the predicted force. We find that for\nscenarios with 0.7<M<2, between 10%-50% of the expected DF force is missing.\nThe origin of this deficit is mostly related to the wake structure close to the\nperturber, where the density profile of the Mach cone face shows significant\nsmoothing, which does not improve with time. The spherical expanding\nperturbation of the medium is captured well by the hydro scheme, but it is the\nsharp density structure, at the transition from Mach cone to average density,\nthat introduces the mismatch. However, we find a general improvement of the\nforce deficit with time, though significant differencesremain, in agreement\nwith other studies. This is due to (1) the structure of the far field wake\nbeing reproduced well, and (2) the fraction of total drag from the far field\nwake increasing with time. Dark matter sub-haloes, in typical cosmological\nsimulations, occupy parameters similar to those tested here, suggesting that\nthe DF which these sub-haloes experience is significantly underestimated, and\nhence their merger rate.

One of the main challenges in this approach is\nobtaining accurate system dynamics, which is especially difficult for systems\nthat require online model identification given limited computational resources\nand system data. In order to approximate the real unmodelled system dynamics,\nwe define adaptive affine control dynamics which are updated based on the error\nstates obtained by real-time sensor measurements. We define a HOCBF for a\nsafety requirement on the unmodelled system based on the adaptive dynamics and\nerror states, and reformulate the safety-critical control problem as the above\nmentioned QP. Then, we determine the events required to solve the QP in order\nto guarantee safety. We also derive a condition that guarantees the\nsatisfaction of the HOCBF constraint between events.

At the same time, coherence\nof edge modes in certain symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases can\npersist away from the ground state. In this work we show the existence of\nmany-body scars and their implications on bulk coherence in such an SPT phase.\nTo this end, we study the eigenstate properties and the dynamics of an\ninteracting spin-$1/2$ chain with three-site \"cluster\" terms hosting a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase. Focusing on the weakly\ninteracting regime, we find that eigenstates with volume-law entanglement\ncoexist with area-law entangled eigenstates throughout the spectrum. We show\nthat a subset of the latter can be constructed by virtue of repeated cluster\nexcitations on the even or odd sublattice of the chain, resulting in an\nequidistant \"tower\" of states, analogous to the phenomenology of quantum\nmany-body scars. We further demonstrate that these scarred eigenstates support\nnonthermal expectation values of local cluster operators in the bulk and\nexhibit signatures of topological order even at finite energy densities.\nStudying the dynamics for out-of-equilibrium states drawn from the\nnoninteracting \"cluster basis\", we unveil that nonthermalizing bulk dynamics\ncan be observed on long time scales if clusters on odd and even sites are\nenergetically detuned. In this case, cluster excitations remain essentially\nconfined to one of the two sublattices such that inhomogeneous cluster\nconfigurations cannot equilibrate and thermalization of the full system is\nimpeded.

A key challenge in MMDPs occurs when the state and action\nspaces grow exponentially in the number of agents, making computation of an\noptimal policy computationally intractable for medium- to large-scale problems.\nOne property that has been exploited to mitigate this complexity is transition\nindependence, in which each agent's transition probabilities are independent of\nthe states and actions of other agents.

Upon exposure to a sufficiently\nhigh intensity pulse of acoustic energy, the nanodroplet perfluorocarbon core\nundergoes a liquid-to-gas phase change and becomes an echogenic microbubble,\nproviding ultrasound contrast. The controllable activation leads to\nhigh-contrast images, while the small size of the nanodroplets promotes longer\ncirculation times and better in-vivo stability. One drawback, however, is that\nthe nanodroplets can only be vaporized a single time, limiting their\nversatility. Recently, we and others have address this issue by using a\nperfluorohexane core, which has a boiling point above body temperature. Thus\nafter vaporization, the microbubbles recondense back into their stable\nnanodroplets form. Previous work with perfluorohexane nanodroplets relied on\noptical activation via pulse laser absorption of an encapsulated dye. This\nstrategy limits the imaging depth and temporal resolution of the method. In\nthis study we overcome these limitations by demonstrating acoustic droplet\nvaporization with 1.1-MHz high intensity focused ultrasound. A short-duration,\nhigh-amplitude pulse of focused ultrasound provides a sufficiently strong peak\nnegative pressure to initiate vaporization. When using a custom imaging\nsequence with a high-frequency transducer, the repeated acoustic activation of\nperfluorohexane nanodroplets can be visualized in polyacrylamide\ntissue-mimicking phantoms. We demonstrate detection of hundreds of vaporization\nevents from individual nanodroplets with activation thresholds well below the\ntissue cavitation limit. Overall, this approach has the potential to result in\nreliable contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging at clinically relevant depths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 19:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Radiation-driven mass loss is key to our understanding of\nmassive-star evolution. However, for low-luminosity O-type stars there are big\ndiscrepancies between theoretically predicted and empirically derived mass-loss\nrates (called the weak-wind problem). Aims. We compute radiation-line-driven\nwind models of a typical weak-wind star to determine its temperature structure\nand the corresponding impact on ultra-violet (UV) line formation. Methods. We\ncarried out hydrodynamic simulations of the line-deshadowing instability (LDI)\nfor a weak-wind star in the Galaxy. Subsequently, we used this LDI model as\ninput in a short-characteristics radiative transfer code to compute synthetic\nUV line profiles. Results. We find that the line-driven weak wind is\nsignificantly shock heated to high temperatures and is unable to cool down\neffciently. This results in a complex temperature structure where more than\nhalf of the wind volume has temperatures significantly higher than the stellar\neffective temperature. Therefore, a substantial portion of the weak wind will\nbe more ionised, resulting in a reduction of the UV line opacity and therefore\nin weaker line profiles for a given mass-loss rate. Quantifying this, we find\nthat weak-wind mass-loss rates derived from unsaturated UV lines could be\nunderestimated by a factor of between 10 and 100 if the high-temperature gas is\nnot properly taken into account in the spectroscopic analysis.

And, for a number of fully\nconnected and convolutional neural networks in computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing, 1/6/9 achieves numerical parity to standard\nmixed-precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 20:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 20:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

When rewards provided by\nthe environment are sparse, agents may not receive immediate feedback on the\nquality of actions that they take, thereby affecting learning of policies. In\nthis paper, we propose a method called Shaping Advice in deep Multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (SAM) to augment the reward signal from the environment\nwith an additional reward termed shaping advice. The shaping advice is given by\na difference of potential functions at consecutive time-steps. Each potential\nfunction is a function of observations and actions of the agents. The shaping\nadvice needs to be specified only once at the start of training, and can be\neasily provided by non-experts. We show through theoretical analyses and\nexperimental validation that shaping advice provided by SAM does not distract\nagents from completing tasks specified by the environment reward.\nTheoretically, we prove that convergence of policy gradients and value\nfunctions when using SAM implies convergence of these quantities in the absence\nof SAM. Experimentally, we evaluate SAM on three tasks in the multi-agent\nParticle World environment that have sparse rewards. We observe that using SAM\nresults in agents learning policies to complete tasks faster, and obtain higher\nrewards than: i) using sparse rewards alone; ii) a state-of-the-art reward\nredistribution method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 20:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

We\nintroduce federated learning with taskonomy (FLT) that generalizes this\ndirection by learning the task-relatedness between clients for more efficient\nfederated aggregation of heterogeneous data. In a one-off process, the server\nprovides the clients with a pretrained (and fine-tunable) encoder to compress\ntheir data into a latent representation, and transmit the signature of their\ndata back to the server. The server then learns the task-relatedness among\nclients via manifold learning, and performs a generalization of federated\naveraging.

We\ndiscuss several ways of doing this, proposed in recent papers, with a focus on\nmethods that exploit RQMC. A first idea is to directly combine RQMC with a\nstandard kernel density estimator. Another one is to adapt a simulation-based\nderivative estimation method such as smoothed perturbation analysis or the\nlikelihood ratio method to obtain a continuous estimator of the cdf, whose\nderivative is an unbiased estimator of the density. This can then be combined\nwith RQMC. We summarize recent theoretical results with these approaches and\ngive numerical illustrations of how they improve the convergence of the mean\nsquare integrated error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 22:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 20:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Recently, Double-DIP proposes to model the kernel via a\nnetwork architecture prior, while KernelGAN employs the deep linear network and\nseveral regularization losses to constrain the kernel space. However, they fail\nto fully exploit the general SR kernel assumption that anisotropic Gaussian\nkernels are sufficient for image SR. To address this issue, this paper proposes\na normalizing flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for kernel modeling. By learning an\ninvertible mapping between the anisotropic Gaussian kernel distribution and a\ntractable latent distribution, FKP can be easily used to replace the kernel\nmodeling modules of Double-DIP and KernelGAN. Specifically, FKP optimizes the\nkernel in the latent space rather than the network parameter space, which\nallows it to generate reasonable kernel initialization, traverse the learned\nkernel manifold and improve the optimization stability. Extensive experiments\non synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the proposed FKP can\nsignificantly improve the kernel estimation accuracy with less parameters,\nruntime and memory usage, leading to state-of-the-art blind SR results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 22:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

One promising strategy to bridge the divide between these\napproaches and take advantage of their respective strengths is Theory-Guided\nMachine Learning (TGML) which aims to integrate physical laws into ML\nalgorithms. In this paper, three case studies on thermal management during\nprocessing of advanced composites are presented and studied using FE, ML and\nTGML. A structured approach to incrementally adding increasingly complex\nphysics to training of TGML model is presented. The benefits of TGML over ML\nmodels are seen in more accurate predictions, particularly outside the training\nregion, and ability to train with small datasets. One benefit of TGML over FE\nis significant speed improvement to potentially develop real-time feedback\nsystems. A recent successful implementation of a TGML model to assess\nproducibility of aerospace composite parts is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

However, owing to the large number of\nharmonics required to compute the amplitude of an eccentric signal, eccentric\ntemplates can be computationally very expensive, making statistical analyses to\ndistinguish distributions from different formation channels very challenging.\nIn this paper, we outline a method for estimating the signal-to-noise ratio for\ninspiraling binaries at lower frequencies such as those proposed for LISA and\nDECIGO. Our approximation can be useful more generally for any quasi-periodic\nsources. We argue that surprisingly, the signal-to-noise ratio evaluated at or\nnear the peak frequency (of the power) is well approximated by using a constant\nnoise curve, even if in reality the noise strain has power law dependence. We\nfurthermore improve this initial estimate over our previous calculation to\nallow for frequency-dependence in the noise to expand the range of eccentricity\nand frequency over which our approximation applies. We show how to apply this\nmethod to get an answer accurate to within a factor of two over almost the\nentire projected observable frequency range. We emphasize this method is not a\nreplacement for detailed signal processing. The utility lies chiefly in\nidentifying theoretically useful discriminators among different populations and\nproviding fairly accurate estimates for how well they should work.

Building on\nrecent advances in data-driven turbulence modeling, the present approach,\nreferred to as Learning and Inference assisted by Feature-space Engineering\n(LIFE), is based on the hypothesis that robustness and generalizability demand\na meticulously-designed feature space that is informed by the underlying\nphysics, and a carefully constructed features-to-augmentation map. The critical\ncomponents of this approach are: (1) Maintaining consistency across the\nlearning and prediction environments; (2) Tightly-coupled inference and\nlearning by constraining the augmentation to be learnable throughout the\ninference process; (3) Identification of relevant physics-informed features in\nappropriate functional forms to enable significant overlap in feature space for\na wide variety of cases to promote generalizability; (4) Maintaining explicit\ncontrol over feature space to change the augmentation function behavior only in\nthe vicinity of available datapoints. To demonstrate the viability of this\napproach, it is used in the modeling of bypass transition. The augmentation is\ndeveloped on skin friction data from two flat plate cases from the ERCOFTAC\ndataset.

Large-amplitude\nfluctuations, magnetic X-point geometry, and plasma interactions with material\nwalls make simulating turbulence in the edge/SOL more challenging than in the\ncore region, necessitating specialized gyrokinetic codes. Further, the\ninclusion of electromagnetic effects in gyrokinetic simulations that can handle\nthe unique challenges of the boundary plasma is critical to the understanding\nof phenomena such as the pedestal and ELMs, for which electromagnetic dynamics\nare expected to be important.\n  In this thesis, we develop the first capability to simulate electromagnetic\ngyrokinetic turbulence on open magnetic field lines.

Since\nsuch models do not fit into the memory of accelerator devices, they need to be\npartitioned by model parallelism techniques. Moreover, to accelerate training\nfor huge training data, we need a combination of model and data parallelisms,\ni.e., hybrid parallelism. Given a model description for PyTorch without any\nspecification for model parallelism, RaNNC automatically partitions the model\ninto a set of subcomponents so that (1) each subcomponent fits a device memory\nand (2) a high training throughput for pipeline parallelism is achieved by\nbalancing the computation times of the subcomponents.

Sellers compete in the same\nmarket through pricing, while considering the impact of their heterogeneous\nreputations. We consider sellers with limited as well as unlimited capacities,\nwhich correspond to different practical market scenarios. In the unlimited\nseller capacity scenario, buyers prefer the seller with the highest\nreputation-price ratio. If the gap between the highest and second highest\nseller reputation levels is large enough, then the highest reputation seller\ndominates the market as a monopoly. If sellers' reputation levels are\nrelatively close to each other, then those sellers with relatively high\nreputations will survive at the equilibrium, while the remaining relatively low\nreputation sellers will get zero market share. In the limited seller capacity\nscenario, we further consider two different cases.

The responses in\nthe neutral $(t_z)$ and charge-exchange $(t_{\\pm})$ channels are considered in\na unified way.

The essential components of a\nrepresentative elliptic solver are run at precision levels as low as half (16\nbits), and accompanied with a detailed evaluation of the impact of reduced\nprecision on the solver convergence and the solution quality.\n  A detailed inquiry into reduced precision requires a model configuration that\nis meaningful but cheaper to run and easier to evaluate than full\natmosphere/ocean models.

When the lB becomes\nsmaller than the lV, the transition from spatial confinement to magnetic\nconfinement occurs and the atomic-like shell states condense into Landau levels\n(LLs) of the Fock-Darwin states in graphene. Our experiment demonstrates that\nthe spatial confinement dramatically changes the energy spacing between the LLs\nand generates large electron-hole asymmetry of the energy spacing between the\nLLs. These results shed light on puzzling observations in previous experiments,\nwhich hitherto remained unaddressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

For the non-extremal black hole, the entanglement entropy grows\nlinearly in time and can be saturated after the Page time as expected. The\nentanglement entropy also has a well-defined Schwarzschild limit. In the\nextremal black hole, the island prescription provides a logarithmically growing\nentanglement entropy in time and a constant entanglement entropy after the Page\ntime. In the extremal black hole, the boundary of the island hits the curvature\nsingularity where the semi-classical approximations appear invalid. To avoid\nencountering the curvature singularity, we apply this procedure to the Hayward\nblack hole regular at the origin. Consequently, the presence of the island in\nextremal black holes can provide a finite entanglement entropy, which might\nimply non-trivial vacuum configurations of extremal black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 08:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 03:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 03:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

Here, we show that, by\nexploiting the collective character of molecular polaritons in conjunction with\nthe effect of polaron decoupling, i.e., the suppression of environmental\ninfluence on the polariton, a superreaction can be realized, involving a\ncollective enhancement of charge or excitation-energy transfer reaction rate in\na system of donors all coupled to a common acceptor. This effect is analogous\nto the phenomenon of superradiation. Since the polariton is a superposition\nstate of excitations of all the molecules coupled to the cavity, it is\nvulnerable to the effect of decoherence caused by energy fluctuations in\nmolecular systems. Consequently, in the absence of a strong light-matter\ninteraction, the reaction rate decreases significantly as the number of\nmolecules increases, even if the system starts from the polariton state. By\nturning on the light-matter interaction, the dynamic behavior of the system\nchanges dramatically, and the reaction rate increases with the number of\nmolecules, as expected for a superreaction.

One of the\nchallenges and lessons learned from classic software engineering is the need\nfor high-level, abstract and technology-independent representations with which\nto design software before it is coded. This paper specifically addresses this\nchallenge for quantum software design. Since UML is a well-proven modelling\nlanguage that has been widely employed by industry for some time, we propose a\nUML extension for the representation of quantum algorithms. Our proposal\ncomprises the definition of a UML profile based on various stereotypes that can\nbe applied to the existing UML activity diagrams in order to represent quantum\ncircuits. The advantage of this representation is that UML quantum circuits can\nbe interrelated with other UML elements and diagrams, which will make it\npossible to represent various concerns and viewpoints of the so-called hybrid\ninformation systems.

Improved approaches to phantom modulus can be\nconstructed from considering a force balance at the junctions, which requires\nknowledge of the distribution of cross-link fluctuations in imperfect networks.\nAssuming loops with equilibrium conformations and a force balance at all loop\njunctions, a lower bound estimate for the phantom modulus,\n$G_{\\text{ph}}\\approx\\left(\\xi-c_{\\text{f}}L_{1}\\right)kT/V$ is obtained within\nthe ILGA for end-linked model networks and in the limit of $L_{1}\\ll\\xi$. Here,\n$L_{1}$ is the number of primary (\"pending\") loops, $\\xi$ the cycle rank of the\nnetwork, $k$ the Boltzmann constant, $V$ the volume of the sample, and $T$ the\nabsolute temperature. $c_{\\text{f}}$ is a functionality dependent coefficient\nthat is $\\approx2.56$ for junction functionality $f=3$ and $\\approx3.06$ for\n$f=4$, while it converges quickly towards $\\approx4.2$ in the limit of large\n$f$. Further corrections to phantom modulus beyond finite loops are addressed\nbriefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 09:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The energy release as microflares and nanoflares occurs in two main\nphases.

This process is carried out manually, which can be\nhighly time-consuming and very prone to annotation errors.

In most instances, the assets\nbeing traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade\nand their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the\njurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do\nnot formally recognise proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part\nof the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in rampant\nillegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, we\nmotivate the need for regulated blockchain consensus protocols with a case\nstudy of the illegal, cryptocurrency based, Silk Road darknet market. We\npresent a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring\nlegal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain distributed consensus.\nAs per our regulatory framework, we derive conditions under which legal\ntransaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which\nare, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal\ntransactions. Finally, we show that with a small change to the standard\nblockchain consensus execution policy (appropriately introduced through\nregulation), the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network can be\nmaximized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 09:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Sub-volume fluctuations arise due to both turbulent\nmotions and other interface dynamics which can, in general, occur in both\nlaminar and turbulent flows. Both of these types of fluctuations are attenuated\nby the volume averaging process.

The sub-volume stress closure introduces\nan explicit volume viscosity augmented by turbulent viscosity in turbulent\nflows. The volume averaged surface tension force closure is based on fractal\nproperties of wrinkled sub-volume interfaces. These closures are evaluated\nthrough a priori analysis of resolved flow simulations for a series of\ntwo-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional turbulent interfacial shear\nflows. Subsequently, full EVD simulations are validated for these shear flows\nand for a laboratory airblast spray jet. Numerical convergence is demonstrated\nby keeping the physical length scale constant while reducing the numerical grid\nsize so that numerical diffusion diminishes and becomes overwhelmed by the\nexplicit volume diffusion. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted for\nvariations in the physical length scale, which is compared to the boundary\nlayer thickness on the light fluid side of the interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 10:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 22:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

We\nconfirm earlier results that loops formed by intersections of infinite strings\nformed from random-field initial conditions disappear quickly, with lifetime\nproportional to their initial rest-frame length $\\ell_\\text{init}$. We study a\npopulation with $\\ell_\\text{init}$ up to $6000$ inverse mass units, and measure\nthe proportionality constant to be $0.14\\pm0.04$, independently of the initial\nlengths. We propose a new method to construct oscillating non-self intersecting\nloops from initially stationary strings, and show that by contrast these loops\nhave lifetimes scaling approximately as $\\ell_\\text{init}^2$, in line with\nprevious works on artificially created string configurations. We show that the\noscillating strings have mean-square velocity $\\bar{v}^2 \\simeq 0.500 \\pm\n0.004$, consistent with the Nambu-Goto value of $1/2$, while the network loops\nhave $\\bar{v}^2 \\simeq 0.40 \\pm 0.04$. We argue that whatever the mechanism\nbehind the network loop decay is, it is non-linear, can only be suppressed by\ncareful tuning of initial conditions, and is much stronger than gravitational\nradiation.

The potential of such cut finite element techniques for\nhigher order space-time finite element methods has rarely been studied in the\nliterature so far and deserves further elucidation. The key ingredients of the\napproach are the weak formulation of Dirichlet boundary conditions by Nitsche's\nmethod, the flexible and efficient integration over all types of intersections\nof cells by moving boundaries and the spatial extension of the discrete\nphysical quantities to the entire computational background mesh including\nfictitious (ghost) subdomains of fluid flow. Thereby, an expensive remeshing\nand adaptation of the sparse matrix data structure are avoided and the\ncomputations are accelerated. To prevent spurious oscillations caused by\nirregular intersections of mesh cells, a penalization, defining also implicitly\nthe extension to ghost domains, is added.

The second is landmarking, a more pragmatic\napproach that avoids modelling the marker process. Landmarking has been shown\nto be less efficient than correctly specified joint models in simulation\nstudies, when data are generated from the joint model.

The boundaries of finite-time coherent sets are\nexamples of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs). The selection of the time\nduration over which FTCS and LCS computations are made in practice is crucial\nto their success. If this time is longer than the lifetime of coherence of\nindividual objects then existing methods will fail to detect the shorter-lived\ncoherence. It is of clear practical interest to determine the full lifetime of\ncoherent objects, but in complicated practical situations, for example a field\nof ocean eddies with varying lifetimes, this is impossible with existing\napproaches. Moreover, determining the timing of emergence and destruction of\ncoherent sets is of significant scientific interest. In this work we introduce\nnew constructions to address these issues. The key components are an inflated\ndynamic Laplace operator and the concept of semi-material FTCSs. We make strong\nmathematical connections between the inflated dynamic Laplacian and the\nstandard dynamic Laplacian [Froyland 2015], showing that the latter arises as a\nlimit of the former.

The\npresented work here is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for wave\nfield pattern recognition, or more specifically the wave field change\nrecognition. The CNN model is used to identify the change within propagating\nwave fields after a crack initiation within the structure. The paper describes\nthe implemented method and the required training procedure to get a successful\ncrack detection accuracy, where the training data are based on the dynamic\nlattice model. Although the training of the model is still time consuming, the\nproposed new method has an enormous potential to become a new crack detection\nor structural health monitoring approach within the conventional monitoring\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

It is found that the evolution of luminosity with redshift\ncan be expressed by $L\\propto(1+z)^k$ with a diverse $k$ relied more on the\nsample selection. Interestingly, the cumulative distributions of either\nnon-evolving luminosities or redshifts are found to be also determined by the\nsample selection rather than the instrumental sensitivity. Nevertheless, the\nnon-evolving luminosities of our samples are similarly distributed with a\ncomparable break luminosity of $L_0\\sim10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

Most importantly, it is found that the burst rates violate\nthe star formation rate at low redshift, while both of them are good in\nagreement with each other in the higher-redshift regions as many authors\ndiscovered previously.

This work investigates the\nresilience of the content protection systems of the four biggest music\nstreaming services (by subscriber base) from India, namely Airtel Wynk, Ganna,\nJioSaavn and Hungama. By considering the Digital Rights Management (DRM) system\nemployed by Spotify as a benchmark, we analyse the security of these platforms\nby attempting to steal the streamed content efficiently. Finally, we present a\nholistic overview of the flaws in their security mechanisms and discuss\npossible mitigation strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nconstitutes the first attempt to analyze security of OTT music services from\nIndia. Our results further confirm the time tested belief that security through\nobscurity is not a long term solution and leaves such platforms open to piracy\nand a subsequent loss of revenue for all the stakeholders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 14:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Recently, self-supervised contrastive\nlearning has gained increasing attention for its effectiveness in unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. The main idea of instance contrastive learning is to\nmatch a same instance in different augmented views. However, the relationship\nbetween different instances has not been fully explored in previous contrastive\nmethods, especially for instance-level contrastive loss.

Also, an electromagnetic counterpart was detected at\nmany wavebands from radio to gamma rays marking the begin of a new\nmulti-messenger era involving gravitational waves. We describe how\nmulti-messenger observations of GW170817 are employed to constrain the nuclear\nequation of state. Combining the information from the optical emission and the\nmass measurement through gravitational waves leads to a lower limit on neutron\nstar radii. According to this conservative analysis, which employs a minimum\nset of assumptions, the radii of neutron stars with typical masses should be\nlarger than about 10.7~km. This implies a lower limit on the tidal\ndeformability of about 210, while much stronger lower bounds are not supported\nby the data of GW170817. The multi-messenger interpretation of GW170817 rules\nout very soft nuclear matter and complements the upper bounds on NS radii which\nare derived from the measurement of finite-size effects during the pre-merger\nphase.

These systems are dynamic on timescales of hours to years.\nThe observed variability can help us infer the physical processes that occur in\nthe circumstellar environment. We aim at understanding the dynamics of the\nmagnetic interaction between the star and the inner accretion disk in young\nstellar objects. We present the case of the young stellar system V2129 Oph,\nwhich is a well-known T Tauri star. We performed a time series analysis of this\nstar using high-resolution spectroscopic data at optical and infrared\nwavelengths from CFHT/ESPaDOnS, ESO/HARPS and CFHT/SPIRou. The new data sets\nallowed us to characterize the accretion-ejection structure in this system and\nto investigate its evolution over a timescale of a decade via comparisons to\nprevious observational data. We measure radial velocity variations and recover\na stellar rotation period of 6.53d. However, we do not recover the stellar\nrotation period in the variability of various circumstellar lines, such as\nH$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ in the optical or HeI 1083nm and Pa$\\beta$ in the\ninfrared. Instead, we show that the optical and infrared line profile\nvariations are consistent with a magnetospheric accretion scenario that shows\nvariability with a period of about 6.0d, shorter than the stellar rotation\nperiod. Additionally, we find a period of 8.5d in H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines,\nprobably due to a structure located beyond the corotation radius, at a distance\nof 0.09au. We investigate whether this could be accounted for by a wind\ncomponent, twisted or multiple accretion funnel flows, or an external\ndisturbance in the inner disk. We conclude that the dynamics of the\naccretion-ejection process can vary significantly on a timescale of just a few\nyears, presumably reflecting the evolving magnetic field topology at the\nstellar surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 14:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a\nfundamental limitation on the measurement of the product of incompatible\nobservables, a `joint' measurement. However, recently a method using weak\nmeasurement has experimentally demonstrated joint measurement. This method\n[Lundeen, J. S., and Bamber, C. Phys. Rev.

A drawback of this method is that it requires coupling each\nobservable to a distinct degree of freedom (DOF), i.e., a disjoint Hilbert\nspace. Typically, this `read-out' system is an unused internal DOF of the\nmeasured particle. Unfortunately, one quickly runs out of internal DOFs, which\nlimits the number of observables and types of measurements one can make. To\naddress this limitation, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a technique\nto perform a joint weak-measurement of two incompatible observables using only\none DOF as a read-out system.

Both HHO methods hinge on a\nstabilization in the spirit of Lehrenfeld--Sch\\\"oberl for second-order PDEs.\nThe cell unknowns are polynomials of order $(k+2)$ that can be eliminated\nlocally by means of static condensation. The face unknowns approximating the\ntrace of the solution on the mesh (inter)faces are polynomials of order $(k+1)$\nin the first HHO method which is valid in dimension two and uses an original\nstabilization involving the canonical hybrid finite element, and they are of\norder $(k+2)$ for the second HHO method which is valid in arbitrary dimension\nand uses only $L^2$-orthogonal projections in the stabilization. A comparative\ndiscussion with the weak Galerkin methods from the literature is provided,\nhighlighting the close connections and the improvements proposed herein.\nAdditionally, we show how the two HHO methods can be combined with a\nNitsche-like boundary-penalty technique to weakly enforce the boundary\nconditions. An originality in the devised Nitsche's technique is to avoid any\npenalty parameter that must be large enough. Finally, numerical results\nshowcase the efficiency of the proposed methods and indicate that the HHO\nmethods can generally outperform discontinuous Galerkin methods and even be\ncompetitive with $C^0$-interior penalty methods on triangular meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 14:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 17:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

We present a\nnovel shape signature for 2D bounded simply-connected domains, named the\nHarmonic Beltrami signature (HBS). The proposed signature is based on the\nharmonic extension of the conformal welding map of a unit circle and its\nBeltrami coefficient. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between\nthe quotient space of HBS and the space of 2D simply-connected shapes up to a\ntranslation, rotation and scaling. With a suitable normalization, each\nequivalence class in the quotient space of HBS is associated to a unique\nrepresentative. It gets rid of the conformal ambiguity. As such, each shape is\nassociated to a unique HBS. Conversely, the associated shape of a HBS can be\nreconstructed based on quasiconformal Teichmuller theories, which is uniquely\ndetermined up to a translation, rotation and scaling. The HBS is thus an\neffective fingerprint to represent a 2D shape. The robustness of HBS is studied\nboth theoretically and experimentally. With the HBS, simple metric, such as L2,\ncan be used to measure geometric dissimilarity between shapes. Experiments have\nbeen carried out to classify shapes in different classes using HBS.

In\nconventional planning decision making, shorter-term (e.g., hourly) variations\nare not explicitly accounted for. However, given the deepening penetration of\nvariable resources, it is becoming imperative to consider such shorter-term\nvariation in the longer-term planning exercise. By leveraging the abundant\namount of operational observation data, we propose a scenario-based robust\nplanning framework that provides rigorous guarantees on the future operation\nrisk of planning decisions considering a broad range of operational conditions,\nsuch as renewable generation fluctuations and load variations. By connecting\ntwo-stage robust optimization with the scenario approach theory, we show that\nwith a carefully chosen number of scenarios, the operational risk level of the\nrobust solution can be adaptive to the risk preference set by planners. The\ntheoretical guarantees hold true for any distributions, and the proposed\napproach is scalable towards real-world power grids. Furthermore, the\ncolumn-and-constraint generation algorithm is used to solve the two-stage\nrobust planning problem and tighten theoretical guarantees.

A major challenge in performing\nhigh-fidelity simulations of such flows resides in the stringent requirements\nfor the numerical schemes to be used. These must be robust enough to handle\nstrong, unsteady discontinuities, while ensuring low amounts of intrinsic\ndissipation in smooth flow regions. Furthermore, the wide range of temporal and\nspatial active scales leads to concurrent needs for numerical stabilization and\naccurate representation of the smallest resolved flow scales in cases of\nunder-resolved configurations.

In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to perform nonparametric feature selection for both regression and\nclassification problems. In this framework, we learn prediction functions\nthrough empirical risk minimization over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.\nThe space is generated by a novel tensor product kernel which depends on a set\nof parameters that determine the importance of the features. Computationally,\nwe minimize the empirical risk with a penalty to estimate the prediction and\nkernel parameters at the same time.

In this paper, we investigate the responses of broad\nemission lines (BELs) to the continuum variations for these quasars under two\nBBH scenarios, and check whether they can be distinguished from each other and\nfrom that of a single BH system. We assume a simple circumbinary broad-line\nregion (BLR) model, compatible with BLR size estimates, with a standard\n$\\Gamma$ distribution of BLR clouds.

Two\nsubjects are presented in the manuscript, both aiming at studying the effect of\nthe spin of elementary particles on otherwise known theories.\n  First is a study of the L\\'evy-Leblond-Newton (LLN) equation, which is used\nto describe the evolution of a quantum system with spin 1/2 that is coupled to\nits own gravitational potential. After reviewing some symmetries of non\nrelativistic Quantum Mechanics, and how to geometrize them with the help of\nBargmann structures, we recall what is the L\\'evy-Leblond equation. In this\nchapter, the LLN equation is described in a fully covariant way on Bargmann\nstructures. This covariant formulation then helps to derive the dynamical\nsymmetries of the equation, and conserved quantities. The symmetry group of\nthis equation turns out to be the already known Schr\\\"odinger-Newton group.\n  The second part deals with the trajectory of particles with spin in General\nRelativity. We first highlight Souriau's geometric method to derive the\nMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, and then discuss the different\npossible Spin Supplementary Conditions (SSC) that exist to close the system of\nMPD equations. In this chapter, we assume the Tulczyjew SSC to describe the\ntrajectory of photons, leading to the Souriau-Saturnini equations. We then\npresent some works where we have applied these equations, in a Schwarzschild\nspacetime, and in a spacetime deformed by a gravitational wave. In the first\nwork, we found gravitational birefringence: the trajectory deviates from the\ngeodesic plane, depending on the helicity of the photon and its wavelength. The\nsecond work presented also found birefringence in gravitational interferometry\nexperiments, however the effect is many orders of magnitude lower than what we\ncan detect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 21:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

In this paper, we present a new\nsystem for solving the second sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new\ngeometric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions\nformed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone\ngraph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies\nbetween them. Zone graphs allow us to tractably work with industry-standard CAD\noperations, unlike prior work using CSG with parametric primitives. We focus on\nCAD programs consisting of sketch + extrude + Boolean operations, which are\ncommon in CAD practice. We phrase our problem as search in the space of such\nextrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to\nscore potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search.
