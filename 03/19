We conjecture\nthat it may occur in disturbed honeycomb lattices where both spin degeneracy\nand time reversal symmetry are broken. These configurations harbor two distinct\ngap-opening mechanisms that, when occurring simultaneously, drive slightly\ndifferent gaps in each valley, causing a net anomalous conductivity when the\nchemical potential is tuned to be between the distinct gaps.

This article breaks down and analyzes the main factors that\ninfluence the environmental footprint of FL policies compared with classical\nCL/Big-Data algorithms running in data centers. The proposed analytical\nframework takes into account both learning and communication energy costs, as\nwell as the carbon equivalent emissions; in addition, it models both vanilla\nand decentralized FL policies driven by consensus.

On the other hand, all FL policies\nare slower to converge when local data are unevenly distributed (often 2x\nslower than CL).

The resulting spatiotemporal variations are analyzed between the\ndifferent cases using unsteady statistics, $x-t$ diagrams, spectral analysis,\nand modal decomposition. A cavity of length to depth ratio $[L/D]=2$ at a\nfreestream Mach number of $M_\\infty = 1.71$ is considered to be in a confined\npassage. Impinging shock strength is controlled by changing the ramp angle\n($\\theta$) on the top-wall. The static pressure ratio across the impinging\nshock ($p_2/p_1$) is used to quantify the impinging shock strength. Five\ndifferent impinging shock strengths are studied by changing the pressure ratio:\n$1.0,1.2,1.5,1.7$ and $2.0$. As the pressure ratio increases from 1.0 to 2.0,\nthe cavity wall experiences a maximum pressure of 25% due to shock loading. At\n[$p_2/p_1]=1.5$, fundamental fluidic mode or Rossiter's frequency corresponding\nto $n=1$ mode vanishes whereas frequencies correspond to higher modes ($n=2$\nand $4$) resonate. Wavefronts interaction from the longitudinal reflections\ninside the cavity with the transverse disturbances from the shock-shear layer\ninteractions is identified to drive the strong resonant behavior. Due to\nMach-reflections inside the confined passage at $[p_2/p_1]=2.0$, shock-cavity\nresonance is lost.

Initially, each\nagent has one of $k$ different opinions. Agents choose random interaction\npartners and revise their state according to a fixed transition function,\ndepending on their own state and the state of the interaction partners. The\ngoal is to reach a consensus configuration in which all agents agree on the\nsame opinion, and if there is initially a sufficiently large bias towards one\nopinion, that opinion should prevail.\n  We analyze a synchronized variant of the undecided state dynamics defined as\nfollows. The agents act in phases, consisting of a decision and a boosting\npart. In the decision part, any agent that encounters an agent with a different\nopinion becomes undecided. In the boosting part, undecided agents adopt the\nfirst opinion they encounter.\n  We consider this dynamics in the population model and the gossip model.

In this\npaper, we study the challenging problem of inference over temporal knowledge\ngraphs. In particular, the task of temporal link prediction.

We propose Chronological Rotation embedding\n(ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations,\nand time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and\nversatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model\nlearns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and\ntime, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the\nrotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high\ndimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich\ninteraction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a\nTemporal Knowledge Graph. Experimentally, we show that ChronoR is able to\noutperform many of the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets for\ntemporal knowledge graph link prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 17:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

However, it usually experiences significantly altered\ndynamics due to loss of degrees of freedom upon coarse-graining. To establish\nCG models that can faithfully preserve dynamics, previous efforts mainly\nfocused on equilibrium systems. In contrast, various soft matter systems are\nknown out of equilibrium. Therefore, the present work concerns non-equilibrium\nsystems and enables accurate and efficient CG modeling that preserves\nnon-equilibrium dynamics and is generally applicable to any non-equilibrium\nprocess and any observable of interest. To this end, the dynamic equation of a\nCG variable is built in the form of the non-stationary generalized Langevin\nequation (nsGLE) to account for the dependence of non-equilibrium processes on\nthe initial conditions, where the two-time memory kernel is determined from the\ndata of the two-time auto-correlation function of the non-equilibrium\ntrajectory-averaged observable of interest. By embedding the non-stationary\nnon-Markovian process in an extended stochastic framework, an explicit form of\nthe non-stationary random noise in the nsGLE is introduced, and the cost is\nsignificantly reduced for solving the nsGLE to predict the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of the CG variable. To prove and exploit the equivalence of the nsGLE\nand extended dynamics, the memory kernel is parameterized in a two-time\nexponential expansion. A data-driven hybrid optimization process is proposed\nfor the parameterization, a non-convex and high-dimensional optimization\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 17:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 15:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

Our first filter is\nbased on the direct mathematical manipulation of the multi-sensor, multi-object\nBayes filter's posterior distribution. Unfortunately, it requires the division\nof probability distributions and its extension beyond linear Gaussian\napplications is not obvious. Our second filter is based on geometric average\nfusion and it approximates the multi-sensor, multi-object Bayes filter's\nposterior distribution using the geometric average of each sensor's\nmeasurement-updated distribution. This filter can be used under non-linear\nconditions; however, it is not as accurate as our first filter. In both cases,\nwe approximate the LMB filter's measurement update using an existing loopy\nbelief propagation algorithm. Both filters have a constant complexity in the\nnumber of sensors, and linear complexity in both number of measurements and\nobjects. This is an improvement on an iterated-corrector LMB (IC-LMB) filter,\nwhich has linear complexity in the number of sensors. The proposed filters are\nof interest when tracking many objects using several sensors, where filter\nrun-time is more important than filter accuracy.

In this PhD project, I aim to determine if lightning on exoplanets\nand brown dwarfs can be more energetic than it is known from Solar System\nplanets, what are the most promising signatures to look for, and if these\n\"exo-lightning\" signatures can be detected from Earth.\n  This thesis focuses on three major topics. First I discuss a lightning\nclimatology study of Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. I apply the obtained\nlightning statistics to extrasolar planets in order to give a first estimate on\nlightning occurrence on exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Next, I introduce a short\nstudy of potential lightning activity on the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, based on\nprevious radio observations. Related to this, I discuss a first estimate of\nobservability of lightning from close brown dwarfs, with the optical Danish\nTelescope. The final part of my project focuses on a lightning radio model,\nwhich is applied to study the energy and radio power released from lightning\ndischarges in hot giant gas planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. The released\nenergy determines the observability of signatures, and the effect lightning has\non the local atmosphere of the object.\n  This work combines knowledge obtained from planetary and earth sciences and\nuses that to learn more about extrasolar systems. My main results show that\nlightning on exoplanets may be more energetic than in the Solar System,\nsupporting the possibility of future observations and detection of lightning\nactivity on an extrasolar body.

In this work we present a system that can augment a conventional\nscanner with pTx, in particular for use in interventional MRI for guidewire\nsafety. Methods: The pTx system was designed to work in-line with a 1.5T MRI\nwhile the RF synthesis and imaging control was maintained on the host MR\nscanner. The add on pTx system relies on the RF transmit signal, unblanking\npulse, and a protocol driven trigger from the scanner.

Those two types of services introduce strict,\nand in some time conflicting, resource allocation requirements that may result\nin a power-struggle between reliability, latency, and resource utilization in\nwireless networks. The difficulty in addressing that challenge could be traced\nback to the predominant reactive approach in allocating the wireless resources.\nThis allocation operation is carried out based on received service requests and\nglobal network statistics, which may not incorporate a sense of\n\\textit{proaction}. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework termed\n\\textit{service identification} to develop novel proactive resource allocation\nalgorithms.

The\nultimate objective of this framework is to equip future wireless networks with\nthe ability to analyze user behavior, anticipate incoming services, and perform\nproactive resource allocation.

In this work,\nwe investigate regression into the latent space as a probe to understand the\ncompositional properties of GANs. We find that combining the regressor and a\npretrained generator provides a strong image prior, allowing us to create\ncomposite images from a collage of random image parts at inference time while\nmaintaining global consistency. To compare compositional properties across\ndifferent generators, we measure the trade-offs between reconstruction of the\nunrealistic input and image quality of the regenerated samples. We find that\nthe regression approach enables more localized editing of individual image\nparts compared to direct editing in the latent space, and we conduct\nexperiments to quantify this independence effect.

A\nflurry of recent work has asked: why do deep networks not overfit to their\ntraining data? In this work, we make a series of empirical observations that\ninvestigate and extend the hypothesis that deeper networks are inductively\nbiased to find solutions with lower effective rank embeddings. We conjecture\nthat this bias exists because the volume of functions that maps to low\neffective rank embedding increases with depth. We show empirically that our\nclaim holds true on finite width linear and non-linear models on practical\nlearning paradigms and show that on natural data, these are often the solutions\nthat generalize well. We then show that the simplicity bias exists at both\ninitialization and after training and is resilient to hyper-parameters and\nlearning methods.

A sample of 1969 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) at a redshift\n0 < z < 0.49, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to be local\nanalogues of high-redshift galaxies, was used to analyze their most prominent\nemission lines and to derive total oxygen abundances and nitrogen-to-oxygen\nratios following the direct method in the ranges 7.7 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.6 and\n-1.8 < log(N/O) < -0.8.

Diffraction-efficiency testing of sub-micron grating prototypes\ncoated with gold shows that TASTE is capable of meeting Lynx requirements for\nspectral sensitivity, with room for improvement at small groove periods, and\nthat while SCIL offers a promising avenue for Lynx grating production, imprints\nsuffer a small blaze-angle reduction due to resist shrinkage.

The three feature extraction architectures are\ncompared with the previously used Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and linear\nfeature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 2DPCA.\nUnsupervised clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. The results\nshow the superiority of DCT-based method, entropy-based method, and CVAE\nfeatures compared to CAE, PCA, and 2DPCA, with more than 5\\%-20\\% average\naccuracy. In regards to computation time, the two proposed methods are\nnoticeably much faster than the existing CVAE. Furthermore, for\nhigh-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold learning techniques are\nconsidered. The methods are compared for the projection of raw data as well as\nthe encoded CVAE features. All three methods show an improved visualisation\nability when applied to the encoded CVAE features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 18:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 18:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

The majority\ndisplay spectra with exponential cutoffs in a narrow range around a few GeV.\nModels predicted cutoffs up to 100 GeV; it was therefore not expected that\npulsars would be visible in the very-high-energy ($>$100 GeV) regime.\nSubsequent surprise discoveries by ground-based telescopes of pulsed emission\nfrom four pulsars above tens of GeV have marked the beginning of a new era,\nraising important questions about the electrodynamics and local environment of\npulsar magnetospheres. Detection of the Vela pulsar by H.E.S.S. (20-120 GeV)\nand Fermi provides evidence for a curved spectrum.

The model reproduces the decrease of flux\nof the first light-curve peak relative to the second one, evolution of the\nbridge emission, near constant phase positions of peaks, and narrowing of\npulses with increasing energy. We can fundamentally explain the first of these\ntrends, since I found that the curvature radii of the particle trajectories in\nregions where the second $\\gamma$-ray light curve peak originates are\nsystematically larger than those associated with the first peak, implying a\ncorrespondingly larger cutoff for the second peak.

Recent studies have shown that retrograde orbits\ncan also be produced via scattering by dense clumps, which are often present in\nthe early stages of a galaxy's evolution. However, so far it has been unclear\nwhether other internally-driven mechanisms, such as bars, are also capable of\ndriving retrograde motion. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the\nefficiencies with which bars and clumps produce retrograde orbits in disc\ngalaxies. We do this by comparing the retrograde fractions and the spatial\ndistributions of the retrograde populations in four $N$-body$+$smooth particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of isolated disc galaxies spanning a range of\nevolutionary behaviours. We find that both bars and clumps are capable of\ngenerating significant retrograde populations of order $\\sim 10\\%$ of all\nstars. We also find that while clump-driven retrograde stars may be found at\nlarge galactocentric radii, bar-driven retrograde stars remain in the vicinity\nof the bar, even if the bar dissolves. Consequently, we find that retrograde\nstars in the Solar Neighbourhood in the clumpy models are exclusively\nclump-driven, but this is a trace population, constituting $0.01-0.04\\%$ of the\ntotal stellar population in this region. Finally, we find that neither bars\n(including dissolving ones) nor clumps in the models are able to produce\nrotationally supported counter-rotating discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 20:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

Autonomous\ninteractions in such environments require integrating dexterous manipulation\nand fluid mobility. While mobile manipulators in different form factors provide\nan extended workspace, their real-world adoption has been limited. Executing a\nhigh-level task for general objects requires a perceptual understanding of the\nobject as well as adaptive whole-body control among dynamic obstacles. In this\npaper, we propose a two-stage architecture for autonomous interaction with\nlarge articulated objects in unknown environments. The first stage,\nobject-centric planner, only focuses on the object to provide an\naction-conditional sequence of states for manipulation using RGB-D data. The\nsecond stage, agent-centric planner, formulates the whole-body motion control\nas an optimal control problem that ensures safe tracking of the generated plan,\neven in scenes with moving obstacles. We show that the proposed pipeline can\nhandle complex static and dynamic kitchen settings for both wheel-based and\nlegged mobile manipulators. Compared to other agent-centric planners, our\nproposed planner achieves a higher success rate and a lower execution time. We\nalso perform hardware tests on a legged mobile manipulator to interact with\nvarious articulated objects in a kitchen.

The negative correlation also persists\nwhen considering different ranges of luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington\nratio. We discuss how this correlation might be either due to the angle\ndependence of the Thomson cross-section or to more obscured sources having a\nhigher covering factor of the torus.

Neural field theory is a population-level approach to modelling the\nnon-linear dynamics of large populations of neurons, while maintaining a degree\nof mathematical tractability. This class of models provides a solid theoretical\nperspective on fundamental processes of neural tissue such as state transitions\nbetween different brain activities as observed during epilepsy or sleep.\nVarious anatomical, physiological, and mathematical assumptions are essential\nfor deriving a minimal set of equations that strike a balance between\nbiophysical realism and mathematical tractability. However, these assumptions\nare not always made explicit throughout the literature. Even though neural\nfield models (NFMs) first appeared in the literature in the early 1970's, the\nrelationships between them have not been systematically addressed. This may\npartially be explained by the fact that the inter-dependencies between these\nmodels are often implicit and non-trivial. Herein we provide a review of key\nstages of the history and development of neural field theory and contemporary\nuses of this branch of mathematical neuroscience.

These active sensing platforms operate in unsteady fluid flows,\nincluding windy urban environments, hurricanes, and ocean currents. Often\nconstrained in their actuation capabilities, the dynamics of these mobile\nsensors depend strongly on the background flow, making their deployment and\ncontrol particularly challenging. Therefore, efficient trajectory planning with\npartial knowledge about the background flow is essential for teams of mobile\nsensors to adaptively sense and monitor their environments. In this work, we\ninvestigate the use of finite-horizon model predictive control (MPC) for the\nenergy-efficient trajectory planning of an active mobile sensor in an unsteady\nfluid flow field. We uncover connections between the finite-time optimal\ntrajectories and finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) of the background flow,\nconfirming that energy-efficient trajectories exploit invariant coherent\nstructures in the flow.

We\npresent an exhaustive search through critical MPC parameters including the\nprediction horizon, maximum sensor actuation, and relative penalty on the\naccumulated state error and actuation effort. We find that even relatively\nshort prediction horizons can often yield nearly energy-optimal trajectories.\nThese results are promising for the adaptive planning of energy-efficient\ntrajectories for swarms of mobile sensors in distributed sensing and\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 22:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

ICT projects continue to fail; as a result, while research\nin ICT project management has indeed increased, many challenges for research\nand practice remain. Many studies have addressed the execution and management\nof ICT projects and the many factors that might relate to project outcomes.\nVery few, however, have considered ICT project initiation and the crucial\ndecisions made at that very early, pre-life cycle stage. The primary intent of\nthis research is therefore to investigate ICT projects with a particular focus\non their initiation. In doing so we wished to understand why ICT projects are\nstarted, and how they are moved from idea or proposal to supported reality. A\ncombination of semi-structured interviews and the repertory grid data\ncollection and analysis method was employed to investigate and validate the\nmotivating factors that influence individual IT Managers' project initiation\ndecisions and the methods they use to transition from idea to enacted project.\nOur results showed that there are indeed multiple underlying reasons for the\ndecisions made at this early stage and that there are some especially common\ndecision drivers. Some were expected, in the sense that they mapped to\nrecommended best practice. For instance, most projects are motivated by a\ndesire to achieve efficiencies or cost savings, and their potential tends to be\nassessed using cost benefit analysis. Other results were more surprising -\ncompetitor pressure was not a common driver for ICT project initiation in our\nanalysis. Unsurprisingly, formal evaluation methods are more frequently used to\nassess project proposals when those projects are larger and higher profile.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 23:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

Researchers rely heavily on computer\nsimulations to explore the design space in search of high-performing\nimplosions. However, ICF multiphysics codes must make simplifying assumptions,\nand thus deviate from experimental measurements for complex implosions. For\nmore effective design and investigation, simulations require input from past\nexperimental data to better predict future performance. In this work, we\ndescribe a cognitive simulation method for combining simulation and\nexperimental data into a common, predictive model. This method leverages a\nmachine learning technique called transfer learning, the process of taking a\nmodel trained to solve one task, and partially retraining it on a sparse\ndataset to solve a different, but related task. In the context of ICF design,\nneural network models trained on large simulation databases and partially\nretrained on experimental data, producing models that are far more accurate\nthan simulations alone.

By viewing the function as an infinite-dimensional nuisance\nparameter, a semiparametric formulation of this problem poses daunting\nchallenges, both methodologically and theoretically, as (i) the number of local\nextrema may be unknown, and (ii) the induced shape constraints associated with\nlocal extrema are highly irregular. In this article, we build upon a\nderivative-constrained Gaussian process prior recently proposed by Yu et al.\n(2022) to derive what we call an encompassing approach that indexes possibly\nmultiple local extrema by a single parameter. We provide closed-form\ncharacterization of the posterior distribution and study its large sample\nbehavior under this unconventional encompassing regime.

Being a key\ncomponent of such a network, the correlation layer is updated online together\nwith other parts of the network. Yet, when facing serious disturbance, fused\ntrackers may still drift away from the target completely due to accumulated\nerrors. To address these issues, we propose a coarse-to-fine tracking\nframework, which roughly infers the target state via an online-updating DCF\nmodule first and subsequently, finely locates the target through an\noffline-training asymmetric siamese network (ASN). Benefitting from the\nguidance of DCF and the learned channel weights obtained through exploiting the\ngiven ground-truth template, ASN refines feature representation and implements\nprecise target localization. Systematic experiments on five popular tracking\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed DCF-ASN achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance while exhibiting good tracking efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 03:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

Using X-ray computed tomography (CT) to characterize\nTRISO particles is challenging because of the strong attenuation of the X-ray\nbeam by the uranium core leading to severe photon starvation in a substantial\nfraction of the measurements. Furthermore, the overall acquisition time for a\nhigh-resolution CT scan can be very long when using conventional lab-based\nX-ray systems and reconstruction algorithms. Specifically, when analytic\nmethods like the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is used for\nreconstruction, it results in severe streaks artifacts and noise in the\ncorresponding 3D volume which make subsequent analysis of the particles\nchallenging. In this article, we develop and apply model-based image\nreconstruction (MBIR) algorithms for improving the quality of CT\nreconstructions for TRISO particles in order to facilitate better\ncharacterization. We demonstrate that the proposed MBIR algorithms can\nsignificantly suppress artifacts with minimal pre-processing compared to the\nconventional approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed MBIR approach\ncan obtain high-quality reconstruction compared to the FDK approach even when\nusing a fraction of the typically acquired measurements, thereby enabling\ndramatically faster measurement times for TRISO particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 04:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

A typical workflow involves acquiring\nprojection images of a collection of randomly oriented particles, picking and\nclassifying individual particle projections by orientation, and finally using\nthe individual particle projections to reconstruct a 3D map of the electron\ndensity profile. The reconstruction is challenging because of the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the data, the unknown orientation of the particles,\nand the sparsity of data especially when dealing with flexible proteins where\nthere may not be sufficient data corresponding to each class to obtain an\naccurate reconstruction using standard algorithms.

Our method casts the reconstruction as minimizing a cost\nfunction involving a novel forward model term that accounts for the contrast\ntransfer function of the microscope, the orientation of the particles and the\ncenter of rotation offsets. We combine the forward model term with a\nregularizer that enforces desirable properties in the volume to be\nreconstructed.

In robotics, this is\nparticularly difficult because actions usually have several possible results,\nand sensors are prone to produce measurements with error. Partially observable\nMarkov decision processes (POMDPs) are commonly employed, thanks to their\ncapacity to model the uncertainty of actions that modify and monitor the state\nof a system. However, since solving a POMDP is computationally expensive, their\nusage becomes prohibitive for most robotic applications. In this paper, we\npropose a task planning architecture for service robotics. In the context of\nservice robot design, we present a scheme to encode knowledge about the robot\nand its environment, that promotes the modularity and reuse of information.\nAlso, we introduce a new recursive definition of a POMDP that enables our\narchitecture to autonomously build a hierarchy of POMDPs, so that it can be\nused to generate and execute plans that solve the task at hand. Experimental\nresults show that, in comparison to baseline methods, by following a recursive\nhierarchical approach the architecture is able to significantly reduce the\nplanning time, while maintaining (or even improving) the robustness under\nseveral scenarios that vary in uncertainty and size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 05:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 17:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

In this paper, we present a novel channel\nenhancement feature pyramid network (CE-FPN) with three simple yet effective\nmodules to alleviate these problems. Specifically, inspired by sub-pixel\nconvolution, we propose a sub-pixel skip fusion method to perform both channel\nenhancement and upsampling. Instead of the original 1x1 convolution and linear\nupsampling, it mitigates the information loss due to channel reduction. Then we\npropose a sub-pixel context enhancement module for extracting more feature\nrepresentations, which is superior to other context methods due to the\nutilization of rich channel information by sub-pixel convolution. Furthermore,\na channel attention guided module is introduced to optimize the final\nintegrated features on each level, which alleviates the aliasing effect only\nwith a few computational burdens.

The Gittins index policy is known to be the optimal\npreemptive nonanticipating policy (both for the open version of the problem\nwith Poisson arrivals and the closed version without arrivals) minimizing the\nexpected holding costs. While the Gittins index is thoroughly characterized for\nordinary jobs whose state is described by the attained service, it is not at\nall the case with jobs that have more complex structure. Recently, a class of\nsuch jobs, the multistage jobs, were introduced, and it was shown that the\ncomputation of Gittins index of a multistage job reduces into separable\ncomputations for the individual stages. The characterization is, however,\nindirect in the sense that it relies on the recursion for an auxiliary function\n(so called SJP function) and not for the Gittins index itself. In this paper,\nwe answer the natural question: Is it possible to compute the Gittins index for\na multistage job more directly by recursively combining the Gittins indexes of\nits individual stages? According to our results, it seems to be possible, at\nleast, for sequential multistage jobs that have a fixed (deterministic)\nsequence of stages. We prove this for sequential two-stage jobs that have\nmonotonous hazard rates in both stages, but our numerical experiments give an\nindication that the result could possibly be generalized to any sequential\nmultistage jobs.

The recent models explore the integration of external\nknowledge resources such as Unified Modeling Language class diagrams to improve\nthe generated comments. In this paper, we propose API2Com, a model that\nleverages the Application Programming Interface Documentations (API Docs) as a\nknowledge resource for comment generation. The API Docs include the description\nof the methods in more details and therefore, can provide better context in the\ngenerated comments.

For methods that only contain one API, adding API Docs improves the\nresults by 4% BLEU score on average (BLEU score is an automatic evaluation\nmetric used in machine translation). However, as the number of APIs that are\nused in a method increases, the performance of the model in generating comments\ndecreases due to long documentations used in the input.

In this paper, we propose a feature detection\nmethod by projecting a 3D point cloud to form an image and apply the\nvision-based feature detection technique.

For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach i.e. nearest\nkey-frames detection and loop candidate verification by matching features\nextracted from rasterized LIDAR images. Furthermore, we utilize a key-frame\nstructure to achieve a lightweight SLAM system. The proposed system is\nevaluated with implementation on the KITTI dataset and the University of\nMichigan Ford Campus dataset.

Hence, tuning these parameters is an important problem.\nExisting generic hyper-parameter tuning methods require multiple expensive\ncalls to a QUBO solver, making them impractical for performance critical\napplications when repeated solutions of similar combinatorial optimisation\nproblems are required.

The new semantics are conflict-free, non-admissible\nbut employing a weaker notion of admissibility; they allow reinstatement and\nthey retain the majority of properties of complete semantics. We show how both\nweakly complete and Dung's complete semantics can be generated by applying\ndifferent undecidedness blocking strategies, making undecidedness blocking a\nunifying mechanism underlying argumentation semantics.

The Na at Cu impurity in its +1 charge state contributes to this. In\nGa-poor growth conditions, on the other hand, the formation energies of Cu\nvacancies and Ga at Cu antisites are comparatively too high for any significant\ninfluence on carrier density or on the equilibrium Fermi level position. Thus,\nunder these conditions, the Cu at Ga antisites give rise to a $p$-type grain\nboundary. Also, their formation energy is lower than the formation energy of Na\nat Cu impurities.

Effective Lagrangian and nonlinear dynamic equations are\nderived for a two-sublattice ferrimagnet taking into account both spin-torques\nand external magnetic field. The dynamics of the DW before and after the Walker\nbreakdown is calculated for any direction of the spin current polarization. It\nis shown that for the in-plane polarization of the spin current, the DW\nmobility reaches a maximum near the temperature of the angular momentum\ncompensation. For the out-of-plane spin polarization, in contrast, a spin\ncurrent with the densities below the Walker breakdown does not excite the\ndynamics of the DW.

Their practical\napplication requires accurate modelling of the acquisition setup: the spatial\nlocation, orientation, and impulse response of each ultrasound transducer.\nHowever, existing calibration methods fail to accurately characterise these\ntransducers unless their size can be considered negligible when compared to the\ndominant wavelength, which reduces signal-to-noise ratios below usable levels\nin the presence of high-contrast tissues such as the skull. In this paper, we\nintroduce a methodology that can simultaneously estimate the location,\norientation, and impulse response of the ultrasound transducers in a single\ncalibration. We do this by extending spatial response identification, an\nalgorithm that we have recently proposed to estimate transducer impulse\nresponses. Our proposed methodology replaces the transducers in the acquisition\ndevice with a surrogate model whose effective response matches the experimental\ndata by fitting a numerical model of wave propagation. This results in a\nflexible and robust calibration procedure that can accurately predict the\nbehaviour of the ultrasound acquisition device without ever having to know\nwhere the real transducers are or their individual impulse response.\nExperimental results using a ring acquisition system show that spatial response\nidentification produces calibrations of significantly higher quality than\nstandard methodologies across all transducers, both in transmission and in\nreception. Experimental full-waveform inversion reconstructions of a\ntissue-mimicking phantom demonstrate that spatial response identification\ngenerates more accurate reconstructions than those produced with standard\ncalibration techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 10:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 16:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

India also has the second largest\n(and an ever growing) digital footprint (Statista, 2020). Despite this, today's\nstate-of-the-art multilingual systems perform suboptimally on Indian (IN)\nlanguages. This can be explained by the fact that multilingual language models\n(LMs) are often trained on 100+ languages together, leading to a small\nrepresentation of IN languages in their vocabulary and training data.\nMultilingual LMs are substantially less effective in resource-lean scenarios\n(Wu and Dredze, 2020; Lauscher et al., 2020), as limited data doesn't help\ncapture the various nuances of a language. One also commonly observes IN\nlanguage text transliterated to Latin or code-mixed with English, especially in\ninformal settings (for example, on social media platforms) (Rijhwani et al.,\n2017). This phenomenon is not adequately handled by current state-of-the-art\nmultilingual LMs. To address the aforementioned gaps, we propose MuRIL, a\nmultilingual LM specifically built for IN languages. MuRIL is trained on\nsignificantly large amounts of IN text corpora only. We explicitly augment\nmonolingual text corpora with both translated and transliterated document\npairs, that serve as supervised cross-lingual signals in training. MuRIL\nsignificantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on all tasks in the\nchallenging cross-lingual XTREME benchmark (Hu et al., 2020). We also present\nresults on transliterated (native to Latin script) test sets of the chosen\ndatasets and demonstrate the efficacy of MuRIL in handling transliterated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 13:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Characterizing\nthe rigidity of the cells and their heterogeneity in a blood sample is thus a\nkey point in the understanding of occlusive phenomena, particularly in the case\nof erythrocytic diseases in which healthy cells coexist with pathological\ncells. However, measuring intracellular rheology in small biological\ncompartments requires the development of specific techniques. We propose a\ntechnique based on molecular rotors-viscosity-sensitive fluorescent probes-to\nevaluate the above key point. DASPI molecular rotor has been identified with\nspectral fluorescence properties decoupled from those of hemoglobin, the main\ncomponent of the cytosol. After validation of the rotor as a viscosity probe in\nmodel fluids, we showed by confocal microscopy that, in addition to binding to\nthe membrane, the rotor penetrates spontaneously and uniformly into red blood\ncells. Experiments conducted on temperature-stiffened red blood cells show that\nmolecular rotors can probe their overall rigidity. A simple model allowed us to\nseparate the contribution of the cytosol from that of the membrane, providing a\nquantification of cytosol rigidification with temperature, consistent with\nindependent measurements of the viscosity of hemoglobin solutions. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the rotor can be used to quantify the\nintracellular rheology of red blood cells at the cellular level, as well as the\nheterogeneity of this stiffness in a blood sample. This technique opens up new\npossibilities for biomedical applications, diagnosis and disease monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

However, due to domain\nshift, the model trained with one of the three scenarios in SCD has poor\ngeneralization ability when applied to the rest scenarios.

The full restoration\nof the electric infrastructure is not always simultaneously performed with the\nfull restoration of electric production. Here, we describe the electric\nproduction curves for the islands of Saint-Martin, Saint-Barthelemy, and Puerto\nRico in the Caribbean, where two major hurricanes occurred in 2017. After the\nmajor hurricanes, the electric energy production was characterised by a slow\nrecovery followed by a stable phase during several months, corresponding to\napproximately $75\\%$ of the initial electric production. A resilience time of\nseveral months (1 month $< t_s <$ 5 months) is necessary to attain the new\nelectric energy production equilibrium $E_{is}$, which is lower than the\ninitial electric energy production $E_i$. The reduction in electric energy\nconsumption per capita is of $20-25\\%$. In Saint-Martin, during the\npost-hurricane stable phase, the electric production was only approximately\n$60\\%$ of the initial electric energy production instead of $75\\%$. The\nreduction of 15 percent in the electric production of Saint-Martin after\nHurricane Irma could be attributed to the migration of approximately 8 000\ninhabitants (approximately $23\\%$) outside the island.

In this regard, this paper identifies the requirements of\nBCs for being GDPR compliant in BIoT use cases. Accordingly, an on-chain\nsolution is proposed that allows fine-grained modification (update and erasure)\noperations on TXs' data fields within a BC.

Accordingly, DFS is composed of two consecutive generators: an\naligned feature generator, transferring semantic and visual representations\ninto aligned features; a synthesized feature generator, producing diverse\nfeature samples of unseen classes in the aligned space. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments to verify the efficacy of DFS. Results demonstrate\nits effectiveness to generate diverse features for unseen classes, leading to\nsuperior performance on multiple benchmarks. Code will be released upon\nacceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 12:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

But what happens\nwhen we consider adolescents in a population where already adults have poor\nsleep quality and a very late chronotype?

The results show that in this\npopulation sleep quality is much poorer than in most other healthy populations\nrecorded elsewhere. Furthermore, sleep quality is consistently worse for\nadolescents than for the other groups. The difference with adults seems to be\ndue mainly to increased daytime sleepiness and sleep latency, whereas the\ndifference with preadolescents seems to be due mainly to shorter sleep\nduration. We also found that the chronotypes of all the groups are very late,\nwith a peak at an age between 18 and 24 ys.

While such fully automated approaches have\nproven successful in many application domains, there are situations where human\ninvolvement in the adaptation process is beneficial or even necessary. For such\n\"human-in-the-loop\" adaptive systems, two major challenges, namely transparency\nand controllability, have to be addressed to include the human in the\nself-adaptation loop. Transparency means that relevant context information\nabout the adaptive systems and its context is represented based on a digital\ntwin enabling the human an immersive and realistic view. Concerning\ncontrollability, the decision-making and adaptation operations should be\nmanaged in a natural and interactive way. As existing human-in-the-loop\nadaptation approaches do not fully cover these aspects, we investigate\nalternative human-in-the-loop strategies by using a combination of digital\ntwins and virtual reality (VR) interfaces.

But, when\nthese processes are executed on some computer platform, synchronisation leads\nto context switches of the processes and therefore an increased overhead, which\nmay lead to deadline misses. But, by combining processes we reduce the number\nof context switches and therefore reduce the overhead. We combine these\nprocesses by representing the processes by edge-labelled acyclic directed\nmulti-graphs, and multiply the graphs by the VRSP. Next, we transpose the\nresulting graphs into processes for which there are less context switches. An\nimportant aspect of these real-time applications is that they must execute in\ntime. Still, it may happen that the set of processes of the application cannot\nexecute timely and may miss a deadline. Now, by decomposing the graphs and\nmultiplying the graphs by the VRSP in another combination, the processes that\nare represented by these recombined graphs may execute in time. The\nrequirements of the recently introduced graph-decomposition theorems are too\nstrict and can be relaxed, whereby more graphs can be decomposed giving more\npossible combinations for the real-time application. Therefore, we recall the\ndefinition of the VRSP and the two graph-decomposition theorems, we relax the\nrequirements by stating and proving two lemmas and use these lemmas to state\nand prove these two (relaxed) graph-decomposition theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 13:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 23:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 22:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 12:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Meanwhile, current unsupervised detectors are unable to\ngenerate aligned keypoints with good coverage. In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised aligned keypoint detector, Skeleton Merger, which utilizes\nskeletons to reconstruct objects. It is based on an Autoencoder architecture.\nThe encoder proposes keypoints and predicts activation strengths of edges\nbetween keypoints. The decoder performs uniform sampling on the skeleton and\nrefines it into small point clouds with pointwise offsets. Then the activation\nstrengths are applied and the sub-clouds are merged. Composite Chamfer Distance\n(CCD) is proposed as a distance between the input point cloud and the\nreconstruction composed of sub-clouds masked by activation strengths. We\ndemonstrate that Skeleton Merger is capable of detecting semantically-rich\nsalient keypoints with good alignment, and shows comparable performance to\nsupervised methods on the KeypointNet dataset.

Such frictional cracks are commonly assumed to feature the universal\nsquare root near-edge singularity of ideal shear cracks, as predicted by Linear\nElastic Fracture Mechanics. Here we show that this is not the generic case due\nto the intrinsic dependence of the frictional strength on the slip rate, even\nif the bodies forming the frictional interface are identical and predominantly\nlinear elastic. Instead, frictional shear cracks feature unconventional\nsingularities characterized by a singularity order $\\xi$ that differs from the\nconventional $-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ one. It is shown that $\\xi$ depends on the\nfriction law, on the propagation speed and on the symmetry mode of loading. We\ndiscuss the general structure of a theory of unconventional singularities,\nalong with their implications for the energy balance and dynamics of frictional\ncracks. Finally, we present explicit calculations of $\\xi$ and the associated\nnear-edge fields for linear viscous-friction -- which may emerge as a\nperturbative approximation of nonlinear friction laws or on its own -- for both\nin-plane (mode-II) and anti-plane (mode-III) shear loadings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 14:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Although they have shown promising\npotentials for the future miniaturization of optics, the chromatic aberration\ninherited from their diffractive nature plagues them towards many practical\napplications. Current solutions for creating achromatic metalenses usually\nrequire searching through a large number of meta-atoms to find designs that\nfulfill not only phase but phase dispersion requirements, which leads to\nintensive design efforts. Besides, most designs are based on regular-shaped\nantennas driven by the designers' intuition and experience, hence only cover a\nlimited design space. Here, we present an inverse design approach that\nefficiently produces meta-atoms with unintuitive geometries required for\nbroadband achromatic metalenses. We restricted the generated shapes to hold\nfour-fold reflectional symmetry so that the resulting metalenses are\npolarization insensitive. In addition, meta-atoms generated by our method\ninheritably have round edges and corners, which make them\nnanofabrication-friendly. Our experimental characterization shows that our\nmetalenses exhibit superior performance over a broad bandwidth of 465 nm in the\nnear-infrared regime. Our method offers a fast and efficient way of designing\nhigh-performance achromatic metalenses and sheds new insights for unintuitive\ndesign of other metaphotonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 14:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

To\nstudy the correlation between thermal and nonthermal processes in stellar\nflares, we have searched the databases of Kepler (optical observations) and\nXMM-Newton (soft X-rays) for the flares observed simultaneously with both\ninstruments; nine distinctive flares (with energies exceeding $10^{33}$ erg) on\nthree stars (of K-M spectral classes) have been found. We have analyzed and\ncompared the flare parameters in the optical and X-ray spectral ranges; we have\nalso compared the obtained results with similar observations of solar flares.\nMost of the studied stellar flares released more energy in the optical range\nthan in X-rays. In one flare, X-ray emission strongly dominated, which could be\ncaused either by soft spectrum of energetic electrons or by a near-limb\nposition of this flare. The X-ray flares were typically delayed with respect to\nand shorter than their optical counterparts, which is partially consistent with\nthe Neupert effect.

In this paper, we first study\nthe clearing model under pro-rated payments of Eisenberg and Noe, and we derive\nnovel necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the clearing\npayments, valid for an arbitrary topology of the financial network. Then, we\nargue that the proportionality rule is one of the factors responsible for\ncascaded defaults, and that the overall system loss can be reduced if this rule\nis lifted. The proposed approach thus shifts the focus from the individual\ninterest to the overall system's interest to control and contain adverse\neffects of cascaded failures, and we show that clearing payments in this\nsetting can be computed by solving suitable convex optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 15:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 10:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Since 2016 (Berrut et al. 2016) a succession\nof studies (Bois et al. 2019) have traced infant mortality from organisms of\nhigh complexity (e.g. mammals) down to unicellular organisms. Infant mortality\nmay be considered as a filtering process through which organisms with\npotentially lethal congenital defects are eliminated. Such defects may have\nmany causes but here we focus particularly on mishaps resulting from\nnon-optimal conditions in the production of proteins, enzymes and other crucial\nmacromolecules. The statistical signature of infant mortality consists in a\nfalling age-specific death rate. The question we address here is whether infant\nmortality episodes take place in bacteria in the minutes precededing or\nfollowing cell division. It will be shown that while experiments carried out in\nthe 20th century tried but failed to detect such an effect (mostly because of\nlimited sample size), more recent observations provided consistent evidence of\na sizeable mortality, with a rate of the order of 0.7 per 1,000 per hour, in\nthe exponential growth phase of E. coli. A further crucial test will be to\nmeasure the age-specific, post-division death rate. An experiment is outlined\nfor that purpose. It is based on the selection of stained cells through flow\ncytometry and the derivation of their ages at death from their sizes. If an\ninfant mortality effect can be identified in E. coli it can be conjectured that\na similar effect also exists in other unicellular organisms, both prokaryote\nand eukaryote.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 22:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

This scientific gap mainly\nresults from the maneuver complexity on urban roads, making it difficult to\nmodel the platoon formation process. Inspired by flocking behaviors in nature,\nthis paper proposed a two-dimensional model to describe CAV group dynamics. The\nmodel is formulated based on potential fields in planar coordinates, which is\ncomposed of the inter-vehicle potential field and the cross-section potential\nfield. The inter-vehicle potential field enables CAVs to attract each other\nwhen vehicle gaps are larger than the equilibrium distance, and repel each\nother otherwise. It also generates incentives for lane change maneuvers to join\na platoon or to comply with the traffic management layer. The cross-section\npotential field is able to mimic lane keeping behavior and it also creates\nresistance to avoid unnecessary lane changes at very low incentives. These\nmodeling principles can also be applied to human-driven vehicles in the mixed\ntraffic environment.

Starting from an analytic procedure to check the\ndomino-tileability of the aperture, two multi-objective optimization techniques\nare derived to efficiently and effectively deal with small and medium/large\narrays depending on the values of the bounds for the cardinality of the\nsolution space of the admissible clustered solutions. A set of representative\nnumerical examples is reported to assess the effectiveness of the proposed\nsynthesis approach also through full-wave simulations when considering\nnon-ideal models for the radiating elements of the array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 19:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The dynamics is observed in an electron quantum\nphase consisted of macroscopic quantum orbits similar to those responsible for\nthe integer quantum Hall effect. The dynamics is consistent with the standard\nQM that predicts a \"cloud-like\" behavior of electron in quantum orbits\nregardless of their lengthscale. Sinse the dynamics is beyond the relativistic\nparadigm of movement, it may well be nonlocal. It thereby can be the basis for\na quantum concept of absolute simultaneity, which now rests not on the\nmeaningless notion of infinite speed but on empirically-tested quantum effect.\nThis concept revives the Bell-Popper idea to replace the current \"kinematic\"\nversion of relativity by the \"dynamic\" version by Lorentz and Poincare with a\nrevival of the classical view of space and time where the problem of preferred\nreference frame now can be solved without to involve the vague notion \"aether\".\nWe argue that the concept of quantum absolute simultaneity opens the door to a\nrealistic interpretation of standard QM through a deeper insight of what is\ncalled \"reality\" and ultimately to a harmony between quantum and relativity\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 13:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}
