This pipeline leverages the use of neural architecture\nsearch to automate the discovery of interpretable model architectures, and\nautomatic differentiation to automate the fitting of model parameters to data.\nWe evaluate the utility of these methods based on their ability to recover\nquantitative models of human information processing from synthetic data.

Performing mixup for transfer learning with pre-trained models however\nis not that simple, a high capacity pre-trained model with a large\nfully-connected (FC) layer could easily overfit to the target dataset even with\nsamples-to-labels mixed up. In this work, we propose SMILE - Self-Distilled\nMixup for EffIcient Transfer LEarning. With mixed images as inputs, SMILE\nregularizes the outputs of CNN feature extractors to learn from the mixed\nfeature vectors of inputs (sample-to-feature mixup), in addition to the mixed\nlabels. Specifically, SMILE incorporates a mean teacher, inherited from the\npre-trained model, to provide the feature vectors of input samples in a\nself-distilling fashion, and mixes up the feature vectors accordingly via a\nnovel triplet regularizer. The triple regularizer balances the mixup effects in\nboth feature and label spaces while bounding the linearity in-between samples\nfor pre-training tasks. Extensive experiments have been done to verify the\nperformance improvement made by SMILE, in comparisons with a wide spectrum of\ntransfer learning algorithms, including fine-tuning, L2-SP, DELTA, and RIFLE,\neven with mixup strategies combined. Ablation studies show that the vanilla\nsample-to-label mixup strategies could marginally increase the linearity\nin-between training samples but lack of generalizability, while SMILE\nsignificantly improve the mixup effects in both label and feature spaces with\nboth training and testing datasets. The empirical observations backup our\ndesign intuition and purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 16:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

More precisely, we\nsuppose that these polynomials are given by their approximate values at\ndistinct known points.

At no point do we change to the monomial basis, thus preserving\nthe good conditioning properties of the original Lagrange basis. We discuss\nadvantages and drawbacks of this method.

Renormalization\ninduces sequential bilinear graviton-scalar mixings on single, double and\nmultiple trace terms, corresponding to $R\\square^{-1}$ interactions of the\nscalar curvature, with intermediate virtual massless exchanges. These\ndilaton-like terms couple to the conformal anomaly, as for the chiral anomalous\nWIs. We show that at 4T level a new traceless component appears after\nrenormalization. We comment on future extensions of this result to more general\nbackgrounds, with possible applications to non local cosmologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 16:25:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 19:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

To manage\nthese constraints and smooth out the expenditure across auctions, the bidders\n(or the platform on behalf of them) often employ pacing: each bidder is\nassigned a pacing multiplier between zero and one, and her bid on each item is\nmultiplicatively scaled down by the pacing multiplier. This naturally gives\nrise to a game in which each bidder strategically selects a multiplier. The\nappropriate notion of equilibrium in this game is known as a pacing\nequilibrium. In this work, we show that the problem of finding an approximate\npacing equilibrium is PPAD-complete for second-price auctions. This resolves an\nopen question of Conitzer et al. [2021].

Using the\nBragg interaction with a set of laser beams, the atoms can be launched into\ncircular orbits, with two counterpropagating interferometers allowing many\nsources of common-mode noise to be excluded. In a perfectly symmetric and\nharmonic potential, the interferometer output would depend only on the rotation\nrate of the apparatus. However, deviations from the ideal case can lead to\nspurious phase shifts. These phase shifts have been theoretically analyzed for\nanharmonic perturbations up to quartic in the confining potential, as well as\nangular deviations of the laser beams, timing deviations of the laser pulses,\nand motional excitations of the initial condensate. Analytical and numerical\nresults show the leading effects of the perturbations to be second order. The\nscaling of the phase shifts with the number of orbits and the trap axial\nfrequency ratio are determined. The results indicate that sensitive parameters\nshould be controlled at the $10^{-5}$ level to accommodate a rotation sensing\naccuracy of $10^{-9}$ rad/s. The leading-order perturbations are suppressed in\nthe case of perfect cylindrical symmetry, even in the presence of anharmonicity\nand other errors.

The CE loss encourages features of a class to have\na higher projection score on the true class-vector compared to the negative\nclasses. However, this is a relative constraint and does not explicitly force\ndifferent class features to be well-separated. Motivated by the observation\nthat ground-truth class representations in CE loss are orthogonal (one-hot\nencoded vectors), we develop a novel loss function termed `Orthogonal\nProjection Loss' (OPL) which imposes orthogonality in the feature space. OPL\naugments the properties of CE loss and directly enforces inter-class separation\nalongside intra-class clustering in the feature space through orthogonality\nconstraints on the mini-batch level.

Forecasting multi-agent\ntrajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we\nmodel the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social\ndimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most\nprior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., first using a\ntemporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and\nthen modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model.\nThis approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the\ntime or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would\nprefer a method that allows an agent's state at one time to directly affect\nanother agent's state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new\nTransformer, AgentFormer, that jointly models the time and social dimensions.\nThe model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by\nflattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention\noperations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence,\nAgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent\nidentities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements\nof other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent\ntrajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any\nprevious timestep when inferring an agent's future position. The latent intent\nof all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one\nagent's behavior to affect other agents.

Challenges in\nadapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the\ntwo domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the\nhigh resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these\ndifferences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is\ncomputed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme\nbrings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to\nnon-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.\nThis hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales\nand has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These\nqualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision\ntasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and\ndense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP\non COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val).

If it is larger than 90\ndegree, i.e. counterrotating, the IMBH does not align. Initially, the rate of\norbital reorientation increases linearly with the ratio of the mass of the IMBH\nover the SMBH mass and it is orders of magnitude faster than ordinary (i.e.\nChandrasekhar) dynamical friction, particularly for high SMBH masses.

It comprises a shell detonation and subsequent core detonation. The focus\nof our study is on the effect of the progenitor metallicity on the\nnucleosynthetic yields. For this, we compute and analyse a set of eleven\ndifferent models with varying core and shell masses at four different\nmetallicities each. This results in a total of 44 models at metallicities\nbetween 0.01$Z_\\odot$ and 3$Z_\\odot$. Our models show a strong impact of the\nmetallicity in the high density regime. The presence of $^{22}$Ne causes a\nneutron-excess which shifts the production from $^{56}$Ni to stable isotopes\nsuch as $^{54}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni in the $\\alpha$-rich freeze-out regime. The\nisotopes of the metallicity implementation further serve as seed nuclei for\nadditional reactions in the shell detonation. Most significantly, the\nproduction of $^{55}$Mn increases with metallicity confirming the results of\nprevious work. A comparison of elemental ratios relative to iron shows a\nrelatively good match to solar values for some models. Super-solar values are\nreached for Mn at 3$Z_\\odot$ and solar values in some models at $Z_\\odot$. This\nindicates that the required contribution of SNe Ia originating from\nChandrasekhar mass WDs can be lower than estimated in orevious work to reach\nsolar values of [Mn/Fe] at [Fe/H]$=0$. Our galactic chemical evolution models\nsuggest that SNe Ia from sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, along with\ncore-collapse supernovae, could account for more than 80% of the solar Mn\nabundance. Using metallicity-dependent SN Ia yields helps to reproduce the\nupward trend of [Mn/Fe] as a function of metallicity for the solar\nneighborhood. These chemical evolution predictions, however, depend on the\nmassive star yields adopted in the calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 20:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The Be star on the other hand has a rather low\nluminosity, and a spectroscopic mass inconsistent with its possible dynamical\nmass. The fit to the UV can be significantly improved by reducing the T$_{eff}$\nand radius of the Be star, though at the expense of leading to a different mass\nratio.

Sorting plays an important role in the area of databases, as many\nqueries can be served much faster if the relations are first sorted. One of the\nmost popular sorting algorithm in databases is merge sort.\n  In modern data-centers, data is stored in storage servers, while processing\ntakes place in compute servers. Hence, in order to compute queries on the data,\nit must travel through the network from the storage servers to the compute\nservers. This creates a potential for utilizing programmable switches to\nperform partial sorting in order to accelerate the sorting process at the\nserver side. This is possible because, as mentioned above, data packets pass\nthrough the switch in any case on their way to the server. Alas, programmable\nswitches offer a very restricted and non-intuitive programming model, which is\nwhy realizing this is not-trivial.\n  We devised a novel partial sorting algorithm that fits the programming model\nand restrictions of programmable switches and can expedite merge sort at the\nserver. We also utilize built-in parallelism in the switch to divide the data\ninto sequential ranges. Thus, the server needs to sort each range separately\nand then concatenate them to one sorted stream. This way, the server needs to\nsort smaller sections and each of these sections is already partially sorted.\nHence, the server does less work, and the access pattern becomes more\nvirtual-memory friendly.\n  We evaluated the performance improvements obtained when utilizing our partial\nsorting algorithm over several data stream compositions with various switch\nconfigurations. Our study exhibits an improvement of 20%-75% in the sorting\nrun-time when using our approach compared to plain sorting on the original\nstream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 18:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Thus, if loop\nquantum cosmology (LQC) is to provide an accurate depiction of the real world,\nit must allow for quantum states of spacetime geometry which are semi-classical\nin two respects: they must be sharply peaked around a single, classical\ngeometry, and they must have small quantum fluctuations. It is generally\nassumed that Gaussian states exhibit both of these properties. After all, they\ndo in ordinary quantum mechanics. In this paper, we derive exact closed-form\nexpressions for the fluctuations of Gaussian states in LQC and their lower\nbound given by the Robertson-Schr\\\"odinger inequality. We demonstrate that,\ncontrary to ordinary quantum mechanics, fluctuations for Gaussian states in\nspatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic LQC diverge as the state variance\nincreases (as well as in related cosmological models with the same kinematic\nHilbert space and canonical observables). However, when the holonomy length is\nmade to scale with a volume regularization parameter, these fluctuations may be\narbitrarily suppressed by taking the fiducial volume to be large, providing\nanalytic control over their divergence. Finally, we show that, despite this,\nGaussian states in LQC generally do not minimize uncertainty. Moreover, it is\nconjectured that no such minimal-uncertainty states exist. Throughout this\nwork, it becomes clear how important the often-assumed condition of holonomy\nlength volume-scaling is; we show that when this condition is violated, the\nresulting theory exhibits operator closure pathologies and other exotic\nalgebraic features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 19:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The flat bands that emerge at low twist angles in TBG result in\nsharp features in the electronic density of states (DOS), affecting transport.\nHere we show that they lead to superior and tuneable thermoelectric (TE)\nperformance. Combining an iterative Boltzmann transport equation solver and\nelectronic structure from an exact continuum model, we calculate thermoelectric\ntransport properties of TBG at different twist angles, carrier densities, and\ntemperatures. Our simulations show the room-temperature TE power factor (PF) in\nTBG reaches 40 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$, significantly higher than single-layer\ngraphene (SLG) and among the highest reported to date. The peak PF is observed\nnear the magic angle, at a twist angle of $\\approx$1.3$^\\circ$, and near\ncomplete band filling. We elucidate that its dependence is driven by the band\ngap between lowest and second subband, which improves Seebeck but decreases\nwith twist angle, and Fermi velocity, which dictates conductivity and rises\nwith twist angle. We observed a further increase in the PF of TBG with\ndecreasing temperature. The strong TE performance, along with the ability to\nfine-tune transport using twist angle, makes TBG an interesting candidate for\nfuture research and applications in energy conversion and thermal sensing and\nmanagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 19:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

By evaporating lithium near or at\nthe divertor plate and condensing it closer to the main chamber, a lithium\nvapor density gradient can be created. This density gradient ties energy losses\nto poloidal distance between the target and the detachment point. The radiation\nzone is then prevented from reaching the X-point as the lithium ionization rate\ndecreases when the detachment front moves away from the divertor target. Here\nwe present Scrape Off Layer Plasma Simulator (SOLPS) simulations of a lithium\nvapor box divertor using an NSTX-U equilibrium and PFC geometry. The parameters\nfor the core boundary conditions, gas puff intensity, and heat and particle\ntransport coefficients are chosen to match experimental values.

This application is\nmotivated by the needs of identifying and possibly detecting new types of a\nparticular kind of stars known as variable stars. We first suitably transform\nthe physical attributes of the stars onto the simplex to achieve scale\ninvariance while maintaining their dependence structure. This allows us to\ncompare data collected by different sky surveys which can have different\nscales. The model hence combines a mixture of Dirichlet mixtures to represent\nthe known classes with the semi-supervised classification strategy of Vatanen\net al. (2012) for outlier detection. In line with previous work on\nsemiparametric model-based clustering, the single Dirichlet distributions can\nbe seen as providing the baseline pattern of the data. These are then combined\nto effectively model the complex distributions of the attributes for the\ndifferent classes. The model is estimated using a hierarchical two-step\nprocedure which combines a suitably adapted version of the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with Bayes' rule.

Existing systems sell space using first-price\nauctions; however, users find it difficult to estimate how much they need to\nbid in order to get their transactions accepted onto the chain. If they bid too\nlow, their transactions can have long confirmation times. If they bid too high,\nthey pay larger fees than necessary.\n  In light of these issues, new transaction fee mechanisms have been proposed,\nmost notably EIP-1559, aiming to provide better usability. EIP-1559 is a\nhistory-dependent mechanism that relies on block utilization to adjust a base\nfee. We propose an alternative design -- a {\\em dynamic posted-price mechanism}\n-- which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past\nblocks to compute a posted price for subsequent blocks.

Furthermore, it remains relatively less explored how rotation-equivariant\nfeatures can be leveraged to tackle 3D shape alignment tasks. While many past\napproaches have been based on either non-equivariant or invariant descriptors\nto align 3D shapes, we argue that such tasks may benefit greatly from an\nequivariant framework.

First, we present SE(3) separable point\nconvolution, a novel framework that breaks down the 6D convolution into two\nseparable convolutional operators alternatively performed in the 3D Euclidean\nand SO(3) spaces. This significantly reduces the computational cost without\ncompromising the performance.

Meanwhile, R-EBMs can also be regarded as\nutterance-level confidence estimators, which may benefit many downstream tasks.\nExperiments on a 100hr LibriSpeech dataset show that R-EBMs can reduce the word\nerror rates (WERs) by 8.2%/6.7% while improving areas under precision-recall\ncurves of confidence scores by 12.6%/28.4% on test-clean/test-other sets.\nFurthermore, on a state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning\n(wav2vec 2.0), R-EBMs still significantly improves both the WER and confidence\nestimation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 22:08:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 17:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

This double truncation may induce a\nsystematic bias in estimation, so specific corrections are needed. A relevant\ntarget in Survival Analysis is the hazard rate function, which represents the\ninstantaneous probability for the event of interest. In this work we introduce\na flexible estimation approach for the hazard rate under double truncation.\nSpecifically, a kernel smoother is considered, in both a fully nonparametric\nsetting and a semiparametric setting in which the incidence process fits a\ngiven parametric model. Properties of the kernel smoothers are investigated\nboth theoretically and through simulations. In particular, an asymptotic\nexpression of the mean integrated squared error is derived, leading to a\ndata-driven bandwidth for the estimators.

To detect these anomalies, a separate DNN called assurance monitor is\noften trained and used in parallel to the controller DNN, increasing the\nresource burden and latency. We hypothesize that a single network that can\nperform controller predictions and anomaly detection is necessary to reduce the\nresource requirements. Deep-Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks provide a\nrejection class alongside the class predictions, which can be utilized for\ndetecting anomalies at runtime. However, the use of RBF activation functions\nlimits the applicability of these networks to only classification tasks. In\nthis paper, we show how the deep-RBF network can be used for detecting\nanomalies in CPS regression tasks such as continuous steering predictions.\nFurther, we design deep-RBF networks using popular DNNs such as NVIDIA DAVE-II,\nand ResNet20, and then use the resulting rejection class for detecting\nadversarial attacks such as a physical attack and data poison attack.

Here we study frequency-dependent\nselection (FDS)--where a trait's tendency to be copied depends on its current\nfrequency regardless of the trait value itself. We develop a maximum-likelihood\nmethod to infer the precise form of FDS from time series of trait abundance,\nand we apply the method to data on baby names and pet dog breeds over the last\ncentury. We find that the most common names tend to decline by 2%-6% per yr on\naverage; whereas rare names--1 in 10,000 births--tend to increase by 1%-3% per\nyr. This specific form of negative FDS explains patterns of diversity and\nreplicates across the United States, France, Norway and the Netherlands,\ndespite cultural, linguistic and demographic variation. We infer a fixed\nfitness offset between male and female names that implies different rates of\ninnovation.

In purebred dog registrations we infer a form of negative FDS that is\nconsistent with a preference for novelty, in which each year's newest breeds\noutgrow the previous by about 1%/yr, which also recapitulates boom-bust cycles\nin dog fanciers.

EHQCD models\nare characterized by two parameters, the conformal dimension of the relevant\noperator that deforms the CFT and the associated coupling. We find that black\nhole solutions appear at temperatures higher than some temperature $T_{min}$\nand can be categorized in two classes: large and small black holes. A large\nblack hole is thermally stable and it is therefore interpreted as the gravity\ndual of a non-conformal plasma. A small black hole, on the other hand, is\nthermally unstable. We show that thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy\ndensity $s$, specific heat $C_V$, and speed of sound $c_s$ are sensitive to the\nmodel parameters. We investigate perturbations of the black hole solutions and\ncalculate the viscosity coefficients of the corresponding dual non-conformal\nplasma. For the shear viscosity, we confirm that the ratio $\\eta/s$ is given by\nthe universal result $1/4\\pi$.

However, despite government\nrecommendations and mandates, a progressive increase in mobility was observed\nin several sites. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"quarantine fatigue\".\nMathematical models have been used for more than a century to study the\ndynamics of diseases spread. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large\nnumber of models have been developed to investigate different aspects of the\npandemic. The aim of the present work has been to design and explore a\nmathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with quarantine fatigue. A\ndeterministic model represented by a system of differential equations, based on\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was developed. The model was\nexplored by means of computational simulations. The results obtained show that,\nin some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a second\npeak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have\ncontributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in\ndifferent parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations\nperformed also showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other\nparameters related to propagation dynamics. The developed model is relatively\nsimple and has important limitations for performing accurate predictions in the\nreal world. However, our study highlights the importance of considering\nquarantine fatigue in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well\nas of possible future pandemics caused by other pathogens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

To reduce the time and effort required to make them, researchers have\ndeveloped algorithms that predict the compatibility of audio elements. Prior\nwork has focused on mixing unaltered excerpts, but advances in source\nseparation enable the creation of mashups from isolated stems (e.g., vocals,\ndrums, bass, etc.). In this work, we take advantage of separated stems not just\nfor creating mashups, but for training a model that predicts the mutual\ncompatibility of groups of excerpts, using self-supervised and semi-supervised\nmethods. Specifically, we first produce a random mashup creation pipeline that\ncombines stem tracks obtained via source separation, with key and tempo\nautomatically adjusted to match, since these are prerequisites for high-quality\nmashups. To train a model to predict compatibility, we use stem tracks obtained\nfrom the same song as positive examples, and random combinations of stems with\nkey and/or tempo unadjusted as negative examples. To improve the model and use\nmore data, we also train on \"average\" examples: random combinations with\nmatching key and tempo, where we treat them as unlabeled data as their true\ncompatibility is unknown. To determine whether the combined signal or the set\nof stem signals is more indicative of the quality of the result, we experiment\non two model architectures and train them using semi-supervised learning\ntechnique. Finally, we conduct objective and subjective evaluations of the\nsystem, comparing them to a standard rule-based system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 01:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the addition\nof nanoscale porosity to even ultrafine-grained Si0.8Ge0.2 may be worthwhile.\nThe semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation was used to model electrical and\nphonon transport in polycrystalline Si0.8Ge0.2 containing prismatic pores\nperpendicular to the transport current. The models are free of tuning\nparameters and were validated against experimental data. The models reveal that\na combination of pores and grain boundaries suppresses phonon conductivity to a\nmagnitude comparable with the electronic thermal conductivity. In this regime,\nZT can be further enhanced by reducing carrier concentration to the electrical\nand electronic thermal conductivity and simultaneously increasing thermopower.\nAlthough increases in ZT are modest, the optimal carrier concentration is\nsignificantly lowered, meaning semiconductors need not be so strongly\nsupersaturated with dopants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 02:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 00:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

The influences of liquid droplet mass loading, heat\nexchange coefficient (or evaporation rate) and Lewis number on spherical spray\nflame ignition are studied. Two flame regimes are considered, i.e.,\nheterogeneous and homogeneous flames, based on the mixture condition near the\nflame front. The results indicate that the spray flame trajectories are\nconsiderably affected by the ignition energy addition. The critical condition\nfor successful ignition for the fuel-rich mixture is coincidence of inner and\nouter flame balls from igniting kernel and propagating flame. The flame balls\nalways exist in homogeneous mixtures, indicating that ignition failure and\ncritical successful events occur only in purely gaseous mixture.

However, the canonical Energy-Momentum\nTensors (EMTs) are neither symmetric nor gauge-symmetric (gauge invariant). The\nBelinfante-Rosenfeld (BR) method is a well-known procedure to symmetrize the\nEMTs, which also renders them gauge symmetric for first-order field theories.\nHigh-order electromagnetic field theories appear in the study of gyrokinetic\nsystems for magnetized plasmas and the Podolsky system for the radiation\nreaction of classical charged particles. For these high-order field theories,\ngauge-symmetric EMTs are not necessarily symmetric and vice versa. In the\npresent study, we develop a new gauge-symmetrization method for EMTs in\nhigh-order electromagnetic field theories. The Noether procedure is carried out\nusing the Faraday tensor F, instead of the 4-potential A, to derive a canonical\nEMT T_N. We show that the gauge-dependent part of T_N can be removed using the\ndisplacement-potential tensor \\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{D}*A/4\\pi, where \\mathcal{D}\nis the anti-symmetric electric displacement tensor. This method\ngauge-symmetrize the EMT without necessarily making it symmetric, which is\nadequate for applications not involving general relativity. For first-order\nelectromagnetic field theories, such as the standard Maxwell system,\n\\mathcal{F} reduces to the familiar BR super-potential \\mathcal{S}, and the\nmethod developed can be used as a simpler procedure to calculate \\mathcal{S}\nwithout employing the angular momentum tensor in 4D spacetime. When the\nelectromagnetic system is coupled to classical charged particles, the\ngauge-symmetrization method for EMTs is shown to be effective as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 03:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Motivated by this observation, we present a novel\nperspective and formulate this task as a problem of learning with pixel-level\nlabel noise. Existing noisy label methods, nevertheless, mainly aim at\nimage-level tasks, which can not capture the relationship between neighboring\nlabels in one image. Therefore, we propose a graph based label noise detection\nand correction framework to deal with pixel-level noisy labels. In particular,\nfor the generated pixel-level noisy labels from weak supervisions by Class\nActivation Map (CAM), we train a clean segmentation model with strong\nsupervisions to detect the clean labels from these noisy labels according to\nthe cross-entropy loss.

These\napproaches leverage fixed depth range hypotheses to construct cascaded plane\nsweep volumes. However, it is inappropriate to set identical range hypotheses\nfor each pixel since the uncertainties of previous per-pixel depth predictions\nare spatially varying. Distinct from these approaches, we propose a Dynamic\nDepth Range Network (DDR-Net) to determine the depth range hypotheses\ndynamically by applying a range estimation module (REM) to learn the\nuncertainties of range hypotheses in the former stages. Specifically, in our\nDDR-Net, we first build an initial depth map at the coarsest resolution of an\nimage across the entire depth range. Then the range estimation module (REM)\nleverages the probability distribution information of the initial depth to\nestimate the depth range hypotheses dynamically for the following stages.\nMoreover, we develop a novel loss strategy, which utilizes learned dynamic\ndepth ranges to generate refined depth maps, to keep the ground truth value of\neach pixel covered in the range hypotheses of the next stage. Extensive\nexperimental results show that our method achieves superior performance over\nother state-of-the-art methods on the DTU benchmark and obtains comparable\nresults on the Tanks and Temples benchmark.

This is probably caused by the high\ninterstellar extinction in the surroundings of the AGN, which corresponds to\nthe true nucleus of the galaxy, as also proposed by previous studies.

The AGN position does not coincide with the brightest\nline-emitting region at the centre of NGC 1448. That may be a consequence of\nthe high obscuration from the AGN towards the observer (the AGN is actually\nCompton thick), mostly caused by a nearly edge-on torus. An additional\nhypothesis is that the AGN reduced its luminosity, during the last 440 yr, to\nnearly half of the value in the past.

One of the commonly used models is,\ndue to its simplicity and calculation speed, the analytical drag-based model\n(DBM) for heliospheric propagation of CMEs. DBM relies on the observational\nfact that slow CMEs accelerate whereas fast CMEs decelerate, and is based on\nthe concept of MHD drag, which acts to adjust the CME speed to the ambient\nsolar wind. Although physically DBM is applicable only to the CME magnetic\nstructure, it is often used as a proxy for the shock arrival. In recent years,\nthe DBM equation has been used in many studies to describe the propagation of\nCMEs and shocks with different geometries and assumptions. Here we give an\noverview of the five DBM versions currently available and their respective\ntools, developed at Hvar Observatory and frequently used by researchers and\nforecasters.

To this end,\nwe propose an improved Transformer-based architecture, called Strided\nTransformer, which simply and effectively lifts a long sequence of 2D joint\nlocations to a single 3D pose. Specifically, a Vanilla Transformer Encoder\n(VTE) is adopted to model long-range dependencies of 2D pose sequences. To\nreduce the redundancy of the sequence, fully-connected layers in the\nfeed-forward network of VTE are replaced with strided convolutions to\nprogressively shrink the sequence length and aggregate information from local\ncontexts. The modified VTE is termed as Strided Transformer Encoder (STE),\nwhich is built upon the outputs of VTE. STE not only effectively aggregates\nlong-range information to a single-vector representation in a hierarchical\nglobal and local fashion, but also significantly reduces the computation cost.\nFurthermore, a full-to-single supervision scheme is designed at both full\nsequence and single target frame scales applied to the outputs of VTE and STE,\nrespectively.

Because of the\nextremely large number of model evaluations required by the dataset\nconstruction, MOR techniques are employed to reduce the computational burden.\nThe trained classifier is shown to be able to map unseen vibrational\nrecordings, e.g. collected on-the-fly from sensors placed on the structure, to\nthe actual damage state, thus providing information concerning the presence and\nalso the location of damage. The proposed strategy has been validated by means\nof two case studies, concerning a 2D portal frame and a 3D portal frame railway\nbridge; MOR techniques have allowed us to respectively speed up the analyses\nabout 30 and 420 times. For both the case studies, after training the\nclassifier has attained an accuracy greater than 85%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

It is extensively reported that TI evolves in animals living in\na large group because TI could assess relative rank without deducing all dyadic\nrelationships, which averts costly fights.The relationships in a large group\nbecome so complex that social cognition may not be developed adequately to\nhandle such complexity. If all group members apply TI to all possible members\nin the group, TI is supposed to require extremely highly developed cognitive\nabilities especially in a large group. Instead of developing cognitive\nabilities significantly, animals may apply simplified TI we call reference TI\nin this study as heuristic approaches. The reference TI allows members to\nrecognize and remember social interactions only among a set of reference\nmembers rather than all potential members.

We examined how\ninformation processes evolve in a large group using evolutionary simulations in\nthe hawk-dove game. Information processes with almost any numbers of reference\nmembers could evolve in a large group as long as the numbers of shared\nreference member are high because information from the others' experiences is\nshared.

These two\ngroups represent radial-symmetric and plane-axisymmetric flow regimes from a\nconventional pressure-diffusion perspective. A comprehensive parameter study\ninto the sensitivity of the applied hydro-mechanical model to changes in\ncharacteristic fracture parameters revealed an interrelation between fracture\nlength and normal fracture stiffness that yield a match between field\nobservations and numerical results. Fracture stiffness values increase with\ncorresponding fracture length.

Spectra and photometry revealed that the star is\nan H-rich active ER UMa-type dwarf nova with a highly variable supercycle of\n~50-100 d that implies a high and variable mass-transfer rate. This object\ndemonstrated peculiar behaviour: short-lasted superoutbursts (a week); a slow\nsuperoutburst decline and cases of rebrightenings; low frequency (from none to\na few) of the normal outbursts during the supercycle.

Convergence of plays to Nash\nequilibrium has often been justified by agents' learning.

When successive values of p\ncan take values above and below 1, bounded rational agents may learn about\ntheir environment through simplified representations of the game, reasoning\nwith analogies and constructing expectations about the behavior of other\nplayers.

Although experimental imperfections affect the\nsensitivity, repetitions of the measurements decrease the estimation\nuncertainty by a square root of the total number of the measurements if there\nare only statistical errors. However, it is difficult to precisely characterize\nthe coherence time of the system because it fluctuates in time in realistic\nconditions, which induces systematic errors. In this case, due to residual bias\nof the measured values, estimation uncertainty cannot be lowered than a finite\nvalue even in the limit of the infinite number of measurements. On the basis of\nthe fact that the decoherence dynamics in the so-called Zeno regime are not\nsignificant compared to other regimes, we propose a novel but very simple\nprotocol to use measurements in the Zeno regime for reducing systematic errors.\nOur scheme allows the estimation uncertainty $\\delta ^2 \\omega$ to scale as\n$L^{1/4}$ where $L$ denotes the number of the measurements even when we cannot\nprecisely characterize the coherence time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 11:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Model-based RL shows the\nprospect of being more sample-efficient than model-free methods in terms of\nagent-environment interactions, because the model enables to extrapolate to\nunseen situations. In the more recent past, model-based methods have shown\nsuperior results compared to model-free methods in some challenging domains\nwith non-linear state transitions. At the same time, it has become apparent\nthat RL is not market-ready yet and that many real-world applications are going\nto require model-based approaches, because model-free methods are too\nsample-inefficient and show poor performance in early stages of training. The\nlatter is particularly important in industry, e.g. in production systems that\ndirectly impact a company's revenue. This demonstrates the necessity for a\ntoolbox to push the boundaries for model-based RL. While there is a plethora of\ntoolboxes for model-free RL, model-based RL has received little attention in\nterms of toolbox development.

The stealth window\nconsists of an anti-reflection glass with indium tin oxide (ITO) as resistive\nfilm and a liquid container made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Since the\nmaterials constituting the window are all transparent, the metamaterials that\ncan be switched through the liquid control system can always maintain high\nlight transmission. The proposal can obtain a transmission passband from 2.3\nGHz to 5 GHz with low insertion loss, especially at 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz with the\ninsertion loss of the passband reach 0.51 and 0.99 , by alcohol drainage. It\ncan also reflect electromagnetic waves at 2.45 GHz and absorb them from 4.5 GHz\nto 10.5 GHz with a strong absorptivity over 90% by alcohol injection,\nexhibiting the reconfigurable electromagnetic characteristic of switching\nbetween transmission state and absorption state. Furthermore, the proposed\nabsorber shows its good transmission/absorption performance under different\npolarizations and obtains absorptivity over 90% when alcohol injection in an\noblique incidence of 50{\\deg}. Finally, the prototype window has been\nfabricated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed structure, which\nindicates that the proposal presents significant implications for smart stealth\nsystems and WLAN communication that require switching of working states in a\ncomplex electromagnetic environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 11:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Surface tension\nat the drop boundary is included in the analysis, although negligibly small in\nthe squeezing experiments. The circular evolution is found to be stable under\nsmall perturbations. If the force is reversed (F < 0), so that the plates are\npulled or levered apart, the boundary of the drop is subject to a fingering\ninstability.

The annular evolution of the drop under constant squeezing is\nstill found to follow a `one-eighth' power law, but this is unstable, the\ninstability originating at the boundary of the air bubble. If the plates are\ndrawn apart, the evolution is still subject to the fingering instability driven\nfrom the outer boundary of the annulus.

This enables the calculation\nof both uncertainty and skill metrics for the neural network predictions, and\novercomes the common difficulty of inferring uncertainty from these\npredictions.\n  This approach is data-driven and the neural network is trained on the\nWeatherBench dataset (processed ERA5 data) to forecast geopotential and\ntemperature 3 and 5 days ahead.

Given instances of\ntwo relations, where one has a foreign key dependence on the other and is\nmissing its foreign key ($FK$) values, and two types of constraints: (1) CCs\nthat apply to the join view and (2) ICs that apply to the table with missing\n$FK$ values, our goal is to impute the missing $FK$ values such that the\nconstraints are satisfied. We provide a novel framework for the problem based\non declarative CCs and ICs.

While this is highly efficient, each bit\ndimension is equally weighted, which means that potentially discriminative\ninformation of the data is lost. A more expressive alternative is to use\nreal-valued vector representations and compute their inner product; this allows\nvarying the weight of each dimension but is many magnitudes slower. To fix\nthis, we derive a new way of measuring the dissimilarity between two objects in\nthe Hamming space with binary weighting of each dimension (i.e., disabling\nbits): we consider a field-agnostic dissimilarity that projects the vector of\none object onto the vector of the other.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed\nFFSD, which comprises two key components: Feature Fusion and Self-Distillation,\ntowards solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from\nprevious works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD\nsplits them into a leader student and a common student set. Then, the feature\nfusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common\nstudents into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist\nthe learning of the leader student. To enable the leader student to absorb more\ndiverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the\ndiversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to\nconvert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the\nshallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the\ndeeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training,\nwe simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over\nthe common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost.\nExtensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of\nour FFSD over existing works.

In this paper, we point out that the\ninformation of features derived from regions excluding objects are also\nessential for distilling the student detector, which is usually ignored in\nexisting approaches. In addition, we elucidate that features from different\nregions should be assigned with different importance during distillation. To\nthis end, we present a novel distillation algorithm via decoupled features\n(DeFeat) for learning a better student detector.

In\npractice, the microstructure of colloidal gels, which dictates their mechanical\nproperties, strongly depends on the particle concentration and on the nature of\ntheir interactions. Yet another critical control parameter is the shear history\nexperienced by the sample, which controls the size and density of the cluster\npopulation, via particle aggregation, cluster breakup, and restructuring. Here\nwe investigate the impact of shear history on acid-induced gels of boehmite, an\naluminum oxide. We show that following a primary gelation, these gels display a\ndual response depending on the shear rate $\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm p}$ used to\nrejuvenate their microstructure. We identify a critical shear rate\n$\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm c}$, above which boehmite gels display a gel-like viscoelastic\nspectrum upon flow cessation, similar to that obtained following the primary\ngelation. However, upon flow cessation after shear rejuvenation below\n$\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm c}$, boehmite gels display a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum\ntogether with enhanced elastic properties. Moreover, the nonlinear rheological\nproperties of boehmite gels also differ on both sides of $\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm c}$:\nweak gels obtained after rejuvenation at $\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm p}>\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm\nc}$ show a yield strain that is constant, independent of $\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm p}$,\nwhereas strong gels obtained with $\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm p}<\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm c}$\ndisplay a yield strain that significantly increases with $\\dot\\gamma_{\\rm p}$.\nOur results can be interpreted in light of previous literature on shear-induced\nanisotropy, while we rationalize the critical shear rate in terms of a\ndimensionless quantity, the Mason number, comparing the strength of the shear\nflow to the interparticle bond force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 13:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 14:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Interestingly, traveling distance decreases but traveling\ncost increases for some instances of diverted traffic.

A well-thought\ninitialization of these model parameters can often avoid that the nonlinear\noptimization algorithm converges to a poorly performing local minimum of the\nconsidered cost function. This paper introduces an improved initialization\napproach for nonlinear state-space models represented as a recurrent artificial\nneural network and emphasizes the importance of including an explicit linear\nterm in the model structure.

It is particularly evident in\ncataclysmic variables (CVs). Attempting to define boundary conditions for\nmodels, the strength of the flickering is measured in several thousand light\ncurves of more than 100 CVs. The flickering amplitude is parameterized by the\nFWHM of a Gaussian fit to the magnitude distribution of data points in a light\ncurve. This quantity requires several corrections before a comparison between\ndifferent sources can be made. While no correlations of the flickering strength\nwith simple parameters such as component masses, orbital inclination or period\nwere detected, a dependence on the absolute magnitude of the primary component\nand on the CV subtype is found. In particular, flickering in VY Scl tpye\nnovalike variables is systematically stronger than in UX UMa type novalikes.\nThe broadband spectrum of the flickering light source can be fit by simple\nmodels but shows excess in the $U$ band. When the data permitted to investigate\nthe flickering strength as a function of orbital phase in eclipsing CVs, such a\ndependence was found, but it is different for different systems. Surprisingly,\nthere are also indications for variations of the flickering strength with the\nsuperhump phase in novalike variables with permanent superhumps. In dwarf\nnovae, the flickering amplitude is high during quiescence, drops quickly at an\nintermediate magnitude when the system enters into (or returns from) an\noutburst and, on average, remains constant above a given brightness threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Complementary\nmicromagnetic simulations indicate that the net magnetic dipole moment rotates\ncounterclockwise (CCW) during both resonances. The magnon probability\ndistribution for the lower-frequency resonance is localised within isolated\nskyrmions, unlike the higher-frequency mode which principally originates from\nareas between skyrmions.

The gyrations of stable\nisolated skyrmions reported in this room temperature study encourage the\ndevelopment of new material platforms and applications based on skyrmion\nresonances.

However, the\nruntime and memory costs become quickly prohibitive as one attempts (possibly\nat the same time) (i) to reach out to heavier nuclei, (ii) to employ\nsymmetry-breaking reference states to access open-shell nuclei and (iii) to aim\nfor yet a greater accuracy. The challenge is particularly exacerbated for\nnon-perturbative methods involving the repeated storage of (high-rank) tensors\nobtained via iterative solutions of non-linear equations. The present work\naddresses the formal and numerical implementations of so-called importance\ntruncation (IT) techniques within the frame of one particular non-perturbative\nexpansion method, i.e., Gorkov Self-Consistent Green's Function (GSCGF) theory,\nwith the goal to eventually overcome above-mentioned limitations. By a priori\ntruncating irrelevant tensor entries, IT techniques are shown to reduce the\nstorage to less than 1% of its original cost in realistic GSCGF calculations\nperformed at the ADC(2) level while maintaining a 1% accuracy on the\ncorrelation energy. The future steps will be to extend the present development\nto the next, e.g., ADC(3), truncation level and to SCGF calculations applicable\nto doubly open-shell nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Most\\'efaoui, H. Moumen, and M. Raynal presented a new and\nsimple randomized signature-free binary consensus algorithm (denoted here MMR)\nthat copes with the net effect of asynchrony Byzantine behaviors. Assuming\nmessage scheduling is fair and independent from random numbers MMR is optimal\nin several respects: it deals with up to t Byzantine processes where t < n/3\nand n is the number of processes, O(n\\^2) messages and O(1) expected time. The\npresent article presents a non-trivial extension of MMR to an even more\nfault-prone context, namely, in addition to Byzantine processes, it considers\nalso that the system can experience transient failures. To this end it\nconsiders self-stabilization techniques to cope with communication failures and\narbitrary transient faults (such faults represent any violation of the\nassumptions according to which the system was designed to operate).\n  The proposed algorithm is the first loosely-self-stabilizing Byzantine\nfault-tolerant binary consensus algorithm suited to asynchronous\nmessage-passing systems. This is achieved via an instructive transformation of\nMMR to a self-stabilizing solution that can violate safety requirements with\nprobability Pr= O(1/(2\\^M)), where M is a predefined constant that can be set\nto any positive integer at the cost of 3 M n + log M bits of local memory. In\naddition to making MMR resilient to transient faults, the obtained\nself-stabilizing algorithm preserves its properties of optimal resilience and\ntermination, (i.e., t < n/3, and O(1) expected time).

Szilard's information engine still serves as a canonical example\nafter almost a hundred years, despite recent significant growth of the area.\nThe role the demon plays can be reduced to mapping observable data to a\nmeta-stable memory, which is utilized to extract work. While Szilard showed\nthat the map can be implemented mechanistically, it was chosen a priori. The\nchoice of how to construct a meaningful memory constitutes the demon's\nintelligence. Recently, it was shown that this can be automated as well. To\nthat end, generalized, partially observable information engines were\nintroduced, providing a basis for understanding the physical nature of\ninformation processing. Partial observability is ubiquitous in real world\nsystems which have limited sensor types and information acquisition bandwidths.\nGeneralized information engines can run work extraction at a different\ntemperature, T' > T, from the memory forming process. This enables the combined\ntreatment of heat engines and information engines. We study the physical\ncharacteristics of intelligent observers by introducing a canonical model that\ndisplays physical richness, despite its simplicity. A minor change to Szilard's\nengine - inserting the divider at an angle - results in a family of partially\nobservable Szilard engines. Their analysis shows how the demon's intelligence\ncan be automated. For each angle, and for each value of T'/T, an optimal memory\ncan be found, enabling the engine to run with minimal dissipation.

Most prior DA approaches leverage complicated and powerful deep\nneural networks to improve the adaptation capacity and have shown remarkable\nsuccess. However, they may have a lack of applicability to real-world\nsituations such as real-time interaction, where low target inference latency is\nan essential requirement under limited computational budget. In this paper, we\ntackle the problem by proposing a dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) framework,\nwhich can simultaneously achieve efficient target inference in low-resource\nscenarios and inherit the favorable cross-domain generalization brought by DA.\nIn contrast to static models, as a simple yet generic method, DDA can integrate\nvarious domain confusion constraints into any typical adaptive network, where\nmultiple intermediate classifiers can be equipped to infer \"easier\" and\n\"harder\" target data dynamically. Moreover, we present two novel strategies to\nfurther boost the adaptation performance of multiple prediction exits: 1) a\nconfidence score learning strategy to derive accurate target pseudo labels by\nfully exploring the prediction consistency of different classifiers; 2) a\nclass-balanced self-training strategy to explicitly adapt multi-stage\nclassifiers from source to target without losing prediction diversity.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks are conducted to verify that DDA\ncan consistently improve the adaptation performance and accelerate target\ninference under domain shift and limited resources scenarios\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The\nrelaxation portion, however, is typically not well-reproduced, with the\nrelaxation in experiments occurring much more slowly than in models. In this\nstudy, using a model that includes a size distribution of the active material\nparticles, we give a physical explanation for the slow relaxation phenomenon.\nThis model, the Many-Particle-DFN (MP-DFN), is compared against discharge and\nrelaxation data from the literature, and optimal fits of the size distribution\nparameters (mean and variance), as well as solid-state diffusivities, are found\nusing numerical optimization. The voltage after relaxation is captured by\ncareful choice of the current cut-off time, allowing a single set of physical\nparameters to be used for all C-rates, in contrast to previous studies. We find\nthat the MP-DFN can accurately reproduce the slow relaxation, across a range of\nC-rates, whereas the DFN cannot. Size distributions allow for greater internal\nheterogeneities, giving a natural origin of slower relaxation timescales that\nmay be relevant in other, as yet explained, battery behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 12:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

This conclusion is followed from a\nsubmicroscopic consideration of particles and their motion in the framework of\nthe theory of physical space in the form of a tessellattice developed by Michel\nBounias and the author. The periodical change of the particle's charged state\nto its monopole state can easily be introduced in the conventional Maxwell\nequations and the magnetic monopole automatically shows up in the structure of\nMaxwell's equations. The monopole is also presented in any quark system as a\nquark obeys dynamics that are also characterized by the appropriate de Broglie\nwavelength and hence the electric charge changes periodically to the magnetic\nmonopole. A (anti)neutrino emerges as the typical electron's monopole. When the\ncharged particle becomes the monopole, it also loses its mass (the mass passes\nto the particle's inerton cloud) and thus the neutrino is a massless particle,\nor more correctly massless monopole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 09:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}
