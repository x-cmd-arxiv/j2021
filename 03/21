To understand how the choice of a norm affects\npower properties of tests in high dimensions, we study the consistency sets of\n$p$-norm based tests in the prototypical framework of sequence models with\nunrestricted parameter spaces, the null hypothesis being that all observations\nhave zero mean. The consistency set of a test is here defined as the set of all\narrays of alternatives the test is consistent against as the dimension of the\nparameter space diverges. We characterize the consistency sets of $p$-norm\nbased tests and find, in particular, that the consistency against an array of\nalternatives cannot be determined solely in terms of the $p$-norm of the\nalternative. Our characterization also reveals an unexpected monotonicity\nresult: namely that the consistency set is strictly increasing in $p \\in (0,\n\\infty)$, such that tests based on higher $p$ strictly dominate those based on\nlower $p$ in terms of consistency. This monotonicity allows us to construct\nnovel tests that dominate, with respect to their consistency behavior, all\n$p$-norm based tests without sacrificing size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 16:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:49:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 18:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 12:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

To exploit\nthe cloud-like functions at the network edge, service caching has been\nimplemented to reuse the computation task input/output data, thus effectively\nreducing the delay incurred by data retransmissions and repeated execution of\nthe same task. In a multi-user cache-assisted MEC system, users' preferences\nfor different types of services, possibly dependent on their locations, play an\nimportant role in joint design of communication, computation and service\ncaching. In this paper, we consider multiple representative locations, where\nusers at the same location share the same preference profile for a given set of\nservices. Specifically, by exploiting the location-aware users' preference\nprofiles, we propose joint optimization of the binary cache placement, the edge\ncomputation resource and the bandwidth allocation to minimize the expected\nsum-energy consumption, subject to the bandwidth and the computation\nlimitations as well as the service latency constraints. To effectively solve\nthe mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based\noffline cache placement scheme using a novel stochastic quantization based\ndiscrete-action generation method. The proposed hybrid learning framework\nadvocates both benefits from the model-free DL approach and the model-based\noptimization. The simulations verify that the proposed DL-based scheme saves\nroughly 33% and 6.69% of energy consumption compared with the greedy caching\nand the popular caching, respectively, while achieving up to 99.01% of the\noptimal performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 18:30:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 19:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

In this study, the laminar film\ncondensation over upward facing flat slabs and circular disks of finite sizes\nwith free edges in the presence of wall slip effects is investigated. By\nconsidering the Navier slip model and extending the classical Nusselt analysis,\nthe mass, momentum, and energy of the liquid film in two-dimensional and\naxisymmetric coordinates are solved for the film thickness and the heat\ntransfer rate in non-dimensional form. Numerical solution yields the local\nstructure of the condensate film profile and the Nusselt number for different\nvalues of the slip coefficient. Investigation of the results reveals that the\ncondensate film on horizontal surfaces becomes thinner and the overall heat\ntransfer rate is enhanced with an increase in the slip coefficient. In\nparticular, a regression analysis of the results indicates a power law\ndependence of the Nusselt number on the non-dimensional slip coefficient with\nan exponent close to 0.5. Significant enhancement in phase change heat transfer\nfollow from the modification of the local velocity profiles within the\ncondensate film, especially in resulting from the additional momentum gain near\nthe wall surfaces due to increases in slip effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 20:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

While the Hidden Markov\nmodeling-based learning mechanisms are well studied in literature, we analyze a\nsymbolic-dynamics inspired approach. Under this umbrella, Markov modeling of\ntime-series data consists of two major steps -- discretization of continuous\nattributes followed by estimating the size of temporal memory of the\ndiscretized sequence. These two steps are critical for the accurate and concise\nrepresentation of time-series data in the discrete space. Discretization\ngoverns the information content of the resultant discretized sequence. On the\nother hand, memory estimation of the symbolic sequence helps to extract the\npredictive patterns in the discretized data. Clearly, the effectiveness of\nsignal representation as a discrete Markov process depends on both these steps.\nIn this paper, we will review the different techniques for discretization and\nmemory estimation for discrete stochastic processes. In particular, we will\nfocus on the individual problems of discretization and order estimation for\ndiscrete stochastic process. We will present some results from literature on\npartitioning from dynamical systems theory and order estimation using concepts\nof information theory and statistical learning.

We first represent textile structures using\nhypergraphs and extract multisets of k-neighbourhoods describing weaving\npatterns from these graphs. Then, the resulting multisets are clustered using\nvarious distance measures and various clustering algorithms (K-Means for\nsimplicity and hierarchical agglomerative algorithms for precision). We\nevaluate the different variants of our approach experimentally, showing that\nthis can be implemented efficiently (meaning it has linear complexity), and\ndemonstrate its quality to query and cluster datasets containing large textile\nsamples. As, to the est of our knowledge, this is the first practical approach\nfor explicitly modelling complex and irregular weaving patterns usable for\nretrieval, we aim at establishing a solid baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Puncturing, shortening and extension are three strategies to obtain\narbitrary code lengths and code rates for polar codes.

In this\nwork, we propose a novel architecture QuClassi, a quantum neural network for\nboth binary and multi-class classification. Powered by a quantum\ndifferentiation function along with a hybrid quantum-classic design, QuClassi\nencodes the data with a reduced number of qubits and generates the quantum\ncircuit, pushing it to the quantum platform for the best states, iteratively.\nWe conduct intensive experiments on both the simulator and IBM-Q quantum\nplatform. The evaluation results demonstrate that QuClassi is able to\noutperform the state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions, Tensorflow-Quantum and\nQuantumFlow by up to 53.75% and 203.00% for binary and multi-class\nclassifications. When comparing to traditional deep neural networks, QuClassi\nachieves a comparable performance with 97.37% fewer parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 05:28:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 21:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Yet, throughout application domains, mathematical\noptimization is, for the most part, considered to be a numerical discipline.\nOptimization problems are formulated to be solved numerically with specific\nalgorithms running on microprocessors. An emerging alternative is to view\noptimization algorithms as dynamical systems. While this new perspective is\ninsightful in itself, liberating optimization methods from specific numerical\nand algorithmic aspects opens up new possibilities to endow complex real-world\nsystems with sophisticated self-optimizing behavior. Towards this goal, it is\nnecessary to understand how numerical optimization algorithms can be converted\ninto feedback controllers to enable robust \"closed-loop optimization\". In this\narticle, we review several research streams that have been pursued in this\ndirection, including extremum seeking and pertinent methods from model\npredictive and process control. However, our focus lies on recent methods under\nthe name of \"feedback-based optimization\". This research stream studies control\ndesigns that directly implement optimization algorithms in closed loop with\nphysical systems. Such ideas are finding widespread application in the design\nand retrofit of control protocols for communication networks and electricity\ngrids. In addition to an overview over continuous-time dynamical systems for\noptimization, our particular emphasis lies on closed-loop stability as well as\nthe enforcement of physical and operational constraints in closed-loop\nimplementations. We further illustrate these methods in the context of\nclassical problems, namely congestion control in communication networks and\noptimal frequency control in electricity grids, and we highlight one potential\nfuture application in the form of autonomous reserve dispatch in power systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 07:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

In particular, for large-scale problems or\nthe convergence error is not very small, i.e., $n \\geq \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}$,\nANITA obtains the \\emph{first} optimal result $O(n)$, matching the lower bound\n$\\Omega(n)$ provided by Woodworth and Srebro (2016), while previous results are\n$O(n \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ of Varag (Lan et al., 2019) and\n$O(\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}})$ of Katyusha (Allen-Zhu, 2017). ii) For strongly\nconvex finite-sum problems, we also show that ANITA can achieve the optimal\nconvergence rate $O\\big((n+\\sqrt{\\frac{nL}{\\mu}})\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\big)$\nmatching the lower bound\n$\\Omega\\big((n+\\sqrt{\\frac{nL}{\\mu}})\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\big)$ provided by\nLan and Zhou (2015).

To explore the co-evolutionary\ndynamics of populations of PRZI traders that dynamically adapt their\nstrategies, I show results from long-term market experiments in which each\ntrader uses a simple stochastic hill-climber algorithm to repeatedly evaluate\nalternative s-values and choose the most profitable at any given time. In these\nexperiments the profitability of any particular s-value may be non-stationary\nbecause the profitability of one trader's strategy at any one time can depend\non the mix of strategies being played by the other traders at that time, which\nare each themselves continuously adapting. Results from these market\nexperiments demonstrate that the population of traders' strategies can exhibit\nrich dynamics, with periods of stability lasting over hundreds of thousands of\ntrader interactions interspersed by occasional periods of change.

The lowly dispersive energy bands along the c-direction\nconfirmed anisotropy in conductivity. The analysis of DOS revealed the dominant\ncontribution from Zr-d orbitals to the conductivity with a small contribution\nfrom the In/Tl-p states contributing at the Fermi level. The Debye temperature\n(Theta-D), minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin), Gruneisen parameter and melting\ntemperature (Tm) have been calculated. The higher values of Theta-D and Tm, and\nlower value of Kmin for Zr2AB2 (A = In, Tl) compared to those of Zr2AC (A = In,\nTl). Besides, the specific heat capacities, thermal expansion coefficient, and\ndifferent thermodynamic potential functions have been calculated. The optical\nconstants have been studied to reveal their possible relevance for application\npurposes. The reflectivity spectra revealed the applicability of Zr2AB2 (A =\nIn, Tl) as cover materials to diminish the solar heating. The studied physical\nproperties of Zr2AB2 (A = In, Tl) are compared with those of other relevant 212\nand 211 MAX phase nanolaminates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 10:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

To address person name recognition in this context, we\npropose a fine-grained annotation scheme based on anthroponymy. To take full\nadvantage of the fine-grained annotations, we propose a Co-guided Neural\nNetwork (CogNN) for person name recognition. CogNN fully explores the\nintra-sentence context and rich training signals of name forms. To better\nutilize the inter-sentence context and implicit relations, which are extremely\nessential for recognizing person names in long documents, we further propose an\nInter-sentence BERT Model (IsBERT).

One way to address these issues is\nensuring data confidentiality using lightweight encryption algorithms for IoT\nprotocols. However, the design and implementation of such protocols is an\nerror-prone task; flaws in the implementation can lead to devastating security\nvulnerabilities. Here we propose a new verification approach named\nEncryption-BMC and Fuzzing (EBF), which combines Bounded Model Checking (BMC)\nand Fuzzing techniques to check for security vulnerabilities that arise from\nconcurrent implementations of cyrptographic protocols, which include data race,\nthread leak, arithmetic overflow, and memory safety. EBF models IoT protocols\nas a client and server using POSIX threads, thereby simulating both entities'\ncommunication. It also employs static and dynamic verification to cover the\nsystem's state-space exhaustively. We evaluate EBF against three benchmarks.\nFirst, we use the concurrency benchmark from SV-COMP and show that it\noutperforms other state-of-the-art tools such as ESBMC, AFL, Lazy-CSeq, and\nTSAN with respect to bug finding. Second, we evaluate an open-source\nimplementation called WolfMQTT. It is an MQTT client implementation that uses\nthe WolfSSL library. We show that \\tool detects a data race bug, which other\napproaches are unable to find.

However, the performance of\nBERT-based models is mainly driven by the enormous amount of parameters, which\nhinders their application to resource-limited scenarios. Faced with this\nproblem, recent studies have been attempting to compress BERT into a\nsmall-scale model. However, most previous work primarily focuses on a single\nkind of compression technique, and few attention has been paid to the\ncombination of different methods. When BERT is compressed with integrated\ntechniques, a critical question is how to design the entire compression\nframework to obtain the optimal performance. In response to this question, we\nintegrate three kinds of compression methods (weight pruning, low-rank\nfactorization and knowledge distillation (KD)) and explore a range of designs\nconcerning model architecture, KD strategy, pruning frequency and learning rate\nschedule. We find that a careful choice of the designs is crucial to the\nperformance of the compressed model.

The methodology relies on a\nmulti-observation approach, consisting in combining multiple independent\nmeasurements into a single dataset, with the aim of over-determining the\nproblem. In the present work, a poroelastic sample is placed in an impedance\ntube and tested in two loading conditions, namely in a rigid-backing\nconfiguration and coupled to a resonant expansion chamber. Given the\nnon-monotonic nature of the experimental data, an incremental parameter\nestimation procedure is used in order to guide the model parameters towards the\nglobal solution without terminating at local minima. A statistical inversion\napproach is also discussed, providing refined point estimates, uncertainty\nranges and parameter correlations. The methodology is applied to the\ncharacterisation of a sample of melamine foam and provides estimates of all\nnine parameters with compact uncertainty ranges. It is shown that the model\nparameters are retrieved with a lower uncertainty in the multi-observation\ncase, as compared with a single-observation case.

Recent metric-based frameworks tend to\nrepresent a support class by a fixed prototype (e.g., the mean of the support\ncategory) and make classification according to the similarities between query\ninstances and support prototypes. However, discriminative dominant regions may\nlocate uncertain areas of images and have various scales, which leads to the\nmisaligned metric. Besides, a fixed prototype for one support category cannot\nfit for all query instances to accurately reflect their distances with this\ncategory, which lowers the efficiency of metric. Therefore, query-specific\ndominant regions in support samples should be extracted for a high-quality\nmetric. To address these problems, we propose a Hierarchical Representation\nbased Query-Specific Prototypical Network (QPN) to tackle the limitations by\ngenerating a region-level prototype for each query sample, which achieves both\npositional and dimensional semantic alignment simultaneously.

Solving coding\nproblems in a short time is important, so these CQAs have a considerable impact\non the software development process.

Semiconcepts of\na context form a pure dBa. The present article is a study on topological\nrepresentation results for dBas, and in particular, those for fully contextual\nand pure dBas. In this work, a context on topological spaces (CTS) is\nconsidered, and the focus is on a special kind of CTS in which the relation\ndefining the context as well as the converse of the relation are continuous\nwith respect to the topologies. Such CTS are denoted as CTSCR. It is observed\nthat clopen object oriented protoconcepts of a CTSCR form a fully contextual\ndBa, while clopen object oriented semiconcepts form a pure dBa. Every dBa is\nshown to be quasi-embeddable into the dBa of clopen object oriented\nprotoconcepts of a particular CTSCR. The quasi-embedding turns into an\nembedding in case of a contextual dBa, and into an isomorphism, when the dBa is\nfully contextual. For pure dBas, one obtains an isomorphism with the algebra of\nclopen object oriented semiconcepts of the CTSCR. Representation of finite dBas\nand Boolean algebras are also addressed in the process. Abstraction of\nproperties of this CTSCR leads to the definition of Stone contexts. Stone\ncontexts and CTSCR- homeomorphisms are seen to form a category, denoted Scxt.\nFurthermore, correspondences are observed between dBa isomorphisms and\nCTSCR-homeomorphisms. This motivates a study of categorical duality of dBas,\nconstituting the second part of the article. Pure dBas and fully contextual\ndBas along with dBa isomorphisms form categories, denoted PDBA and FCDBA\nrespectively. It is established that PDBA is equivalent to FCDBA, while FCDBA\nand PDBA are dually equivalent to Scxt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 13:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 08:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 08:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Methods: The algorithm makes novel use of a Lie-group-based extended\nKalman filter. The algorithm iterates through the prediction (kinematic\nequation), measurement (pelvis position pseudo-measurements, zero-velocity\nupdate, and flat-floor assumption), and constraint update (hinged knee and\nankle joints, constant leg lengths). Results: The inertial motion capture\nalgorithm was extensively evaluated on two datasets showing its performance\nagainst two standard benchmark approaches in optical motion capture (i.e.,\nplug-in gait (commonly used in gait analysis) and a kinematic fit (commonly\nused in animation, robotics, and musculoskeleton simulation)), giving insight\ninto the similarity and differences between the said approaches used in\ndifferent application areas. The overall mean body segment position (relative\nto mid-pelvis origin) and orientation error magnitude of our algorithm ($n=14$\nparticipants) for free walking was $5.93 \\pm 1.33$ cm and $13.43 \\pm\n1.89^\\circ$ when using three IMUs placed on the feet and pelvis, and $6.35 \\pm\n1.20$ cm and $12.71 \\pm 1.60^\\circ$ when using only two IMUs placed on the\nfeet. Conclusion: The algorithm was able to track the joint angles in the\nsagittal plane for straight walking well, but requires improvement for\nunscripted movements (e.g., turning around, side steps), especially for dynamic\nmovements or when considering clinical applications. Significance: This work\nhas brought us closer to comprehensive remote gait monitoring using IMUs on the\nshoes. The low computational cost also suggests that it can be used in\nreal-time with gait assistive devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 13:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Recently, the study on this topic in\naerial images has made tremendous progress. However, complex background and\nworse imaging quality are obvious problems in aerial object detection. Most\nstate-of-the-art approaches tend to develop elaborate attention mechanisms for\nthe space-time feature calibrations with arduous computational complexity,\nwhile surprisingly ignoring the importance of feature calibrations in\nchannel-wise. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nCalibrated-Guidance (CG) scheme to enhance channel communications in a feature\ntransformer fashion, which can adaptively determine the calibration weights for\neach channel based on the global feature affinity correlations. Specifically,\nfor a given set of feature maps, CG first computes the feature similarity\nbetween each channel and the remaining channels as the intermediary calibration\nguidance. Then, re-representing each channel by aggregating all the channels\nweighted together via the guidance operation.

To\ndemonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency, extensive experiments are carried\nout on both oriented object detection task and horizontal object detection task\nin aerial images.

A class of theoretical frameworks -- known as\nelastic models -- attribute this temperature dependence to the variations of\nthe liquid's macroscopic elasticity, quantified by the high-frequency shear\nmodulus $G_\\infty(T)$. While elastic models find some support in a number of\nexperimental studies, these models do not take into account the spatial\nstructures, length scales, and heterogeneity associated with structural\nrelaxation in supercooled liquids. Here, we propose that viscous slowing down\nis controlled by a mesoscopic elastic stiffness $\\kappa(T)$, defined as the\ncharacteristic stiffness of response fields to local dipole forces in the\nliquid's underlying inherent states. First, we show that $\\kappa(T)$ -- which\nis intimately related to the energy and length scales characterizing\nquasilocalized, nonphononic excitations in glasses -- increases more strongly\nwith decreasing $T$ than the macroscopic inherent state shear modulus $G(T)$ in\nseveral computer liquids. Second, we show that the simple relation $\\Delta\nE(T)\\propto\\kappa(T)$ holds remarkably well for some computer liquids, implying\na direct connection between the liquid's underlying mesoscopic elasticity and\nenthalpic energy barriers.

Depending on the size of the Higgs\ntriplet vacuum expectation value, the doubly charged Higgs may decay into a\npair of same-sign charged leptons or a pair of same-sign $W$ bosons. In order\nto explore the discovery potential of the doubly charged Higgs at future\n$e^{-}p$ colliders, we discuss these two decay scenarios in detail and show\nrespectively the detection sensitivity on the mass of the doubly charged Higgs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 14:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Although various screen unlocking technologies, including\nfingerprint and facial recognition, have been widely adopted, they still have\nsome limitations. For example, fingerprints can be stolen by special material\nstickers and facial recognition systems can be cheated by 3D-printed head\nmodels. In this paper, we propose EmgAuth, a novel electromyography(EMG)-based\nsmartphone unlocking system based on the Siamese network. EmgAuth enables users\nto unlock their smartphones by leveraging the EMG data of the smartphone users\ncollected from Myo armbands. When training the Siamese network, we design a\nspecial data augmentation technique to make the system resilient to the\nrotation of the armband, which makes EmgAuth free of calibration. We conduct\nextensive experiments including 53 participants and the evaluation results\nverify that EmgAuth can effectively authenticate users with an average true\nacceptance rate of 91.81% while keeping the average false acceptance rate of\n7.43%. In addition, we also demonstrate that EmgAuth can work well for\nsmartphones with different screen sizes and for different scenarios when users\nare placing smartphones at different locations and with different orientations.\nEmgAuth shows great promise to serve as a good supplement for existing screen\nunlocking systems to improve the safety of smartphones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 07:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Despite\nthe interest of the community in developing new methods for learning molecular\nembeddings and their theoretical benefits, comparing molecular embeddings with\neach other and with traditional representations is not straightforward, which\nin turn hinders the process of choosing a suitable representation for QSAR\nmodeling. A reason behind this issue is the difficulty of conducting a fair and\nthorough comparison of the different existing embedding approaches, which\nrequires numerous experiments on various datasets and training scenarios. To\nclose this gap, we reviewed the literature on methods for molecular embeddings\nand reproduced three unsupervised and two supervised molecular embedding\ntechniques recently proposed in the literature. We compared these five methods\nconcerning their performance in QSAR scenarios using different classification\nand regression datasets. We also compared these representations to traditional\nmolecular representations, namely molecular descriptors and fingerprints. As\nopposed to the expected outcome, our experimental setup consisting of over\n25,000 trained models and statistical tests revealed that the predictive\nperformance using molecular embeddings did not significantly surpass that of\ntraditional representations. While supervised embeddings yielded competitive\nresults compared to those using traditional molecular representations,\nunsupervised embeddings tended to perform worse than traditional\nrepresentations.
