In contrast, there are\nalgorithms that only use motion cues to increase speed, especially for online\napplications. But these algorithms cannot handle occlusions and re-identify\nlost objects. In this paper, a novel online multiple object tracking algorithm\nis presented that only uses geometric cues of objects to tackle the occlusion\nand reidentification challenges simultaneously. As a result, it decreases the\nidentity switch and fragmentation metrics.

To address this underfitting challenge,\nwe first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is\noften bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep\nhierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by\ncapturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end\noptimization of such models is notably difficult.

The AQCM algorithm performs hierarchical clustering in any\ndata set for which there is an associated similarity measure quantifying the\nsimilarity of any data i and data j. Importantly, the method exhibits two\nvaluable performance properties: 1) the ability to automatically return either\na larger or smaller number of clusters depending on the inherent properties of\nthe data rather than on a parameter 2) the ability to return a very large\nnumber of relatively small clusters automatically when such clusters are\nreasonably well defined in a data set. In this work we present the general idea\nof a quasi-clique agglomerative approach, provide the full details of the\nmathematical steps of the AQCM algorithm, and explain some of the motivation\nbehind the new methodology.

In this work we show how Poisson's ratio may be measured during\nnanoindentation experiments by means of a second load actuator oriented\northogonally to the primary vertical load axis. We apply a small oscillating\nlateral load to Berkovich and sphero-conical indenter tips during\nnanoindentation into fused silica and metallic samples. This enables the\nelastic lateral contact stiffness to be measured as a function of depth in a\nmanner analogous to continuous stiffness measurements in conventional\nindentation experiments. The stiffness may in turn be used to calculate v.\nDuring constant strain rate experiments, we extract values of v = 0.16 for\nfused silica and v = 0.34 for polycrystalline aluminium over indentation depths\nof several hundred nanometres. We highlight two critical issues that must be\naddressed to ensure accurate measurement of v during indentation; partial slip\nand additional plasticity brought about through the added shear under\ntangential loading. We study these separate phenomena in fused silica and\nsingle crystal nickel, suggesting that interfacial slip is favoured in harder,\nbrittle materials, while plasticity is dominant in more ductile materials.

Instead of transmitting all\nthe LF views, only a sparse set of reference views are encoded and transmitted,\nwhile the remaining views are synthesized at the decoder side. The transmitted\nviews are encoded using the versatile video coding (VVC) standard and are used\nas reference views to synthesize the dropped views. The selection of\nnon-reference dropped views is performed using a rate-distortion optimization\nbased on the VVC temporal scalability.

VVC\nintroduces several new coding tools providing a significant coding gain over\nthe high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard. It is well known that\nincreasing the coding efficiency adds more dependencies in the video bitstream\nmaking format-compliant encryption with the standard more challenging. In this\npaper we tackle the problem of selective encryption of the VVC standard in\nformat-compliant and constant bitrate. These two constraints ensure that the\nencrypted bitstream can be decoded by any VVC decoder while the bitrate remains\nunchanged by the encryption. The selective encryption of all possible VVC\nsyntax elements is investigated. A new algorithm is proposed to encrypt in\nformat-compliant and constant bitrate the transform coefficients (TCs) together\nwith other syntax elements at the level of the entropy encoder.

Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in terms of\nevaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect\nthe geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance\nof the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a\nloss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, virtual normal\ndirections determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D\nspace, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth\nestimation. Significantly, the virtual normal loss can not only improve the\nperformance of learning metric depth, but also disentangle the scale\ninformation and enrich the model with better shape information. Therefore, when\nnot having access to absolute metric depth training data, we can use virtual\nnormal to learn a robust affine-invariant depth generated on diverse scenes. In\nexperiments, We show state-of-the-art results of learning metric depth on NYU\nDepth-V2 and KITTI.

To tackle these\nissues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR)\nmodule, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint\ninfections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph\nconvolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe\nzones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability,\nwe propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related\npixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware\nfeatures are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream\ntasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to\nhandle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range\ncontextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play,\nwhich can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance.\nExperiments demonstrated that the proposed method consistently boost the\nperformance of state-of-the-art backbone architectures on both of public and\nour private COVID-19 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 02:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Given this\ntension with the standard model, we here examine whether the observed 21-cm\nsignal is instead consistent with the results of recent modeling based on the\nalternative Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the R_h=ct\nuniverse, showing that--in this model--the CMB radiation might have been\nrethermalized by dust ejected into the IGM by the first-generation stars at\nredshift z < 16.

However, there is poor understanding of how organizations implement\nthese practices, of the benefits developers perceive they bring, and of the\nchallenges developers and organizations experience in implementing them. In\nthis paper, we discuss a multiple-case study of three small- to medium-sized\ncompanies using the recommended suite of ten CI practices. Using interviews and\nactivity log mining, we learned that these practices are broadly implemented\nbut how they are implemented varies depending on their perceived benefits, the\ncontext of the project, and the CI tools used by the organization. We also\ndiscovered that CI practices can create new constraints on the software process\nthat hurt feedback cycle time. For researchers, we show that how CI is\nimplemented varies, and thus studying CI (for example, using data mining)\nrequires understanding these differences as important context for research\nstudies. For practitioners, our findings reveal in-depth insights on the\npossible benefits and challenges from using the ten practices, and how project\ncontext matters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 03:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

There has been extensive research in this area, but existing methods\nmeet great challenges in situations with a large proportion of outliers and\ntime constraints, but without good transformation initialization. Recently, a\nseries of learning-based algorithms have been introduced and show advantages in\nspeed. Many of them are based on correspondences between the two point clouds,\nso they do not rely on transformation initialization. However, these\nlearning-based methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect\ncorrespondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matchingbased\nframework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point\nclouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a\nmodule based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix.\nBy using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its\nstructure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing\ncorrespondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the\nnetwork with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test\nstage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one\ncorrespondences so that registration can be performed by singular value\ndecomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate\nedges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the\ncorrespondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy,\npartial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We propose a residual fusion network (RFN) which is based on a residual\narchitecture to replace the traditional fusion approach. A novel\ndetail-preserving loss function, and a feature enhancing loss function are\nproposed to train RFN. The fusion model learning is accomplished by a novel\ntwo-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we train an auto-encoder based\non an innovative nest connection (Nest) concept. Next, the RFN is trained using\nthe proposed loss functions. The experimental results on public domain data\nsets show that, compared with the existing methods, our end-to-end fusion\nnetwork delivers a better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both\nsubjective and objective evaluation. The code of our fusion method is available\nat https://github.com/hli1221/imagefusion-rfn-nest\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 07:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 06:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Inverse Reinforcement Learning is an\neffective way to retrieve reward functions from demonstrations. However, it has\nalways been challenging when applying it to multi-agent settings since the\nmutual influence between agents has to be appropriately modeled. To tackle this\nchallenge, previous work either exploits equilibrium solution concepts by\nassuming humans as perfectly rational optimizers with unbounded intelligence or\npre-assigns humans' interaction strategies a priori. In this work, we advocate\nthat humans are bounded rational and have different intelligence levels when\nreasoning about others' decision-making process, and such an inherent and\nlatent characteristic should be accounted for in reward learning algorithms.\nHence, we exploit such insights from Theory-of-Mind and propose a new\nmulti-agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning framework that reasons about humans'\nlatent intelligence levels during learning. We validate our approach in both\nzero-sum and general-sum games with synthetic agents and illustrate a practical\napplication to learning human drivers' reward functions from real driving data.\nWe compare our approach with two baseline algorithms. The results show that by\nreasoning about humans' latent intelligence levels, the proposed approach has\nmore flexibility and capability to retrieve reward functions that explain\nhumans' driving behaviors better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 07:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

A barrier to constructing these is that strong notions of\nexpansion could not be proven via the spectral expansion paradigm.\n  A very symmetric and structured family of optimal spectral expanders (i.e.,\nRamanujan graphs) was constructed using number theory by Lubotzky, Phillips and\nSarnak, and was subsequently generalized by others. We call such graphs Number\nTheoretic Ramanujan Graphs. These graphs are not only spectrally optimal, but\nalso posses strong symmetries and rich structure. Thus, it has been widely\nconjectured that number theoretic Ramanujan graphs are lossless expanders, or\nat least unique neighbor expanders.\n  In this work we disprove this conjecture, by showing that there are number\ntheoretic Ramanujan graphs that are not even unique neighbor expanders. This is\ndone by introducing a new combinatorial paradigm that we term the closed orbit\nmethod.\n  The closed orbit method allows one to construct finite combinatorial objects\nwith extermal substructures. This is done by observing that there exist\ninfinite combinatorial structures with extermal substructures, coming from an\naction of a subgroup of the automorphism group of the structure. The crux of\nour idea is a systematic way to construct a finite quotient of the infinite\nstructure containing a simple shadow of the infinite substructure, which\nmaintains its extermal combinatorial property.\n  Other applications of the method are to the edge expansion of number\ntheoretic Ramanujan graphs and vertex expansion of Ramanujan complexes.\nFinally, in the field of graph quantum ergodicity we produce number theoretic\nRamanujan graphs with an eigenfunction of small support that corresponds to the\nzero eigenvalue. This again contradicts common expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 09:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 11:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

This helps\nreduce the chances of issues such as load frequency control and the chances of\nelectricity blackouts. To gain a better understanding of the load that is\nlikely to be required over the next 24h, estimations under uncertainty are\nneeded. This is especially difficult in a decentralized electricity market with\nmany micro-producers which are not under central control.\n  In this paper, we investigate the impact of eleven offline learning and five\nonline learning algorithms to predict the electricity demand profile over the\nnext 24h. We achieve this through integration within the long-term agent-based\nmodel, ElecSim. Through the prediction of electricity demand profile over the\nnext 24h, we can simulate the predictions made for a day-ahead market. Once we\nhave made these predictions, we sample from the residual distributions and\nperturb the electricity market demand using the simulation, ElecSim. This\nenables us to understand the impact of errors on the long-term dynamics of a\ndecentralized electricity market.\n  We show we can reduce the mean absolute error by 30% using an online\nalgorithm when compared to the best offline algorithm, whilst reducing the\nrequired tendered national grid reserve required. This reduction in national\ngrid reserves leads to savings in costs and emissions. We also show that large\nerrors in prediction accuracy have a disproportionate error on investments made\nover a 17-year time frame, as well as electricity mix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 11:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

To address this issue, instead of learning the pose invariant\nfeatures, DistSTN newly involves an elaborated feature disentangling model to\nseparate the learned pose factors of a SAR target from the identity ones so\nthat they can independently control the representation process of the target\nimage. To disentangle the explainable pose factors, we develop a pose\ndiscrepancy spatial transformer module in DistSTN to characterize the intrinsic\ntransformation between the factors of two different targets with an explicit\ngeometric model.

However,\ndue to the diffraction limit, sub-micron/nanometer features are difficult to\nresolve. While various super-resolution techniques are developed to achieve\nnanometer-scale resolution, they often either require expensive optical setup\nor specialized fluorophores. In recent years, deep learning has shown the\npotentials to reduce the technical barrier and obtain super-resolution from\ndiffraction-limited images. For accurate results, conventional deep learning\ntechniques require thousands of images as a training dataset. Obtaining large\ndatasets from biological samples is not often feasible due to the\nphotobleaching of fluorophores, phototoxicity, and dynamic processes occurring\nwithin the organism. Therefore, achieving deep learning-based super-resolution\nusing small datasets is challenging. We address this limitation with a new\nconvolutional neural network-based approach that is successfully trained with\nsmall datasets and achieves super-resolution images.

Slingshot spiders\nare characterized by their ultrafast launch speeds and accelerations (exceeding\n1300 $m/s^2$), however a theoretical approach to characterize the underlying\nspatiotemporal web dynamics remains missing. To address this knowledge gap, we\ndevelop a 2D-coupled damped oscillator model of the web. Our model reveals\nthree key insights into the dynamics of slingshot motion. First, the tension\nline plays a dual role: enabling the spider to load elastic energy into the web\nfor a quick launch (in milliseconds) to displacements of 10-15 body lengths,\nbut also enabling the spider to halt quickly, attenuating inertial\noscillations. Second, the dominant energy dissipation mechanism is viscous drag\nby the silk lines - acting as a low Reynolds number parachute. Third, the web\nexhibits underdamped oscillatory dynamics through a finely-tuned balance\nbetween the radial line forces, the tension line force and viscous drag\ndissipation. Together, our work suggests that the conical geometry and\ntension-line enables the slingshot web to act as both an elastic spring and a\nshock absorber, for the multi-functional roles of risky predation and\nself-preservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 11:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be\nadministered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere\nto social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? To\naddress this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread\nincorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We\nuse this model to study two important measures of disease control and\neradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive\ncare unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence,\nvaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to\nthe slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by\na large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the\npopulation becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast,\nwith reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly\nexceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life.

Insulin\ndosages and carbohydrate consumption are important considerations in managing\nBGLs. Since the 1960s, models have been developed to forecast blood glucose\nlevels based on the history of BGLs, insulin dosages, carbohydrate intake, and\nother physiological and lifestyle factors. Such predictions can be used to\nalert people of impending unsafe BGLs or to control insulin flow in an\nartificial pancreas. In past work, we have introduced an LSTM-based approach to\nblood glucose level prediction aimed at \"what if\" scenarios, in which people\ncould enter foods they might eat or insulin amounts they might take and then\nsee the effect on future BGLs. In this work, we invert the \"what-if\" scenario\nand introduce a similar architecture based on chaining two LSTMs that can be\ntrained to make either insulin or carbohydrate recommendations aimed at\nreaching a desired BG level in the future. Leveraging a recent state-of-the-art\nmodel for time series forecasting, we then derive a novel architecture for the\nsame recommendation task, in which the two LSTM chain is used as a repeating\nblock inside a deep residual architecture. Experimental evaluations using real\npatient data from the OhioT1DM dataset show that the new integrated\narchitecture compares favorably with the previous LSTM-based approach,\nsubstantially outperforming the baselines. The promising results suggest that\nthis novel approach could potentially be of practical use to people with type 1\ndiabetes for self-management of BGLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 19:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}
