The distinction\nbetween the two approaches lies in the fact that the indirect approach involves\nidentifying a lower dimensional model from data which is then used in a\ncertainty-equivalent control design, while the direct approach avoids this\nintermediate step altogether. Working within an optimization-based framework,\nwe find that the suboptimality gap measuring the control performance w.r.t. the\noptimal model-based control design vanishes with the size of the dataset only\nwith the direct approach. The indirect approach has a higher rate of\nconvergence, but its suboptimality gap does not vanish as the size of the\ndataset increases. This reveals the existence of two distinct regimes of\nperformance as the size of the dataset of input-output behaviors is increased.\nWe show that the indirect approach, by relying on the identification of a lower\ndimensional model, has lower variance and outperforms the direct approach for\nsmaller datasets, while it incurs an asymptotic bias as a result of the process\nnoise and a (possibly) incorrect assumption on the order of the identified\nmodel. The direct approach, however, does not incur an asymptotic bias, and\noutperforms the indirect approach for larger datasets. Ultimately, by revealing\nthe existence of two non-asymptotic regimes for the performance of direct and\nindirect data-driven predictive control designs, our study suggests that\nneither approach is invariably superior and that the choice of design must, in\npractice, be informed by the available dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 16:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 19:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

Recently,\nadversarial attack has been applied to visual object tracking to evaluate the\nrobustness of deep trackers. Assuming that the model structures of deep\ntrackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking\nhave demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep\ntrackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose\na decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In\ncontrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static\nimages for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially\ngenerates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and\nhistorical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method\ndegrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object\nmotions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the\nnext few frames to initialize temporal motion attack. We validate the proposed\nIoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based,\ncorrelation filter based, and long-term trackers). Extensive experiments on the\nbenchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IoU attack\nmethod.

Hence we\nmay be able to make a crucial distinction between formation through core\naccretion (CA) or the gravitational instability (GI), as CA formation\ntimescales are typically Myrs whilst formation through GI will occur within the\nfirst $\\approx10^4-10^5$yrs of disc evolution.

We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to determine the\nsystem's critical disc mass for fragmentation, finding $M_{\\rm\nd,crit}=0.3$M$_{\\odot}$. Viscous evolution models of the disc's mass history\nindicate that it was likely massive enough to exceed $M_{\\rm d,crit}$ in the\nrecent past, thus it is possible that a young AB Aurigae disc may have\nfragmented to form multiple giant gaseous protoplanets.

During training, the novelty class is\nabsent, preventing the use of traditional classification approaches. Deep\nautoencoders have been widely used as a base of many unsupervised novelty\ndetection methods. In particular, context autoencoders have been successful in\nthe novelty detection task because of the more effective representations they\nlearn by reconstructing original images from randomly masked images. However, a\nsignificant drawback of context autoencoders is that random masking fails to\nconsistently cover important structures of the input image, leading to\nsuboptimal representations - especially for the novelty detection task. In this\npaper, to optimize input masking, we have designed a framework consisting of\ntwo competing networks, a Mask Module and a Reconstructor. The Mask Module is a\nconvolutional autoencoder that learns to generate optimal masks that cover the\nmost important parts of images. Alternatively, the Reconstructor is a\nconvolutional encoder-decoder that aims to reconstruct unperturbed images from\nmasked images. The networks are trained in an adversarial manner in which the\nMask Module generates masks that are applied to images given to the\nReconstructor. In this way, the Mask Module seeks to maximize the\nreconstruction error that the Reconstructor is minimizing. When applied to\nnovelty detection, the proposed approach learns semantically richer\nrepresentations compared to context autoencoders and enhances novelty detection\nat test time through more optimal masking. Novelty detection experiments on the\nMNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's\nsuperiority over cutting-edge methods. In a further experiment on the UCSD\nvideo dataset for novelty detection, the proposed approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 17:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 07:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 04:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

This yield-criterion function governs the plastic evolution of the\nfluid-solid mixture. Fluid storage and transport are described by a\nDarcy-Biot-type formulation. Thereby the fluid storage is decomposed into a\ncontribution due to the elastic deformations and one due to the plastic\ndeformations. A local return mapping scheme is used for the update of the\nplastic quantities. The global minimization structure demands a\n$H($div$)$-conforming finite-element formulation. Furthermore this is combined\nwith an enhanced-assumed-strain formulation in order to overcome locking\nphenomena arising from the plastic deformations. The robustness and\ncapabilities of the presented framework will be shown in a sequence of\nnumerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 19:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

However, in other domains, like image\nclassification, DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations, which consist of imperceptible crafted noise that when added to\nthe data fools the model into misclassification. This puts into question the\nsecurity of DNNs in communication tasks, and in particular in modulation\nrecognition. We propose a novel framework to test the robustness of current\nstate-of-the-art models where the adversarial perturbation strength is\ndependent on the signal strength and measured with the \"signal to perturbation\nratio\" (SPR). We show that current state-of-the-art models are susceptible to\nthese perturbations.

When analyzing these vulnerable models we found that\nadversarial perturbations do not shift the symbols towards the nearest classes\nin constellation space. This shows that DNNs do not base their decisions on\nsignal statistics that are important for the Bayes-optimal modulation\nrecognition model, but spurious correlations in the training data.

NMR software should allow researchers to flexibly implement\nvarious functionality according to the requirement of applications. Scripting\nsystem can offer an open environment for NMR users to write custom programs\nwith basic libraries. Emerging technologies, especially multivariate\nstatistical analysis and artificial intelligence, have been successfully\napplied to NMR applications such as metabolomics and biomacromolecules.\nScripting system should support more complex NMR libraries, which will enable\nthe emerging technologies to be easily implemented in the scripting\nenvironment. Result: Here, a novel NMR scripting system named \"NMRPy\" is\nintroduced. In the scripting system, both Java based NMR methods and original\nCPython based libraries are supported. A module was built as a bridge to\nintegrate the runtime environment of Java and CPython.

However, those\nmethods focus on arithmetic accelerations and overlook the benefits of the\nunderlying system's structure. In particular, the existing decoupled\nsoftware-hardware algorithm design that naively parallelizes the arithmetic\noperations by the hardware does not tackle the hardware overheads such as\nCPU-GPU and thread-to-thread communications in a principled manner. Also, the\nadvantages of parallelizable subproblem decomposition in distributed MPC are\nnot well recognized and exploited.

This gap between practice and theory is a central problem in\nsolver research. It is believed that SAT solvers exploit structure inherent in\nindustrial instances, and hence there have been numerous attempts over the last\n25 years at characterizing this structure via parameters. These can be\nclassified as rigorous, i.e., they serve as a basis for complexity-theoretic\nupper bounds (e.g., backdoors), or correlative, i.e., they correlate well with\nsolver run time and are observed in industrial instances (e.g., community\nstructure). Unfortunately, no parameter proposed to date has been shown to be\nboth strongly correlative and rigorous over a large fraction of industrial\ninstances. Given the sheer difficulty of the problem, we aim for an\nintermediate goal of proposing a set of parameters that is strongly correlative\nand has good theoretical properties. Specifically, we propose parameters based\non a graph partitioning called Hierarchical Community Structure (HCS), which\ncaptures the recursive community structure of a graph of a Boolean formula. We\nshow that HCS parameters are strongly correlative with solver run time using an\nEmpirical Hardness Model, and further build a classifier based on HCS\nparameters that distinguishes between easy industrial and hard random/crafted\ninstances with very high accuracy. We further strengthen our hypotheses via\nscaling studies.

Many buildings that must\nundergo deep energy renovation are old and may lack design/renovation\ndocumentation, or possible degradation of materials might have occurred in\nbuilding elements over time. Thermal transmittance (i.e. U-value) is one of the\nmost important parameters for determining the transmission heat losses through\nbuilding envelope elements. It depends on the thickness and thermal properties\nof all the materials that form a building element. In-situ U-value can be\ndetermined by ISO 9869-1 standard (Heat Flux Method - HFM). Still, measurement\nduration is one of the reasons why HFM is not widely used in field testing\nbefore the renovation design process commences. This paper analyzes the\npossibility of reducing the measurement time by conducting parallel\nmeasurements with one heat-flux sensor. This parallelization could be achieved\nby applying a specific class of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on HFM\nresults to predict unknown heat flux based on collected interior and exterior\nair temperatures. After the satisfying prediction is achieved, HFM sensor can\nbe relocated to another measuring location.

This paper takes the first step towards\nunderstanding stability guarantees for nonlinear RHC when the inner planning\nproblem is solved to first-order stationary points, but not necessarily global\noptima. Special attention is given to feedback linearizable systems, and a\nmixture of positive and negative results are provided. We establish that, under\ncertain strong conditions, first-order solutions to RHC exponentially stabilize\nlinearizable systems.

However, unlike point-to-plane variants of\niterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric\ninformation such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent\npoint drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models\n(GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM\ncomponents which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two\npoint clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local\nSurface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method\nadaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the\npoint-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This\nresults in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point\ncloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve\nit with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we\ndemonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations\nand efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained\noptimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid\ntransformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various\ndatasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs. Also, it is\nsignificantly faster than modern implementations of CPD.

Although\na lot of efforts have been made, such as heteroscedastic neural networks\n(HNNs), little work has demonstrated satisfactory practicability due to the\ndifferent levels of compromise on learning efficiency, quality of uncertainty\nestimates, and predictive performance. Moreover, existing HNNs typically fail\nto construct an explicit interaction between the prediction and its associated\nuncertainty. This paper aims to remedy these issues by developing SDE-HNN, a\nnew heteroscedastic neural network equipped with stochastic differential\nequations (SDE) to characterize the interaction between the predictive mean and\nvariance of HNNs for accurate and reliable regression. Theoretically, we show\nthe existence and uniqueness of the solution to the devised neural SDE.\nMoreover, based on the bias-variance trade-off for the optimization in SDE-HNN,\nwe design an enhanced numerical SDE solver to improve the learning stability.\nFinally, to more systematically evaluate the predictive uncertainty, we present\ntwo new diagnostic uncertainty metrics.

For the noise energy bounded case, the observability\nellipsoid and the image observability ellipsoid are defined by the state\nobserved error and then a novel concept on the LDT systems, called as the\nobserve ability, is proposed.

Generally,\npristine Ag2Se exhibits unusual low thermal conductivity along with high\nelectrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which leads to high\nthermoelectric performance (n-type) at room temperature. Herein, we report a\npseudoternary phase, Ag2Se0.5Te0.25S0.25, which shows improved thermoelectric\nperformance (zT ~ 2.1 at 400 K). Density functional theory reveals that the\nRashba type of spin-dependent band spitting originated because of Te-doping,\nenhancing carrier mobility. Using density functional perturbation theory, we\nhereby realize that the intrinsic carrier mobility is not only controlled by\ncarrier effective mass, neither deformation potential theory, instead it is\nsubstantially limited by longitudinal optical phonon scattering. In fact,\nlocally off-centered S atoms and rising configurational entropy via\nsubstitution of Te and S atoms in Ag2Se significantly reduce the lattice\nthermal conductivity (klat ~ 0.34 at 400 K). In order to accurately obtain\nelectrical as well as thermal transport coefficient, we adopt deformation\npotential theory based on Boltzmann transport formalism. The combined\nconsequence of the Rashba effect coupled with configurational entropy\nsynergistically results in such high thermoelectric performance with the\ndevelopment of new n-type thermoelectric material working at the\nnear-room-temperature regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 05:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

To\naddress this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature\nlearning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders\nare applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage\nthe multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded\nfeatures to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of\nsome views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner,\npseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform\nmulti-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global\ndiscriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more\ndiscriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target\ndistribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn\nconsistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency\nof multiple views while preserving their features' diversity.

A\nbiosignature is a measured parameter that has a high probability of being\ncaused by the living organisms, either atmospheric gas species or some surface\nfeatures. Therefore, the focus of a search is on a product or phenomena\nproduced by the living systems, mostly by microorganisms as these are the most\nabundant on our planet like, say, methane.

A biosignature is what living\norganisms produce - a bioproduct, while a bioindicator may be anything\nnecessary for life as we know it, such as water or a rocky planet. Oxygen in\nthis case is a double biomarker; first, it is a byproduct of oxygenic\nphotosynthesis and, second, it is a signature of a complex life, because\ncomplex highly organized life requires high levels of oxygen. It is possible\nthat there are other such bioindicators. For example, in the atmospheric\ncompositions of terrestrial planets in our Solar System (including Titan),\nargon is one of the major constituents, moreover it was recently acknowledged\nto be a `biologically' active gas, exhibiting organprotective and\nneuroprotective properties, especially under hypoxic conditions.

We reveal that the band\ncrossings around the Fermi level form three groups of nodal lines protected by\nthe spacetime inversion symmetry, each carrying a quantized $\\pi$ Berry phase.\nOur result suggests that the local correlation strength in these materials\nappears to be too weak to generate unconventional superconductivity, and\nnon-local electronic correlation might be crucial in this kagome system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 08:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 04:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, numerous\npropositions exist in the literature with varying degrees of sophistication and\ncomplexity that illustrate how algorithms and models can be designed for making\nefficient, accurate, and robust predictions of stock prices. We present a gamut\nof ten deep learning models of regression for precise and robust prediction of\nthe future prices of the stock of a critical company in the auto sector of\nIndia. Using a very granular stock price collected at 5 minutes intervals, we\ntrain the models based on the records from 31st Dec, 2012 to 27th Dec, 2013.\nThe testing of the models is done using records from 30th Dec, 2013 to 9th Jan\n2015.

However, existing attention\nmechanisms only concentrate on refining the features inside each sample and\nneglect the discrimination between different samples. In this paper, we propose\na batch aware attention module (BA2M) for feature enrichment from a distinctive\nperspective. More specifically, we first get the sample-wise attention\nrepresentation (SAR) by fusing the channel, local spatial and global spatial\nattention maps within each sample. Then, we feed the SARs of the whole batch to\na normalization function to get the weights for each sample. The weights serve\nto distinguish the features' importance between samples in a training batch\nwith different complexity of content. The BA2M could be embedded into different\nparts of CNN and optimized with the network in an end-to-end manner. The design\nof BA2M is lightweight with few extra parameters and calculations. We validate\nBA2M through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K for the image\nrecognition task. The results show that BA2M can boost the performance of\nvarious network architectures and outperforms many classical attention methods.\nBesides, BA2M exceeds traditional methods of re-weighting samples based on the\nloss value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 10:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches are proposed based\non taking a matching network with a heavy structure to distinguish the target\nfrom other objects in the area which indeed drastically downgrades the\nperformance of the tracker in terms of speed. Besides, several candidates are\nconsidered and processed to localize the intended object in a region of\ninterest for each frame which is time-consuming. In this article, a special\narchitecture is proposed based on which in contrast to the previous approaches,\nit is possible to identify the object location in a single shot while taking\nits template into account to distinguish it from the similar objects in the\nsame area. In brief, first of all, a window containing the object with twice\nthe target size is considered. This window is then fed into a fully\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) to extract a region of interest (RoI) in a\nform of a matrix for each of the frames. In the beginning, a template of the\ntarget is also taken as the input to the CNN. Considering this RoI matrix, the\nnext movement of the tracker is determined based on a simple and fast method.\nMoreover, this matrix helps to estimate the object size which is crucial when\nit changes over time. Despite the absence of a matching network, the presented\ntracker performs comparatively with the SOTA in challenging situations while\nhaving a super speed compared to them (up to $120 FPS$ on 1080ti).

We present pre-shape gradient system modifications, which permit\nsimultaneous shape optimization with mesh quality improvement. Optimal shapes\nto the original problem are left invariant under regularization. The\ncomputational burden of our approach is limited, since additional solution of\npossibly larger (non-)linear systems for regularized shape gradients is not\nnecessary. We implement and compare pre-shape gradient regularization\napproaches for a hard to solve 2D problem. As our approach does not depend on\nthe choice of metrics representing shape gradients, we employ and compare\nseveral different metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 11:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

While GMP is satisfied in both classical and quantum theories, we show,\nwithin the framework of general probabilistic theories, that it imposes strong\nrestrictions on the law of physics. First, the measurement uncertainty of a\npair of observables cannot be significantly larger than the preparation\nuncertainty. Consequently, the strength of the CHSH nonlocality cannot be\nmaximal. The parameter in the stretched quantum theory, a family of general\nprobabilistic theories that includes the quantum theory, is also limited.\nSecond, the conditional entropy defined in terms of a data compression theorem\nsatisfies the chain inequality.

Here we reconstruct individual cycles for the last millennium\nusing recent 14C data and state-of-the-art models. Starting with the 14C\nproduction rate determined from the so far most precise measurements of\nradiocarbon content in tree rings, solar activity is reconstructed in three\nphysics-based steps: (1) Correction of the 14C production rate for the changing\ngeomagnetic field; (2) Computation of the open solar magnetic flux; and (3)\nConversion into sunspot numbers outside of grand minima. Solar activity is\nreconstructed for the period 971-1900 (85 individual cycles). This more than\ndoubles the number of solar cycles known from direct solar observations. We\nfound that lengths and strengths of well-defined cycles outside grand minima\nare consistent with those obtained from the direct sunspot observations after\n1750. The validity of the Waldmeier rule is confirmed at a highly significant\nlevel. Solar activity is found to be in a deep grand minimum when the activity\nis mostly below the sunspot formation threshold, during about 250 years.\nTherefore, although considerable cyclic variability in 14C is seen even during\ngrand minima, individual solar cycles can hardly be reliably resolved therein.\nThree potential solar particle events, ca. 994, 1052 and 1279 AD, are shown. A\nnew about 1000-year long solar activity reconstruction, in the form of annual\n(pseudo) sunspot numbers with full assessment of uncertainties, is presented\nbased on new high-precision 14C measurements and state-of-the-art models, more\nthan doubling the number of individually resolved solar cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 12:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

We estimate the brightness temperature from the dayside\n(Tday=3186+-677 K) and from the quadrature spectrum (Tquad=2124+-417 K) and\ncombine them to constrain the energy budget of the planet. We compare our\nextracted relative spectra to global circulation models of this planet, which\nare generally found to be a good match. However, we do see tentative evidence\nof a steeper spectral slope in the measured dayside spectrum compared to our\nmodels. We find that we cannot match this increased slope by increasing optical\nopacities in our models. We also find that this spectral slope is unlikely to\nbe explained by a non-equilibrium water abundance, as water advected from the\nnightside is quickly dissociated on the dayside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 13:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

In the present paper we use inelastic neutron scattering supported\nby magnetization and specific heat measurements to study the spin dynamics in\nthe hard-axis ferromagnet CeAgSb2. In the zero field state we observed two\nsharp magnon modes, which are associated with Ce ordering and extended up to\n$\\approx 3 meV with a considerable spin gap of 0.6 meV. Application of a\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the moment direction reduces the spectral\nintensity and suppresses the gap and significantly enhances the low-temperature\nspecific heat at a critical field of Bc ~ 2.8 T via a mean-field-like\ntransition. Above the transition, in the field polarized state, the gap\neventually reopens due to the Zeeman effect. We modeled the observed dispersion\nusing linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) taking into account the ground state Gamma\n6 doublet and exchange anisotropy. Our model correctly captures the essential\nfeatures of the spin dynamics including magnetic dispersion, distribution of\nthe spectral intensity as well as the field-induced behavior, although several\nminor features remain obscure. The observed spectra do not show significant\nbroadening due to the finite lifetime of the quasiparticles.

The calculated in-plane $d_{22}$ value of\n0.557 pm/V is small. However, more excitingly, the out-of-plane $d_{31}$ is as\nhigh as 1.138 pm/V, which is obviously higher compared with ones of other 2D\nknown materials.

An\nimportant result was the finding that dust grains of mm size are embedded in\nvery thin dusty disks. This implies that the dust mass fraction in the midplane\nbecomes comparable to the gas, increasing the importance of the interaction\nbetween the two components there. We address this problem by means of numerical\n2.5D simulations in order to study the gas and dust interaction in fully global\nstratified disks. To this purpose, we employ the recently developed dust grain\nmodule in the PLUTO code. Our model focuses on a typical T Tauri disk model,\nsimulating a short patch of the disk at 10 au which includes grains of constant\nStokes number of $St=0.01$ and $St=0.1$, corresponding to grains with sizes of\n0.9 cm and 0.9 mm, respectively, for the given disk model. By injecting a\nconstant pebble flux at the outer domain, the system reaches a quasi steady\nstate of turbulence and dust concentrations driven by the streaming\ninstability. For our given setup and using resolutions up to 2500 cells per\nscale height we resolve the streaming instability, leading to local dust\nclumping and concentrations. Our results show dust density values of around\n10-100 times the gas density with a steady state pebble flux between $3.5\n\\times 10^{-4}$ and $2.5 \\times 10^{-3} M_{\\rm Earth}/\\mathit{year}$ for the\nmodels with $\\mathit{St}=0.01$ and $\\mathit{St}=0.1$. The grain size and pebble\nflux for model $\\mathit{St}=0.01$ compares well with dust evolution models of\nthe first million years of disk evolution. For those grains the scatter opacity\ndominates the extinction coefficient at mm wavelengths. These types of global\ndust and gas simulations are a promising tool for studies of the gas and dust\nevolution at pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 14:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

We concentrate here on optically\ninduced, electrical and thermal effects. The parallel plate cells were made of\ntwo transparent electrodes (ITO), each covered with semiconductor-embedded,\nactive carbon (A-C) layer. While A-C appears black, it is not an ideal\nblackbody absorber that absorbs all spectral light indiscriminately. In\naddition to relatively flat optical absorption background, A-C exhibits two\ndistinct absorption bands: in the near-IR and in the blue. The first may be\nattributed to absorption by OH- group and the latter, by scattering, possibly\nby surface plasmons. Here, optical and thermal effects of sub-micron size SiC\nparticles that are embedded in A-C electrode, are presented. Similarly to\nnano-Si particles, SiC exhibits blue band absorption, but it is less likely to\noxidize. Using Charge-Discharge (CD) experiments, the relative optically\nrelated capacitance increase may be as large as ~34% (68% when the illuminated\narea is taken into account). Capacitance increase was noted as the illuminated\nsamples became hotter. This thermal effect amounts to 20% of the overall\nrelative change using CD experiments.

The\nenergy confinement time $\\tau_E$ in tokamaks and stellarators is empirically\ngyro-Bohm with an approximate factor of two between the best and worse results\nused to construct scaling laws. Gyro-Bohm is also the approximate level of\ntransport needed in a power plant. What has received little study are\n$\\tau_t/\\tau_E$, the ratio of the tritium to the energy confinement time, and\n$\\tau_\\alpha/\\tau_E$, the ratio of the alpha particle to the energy confinement\ntime. The tritium burn fraction is proportional to $\\tau_t/\\tau_E$, so the\nlarger the better. The contamination of the plasma by helium ash is\nproportional to $\\tau_\\alpha/\\tau_E$, so the smaller the better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 19:33:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 00:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}
