As the described system presents a\nstick-slip phenomenon, the mass may then periodically sticks to the ground. The\nobjective consists of developing numerically tractable conditions ensuring the\nglobal asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium point. The proposed\napproach merges two intermediate results: The first one relies on the\ncharacterization of an attractor around the origin, to which converges the\nclosed-loop trajectories. The second result assesses the regional asymptotic\nstability of the equilibrium point by estimating its basin of attraction. The\nmain result relies on conditions allowing to ensure that the attractor issued\nfrom the first result is included in the basin of attraction of the origin\ncomputed from the second result. An illustrative example draws the interest of\nthe approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 16:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

On the one hand, we can explicitly implement\ndomain-knowledge or physical priors such as anticipating that vehicles will\nfollow the middle of the roads. While this perspective leads to feasible\noutputs, it has limited performance due to the difficulty to hand-craft complex\ninteractions in urban environments. On the other hand, recent works use\ndata-driven approaches which can learn complex interactions from the data\nleading to superior performance. However, generalization, \\textit{i.e.}, having\naccurate predictions on unseen data, is an issue leading to unrealistic\noutputs. In this paper, we propose to learn a \"Realistic Residual Block\" (RRB),\nwhich effectively connects these two perspectives.

The common choice is to minimize the minimum detection time (MDT)\naveraged over a set of contamination events, with contaminant injected at a\ndifferent location. Given a SP, propagation is simulated through a hydraulic\nsoftware model of the network to obtain spatio-temporal concentrations and the\naverage MDT. Searching for an optimal SP is NP-hard: even for mid-size\nnetworks, efficient search methods are required, among which evolutionary\napproaches are often used. A bi-objective formalization is proposed: minimizing\nthe average MDT and its standard deviation, that is the risk to detect some\ncontamination event too late than the average MDT.

While there are many approaches to quantify\nperformance in standard crisp segmentation schemes, drawing hard boundaries in\nremote sensing imagery where gradients and regions of uncertainty exist is\ninappropriate. These cases warrant weak labels and an associated appropriate\nscoring approach. In this paper, a labeling approach and associated modified\nversion of the Rand index for weakly-labeled data is introduced to address\nthese issues.

In the context of multi-hop\nnetworks, which is a classic example for multi-party communication, recent\nstudies have shown that automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based decode-and-forward\n(DF) strategies are suitable for URLLC since the idea of distributing a given\nnumber of ARQs across the nodes provides fine control on the features of\nreliability and latency. Inspired by these developments, in this work, we\npropose a cooperative ARQ sharing strategy for URLLC in multi-hop networks. At\nthe heart of the proposed scheme lies the idea that every node is given the\nknowledge of the number of ARQs allotted to its preceding node in addition to\nthe ARQs allotted to itself. As a result, each node only needs to count the\nnumber of unsuccessful attempts of its preceding node, and then borrow the\nunused ARQs, thereby improving the reliability feature with no compromise in\nthe latency constraint. Using packet-drop-probability (PDP) as the reliability\nmetric for the proposed cooperative strategy, we formulate an optimization\nproblem of minimizing the PDP subject to a sum constraint on the total number\nof ARQs allotted across all the nodes. Supported by theoretical analysis on the\nbehavior of PDP, we present low-complexity algorithms to compute near-optimal\nARQ distributions for our strategy, and show that our strategy outperforms the\nexisting non-cooperative strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 16:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

However it is currently not\nknown whether such robots exist, and, if they do, how to design them. Since\nself similar structures in nature often exhibit self similar behavior at\ndifferent scales, we hypothesize that there may exist robot designs that have\nthe same property. Here we demonstrate that this is indeed the case for some,\nbut not all, modular soft robots: there are robot designs that exhibit a\ndesired behavior at a small size scale, and if copies of that robot are\nattached together to realize the same design at higher scales, those larger\nrobots exhibit similar behavior. We show how to find such designs in simulation\nusing an evolutionary algorithm. Further, when fractal attachment is not\nassumed and attachment geometries must thus be evolved along with the design of\nthe base robot unit, scale invariant behavior is not achieved, demonstrating\nthat structural self similarity, when combined with appropriate designs, is a\nuseful path to realizing scale invariant robot behavior. We validate our\nfindings by demonstrating successful transferal of self similar structure and\nbehavior to pneumatically-controlled soft robots. Finally, we show that biobots\ncan spontaneously exhibit self similar attachment geometries, thereby\nsuggesting that self similar behavior via self similar structure may be\nrealizable across a wide range of robot platforms in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 16:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 04:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

State-of-the-art approaches to social navigation fall\ninto two categories: model-based social constraints and learning-based\napproaches. While effective, these approaches have fundamental limitations --\nmodel-based approaches require constraint and parameter tuning to adapt to\npreferences and new scenarios, while learning-based approaches require reward\nfunctions, significant training data, and are hard to adapt to new social\nscenarios or new domains with limited demonstrations.

We also find that the model\nunder-predicts the observed X-ray to UV time-lags, but this difference is\nprobably due to the broad X-ray auto-correlation function of these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 16:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Quantum coherence of an arbitrary qubit state can be created at\na remote location using maximally entangled state, local operation and\nclassical communication.

We find that when the\nindefinite causal order of channels act on one-half of the entangled pair, then\nthe shared state looses entanglement, but can retain non-zero quantum discord.\nThis finding may have some interesting applications on its own where discord\ncan be consumed as a resource.

With the aid of the notion called\ndominant asset, it is known that the optimal ELG level is achieved by investing\nall available funds on that asset. However, such an \"all-in\" strategy is\narguably too risky to implement in practice. Motivated by this issue, we study\nthe case where the portfolio weights are chosen in a rather ad-hoc manner and a\nbuy-and-hold strategy is subsequently used. Then we show that, if the\nunderlying portfolio contains a dominant asset, buy and hold on that specific\nasset is asymptotically log-optimal with a sublinear rate of convergence. This\nresult also extends to the scenario where a trader either does not have a\nprobabilistic model for the returns or does not trust a model obtained from\nhistorical data. To be more specific, we show that if a market contains a\ndominant asset, buy and hold a market portfolio involving nonzero weights for\neach asset is asymptotically log-optimal. Additionally, this paper also\nincludes a conjecture regarding the property called high-frequency maximality.\nThat is, in the absence of transaction costs, high-frequency rebalancing is\nunbeatable in the ELG sense. Support for the conjecture, involving a lemma for\na weak version of the conjecture, is provided. This conjecture, if true,\nenables us to improve the log-optimality result obtained previously. Finally, a\nresult that indicates a way regarding an issue about when should one to\nrebalance their portfolio if needed, is also provided.

This is achieved by offloading computationally\nintensive workloads, such as deep learning from user devices to the edge. Using\nthe edge reduces the overall communication latency of applications as workloads\ncan be processed closer to where data is generated on user devices rather than\nsending them to geographically distant clouds. Specialised hardware\naccelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) available in the\ncloud-edge network can enhance the performance of computationally intensive\nworkloads that are offloaded from devices on to the edge. The underlying\napproach required to facilitate this is virtualization of GPUs. This paper\ntherefore sets out to investigate the potential of GPU accelerator\nvirtualization to improve the performance of deep learning workloads in a\ncloud-edge environment. The AVEC accelerator virtualization framework is\nproposed that incurs minimum overheads and requires no source-code modification\nof the workload. AVEC intercepts local calls to a GPU on a device and forwards\nthem to an edge resource seamlessly. The feasibility of AVEC is demonstrated on\na real-world application, namely OpenPose using the Caffe deep learning\nlibrary.

To cancel interference, digital\nbeamforming algorithms adaptively adjust the weight vector of the antenna\narray, and in turn its radiation pattern, to minimize interference while\nmaximizing the desired signal power. While these algorithms are effective in\nideal scenarios, they are sensitive to signal corruptions. In this work, we\nconsider the case when the transmitter and receiver in a communication system\ncannot be synchronized, resulting in a carrier frequency offset that corrupts\nthe signal. We present novel beamforming algorithms that are robust to signal\ncorruptions arising from this time-variant carrier frequency offset. In\nparticular, we bring in the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's) and\npropose two atomic-norm-minimization (ANM)-based methods in both 1D and 2D\nframeworks to design a weight vector that can be used to cancel interference\nwhen there exist unknown time-varying frequency drift in the pilot and\ninterferer signals. Both algorithms do not assume a pilot signal is known.\nNoting that solving ANM optimization problems via semi-definite programs can be\na computational burden, we also present a novel fast algorithm to approximately\nsolve our 1D ANM optimization problem. Finally, we confirm the benefits of our\nproposed algorithms and show the advantages over existing approaches with a\nseries of experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 18:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

ALMA observations at 1.4 mm and 0.2'' (750au) angular resolution of\nthe Main core in the high-mass star forming region G31.41+0.31 have revealed a\npuzzling scenario: on the one hand, the continuum emission looks very\nhomogeneous and the core appears to undergo solid-body rotation, suggesting a\nmonolithic core stabilized by the magnetic field; on the other hand, rotation\nand infall speed up toward the core center, where two massive embedded\nfree-free continuum sources have been detected, pointing to an unstable core\nhaving undergone fragmentation. Aims. To establish whether the Main core is\nindeed monolithic or its homogeneous appearance is due to a combination of\nlarge dust opacity and low angular resolution, we carried out millimeter\nobservations at higher angular resolution and different wavelengths. Methods.\nWe carried out ALMA observations at 1.4 mm and 3.5 mm that achieved angular\nresolutions of 0.1''(375 au) and 0.075'' (280 au), respectively. VLA\nobservations at 7 mm and 1.3 cm at even higher angular resolution, 0.05'' (190\nau) and 0.07'' (260 au), respectively, were also carried out to better study\nthe nature of the free-free continuum sources detected in the core. Results.\nThe millimeter continuum emission of the Main core has been clearly resolved\ninto at least four sources, A, B, C, and D, within 1'', indicating that the\ncore is not monolithic. The deconvolved radii of the dust emission of the\nsources, estimated at 3.5 mm, are 400-500au, their masses range from 15 to 26\nMsun, and their number densities are several 1E9 cm-3. Sources A and B, located\ncloser to the center of the core and separated by 750 au, are clearly\nassociated with two free-free continuum sources, likely thermal radio jets, and\nare the brightest in the core. The spectral energy distribution of these two\nsources and their masses and sizes are similar and suggest a common origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 18:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The large\nmolecular clouds harbour massive molecular clumps with massive cores embedded\nin them. The fragmentation of these cores may determine the initial mass\nfunction and the masses of the final stars. Therefore, studying the\nfragmentation processes in the cores is crucial to understand how massive stars\nform. The hot molecular core G34-MM1, embedded in IRDC G34.34+00.24 located at\na distance of 3.6 kpc, is a promising object to study both the fragmentation\nand outflow processes. Using data at 93 and 334 GHz obtained from the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter Array (ALMA) database we studied G34-MM1 with great detail.\nThe angular resolution of the data at 334 GHz allowed us to resolve structures\nof about 0.014 pc ($\\sim$2900 au). We found evidence of fragmentation towards\nthe molecular hot core G34-MM1 at two different spatial scales. The dust\ncondensation MM1-A (about 0.06 pc in size) harbours three molecular subcores\ncandidates (SC1 through SC3) detected in $^{12}$CO J=3-2 emission, with typical\nsizes of about 0.02 pc. From the HCO$^+$ J=1-0 emission, we identify, with\nbetter angular resolution than previous observations, two perpendicular\nmolecular outflows arising from MM1-A.

Here we present fundamental relations between\nlight-matter coupling and quantum geometry of Bloch wave functions, with a\nparticular focus on flat-band and moir\\'e materials, in which the quenching of\nthe electronic kinetic energy could allow one to reach the limit of strong\nlight-matter coupling more easily than in highly dispersive systems. We show\nthat, despite the fact that flat bands have vanishing band velocities and\ncurvatures, light couples to them via geometric contributions. Specifically,\nthe intra-band quantum metric allows diamagnetic coupling inside a flat band;\nthe inter-band Berry connection governs dipole matrix elements between flat and\ndispersive bands. We illustrate these effects in two representative model\nsystems: (i) a sawtooth quantum chain with a single flat band, and (ii) a\ntight-binding model for twisted bilayer graphene. For (i) we highlight the\nimportance of quantum geometry by demonstrating a nonvanishing diamagnetic\nlight-matter coupling inside the flat band. For (ii) we explore the twist-angle\ndependence of various light-matter coupling matrix elements. Furthermore, at\nthe magic angle corresponding to almost flat bands, we show a\nFloquet-topological gap opening under irradiation with circularly polarized\nlight despite the nearly vanishing Fermi velocity.

Furthermore, millimetre dust released in collisions\nbetween resonant bodies could reproduce the width, shape and orientation of the\nobserved disc. We first re-examine the possible orbits of Fomalhaut b, assuming\nthat it moves under gravity alone. If Fomalhaut b orbits close to the disc\nmidplane then its orbit crosses the disc, and the two are apsidally aligned.\nThis alignment may hint at an ongoing dynamical interaction.

These\nassumptions imply that dynamical friction arises from the LBK torque with\nnon-zero contribution only from pure resonance orbits. However, dynamical\nfriction is only of astrophysical interest if its timescale is shorter than the\nage of the Universe. In this paper we therefore relax the adiabatic and secular\napproximations. We first derive a generalized LBK torque, which reduces to the\nLBK torque in the adiabatic limit, and show that it gives rise to transient\noscillations due to non-resonant orbits that slowly damp out, giving way to the\nLBK torque. This is analogous to how a forced, damped oscillator undergoes\ntransients before settling to a steady state, except that here the damping is\ndue to phase mixing rather than dissipation. Next, we present a self-consistent\ntreatment, that properly accounts for time-dependence of the perturber\npotential and circular frequency (memory effect), which we use to examine\norbital decay in a cored galaxy. We find that the memory effect results in a\nphase of accelerated, super-Chandrasekhar friction before the perturber stalls\nat a critical radius, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, in the core (core-stalling).

There are many different ND protocols, both in the\nscientific literature and also those employed in practice. All ND protocols\ninvolve devices sending beacons, and also listening for them. Protocols differ\nin terms of how the beacon transmissions and reception windows are scheduled,\nand the device sleeps in between consecutive transmissions and reception\nwindows in order to save energy. A successful discovery constitutes a sending\ndevice's beacon overlapping with a receiving device's reception window. The\ngoal of all ND protocols is to minimize the discovery latency. In spite of the\nubiquity of ND protocols and active research on this topic for over two\ndecades, the basic question \"Given an energy budget, what is the minimum\nguaranteed ND latency?\", however, still remains unanswered. Given the different\nkinds of protocols that exist, there has also been no standard way of comparing\nthem and their performance. This paper, for the first time, answers the\nquestion on the best-achievable ND latency for a given energy budget. We derive\ndiscovery latencies for different scenarios, e.g., when both devices have the\nsame energy budgets, and both devices have different energy budgets.

The fact that the parametrizations of some other protocols were\noptimal was not known before, and can now be established using our technique.\nOur results are restricted to the case when a few devices discover each other\nat a time, as is the case in most real-life scenarios. When many devices need\nto discover each other simultaneously, packet collisions play a dominant role\nin the discovery latency and how to analyze such scenarios need further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 19:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

The mobility of users\nmotivates the need for an online clustering scheme to maintain up-to-date beams\ntowards those clusters. Furthermore, mobility of users leads to varying\npatterns of clusters (i.e., users move from the coverage of one beam to\nanother), causing dynamic traffic load per beam. As such, efficient radio\nresource allocation and beam management is needed to address the dynamicity\nthat arises from mobility of users and their traffic.

Over\nthe years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this\ntask, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted\ntechniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we\nintroduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR\npoint clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and\nestimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the\nmap. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that\nextracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the\ntransformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose\nhead based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a\ndifferentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations\nof LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud\nregistration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with\nreverse loops.

There is vast literature on efficient algorithms for\nconstructing data structures and performing exact and approximate NNS. This\npaper studies NNS under Uncertainty (NNSU). Specifically, consider the setting\nin which an NNS algorithm has access only to a stochastic distance oracle that\nprovides a noisy, unbiased estimate of the distance between any pair of points,\nrather than the exact distance. This models many situations of practical\nimportance, including NNS based on human similarity judgements, physical\nmeasurements, or fast, randomized approximations to exact distances. A naive\napproach to NNSU could employ any standard NNS algorithm and repeatedly query\nand average results from the stochastic oracle (to reduce noise) whenever it\nneeds a pairwise distance. The problem is that a sufficient number of repeated\nqueries is unknown in advance; e.g., a point maybe distant from all but one\nother point (crude distance estimates suffice) or it may be close to a large\nnumber of other points (accurate estimates are necessary). This paper shows how\nideas from cover trees and multi-armed bandits can be leveraged to develop an\nNNSU algorithm that has optimal dependence on the dataset size and the\n(unknown)geometry of the dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

To mitigate this problem, the CVaR can be\nestimated by extrapolating above a lower threshold than the VaR using a\ngeneralized Pareto distribution (GPD), which is often referred to as the\npeaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. This method often requires a very high\nthreshold to fit well, leading to high variance in estimation, and can induce\nsignificant bias if the threshold is chosen too low. In this paper, we derive a\nnew expression for the GPD approximation error of the CVaR, a bias term induced\nby the choice of threshold, as well as a bias correction method for the\nestimated GPD parameters. This leads to the derivation of a new estimator for\nthe CVaR that we prove to be asymptotically unbiased. In a practical setting,\nwe show through experiments that our estimator provides a significant\nperformance improvement compared with competing CVaR estimators in finite\nsamples. As a consequence of our bias correction method, it is also shown that\na much lower threshold can be selected without introducing significant bias.\nThis allows a larger portion of data to be be used in CVaR estimation compared\nwith the typical POT approach, leading to more stable estimates. As secondary\nresults, a new estimator for a second-order parameter of heavy-tailed\ndistributions is derived, as well as a confidence interval for the CVaR which\nenables quantifying the level of variability in our estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

We\nreport here atomistic spin simulations of all-optical switching in multilayered\nstructures alternating n monolayers of Tb and m monolayers of Co. By using a\ntwo temperature model, we numerically calculate the thermal variation of the\nmagnetization of each sublattice as well as the magnetization dynamics of\n[Tbn/Com] multilayers upon incidence of a single laser pulse. In particular,\nthe condition to observe thermally-induced magnetization switching is\ninvestigated upon varying systematically both the composition of the sample\n(n,m) and the laser fluence. The samples with one monolayer of Tb as [Tb1/Co2]\nand [Tb1/Co3] are showing thermally induced magnetization switching above a\nfluence threshold. The reversal mechanism is mediated by the residual\nmagnetization of the Tb lattice while the Co is fully demagnetized in agreement\nwith the models developed for ferrimagnetic alloys. The switching is however\nnot fully deterministic but the error rate can be tuned by the damping\nparameter. Increasing the number of monolayers the switching becomes completely\nstochastic. The intermixing at the Tb/Co interfaces appears to be a promising\nway to reduce the stochasticity.

Early\nresults suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive\nof COVID-19.

However, this imaging technique\nrelies on injection of radioactive tracers and is expensive. On the contrary,\nArterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI is a non-invasive, non-radioactive, and\nrelatively cheap imaging technique for brain hemodynamic measurements, which\nallows quantification to some extent. In this paper we propose a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) based model for translating ASL to PET images, which could\nbenefit patients as well as the healthcare system in terms of expenses and\nadverse side effects. However, acquiring a sufficient number of paired ASL-PET\nscans for training a CNN is prohibitive for many reasons. To tackle this\nproblem, we present a new semi-supervised multitask CNN which is trained on\nboth paired data, i.e. ASL and PET scans, and unpaired data, i.e. only ASL\nscans, which alleviates the problem of training a network on limited paired\ndata.

With the recent\ndevelopments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ\nblackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environments and make\ndriving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy\nautonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society\nbecomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency,\ntrustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the\ncompliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through\nthe provision of explanations for AVs' behaviour. Explainability is therefore\nseen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what\nthey have 'seen', done, and might do in environments in which they operate.\n  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing body of work\naround explainable autonomous driving.

Specifically, we present and analyze a distributed\naveraging algorithm which operates exclusively with quantized values (i.e., the\ninformation stored, processed and exchanged between neighboring agents is\nsubject to deterministic uniform quantization) and relies on event-driven\nupdates (e.g., to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network\ncongestion, and/or processor usage). The main idea of the proposed algorithm is\nthat each node (i) models its initial state as two quantized fractions which\nhave numerators equal to the node's initial state and denominators equal to\none, and (ii) transmits one fraction randomly while it keeps the other stored.\nThen, every time it receives one or more fractions, it averages their\nnumerators with the numerator of the fraction it stored, and then transmits\nthem to randomly selected out-neighbors. We characterize the properties of the\nproposed distributed algorithm and show that its execution, on any static and\nstrongly connected digraph, allows each agent to reach in finite time a fixed\nstate that is equal (within one quantisation level) to the average of the\ninitial states. We extend the operation of the algorithm to achieve finite-time\nconvergence in the presence of a dynamic directed communication topology\nsubject to some connectivity conditions.

Traditionally, outlier\ndetection techniques are applied to find outliers in the context of the whole\ndataset. However, this practice neglects contextual outliers, that are not\noutliers in the whole dataset but in some specific neighborhoods. Contextual\noutliers are particularly important in data exploration and targeted anomaly\nexplanation and diagnosis. In these scenarios, the data owner computes the\nfollowing information: i) The attributes that contribute to the abnormality of\nan outlier (metric), ii) Contextual description of the outlier's neighborhoods\n(context), and iii) The utility score of the context, e.g. its strength in\nshowing the outlier's significance, or in relation to a particular explanation\nfor the outlier. However, revealing the outlier's context leaks information\nabout the other individuals in the population as well, violating their privacy.\nWe address the issue of population privacy violations in this paper, and\npropose a solution for the two main challenges. In this setting, the data owner\nis required to release a valid context for the queried record, i.e. a context\nin which the record is an outlier. Hence, the first major challenge is that the\nprivacy technique must preserve the validity of the context for each record. We\npropose techniques to protect the privacy of individuals through a relaxed\nnotion of differential privacy to satisfy this requirement. The second major\nchallenge is applying the proposed techniques efficiently, as they impose\nintensive computation to the base algorithm. To overcome this challenge, we\npropose a graph structure to map the contexts to, and introduce differentially\nprivate graph search algorithms as efficient solutions for the computation\nproblem caused by differential privacy techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 01:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

However,\nsince such errors are still quite rare as compared to no-fault cases, desirable\nsolutions call for low/no-overhead systems that do not compromise the\nperformance under no-fault conditions and also allow very fast fault recovery\nto minimize downtime. In this paper, we present IterPro, a light-weight\ncompiler-assisted resilience technique to quickly and accurately recover\nprocesses from transient-error-induced crashes. IterPro repairs the corrupted\nprocess states on-the-fly upon occurrences of errors, enabling applications to\ncontinue their executions instead of being terminated. IterPro also exploits\nside effects introduced by induction variable based code optimization\ntechniques to improve its recovery capability. To this end, two new code\ntransformation passes are introduced to expose the side effects for resilience\npurposes. We evaluated IterPro with 4 scientific workloads as well as the NPB\nbenchmarks suite. During their normal execution, IterPro incurs almost zero\nruntime overhead and a small, fixed 27MB memory overhead. Meanwhile, IterPro\ncan recover on an average 83.55% of crash-causing errors within dozens of\nmilliseconds with negligible downtime. With such an effective recovery\nmechanism, IterPro could tremendously mitigate the overheads and resource\nrequirements of the resilience subsystem in future extreme-scale systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 02:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

We simplify the body as an elastic rod and\napply a backbone optimization method to interpolate continuous body shape\nbetween end constraints imposed by tracked markers. Despite over-simplifying\nthe biomechanics, our method achieves a higher interpolation accuracy (~50%\nerror) in both 3-D position and orientation compared with the widely-used cubic\nB-spline interpolation method. Beyond snakes traversing large obstacles as\ndemonstrated, our method applies to other long, slender, limbless animals and\ncontinuum robots. We provide codes and demo files for easy application of our\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 03:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

In this paper, we\nconsider the more challenging incomplete information problem where dynamic\npricing is applied in conjunction with learning the unknown parameters, with\nthe objective of optimizing the cumulative revenues over a given selling\nhorizon of length $T$. Equivalently, the goal is to minimize the regret which\nmeasures the revenue loss of the algorithm relative to the optimal expected\nrevenue achievable under the stochastic Bass model with market size $m$ and\ntime horizon $T$. Our main contribution is the development of an algorithm that\nsatisfies a high probability regret guarantee of order $\\tilde O(m^{2/3})$;\nwhere the market size $m$ is known a priori. Moreover, we show that no\nalgorithm can incur smaller order of loss by deriving a matching lower bound.\nUnlike most regret analysis results, in the present problem the market size $m$\nis the fundamental driver of the complexity; our lower bound in fact, indicates\nthat for any fixed $\\alpha, \\beta$, most non-trivial instances of the problem\nhave constant $T$ and large $m$. We believe that this insight sets the problem\nof dynamic pricing under the Bass model apart from the typical i.i.d. setting\nand multi-armed bandit based models for dynamic pricing, which typically focus\nonly on the asymptotics with respect to time horizon $T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 03:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Recently, deep learning-based\nregistration methods (DLRs), using deep neural networks, have shown\ncomputational efficiency that is several orders of magnitude faster than\ntraditional optimization-based registration methods (ORs). DLRs rely on a\nglobally optimized network that is trained with a set of training samples to\nachieve faster registration.

Simply mixing images from\nmultiple anatomies for training a single network does not lead to an ideal\nuniversal model due to the statistical shift among datasets of various\nanatomies, the need to retrain from scratch on all datasets with the addition\nof a new dataset, and the difficulty in dealing with imbalanced sampling when\nthe new dataset is further of a smaller size.

Ic can reach a minimum when the TI is near the\ncharge neutrality regime with the Fermi energy lying close to the Dirac point\nof the surface state. In the p-type regime the Josephson current can be well\ndescribed by a short ballistic junction model.

However, a threat to these systems arises that\nadversarial attacks make CNNs vulnerable. Inaccurate diagnosis results make a\nnegative influence on human healthcare. There is a need to investigate\npotential adversarial attacks to robustify deep medical diagnosis systems. On\nthe other side, there are several modalities of medical images (e.g., CT,\nfundus, and endoscopic image) of which each type is significantly different\nfrom others. It is more challenging to generate adversarial perturbations for\ndifferent types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based\nmedical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial\nperturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists\nof a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term\nincreases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example\nand its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures\nsimilar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the\nperspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed\nloss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth\nthe single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence\nof the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes\nthe perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from\nthe ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack\neffective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations\nin small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks\nincluding the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 05:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation.

Network traffic\nclassification become a non-trivial research task in the area of network\nmanagement and security, which not only help to improve the fine-grained\nnetwork resource allocation, but also enable policy-driven network management.\nMeanwhile, the combination of SDN and Edge Computing can leverage both SDN at\nits global visiability of network-wide and Edge Computing at its low latency\nand good privacy-preserving. However, capturing large labeled datasets is a\ncumbersome and time-consuming manual labor. Semi-Supervised learning is an\nappropriate technique to overcome this problem. With that in mind, we proposed\na Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based Semi-Supervised Learning Encrypted\nTraffic Classification method called \\emph{ByteSGAN} embedded in SDN Edge\nGateway to achieve the goal of traffic classification in a fine-grained manner\nto further improve network resource utilization.

Existing self-training\nbased UDA approaches assign pseudo labels for target data and treat them as\nground truth labels to fully leverage unlabeled target data for model\nadaptation. However, the generated pseudo labels from the model optimized on\nthe source domain inevitably contain noise due to the domain gap. To tackle\nthis issue, we advance a MetaCorrection framework, where a Domain-aware\nMeta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA\nsemantic segmentation. In particular, we model the noise distribution of pseudo\nlabels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and\nconstruct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the\nestimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set, the\noptimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance\nthe generalization ability of the model on the target data. Considering the\ncapacity gap between shallow and deep features, we further employ the proposed\nDMLC strategy to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for\ndifferent level features, thereby ensuring deep adaptation.

Mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological\nsections at microscopic resolution. While recent high-throughput scanners allow\nto scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically\nimpossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold\nstandard method.

The robustness of skeleton-based\nactivity recognizers has been questioned recently, which shows that they are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks when the full-knowledge of the recognizer is\naccessible to the attacker. However, this white-box requirement is overly\nrestrictive in most scenarios and the attack is not truly threatening. In this\npaper, we show that such threats do exist under black-box settings too. To this\nend, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack method BASAR. Through\nBASAR, we show that adversarial attack is not only truly a threat but also can\nbe extremely deceitful, because on-manifold adversarial samples are rather\ncommon in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial\nsamples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison,\nwe show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across models, data, and\nattack modes. Through harsh perceptual studies, we show that it achieves\neffective yet imperceptible attacks. By analyzing the attack on different\nactivity recognizers, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of their\nvulnerability and provides insights on what classifiers are likely to be more\nrobust against attack.

While improving\nperformance, this also increases model complexity and memory footprint, making\na dual-stage classifier difficult to implement in a wearable device with\nlimited resources.

The ambiguity\nnaturally leads to the issue of \\emph{implicit multi-label}, motivating the\nneed for diverse predictions.

We demonstrate that, as\ncosmic time passes, the noise yields an average drift of the progenitors toward\nlarger masses, that quantitatively renders the expectation from the standard\nextended Press & Schechter (EPS) theory. We solve the Fokker-Planck equation\nassociated to the stochastic dynamics, and obtain as an exact, stationary\nsolution the EPS progenitor mass function.

Identifying\nand removing them is essential to ensure the accuracy and viability of any post\nprocessing carried out on these scans.

Several QC methods for\nartifact detection exist, however they suffer from problems like requiring\nmanual intervention and the inability to generalize across different artifacts\nand datasets. In this paper, we propose an automated deep learning (DL)\npipeline that utilizes a 3D-Densenet architecture to train a model on diffusion\nvolumes for automatic artifact detection. Our method is applied on a vast\ndataset consisting of 9000 volumes sourced from 7 large clinical datasets.\nThese datasets comprise scans from multiple scanners with different gradient\ndirections, high and low b values, single shell and multi shell acquisitions.\nAdditionally, they represent diverse subject demographics like the presence or\nabsence of pathologies. Our QC method is found to accurately generalize across\nthis heterogenous data by correctly detecting 92% artifacts on average across\nour test set. This consistent performance over diverse datasets underlines the\ngeneralizability of our method, which currently is a significant barrier\nhindering the widespread adoption of automated QC techniques.

However, apart from the\npairwise relationship included in the datasets, the intra-modality and\nnon-paired inter-modality relationships should also be taken into account\nsimultaneously, since the semantic consistency among non-paired representations\nplays an important role in the RS image-voice retrieval task. Inspired by this,\na semantics-consistent representation learning (SCRL) method is proposed for RS\nimage-voice retrieval. The main novelty is that the proposed method takes the\npairwise, intra-modality, and non-paired inter-modality relationships into\naccount simultaneously, thereby improving the semantic consistency of the\nlearned representations for the RS image-voice retrieval. The proposed SCRL\nmethod consists of two main steps: 1) semantics encoding and 2)\nsemantics-consistent representation learning. Firstly, an image encoding\nnetwork is adopted to extract high-level image features with a transfer\nlearning strategy, and a voice encoding network with dilated convolution is\ndevised to obtain high-level voice features. Secondly, a consistent\nrepresentation space is conducted by modeling the three kinds of relationships\nto narrow the heterogeneous semantic gap and learn semantics-consistent\nrepresentations across two modalities. Extensive experimental results on three\nchallenging RS image-voice datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 08:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

However, MTT also has brought\na considerable impact on encoder computational complexity. In this paper, a\ntwo-stage learning-based technique is proposed to tackle the complexity\noverhead of MTT in VVC intra encoders. In our scheme, the input block is first\nprocessed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict its spatial\nfeatures through a vector of probabilities describing the partition at each 4x4\nedge. Subsequently, a Decision Tree (DT) model leverages this vector of spatial\nfeatures to predict the most likely splits at each block.

To achieve the\nphotometric precision required to detect exoplanets in the near infrared, it is\nnecessary to mitigate the impact of variable precipitable water vapour (PWV) on\nradial-velocity and photometric measurements. The aim is to enable global PWV\ncorrection by monitoring the amount of precipitable water vapour at zenith and\nalong the line of sight of any visible target. We developed an open source\nPython package that uses Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites\n(GOES) imagery data, which provides temperature and relative humidity at\ndifferent pressure levels to compute near real-time PWV above any ground-based\nobservatory covered by GOES every 5 minutes or 10 minutes depending on the\nlocation.

Receiver saturation renders\nthe system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly\nneglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands'\ncompetition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at\nthe molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial\nmodel for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work,\nwe propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a\nstate-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick's diffusion\nequation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally\nefficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation\nat the molecular receiver reduces the peak-value of the expected received\nsignal and accelerates the clearance of NTs as compared to the case when\nreceptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical model for the\nreceived signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for\nthe competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs.\nThe proposed statistical model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by\nthe number of released NTs, the number of receptors, and the binding kinetics\nof the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. We show that\nthe impact of these parameters on the signal variance depends on the relative\nnumbers of NTs and receptors. The accuracy of the proposed deterministic and\nstatistical models is verified by particle-based computer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 10:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 12:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

The models can be trained from a data set of\nsimulated runs featuring random policies. The first model is used to\nautomatically extract a set of local states that are expected to maximize the\nglobal performance.

We are taking a robotics\nperspective on this problem, by developing robot learning algorithms that\ncontrol the ultimate humanoid robot, the human body, through electrical muscle\nstimulation.

The most frequent interpretation of\ntheir origin is the presence of planetary-mass companions perturbing the gas\nand dust distribution in the disk (perturbers), but so far the only bona-fide\ndetection has been the two giant planets around PDS 70. Here, we collect a\nsample of 15 protoplanetary disks showing substructures in SPHERE scattered\nlight images and present a homogeneous derivation of planet detection limits in\nthese systems. We also estimate the mass of these perturbers through a Hill\nradius prescription and a comparison to ALMA data. Assuming that one single\nplanet carves each substructure in scattered light, we find that more massive\nperturbers are needed to create gaps within cavities than rings, and that we\nmight be close to a detection in the cavities of RX J1604, RX J1615, Sz Cha, HD\n135344B and HD 34282.

For planets in the gaps between rings, we find that the detection limits\nof SPHERE are about an order of magnitude away in mass, and that the gaps of\nPDS 66 and HD 97048 seem to be the most promising structures for planet\nsearches. The proposed presence of massive planets causing spiral features in\nHD 135344B and HD 36112 are also within SPHERE's reach assuming hot-start\nmodels.These results suggest that current detection limits are able to detect\nhot-start planets in cavities, under the assumption that they are formed by a\nsingle perturber located at the centre of the cavity. More realistic planet\nmass constraints would help to clarify whether this is actually the case, which\nmight point to perturbers not being the only way of creating substructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 11:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

A\nreliable, computationally efficient, and robust workflow to interpret well logs\nand capture uncertainties in real-time is necessary for this application.

However, in this task, the robot gets\npositive rewards from environment only when successfully grasping the goal\nobject. Besides, joint pushing and grasping elongates the action sequence,\ncompounding the problem of reward delay. Thus, sample inefficiency remains a\nmain challenge in this task. In this paper, a goal-conditioned hierarchical\nreinforcement learning formulation with high sample efficiency is proposed to\nlearn a push-grasping policy for grasping a specific object in clutter. In our\nwork, sample efficiency is improved by two means. First, we use a\ngoal-conditioned mechanism by goal relabeling to enrich the replay buffer.\nSecond, the pushing and grasping policies are respectively regarded as a\ngenerator and a discriminator and the pushing policy is trained with\nsupervision of the grasping discriminator, thus densifying pushing rewards. To\ndeal with the problem of distribution mismatch caused by different training\nsettings of two policies, an alternating training stage is added to learn\npushing and grasping in turn. A series of experiments carried out in simulation\nand real world indicate that our method can quickly learn effective pushing and\ngrasping policies and outperforms existing methods in task completion rate and\ngoal grasp success rate by less times of motion.

Specifically, who should store and\nmaintain the information of a given patient and how should this information be\nmade available for other systems. To address this situation, this work proposes\na new solution towards making the Personal Health Trajectory of patients\navailable for both, the patients themselves and health institutions. By using\nthe concept of blockchains' federation and web services access to the global\nvision of a person health can be granted to existing and new solutions. To\ndemonstrate the viability of the proposal, an implementation is provided\nalongside the obtained results in a potential scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 13:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Most of the\nperformances of micro-nanostructured devices rely on both the design and the\nintrinsic properties of the constituent materials that are processed at such\ndimensional scale. For this reason, spatial precision, resolution and\nreproducibility are crucial factors in the micro-fabrication procedure. 3D\ndirect laser lithography (DLL), based on multiphoton absorption, allows to\nrealize outstanding three-dimensional structures with nanoscale features. This\ntechnique has recently emerged as a powerful tool for fabricating 3D\nmicro-patterned surfaces for optics, photonics, as well as for bioinspired cell\nculture scaffold. We propose a method for a two-step fabrication of\nmicro/nanostructured multicomponent systems to be employed as transductors, by\nmeans of the integration of 3D DLL and shadowing effects in metal deposition. A\nz-axis accelerometer is the proof-of-concept for the validation of the proposed\ntransductor. The former is composed of a cantilever patterned with conductive\npaths which act as a strain gauge. Mechanical stimulation deforms the\ncantilever and, accordingly, varies its conductive properties. The fabrication\nof the conductive components is performed using the vacuum evaporation of gold,\na traditional microfabrication technique, and exploiting the shadowing effect\ndue to peculiar microstructures on the cantilever.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 13:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Although lots of\napproaches have been proposed in traditional image translation tasks, few of\nthem can handle the multi-category weather translation task, since weather\nconditions have rich categories and highly complex semantic structures. To\naddress this problem, we develop a multi-domain weather translation approach\nbased on generative adversarial networks (GAN), denoted as Weather GAN, which\ncan achieve the transferring of weather conditions among sunny, cloudy, foggy,\nrainy and snowy. Specifically, the weather conditions in the image are\ndetermined by various weather-cues, such as cloud, blue sky, wet ground, etc.\nTherefore, it is essential for weather translation to focus the main attention\non weather-cues. To this end, the generator of Weather GAN is composed of an\ninitial translation module, an attention module and a weather-cue segmentation\nmodule. The initial translation module performs global translation during\ngeneration procedure. The weather-cue segmentation module identifies the\nstructure and exact distribution of weather-cues. The attention module learns\nto focus on the interesting areas of the image while keeping other areas\nunaltered. The final generated result is synthesized by these three parts.

Objective: This study aims to identify and interpret empirical\nevidence regarding how CI impacts software development. Method: Through a\nSystematic Literature Review, we search for studies in six digital libraries.\nStarting from 479 studies, we select 101 empirical studies that evaluate CI for\nany software development activity (e.g., testing). We thoroughly read and\nextract information regarding (i) CI environment, (ii) findings related to\neffects of CI, and (iii) the employed methodology. We apply a thematic\nsynthesis to group and summarize the findings. Results: Existing research has\nexplored the positive effects of CI, such as better cooperation, or negative\neffects, such as adding technical and process challenges. From our thematic\nsynthesis, we identify six themes: development activities, software process,\nquality assurance, integration patterns, issues & defects, and build patterns.\nConclusions: Empirical research in CI has been increasing over recent years. We\nfound that much of the existing research reveals that CI brings positive\neffects to the software development phenomena. However, CI may also bring\ntechnical challenges to software development teams. Despite the overall\npositive outlook regarding CI, we still find room for improvements in the\nexisting empirical research that evaluates the effects of CI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 14:35:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 15:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 14:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

We propose a novel decision-making\nframework for TAMP by constructing an extended decision tree for both symbolic\ntask planning and high-dimension motion variable binding. We integrate top-k\nplanning for generating explicitly a skeleton space where a variety of\ncandidate skeleton plans are at disposal.

This problem is especially pronounced in data-scarce\nsettings where the data is relatively small (10% of the large scale MSR-VTT) to\ncover the rather complex audio-visual embedding space. In this context, we\nintroduce Rudder - a multilingual video-text retrieval dataset that includes\naudio and textual captions in Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and\nTelugu. Furthermore, we propose to compensate for data scarcity by using domain\nknowledge to augment supervision.

These proposal generators, however, are generic\nand not specifically designed for box-supervised semantic segmentation, thereby\nleaving some leeway for improving segmentation performance. In this paper, we\naim at seeking for a more accurate learning-based class-agnostic pseudo mask\ngenerator tailored to box-supervised semantic segmentation.

Turbulent transport in stellar radiative zones is a key ingredient\nof stellar evolution theory, but the anisotropy of the transport due to the\nstable stratification and the rotation of these regions is poorly understood.\nThe assumption of shellular rotation, which is a cornerstone of the so-called\nrotational mixing, relies on an efficient horizontal transport. However, this\ntransport is included in many stellar evolution codes through phenomenological\nmodels that have never been tested.\n  Aims. We investigate the impact of horizontal shear on the anisotropy of\nturbulent transport.\n  Methods. We used a relaxation approximation (also known as {\\tau}\napproximation) to describe the anisotropising effect of stratification,\nrotation, and shear on a background turbulent flow by computing velocity\ncorrelations.\n  Results. We obtain new theoretical scalings for velocity correlations that\ninclude the effect of horizontal shear.

Moreover, we\npropose a new choice for the non-linear time used in the relaxation\napproximation, which characterises the source of the turbulence.\n  Conclusions.

We\ncall the resultant data 'selectively omitted examination data' Examples of this\ntype of examination are university entrance examinations, certification\nexaminations, and the outcome of students' job-hunting activities. We can learn\nthe number of students accepted for each examination and organization but not\nthe examinees' identity. No research has focused on this type of data. When we\nknow the difficulty level of these examinations, we can obtain a new index to\nassess organization ability, how many students pass, and the difficulty of the\nexaminations. This index would reflect the outcomes of their education\ncorresponding to perspectives on examinations. Therefore, we propose a novel\nmethod, Peak Shift Estimation, to estimate the difficulty level of an\nexamination based on selectively omitted examination data. First, we apply Peak\nShift Estimation to the simulation data and demonstrate that Peak Shift\nEstimation estimates the rank order of the difficulty level of university\nentrance examinations very robustly. Peak Shift Estimation is also suitable for\nestimating a multi-level scale for universities, that is, A, B, C, and D rank\nuniversity entrance examinations. We apply Peak Shift Estimation to real data\nof the Tokyo metropolitan area and demonstrate that the rank correlation\ncoefficient between difficulty level ranking and true ranking is 0.844 and that\nthe difference between 80 percent of universities is within 25 ranks. The\naccuracy of Peak Shift Estimation is thus low and must be improved; however,\nthis is the first study to focus on ranking selectively omitted examination\ndata, and therefore, one of our contributions is to shed light on this method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 15:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

In\nthis paper, we present a novel Doubly Contrastive Deep Clustering (DCDC)\nframework, which constructs contrastive loss over both sample and class views\nto obtain more discriminative features and competitive results. Specifically,\nfor the sample view, we set the class distribution of the original sample and\nits augmented version as positive sample pairs and set one of the other\naugmented samples as negative sample pairs. After that, we can adopt the\nsample-wise contrastive loss to pull positive sample pairs together and push\nnegative sample pairs apart. Similarly, for the class view, we build the\npositive and negative pairs from the sample distribution of the class. In this\nway, two contrastive losses successfully constrain the clustering results of\nmini-batch samples in both sample and class level.

For quantum\nsimulation, various types of NISQ algorithms have been proposed with individual\nadvantages as well as challenges.

In this context,\ndiscs subject to an idealized cooling process, characterized by a cooling\ntimescale $\\beta$ expressed in unit of orbital timescale, have been extensively\nstudied. We take advantage of the Riemann solver and the 3D Godunov scheme\nimplemented in the code Ramses to perform high resolution simulations,\ncomplementing previous studies that have used smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) or 2D grid codes. We observe that the critical value of $\\beta$ for which\nthe disc fragments is consistent with most previous results, and is not well\nconverged with resolution.

Radioactive fallout impacted downwind atolls and islands leading\nto the external and internal exposure of the local populations to ionizing\nradiation. By law, individuals who were exposed to radiation in the context of\nthese tests can file compensation claims with the French government if they\ndevelop certain radiogenic cancers. A claimant who meets the basic eligibility\ncriteria (place, time, and type of disease) automatically benefits from the\npresumption of a causal link between radiation exposure and the development of\ntheir illness, unless the exposure is deemed too low. Since 2017, an effective\ndose threshold of 1 mSv per year has been used in the claims adjudication\nprocess. Decisions as to whether claimants have met this 1 mSv threshold in a\ngiven year are often made on the basis of data from government dose\nreconstruction studies carried out in 2005 and 2006. Using new information\navailable from recently declassified documents on the radiological impact of\nFrench atmospheric nuclear tests in Polynesia, as well as atmospheric transport\nmodeling of radioactive fallout, this article shows that maximum doses to the\npublic for key atmospheric tests may have been underestimated by factors of 2\nto 10 and estimates that the total population exposed above the compensation\nthreshold of 1 mSv/yr could be greater than ~110,000. This latter result\ncorresponds to about 90% of the entire population of French Polynesia at the\ntime of the atmospheric tests. Integrating these updated dose estimates into\nthe claim adjudication process would enlarge the pool of eligible claimants by\na factor of 10.
