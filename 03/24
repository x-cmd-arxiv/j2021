This\nprinciple provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and\ncognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of\nspecialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on\nseveral levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest\nfunctional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By\nfocusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to\nderive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal.\nThis synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with\nthe soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to\nprobe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to\nupdate the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet\nSTDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes\nand the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules\nare fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model,\nsuggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and\nmaking precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level\nuncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the\nnetwork level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP\nlearning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and\nunsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving\nagent interacts with an environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 16:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

However, analyzing these images is complex\neven for experts, hence opening an opportunity for computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems to seize. This paper proposes a fully automatic system based on Deep\nLearning that takes a prostate mpMRI from a PCa-suspect patient and, by\nleveraging the Retina U-Net detection framework, locates PCa lesions, segments\nthem, and predicts their most likely Gleason grade group (GGG). It uses 490\nmpMRIs for training/validation, and 75 patients for testing from two different\ndatasets: ProstateX and IVO (Valencia Oncology Institute Foundation). In the\ntest set, it achieves an excellent lesion-level AUC/sensitivity/specificity for\nthe GGG$\\geq$2 significance criterion of 0.96/1.00/0.79 for the ProstateX\ndataset, and 0.95/1.00/0.80 for the IVO dataset. Evaluated at a patient level,\nthe results are 0.87/1.00/0.375 in ProstateX, and 0.91/1.00/0.762 in IVO.\nFurthermore, on the online ProstateX grand challenge, the model obtained an AUC\nof 0.85 (0.87 when trained only on the ProstateX data, tying up with the\noriginal winner of the challenge).

A promising, but yet lacking more empirical\nevidence, approach is to collect static data of automated tests and use them to\npredict their flakiness. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study to\nassess the use of code identifiers to predict test flakiness. To do so, we\nfirst replicate most parts of the previous study of Pinto~et~al.~(MSR~2020).\nThis replication was extended by using a different ML Python platform\n(Scikit-learn) and adding different learning algorithms in the analyses.

With the recent success in the field\nof machine learning, especially in deep learning, there has been an increased\ninterest in explainable and interpretable machine learning. The ability to\nmodel distributions and provide insight in the density estimation and exact\ndata likelihood is an example of such a feature. Normalizing Flows (NFs), a\nrelatively new research field of generative modelling, has received substantial\nattention since it is able to do exactly this at a relatively low cost whilst\nenabling competitive generative results. While the generative abilities of NFs\nare typically explored, we focus on exploring the data distribution modelling\nfor Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. Using one of the state-of-the-art NF\nmodels, GLOW, we attempt to detect OOD examples in the ISIC dataset. We notice\nthat this model under performs in conform related research. To improve the OOD\ndetection, we explore the masking methods to inhibit co-adaptation of the\ncoupling layers however find no substantial improvement. Furthermore, we\nutilize Wavelet Flow which uses wavelets that can filter particular frequency\ncomponents, thus simplifying the modeling process to data-driven conditional\nwavelet coefficients instead of complete images. This enables us to efficiently\nmodel larger resolution images in the hopes that it would capture more relevant\nfeatures for OOD. The paper that introduced Wavelet Flow mainly focuses on its\nability of sampling high resolution images and did not treat OOD detection. We\npresent the results and propose several ideas for improvement such as\ncontrolling frequency components, using different wavelets and using other\nstate-of-the-art NF architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 16:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators, in particular, provide\nunprecedented opportunities in a variety of fields due to their compact planar\ngeometries compatible with the fabrication technologies used in modern\nelectronics and photonics. Among all 2D topological phases, Chern insulators\nare to date the most reliable designs due to the genuine backscattering\nimmunity of their non-reciprocal edge modes, brought via time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking.

Recently, Sur and Cand\\`es\n(2019) showed that these issues can be corrected by applying a new\napproximation of the MLE's sampling distribution in this high-dimensional\nregime.

In this\nwork, we aim to develop self-attention models that can outperform not just the\ncanonical baseline models, but even the high-performing convolutional models.\nWe propose two extensions to self-attention that, in conjunction with a more\nefficient implementation of self-attention, improve the speed, memory usage,\nand accuracy of these models. We leverage these improvements to develop a new\nself-attention model family, HaloNets, which reach state-of-the-art accuracies\non the parameter-limited setting of the ImageNet classification benchmark. In\npreliminary transfer learning experiments, we find that HaloNet models\noutperform much larger models and have better inference performance. On harder\ntasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, our simple local\nself-attention and convolutional hybrids show improvements over very strong\nbaselines. These results mark another step in demonstrating the efficacy of\nself-attention models on settings traditionally dominated by convolutional\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 17:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 17:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 05:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of\nthe host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this\nprocess, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential\nrole, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the\ndocking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in\norder to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2 [4]. Here we show, with the help\nof atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable\nand moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing\nlong-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational\nchange occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two\nparallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2\n[5], undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no\nbinding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1a). Remarkably, while the\nstructural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of\nentering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S\nupon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings\nsuggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nwithout further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used for\ninfection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro\nstructural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can be\nsuitable for application to mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and\nin general to membrane proteins of other virus types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 17:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

To quantify the contribution of AGN heating to host-galaxy-scale cold\ndust emission at $\\lambda\\ga100$ \\micron, we perform dust RT calculations on a\nsimulated galaxy merger both including and excluding the bright AGN that it\nhosts. By differencing the SEDs yielded by RT calculations with and without AGN\nthat are otherwise identical, we quantify the FIR cold dust emission arising\nsolely from re-processed AGN photons. In extreme cases, AGN-heated\nhost-galaxy-scale dust can increase galaxy-integrated FIR flux densities by\nfactors of 2-4; star formation rates calculated from the FIR luminosity\nassuming no AGN contribution can overestimate the true value by comparable\nfactors. Because the FIR colors of such systems are similar to those of purely\nstar-forming galaxies and redder than torus models, broadband SED decomposition\nmay be insufficient for disentangling the contributions of stars and heavily\ndust-enshrouded AGN in the most IR-luminous galaxies.

Through intensive radial velocity (RV)\nobservations using IRD on the Subaru 8.2m telescope, we confirm the planetary\nnature of the TOIs, and measure their masses: $10.14\\pm0.95\\,M_\\oplus$ and\n$3.43\\pm0.93\\,M_\\oplus$ for TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively, when the\nobserved RVs are fitted with a single-planet circular-orbit model. Combining\nthose with the planet radii of $R_p=1.749\\pm 0.079\\,R_\\oplus$ (TOI-1634b) and\n$1.459\\pm0.065\\,R_\\oplus$ (TOI-1685b), we find that both USP planets have mean\ndensities consistent with an Earth-like internal composition, which is typical\nfor small USP planets. TOI-1634b is currently the most massive USP planet in\nthis category, and it resides near the radius valley, which makes it a\nbenchmark planet in the context of discussing the size limit of rocky planet\ncores as well as testing the formation scenarios for USP planets. Excess\nscatter in the RV residuals for TOI-1685 suggests the presence of a possible\nsecondary planet or unknown activity/instrumental noise in the RV data, but\nfurther observations are required to check those possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 01:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

We here address the phase\ntransition in terms of a Landau-theory-based approach, by analyzing\nsymmetry-allowed distortions connecting the high-symmetry paraelectric\ntetragonal phase to the low-symmetry polar orthorhombic phase. By means of\nfirst-principles simulations, we find that the $\\Gamma_{3-}$ polar mode is only\nweakly unstable, whereas the other two symmetry-allowed distortions, non-polar\nY$_{2+}$ and anti-polar Y$_{4-}$ are hard modes. None of the modes, taken alone\nor combined with one other mode, is able to drive the transition: the key\nfactor in stabilizing the polar phase is identified as the strong trilinear\ncoupling among the three modes. Furthermore, the experimentally acknowledged\nimportance of substrate-induced effects in the growth of HfO$_2$ ferroelectric\nthin films, along with the lack of a clear order parameter in the transition,\nsuggested the extension of our analysis to strain effects. Our findings suggest\na complex behaviour of the Y$_{2+}$ mode, which become unstable under certain\nstrain conditions and an overall unstable behaviour for the $\\Gamma_{3-}$ polar\nmode for all the strain states. A robust result emerges from our analysis:\nindependently of the different applied strain (compressive or tensile, applied\nalong orthorhombic axes), the need of a simultaneous excitation of the three\ncoupled modes remain unaltered.

Abstract syntax trees have been used for a long time in various\nsoftware engineering domains, and in particular in IDEs. The API of modern IDEs\nallows to manipulate and traverse ASTs, resolve references between code\nelements, etc. Such algorithms can enrich ASTs with new data and therefore may\nbe useful in ML-based code analysis. In this work, we present PSIMiner - a tool\nfor processing PSI trees from the IntelliJ Platform. PSI trees contain code\nsyntax trees as well as functions to work with them, and therefore can be used\nto enrich code representation using static analysis algorithms of modern IDEs.\nTo showcase this idea, we use our tool to infer types of identifiers in Java\nASTs and extend the code2seq model for the method name prediction problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

This scenario is at odds with the picture that\nclose-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is\nsubsequently stripped away by some thermally-driven mass loss process. These\ntwo physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped\ntransition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the\ncompositions of planets within the M dwarf radius valley may be able to\nestablish the dominant physics.

The CFD architecture has been implemented on eight commercial\ncoated conductors samples from THEVA. In order to measure the 2-D current\ndistribution in the silver stabilizer layer of the samples, we first used a\ncustom-made array of 120 voltage taps to measure the surface potential\ndistribution. Then, the so-called \"static\" CTL ($\\lambda_s$) was extracted\nusing a semi-analytical model that fitted well the experimental data. As\ndefined in this paper, the static CTL on a 2-D domain is a generalization of\nthe definition commonly used in literature. In addition, we used a 3-D finite\nelement model to simulate the normal zone propagation in our CFD samples, in\norder to quantify their \"dynamic\" CTL ($\\lambda_d$), a new concept introduced\nin this paper and defined as the CTL observed during the propagation of a\nquenched region. The results show that, for a CFD architecture, $\\lambda_d$ is\nalways larger than $\\lambda_s$, whereas $\\lambda_d = \\lambda_s$ when the\ninterfacial resistance between the stabilizer and the superconductor layers is\nthe same everywhere. We proved that the cause of these different behaviors is\nrelated to the shape of the normal zone, which is curved for the CFD\narchitecture, and rectangular otherwise. Finally, we showed that the NZPV is\nproportional to $\\lambda_d$, not with $\\lambda_s$, which suggests that the\ndynamic CTL $\\lambda_d$ is the most general definition of the CTL and should\nalways be used when current crowding and non-uniform heat generation occurs\naround a normal zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Here we compute exactly the shape of the entanglement\nbarriers described by different R\\'enyi entropies after quantum quenches in\ndual-unitary circuits initialised in a class of solvable matrix product states\n(MPS)s. We show that, for free (SWAP-like) circuits, the entanglement entropy\nbehaves as in rational CFTs. On the other hand, for completely chaotic\ndual-unitary circuits it behaves as in holographic CFTs, exhibiting a longer\nentanglement barrier that drops rapidly when the subsystem thermalises.\nInterestingly, the entanglement spectrum is non-trivial in the completely\nchaotic case. Higher R\\'enyi entropies behave in an increasingly similar way to\nrational CFTs, such that the free and completely chaotic barriers are identical\nin the limit of infinite replicas (i.e. for the so called min-entropy). We also\nshow that, upon increasing the bond dimension of the MPSs, the barrier\nmaintains the same shape. It simply shifts to the left to accommodate for the\nlarger initial entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 16:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

MSLWEB is an internal data tracking tool used by operations\nstaff to perform first pass analysis on MSL image sequences, a series of\nproducts taken by the Mast camera, Mastcam. Mastcam's multiband multispectral\nimage sequences require more complex analysis compared to standard 3-band RGB\nimages. Typically, these are analyzed using traditional methods to identify\nunique features within the sequence. Given the short time frame of tactical\nplanning in which downlinked images might need to be analyzed (within 5-10\nhours before the next uplink), there exists a need to triage analysis time to\nfocus on the most important sequences and parts of a sequence. We address this\nneed by creating products for MSLWEB that use novelty detection to help\noperations staff identify unusual data that might be diagnostic of new or\natypical compositions or mineralogies detected within an imaging scene. This\nwas achieved in two ways: 1) by creating products for each sequence to identify\nnovel regions in the image, and 2) by assigning multispectral sequences a\nsortable novelty score. These new products provide colorized heat maps of\ninferred novelty that operations staff can use to rapidly review downlinked\ndata and focus their efforts on analyzing potentially new kinds of diagnostic\nmultispectral signatures. This approach has the potential to guide scientists\nto new discoveries by quickly drawing their attention to often subtle\nvariations not detectable with simple color composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 20:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

The molecular gas is in a\nmassive (M_gas=2x10^10 M_sun), 24 kpc wide, rapidly rotating ring, which is\nassociated with the inner stellar disk. Broad (FWHM=70-180 km s^-1) lines with\ncomplex profiles associated with the radio source are seen over large regions\nin the ring, indicating gas velocities that are high enough to keep the\notherwise marginally Toomre-stable gas from fragmenting into gravitationally\nbound, star-forming clouds. About 1-2% of the jet kinetic energy are required\nto power these motions. Resolved star-formation rate surface densities fall\nfactors 50-75 short of expectations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of\nstar-forming galaxies, and near gas-rich early-type galaxies with signatures of\nstar formation lowered by jet feedback. We argue that radio AGN feedback is the\nonly plausible mechanism to explain the low star-formation rates in this\ngalaxy. Previous authors have already noted that the X-ray halo of J2345-0449\nimplies a baryon fraction near the cosmic average, which is very high for a\ngalaxy. We contrast this finding with other, equally massive baryon-rich spiral\ngalaxies without prominent radio sources. Most of the baryons in these galaxies\nare in stars, not in the halos.

These issues become even more profound\nwhen the objective is the identification of fractures, and/or fracture\nnetworks. The challenge is the limited contrast between the regions of interest\nand the neighboring areas. This limited contrast can mostly be attributed to\nthe minute aperture of the fractures.

This data-driven\nprocedure generates methods that can efficiently solve problems similar to\nthose in the training. In sharp contrast, the typical and traditional designs\nof optimization methods are theory-driven, so they obtain performance\nguarantees over the classes of problems specified by the theory. The difference\nmakes L2O suitable for repeatedly solving a certain type of optimization\nproblems over a specific distribution of data, while it typically fails on\nout-of-distribution problems. The practicality of L2O depends on the type of\ntarget optimization, the chosen architecture of the method to learn, and the\ntraining procedure. This new paradigm has motivated a community of researchers\nto explore L2O and report their findings.\n  This article is poised to be the first comprehensive survey and benchmark of\nL2O for continuous optimization. We set up taxonomies, categorize existing\nworks and research directions, present insights, and identify open challenges.\nWe also benchmarked many existing L2O approaches on a few but representative\noptimization problems.

We\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions for global identifiability of\nlogistic regression models with misclassified outcomes, using a novel approach\ntermed as the submodel analysis, and a technique adapted from the\nPicard-Lindel\\\"{o}f existence theorem in ordinary differential equations. In\nparticular, our results are applicable to logistic models with discrete\ncovariates, which is a common situation in biomedical studies, The conditions\nare easy to verify in practice. In addition to model identifiability, we\npropose a hypothesis testing procedure for regression coefficients in the\nmisclassified logistic regression model when the model is not identifiable\nunder the null.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 21:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

While contemporary work on the distribution of political\nopinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the \"left\"\nand the \"right\" in democracies, the median voter theorem presents a model of\nanti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological\ndistribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological\ndistribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on\nthe \"singled-peakedness\" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly\nloosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of\nvoter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this\nfinding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently\nindifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party\nalternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter\nideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter\nopinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause\nstrategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even\nbecome more polarized than their electorate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 21:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

We show that the entropy of Bayesian smoother estimates for\ngeneral nonlinear state-space models can be expressed as the sum of entropies\nof marginal state estimates given by Bayesian filters. This novel additive form\nallows us to reformulate the smoothing-averse control problem as a fully\nobserved stochastic optimal control problem in terms of the usual concept of\nthe information (or belief) state, and solve the resulting problem via dynamic\nprogramming. We illustrate the applicability of smoothing-averse control to\nprivacy in cloud-based control and covert robotic navigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 23:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

Dynamic wetting delays the onset of finger bifurcation in\nthe late stages of interfacial growth, and at high local capillary numbers can\nalter the fundamental mode of bifurcation, producing vastly different finger\nmorphologies. In low mobility ratio regimes, we see that finger interaction is\nreduced and characteristic finger breaking mechanisms are delayed but never\nfully inhibited. In high mobility ratio regimes, finger shielding is reduced\nwhen dynamic wetting is present. Finger bifurcation is delayed which allows the\nprimary fingers to advance further into the domain before secondary fingers are\ngenerated, reducing the level of competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 23:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

A set of vertices $S$ is\nmulticolored when $S$ has exactly one vertex from each color class. The problem\nis to decide whether there is a multicolored set $S$ such that, after\nidentifying each vertex in $S$ with its color class, $G[S]$ coincides with\n$G_\\varphi$.\n  The MGR problem is related to the class of generalized network problems, most\nof which are NP-hard.

While existing work has largely focused on\nsolely learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both\nregional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level\nrepresentations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the\noverlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas\nwith their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing\nthe feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and\nsemantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional\nfeature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a\nshift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps;\nthis allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for\nlocalization.

However,\nexisting anomaly detection approaches for air quality analysis have their own\nlimitations regarding parameter selection (e.g., need for extensive domain\nknowledge), computational expense, general applicability (e.g., require labeled\ndata), interpretability, and the efficiency of analysis. Furthermore, the poor\nquality of collected air quality data (inconsistently formatted and sometimes\nmissing) also increases the difficulty of analysis substantially. In this\npaper, we systematically formulate design requirements for a system that can\nsolve these limitations and then propose AQEyes, an integrated visual analytics\nsystem for efficiently monitoring, detecting, and examining anomalies in air\nquality data.

Agents have local demand and resource supply, and are\ninterconnected through a network designed to support sharing of the local\nresource; and the network has no external resource supply. It is known from\nclassical welfare economics theory that by pricing the flow of resource,\nbalance between the demand and supply is possible. Agents decide on the\nconsumed resource, and perhaps further the traded resource as well, to maximize\ntheir payoffs considering both the utility of the consumption, and the income\nfrom the trading. When the network supply and demand are balanced, a\ncompetitive equilibrium is achieved if all agents maximize their individual\npayoffs, and a social welfare equilibrium is achieved if the total agent\nutilities are maximized. First, we consider multi-agent systems with static\nlocal allocations, and prove from duality theory that under general convexity\nassumptions, the competitive equilibrium and the social welfare equilibrium\nexist and agree. Compared to similar results in the literature based on KKT\narguments, duality theory provides a direct way for connecting the two notions\nand for a more general (e.g. nonsmooth) class of utility functions. Next, we\nshow that the agent utility functions can be prescribed in a family of socially\nadmissible functions, under which the resource price at the competitive\nequilibrium is kept below a threshold. Finally, we extend the study to\ndynamical multi-agent systems where agents are associated with dynamical states\nfrom linear processes, and we prove that the dynamic the competitive\nequilibrium and social welfare equilibrium continue to exist and coincide with\neach other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 01:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

On the contrary, ionic\nsemiconductors, such as perovskite series, always exhibit benign electronic\nproperties of intrinsic defects owing to the great disparity of\nelectronegativity between anions and cations, but are structurally unstable\nbecause of the sparsely composed octahedral building blocks supported by large\ncations. Combining the stable framework of covalent semiconductors and benign\ndefects of ionic compounds, we find that HgX2S4 (X=In, Sc and Y) spinel\nsemiconductors possess both the merits. The tightly combined tetrahedral and\noctahedral blocks ensures the structural stability, and the band edge of ionic\ncharacteristic, which is mainly dominated by Hg-6s and S-3p orbitals for\nconduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM), respectively,\nmakes HgX2S4 defect-tolerant.

Much research to date focuses on the case of static Fisher markets\nwith full information on buyers' utility functions and item supplies. Motivated\nby real-world markets, we consider an online setting: individuals have linear,\nadditive utility functions; items arrive sequentially and must be allocated and\npriced irrevocably. We define the notion of an online market equilibrium in\nsuch a market as time-indexed allocations and prices which guarantee buyer\noptimality and market clearance in hindsight. We propose a simple, scalable and\ninterpretable allocation and pricing dynamics termed as PACE. When items are\ndrawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution (with a possibly continuous support),\nwe show that PACE leads to an online market equilibrium asymptotically. In\nparticular, PACE ensures that buyers' time-averaged utilities converge to the\nequilibrium utilities w.r.t. a static market with item supplies being the\nunknown distribution and that buyers' time-averaged expenditures converge to\ntheir per-period budget. Hence, many desirable properties of market\nequilibrium-based fair division such as no envy, Pareto optimality, and the\nproportional-share guarantee are also attained asymptotically in the online\nsetting. Next, we extend the dynamics to handle quasilinear buyer utilities,\nwhich gives the first online algorithm for computing first-price pacing\nequilibria. Finally, numerical experiments on real and synthetic datasets show\nthat the dynamics converges quickly under various metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 02:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 20:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

However, the high costs of annotations hinder the collection of\nlarge and completely labeled datasets, motivating semi-supervised detection\napproaches. In this paper, we introduce mean teacher hetero-modal detection\n(MTHD), which addresses two important gaps in current semi-supervised\ndetection. First, it is not obvious how to enforce unlabeled consistency\nconstraints across the very different outputs of various detectors, which has\nresulted in various compromises being used in the state of the art. Using an\nanchor-free framework, MTHD formulates a mean teacher approach without such\ncompromises, enforcing consistency on the soft-output of object centers and\nsize. Second, multi-sequence data is often critical, e.g., for abdominal lesion\ndetection, but unlabeled data is often missing sequences. To deal with this,\nMTHD incorporates hetero-modal learning in its framework. Unlike prior art,\nMTHD is able to incorporate an expansive set of consistency constraints that\ninclude geometric transforms and random sequence combinations. We train and\nevaluate MTHD on liver lesion detection using the largest MR lesion dataset to\ndate (1099 patients with >5000 volumes). MTHD surpasses the best\nfully-supervised and semi-supervised competitors by 10.1% and 3.5%,\nrespectively, in average sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 03:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

Both voxel- and\nrange-based views suffer from quantization loss, especially for voxels when\nfacing large-scale scenes.

Previously, the sheath source term was described\nphenomenologically with a positive-definite function, resulting in a positive\ndefinite wake potential. In reality, the wake potential is negative at the rear\nof the ion column which is important for self-injection and accurate beam\nloading models.

Although, the topic is well studied at least in\ncase of lower dimensional compound systems, e.g., two-qubit systems, but in the\ncase of continuous variable systems, this remains as an open problem. Even in\nthe case of two-mode Gaussian states, the problem is not fully solved. In our\nwork, we have tried to address this issue. At first, a limited number of\nHermitian operators is given to test the necessary and sufficient criterion on\nthe covariance matrix of separable two-mode Gaussian states. Thereafter, we\npresent an interferometric scheme to test the same separability criterion in\nwhich the measurements are being done via Stokes-like operators. In such case,\nwe consider only single-copy measurements on a two-mode Gaussian state at a\ntime and the scheme amounts to the full state tomography. Although this latter\napproach is a linear optics based one, nevertheless it is not an economic\nscheme. Resource-wise a more economical scheme than the full state tomography\nis obtained if we consider measurements on two copies of the state at a time.\nHowever, optimality of the scheme is not yet known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 04:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

Using a one-dimensional photochemical\nmodel, we consider whether plausible volcanic gas fluxes could have switched\nthe redox-state of the past martian atmosphere to reducing conditions. In our\nmodel, the total quantity and proportions of volcanic gases depend on the water\ncontent, outgassing pressure, and oxygen fugacity of the source melt. We find\nthat with reasonable melt parameters the past martian atmosphere (~3.5 Gyr to\npresent) could have easily reached reducing and anoxic conditions with modest\nlevels of volcanism, >0.14 km^3/yr, well within the range of prior estimates.\nCounter-intuitively we also find that more reducing melts with lower oxygen\nfugacity require greater amounts of volcanism to switch a paleo-atmosphere from\noxidizing to reducing. The reason is that sulfur is more stable in such melts\nand lower absolute fluxes of sulfur-bearing gases more than compensate for\nincreases in the proportions of H2 and CO. These results imply that ancient\nMars should have experienced periods with anoxic and reducing atmospheres even\nthrough the mid-Amazonian whenever volcanic outgassing was sustained at\nsufficient levels. Reducing anoxic conditions are potentially conducive to the\nsynthesis of prebiotic organic compounds, such as amino acids, and are\ntherefore relevant to the possibility of life on Mars. Also, anoxic reducing\nconditions should have influenced the type of minerals that were formed on the\nsurface or deposited from the atmosphere such as elemental polysulfur (S8) as a\nsignature of past reducing atmospheres. Finally, our models allow us to\nestimate the amount of volcanically sourced atmospheric sulfate deposited over\nMars' history, approximately 10^6 to 10^9 Tmol, with a spread depending on\nassumed outgassing rate history and magmatic source conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

In the literature, the norm of the\nmatrix errors often is the Frobenius norm in the maximization problem. Herein,\nthe closed-form optimal value for a minimization problem of the least-squares\nresidual over the matrix errors with an induced $l_{p,q}$-norm constraint is\nfirst derived.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nautomatic mixup (AutoMix) framework, where the mixup policy is parameterized\nand serves the ultimate classification goal directly.

In the HCD experiments, the adsorption ability of\nsaturated GAC was increased, mainly due to the increase in the mesoporosity of\nGAC. A synergy between electrosorption/adsorption on GAC and electrooxidation\nwas observed in terms of the removal of all target pollutants. DEET presented\nthe highest synergy, ranging from 40-57%, followed by iopromide (22-46%),\ncarbamazepine (15-34%) and diatrizoate (4-30%). The addition of GAC decreased\nthe concentrations of toxic chlorate and perchlorate by 2-fold and 10-fold,\nrespectively, due to their electrosorption on GAC.

In ref.[1] it has been shown that without fixing\nthe reaction-amplitude phase, many combinations of partial waves at neighboring\nenergies in single-energy, single-channel partial wave analysis reproduce\nexperimental data identically, but are discontinuous and disconnected. To\nobtain the continuous solution, the phase has to be fixed to some continuous\nvalue. In the same reference it has also been shown that the change of angular\npart of reaction-amplitude phase mixes partial waves, so the pole structure of\nany single-energy single-channel partial wave analysis depends on the chosen\nphase. As in any single-channel analysis the overall reaction-amplitude phase\ncannot be determined because of continuum ambiguity, it is in principle free\nand has to be taken from some coupled-channel model. Because of the difference\nin the angular part of the phase, choosing different phases results in the\nchange of the pole content of the obtained solution. Therefore, single-energy\nsingle-channel partial wave analysis is inherently model dependent, and the\nnumber of poles it contains strongly depends on the choice of the phase.

To alleviate their computational burden, some machine learning\ntechniques (ML) have been proposed in the literature, using the information\nprovided by previously solved MILP instances. Unfortunately, these techniques\nreport a non-negligible percentage of infeasible or suboptimal instances.\n  By linking mathematical optimization and machine learning, this paper\nproposes a novel approach that speeds up the traditional constraint generation\nmethod, preserving feasibility and optimality guarantees.

[SODA'14] in the pursuit of prior-independent\nposted-price mechanisms. As they show, $O(1)$-competitive policies are\nachievable using only a single sample from the distribution of each agent. A\nnotable portion of their results relies on reducing the design of single-sample\nprophet inequalities (SSPIs) to that of order-oblivious secretary (OOS)\npolicies. The above reduction comes at the cost of not fully utilizing the\navailable samples. However, to date, this is essentially the only method for\nproving SSPIs for many combinatorial sets. Very recently, Rubinstein et al.\n[ITCS'20] give a surprisingly simple algorithm which achieves the optimal\ncompetitive ratio for the single-choice SSPI problem $-$ a result which is\nunobtainable going through the reduction to secretary problems. Motivated by\nthis discrepancy, we study the competitiveness of simple SSPI policies\ndirectly, without appealing to results from OOS literature. In this direction,\nwe first develop a framework for analyzing policies against a greedy-like\nprophet solution. Using this framework, we obtain the first SSPI for general\n(non-bipartite) matching environments, as well as improved competitive ratios\nfor transversal and truncated partition matroids. Second, motivated by the\nobservation that many OOS policies for matroids decompose the problem into\nindependent rank-$1$ instances, we provide a meta-theorem which applies to any\nmatroid satisfying this partition property. Leveraging the recent results by\nRubinstein et al., we obtain improved competitive guarantees (most by a factor\nof $2$) for a number of matroids captured by the reduction of Azar et al.\nFinally, we discuss applications of our SSPIs to the design of mechanisms for\nmulti-dimensional limited information settings with improved revenue and\nwelfare guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 03:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Near InfraRed (NIR) light irradiation for inducing hyperthermia is\nparticularly attractive, because biological systems mostly lack chromophores\nthat absorb in this spectral window, facilitating the selective heating and\ndestruction of cells which have internalized the NIR absorbing-nanomaterials.\nHowever, little is known about biological effects accompanying nGO-mediated\nhyperthermiaat cellular and molecular levels.In this work, well-characterised\npegylatednGOsheets with an hydrodynamic size of 300 nm were incubated with\nhuman Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells for 24h and their incorporation verified by\nflow cytometry and confocal microscopy. No effect on cell viability was\nobserved after nGO incorporation by Saos-2 cells. However, a proliferation\ndelay was observed due to the presence of nGO sheets in the cytoplasm.1H NMR\nmetabolomicswas employed to screen for changes in the metabolic profile of\ncells, as this could help to improve understanding of celular responses to\nnanomaterials and provide new endpoint markers of effect.Cells incorporating\nnGO sheets showed noticeable changes in 10 metabolites compared to control\ncells, including decreased levels of several amino acids, taurine and creatine\nand increased levels of phosphocholine and uridine/adenosine nucleotides. After\nNIR irradiation, cells showed decreases in glutamate and uridine nulceotides,\ntogether with increases in glycerophosphocholine and adenosine monophosphate.\nOverall, this study has shown that the celular metabolome sensitively responded\nto nGO exposure and nGO-mediated hyperthermia and that NMR metabolomics is a\npowerful tool toinvestigate treatment responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

In many\nscientific fields, the data generated from scientific instruments and\nsupercomputer simulations must be analyzed rapidly. In fact, the requirement\nfor quasi-instant feedback is growing. Scientists want to use results from one\nexperiment to guide the selection of the next or even to improve the course of\na single experiment. Current HPC systems are typically batch-scheduled under\npolicies in which an arriving job is run immediately only if enough resources\nare available; otherwise, it is queued. It is hard for these systems to support\nreal-time jobs. Real-time jobs, in order to meet their requirements, should\nsometimes have to preempt batch jobs and/or be scheduled ahead of batch jobs\nthat were submitted earlier. Accommodating real-time jobs may negatively impact\nsystem utilization also, especially when preemption/restart of batch jobs is\ninvolved. We first explore several existing scheduling strategies to make\nreal-time jobs more likely to be scheduled in due time. We then rigorously\nformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming for offline\nscheduling and develop novel scheduling heuristics for online scheduling.

The resulting free-energy functions are then used to\nobtain the confinement free energy for the translocated portion of the polymer.\nWe characterize the confinement free energy for a flexible polymer in cavities\nwith constant cross-sectional area A for various cavity shapes (cylindrical,\nrectangular and triangular) as well as for tapered cavities with pyramidal and\nconical shape. The scaling of the free energy with cavity volume and\ntranslocated polymer subchain length is generally consistent with predictions\nfrom simple scaling arguments, with small deviations in the scaling exponents\nlikely due to finite-size effects. The confinement free energy depends strongly\non cavity shape anisometry and is a minimum for an isometric cavity shape with\na length/width ratio of unity. For translocation into infinitely long cones,\nthe scaling of the free energy with taper angle is consistent with a\ntheoretical prediction employing the blob model. We also examine the effects of\npolymer bending rigidity on the translocation free energy for cylindrical\ncavities. For isometric cavities, the observed scaling behaviour is in partial\nagreement with theoretical predictions.

Shunt\ndamping is a promising way for the attenuation of vibration of these\nelectromechanical systems. It enables a compact vibration damping method\nwithout adding significant mass and volumetric occupancy. Analyzing the\ndynamics of such electromechanical systems requires precise modeling tools that\nproperly consider the coupling between the piezoelectric elements and the host\nstructure. Although the concept of shunt damping has been studied extensively\nin the literature, most of the studies do not provide a formulation for\nmodeling the multiple piezoelectric patches that are scattered on the host\nstructure and shunted separately. This paper presents a methodology and a\nformulation for separately shunted piezoelectric patches for achieving higher\nperformance on vibration attenuation. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used for\nperforming modal analysis and obtaining the frequency response functions of the\nelectro-mechanical system. The developed model includes mass and stiffness\ncontribution of the piezoelectric patches as well as the electromechanical\ncoupling effect. In this study, the piezoelectric patches are shunted via\nseparate electrical circuits and compared with the ones those are shunted via\ninterconnected electrical circuits. For verification, system-level finite\nelement simulations are performed in ANSYS software and compared with the\nanalytical model results. An experimental setup is also built to validate the\nperformance of the separately shunted piezoelectric patches.

To address this, we describe and evaluate a 'negative-contrast'\nmethod for imaging of the extracranial facial nerve using three-dimensional\nvariable flip angle turbo spin echo (VFA-TSE) imaging. We investigate\nstrategies for further optimization, including parotid-specific VFA-TSE\noptimization and the use of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). Materials\nand Methods: 6 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with parotid tumors underwent\nVFA-TSE and double echo steady state (DESS) imaging of the extracranial facial\nnerve at 3T. The main trunk, divisions and branches of the extracranial facial\nnerve were manually segmented by three radiologists, enabling CNR and Hausdorff\ndistance computation and confidence scoring. CNR, Hausdorff distance and\nconfidence scores were compared between sequences and between pre- and\npost-contrast imaging to evaluate the effect of GBCA. Results: CNR, Hausdorff\ndistances and confidence scores were superior for VFA-TSE compared to DESS\nimaging. GBCA administration produced a further increase in CNR of nerve\nagainst parotid and improved differentiation of nerve from tumor. Conclusion:\nImaging of the extracranial facial nerve with VFA-TSE depicts the nerve as a\nlow signal structure ('black nerve') against the high signal parotid parenchyma\n('white parotid') and outperforms positive-contrast DESS imaging in terms of\nCNR, segmentation consistency and confidence.

The key of our algorithm is to variationally train a shallow\nparameterized quantum circuit, using the results of two types of measurement;\nthe standard computational-basis measurement plus the measurement in the\nHadamard-transformed basis, introduced in order to handle the sign of the data\ncomponents. The variational algorithm changes the circuit parameters so as to\nminimize the sum of two costs corresponding to those two measurement basis,\nboth of which are given by the efficiently-computable maximum mean discrepancy.\nWe also consider the problem of constructing the singular value decomposition\nentropy via the stock market dataset to give a financial market indicator; a\nquantum algorithm (the variational singular value decomposition algorithm) is\nknown to produce a solution faster than classical, which yet requires the\nsign-dependent amplitude encoding. We demonstrate, with an in-depth numerical\nanalysis, that our algorithm realizes loading of time-series of real stock\nprices on quantum state with small approximation error, and thereby it enables\nconstructing an indicator of the financial market based on the stock prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 14:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 08:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

In this paper, we propose a\ntransfer learning approach for the detection of sustain-pedal techniques, which\nare commonly used by pianists to enrich the sound.

We find that the water\ntranslational and rotational dynamics exhibits an oscillatory dependence on\n$w$, due to water layering. The oscillations in dynamics correlate with those\nin hydration pressure, which can be negative (hydrophobic attraction), or as\nhigh as $\\sim 1$ GPa, as seen in the experiments. At pore widths commensurable\nwith full layers (around $7.0$ \\AA\\ and $9.5$ \\AA\\ for one and two layers,\nrespectively), the free energy of the system has minima, and the hydration\npressure vanishes. These are the separations at which the dynamics of confined\nwater slows down. Nevertheless, the hydration pressure vanishes also where the\nfree energy has maxima, i.e., for those pore-widths which are incommensurable\nwith the formation of well-separated layers, as $w\\simeq 8.0$ \\AA. Around these\nvalues of $w$, the dynamics is faster than in bulk, with water squeezed out\nfrom the pore. This behavior has not been observed for simple liquids under\nconfinement, either for water in closed nano-pores. The decomposition of the\nfree energy clarifies the origins of the dynamics speedups and slowdowns. In\nparticular, we find that the nature of the slowdown depends on the number of\nwater layers: for two layers, it is due to the internal energy contribution, as\nin simple liquids, while for one layer, it has an entropic origin possibly due\nto the existence of a hydrogen-bond network in water.

Model-based regularized reconstruction methods used in PAT plays a\ncrucial role in the applicability of PAT because such methods can yield high\nquality images from measurements obtained using fewer number of transducers. A\ncrucial factor that determines the quality of reconstruction in such methods is\nthe choice of regularization weight. Unfortunately, an appropriately tuned\nvalue of regularization weight varies significantly with variation in the noise\nlevel, as well as, with the variation in the high resolution contents of the\nimage, in a way that has not been well understood. There has been attempts to\ndetermine optimum regularization weight from the measured data in the context\nof using elementary and general purpose regularizations. In this paper, we\ndevelop a practicable method for semi-automated tuning of the regularization\nweight in the context of using a modern type of regularization that is\nspecifically designed for PAT image reconstruction. As a first step, we\nintroduce a relative smoothness constraint with a parameter; this parameter\ncomputationally maps into the actual regularization weight, but, its tuning\ndoes not vary significantly with variation in the noise level, and with the\nvariation in the high resolution contents of the image.

Estimators are often shown extra obsolete requirements\ntogether with the real ones to be implemented. Only one previous study has been\nconducted on if such practices bias the estimations. Objective: We conducted\nsix experiments with both students and practitioners to study, and quantify,\nthe effects of obsolete requirements on software estimation. Method By\nconducting a family of six experiments using both students and practitioners as\nresearch subjects (N = 461), and by using a Bayesian Data Analysis approach, we\ninvestigated different aspects of this effect. We also argue for, and show an\nexample of, how we by using a Bayesian approach can be more confident in our\nresults and enable further studies with small sample sizes. Results: We found\nthat the presence of obsolete requirements triggered an overestimation in\neffort across all experiments. The effect, however, was smaller in a field\nsetting compared to using students as subjects. Still, the over-estimations\ntriggered by the obsolete requirements were systematically around twice the\npercentage of the included obsolete ones, but with a large 95% credible\ninterval. Conclusions: The results have implications for both research and\npractice in that the found systematic error should be accounted for in both\nstudies on software estimation and, maybe more importantly, in estimation\npractices to avoid over-estimation due to this systematic error. We partly\nexplain this error to be stemming from the cognitive bias of\nanchoring-and-adjustment, i.e. the obsolete requirements anchored a much larger\nsoftware.

In this paper, we present a theory of the nontrivial\ninterband effect, which cannot be removed without breaking given rules. We\ndefine the general nontrivial interband effect by regarding a property of the\nset of the total bands of a tight-binding Hamiltonian as the triviality. As\nexamples of the source of the nontrivial interband effect, we consider several\ntopological concepts: stable topological insulator, symmetry-based indicator,\nfragile topological insulator, and multipole/higher-order topological\ninsulator. As an application, we calculate the orbital magnetic susceptibility\nfor tight-binding Hamiltonians with topological properties. In addition, we\nconsider the mechanical properties induced by the nontrivial interband effect.\nWe define interband-induced degeneracy pressure, which tends to take a negative\nvalue, and calculate it for the Chern insulator. This calculation demonstrates\nthe importance of topological band structures in mechanical properties of\nsolids. We also discuss the application to nonlinear optics characterized by\nthe polarization difference and the generalization to interacting systems with\nentanglement.

However, contrast variation from site to site\ncaused by lack of standardization in MR acquisition impedes consistent\nmeasurements. In recent years, image harmonization approaches have been\nproposed to compensate for contrast variation in MR images. Current\nharmonization approaches either require cross-site traveling subjects for\nsupervised training or heavily rely on site-specific harmonization models to\nencourage harmonization accuracy. These requirements potentially limit the\napplication of current harmonization methods in large-scale multi-site studies.\nIn this work, we propose an unsupervised MR harmonization framework, CALAMITI\n(Contrast Anatomy Learning and Analysis for MR Intensity Translation and\nIntegration), based on information bottleneck theory. CALAMITI learns a\ndisentangled latent space using a unified structure for multi-site\nharmonization without the need for traveling subjects.

While\nshortening the forecasting horizon allows for more recent data and less\nuncertainty, this frequently means lower data aggregation levels and a more\nsignificant data sparsity. Sparse demand data usually results in lumpy or\nintermittent demand patterns, which have sparse and irregular demand intervals.\nUsual statistical and machine learning models fail to provide good forecasts in\nsuch scenarios. Our research shows that competitive demand forecasts can be\nobtained through two models: predicting the demand occurrence and estimating\nthe demand size. We analyze the usage of local and global machine learning\nmodels for both cases and compare results against baseline methods. Finally, we\npropose a novel evaluation criterion of lumpy and intermittent demand\nforecasting models' performance. Our research shows that global classification\nmodels are the best choice when predicting demand event occurrence. When\npredicting demand sizes, we achieved the best results using Simple Exponential\nSmoothing forecast.

In\nthis work, we introduce a simulator software capable of modeling a population\nstructure and controlling the disease's propagation at an individualistic\nlevel. In order to estimate the confidence of the conclusions drawn from the\nsimulator, we employ a comprehensive probabilistic approach where the entire\npopulation is constructed as a hierarchical random variable. This approach\nmakes the inferred conclusions more robust against sampling artifacts and gives\nconfidence bounds for decisions based on the simulation results. To showcase\npotential applications, the simulator parameters are set based on the formal\nstatistics of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcome of a wide range of control\nmeasures is investigated. Furthermore, the simulator is used as the environment\nof a reinforcement learning problem to find the optimal policies to control the\npandemic. The obtained experimental results indicate the simulator's\nadaptability and capacity in making sound predictions and a successful policy\nderivation example based on real-world data. As an exemplary application, our\nresults show that the proposed policy discovery method can lead to control\nmeasures that produce significantly fewer infected individuals in the\npopulation and protect the health system against saturation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 10:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The first contribution of this work is to propose a\nrequirement list to be satisfied by models designed within the Lagrangian\nframework. Multifractal stochastic processes are a natural choice to retrieve\nmultifractal properties of the dissipation. Among them, following the\nproposition of \\cite{Mandelbrot1968}, we investigate the Gaussian\nMultiplicative Chaos formalism, which requires the construction of a\nlog-correlated stochastic process $X_t$. The fractional Gaussian noise of Hurst\nparameter $H = 0$ is of great interest because it leads to a log-correlation\nfor the logarithm of the process.Inspired by the approximation of fractional\nBrownian motion by an infinite weighted sum of correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocesses, our second contribution is to propose a new stochastic model: $X_t =\n\\int_0^\\infty Y_t^x k(x) d x$, where $Y_t^x$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\nwith speed of mean reversion $x$ and $k$ is a kernel. A regularization of\n$k(x)$ is required to ensure stationarity, finite variance and logarithmic\nauto-correlation. A variety of regularizations are conceivable, and we show\nthat they lead to the aforementioned multifractal models.To simulate the\nprocess, we eventually design a new approach relying on a limited number of\nmodes for approximating the integral through a quadrature $X_t^N = \\sum_{i=1}^N\n\\omega_i Y_t^{x_i}$, using a conventional quadrature method. This method can\nretrieve the expected behavior with only one mode per decade, making this\nstrategy versatile and computationally attractive for simulating such\nprocesses, while remaining within the proposed framework for a proper\ndescription of intermittency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Standard smart grid solutions to mitigate large\nfrequency excursions are based on centrally collecting data and give rise to\nsecurity and privacy concerns. Furthermore, control of fluctuations is often\ntested by employing Gaussian perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that power\ngrid frequency fluctuations are in general non-Gaussian, implying that large\nexcursions are more likely than expected based on Gaussian modeling. We\nconsider real power grid frequency measurements from Continental Europe and\ncompare them to stochastic models and predictions based on Fokker-Planck\nequations. Furthermore, we review a decentral smart grid control scheme to\nlimit these fluctuations. In particular, we derive a scaling law of how\ndecentralized control actions reduce the magnitude of frequency fluctuations\nand demonstrate the power of these theoretical predictions using a test grid.\nOverall, we find that decentral smart grid control may reduce grid frequency\nexcursions due to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian power fluctuations and thus\noffers an alternative pathway for mitigating fluctuation-induced risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Cells copy sequence information from DNA to RNA and on into\nproteins, which are the molecules responsible for the function and regulation\nof cellular systems. In the templated copying process the template catalyses\nthe formation of a second molecule carrying the same sequence. Traditionally,\npeople have ignored the separation of the template and copy at the end of the\nprocess, but separation is necessary and fundamentally changes the\nthermodynamics of the process. In general, creating an accurate polymer costs\nfree energy. Omitting separation, this cost can be compensated for by the extra\nfree energy released by \"correct\" copy/template bonds. Separation requires\nthese bonds be broken, so true copying requires an input of free energy.\nEqually the fact that copy/template bonds are temporary means there is no\nthermodynamic bias towards accuracy, instead copying relies only on kinetic\neffects to promote accuracy. In general, transducing energy can only happen\nreversibly when the transduction process is quasistatic and time varying;\nsomething that cannot be true when you are relying on kinetic discrimination.\n  Copying is a far from equilibrium process. This thesis explores the\nconsequences of this observation. We start in the limit of infinite length\ncopies where the costs of accuracy represent hard thermodynamic bounds and then\nmoves to the finite length limit where these same limits can be understood as\nkinetic barriers. We then discuss copying systems as non-equilibrium steady\nstates, which can be analysed as information engines moving free energy between\nout-of-equilibrium baths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 20:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}
