Specifically,\nrecent work has empirically shown that the superior performance of the\nautomated data augmentation methods stems from increasing the diversity of\naugmented data \\cite{autoaug, randaug}. However, two factors regarding the\ndiversity of augmented data are still missing: 1) the explicit definition (and\nthus measurement) of diversity and 2) the quantifiable relationship between\ndiversity and its regularization effects. To bridge this gap, we propose a\ndiversity measure called Variance Diversity and theoretically show that the\nregularization effect of data augmentation is promised by Variance Diversity.\nWe validate in experiments that the relative gain from automated data\naugmentation in test accuracy is highly correlated to Variance Diversity. An\nunsupervised sampling-based framework, \\textbf{DivAug}, is designed to directly\nmaximize Variance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization effect.\nWithout requiring a separate search process, the performance gain from DivAug\nis comparable with the state-of-the-art method with better efficiency.\nMoreover, under the semi-supervised setting, our framework can further improve\nthe performance of semi-supervised learning algorithms compared to RandAugment,\nmaking it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is\nscarce.

The proposed framework is based on a generalised and fully\nBayesian view on the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). In the EnKF,\nthe updating of the ensemble is based on Gaussian assumptions, whereas in our\ngeneral setup the updating may be based on another parametric family. In\naddition, we propose to formulate an optimality criterion and to find the\noptimal update with respect to this criterion. The framework is fully Bayesian\nin the sense that the parameters of the assumed forecast model are treated as\nrandom variables. As a consequence, a parameter vector is simulated, for each\nensemble member, prior to the updating. In contrast to existing fully Bayesian\napproaches, where the parameters are simulated conditionally on all the\nforecast samples, the parameters are in our framework simulated conditionally\non both the data and all the forecast samples, except the forecast sample which\nis to be updated. The proposed framework is studied in detail for two\nparametric families: the linear-Gaussian model and the finite state-space\nhidden Markov model. For both cases, we present simulation examples and compare\nthe results with existing ensemble-based filtering methods. The results of the\nproposed approach indicate a promising performance. In particular, the filter\nbased on the linear-Gaussian model gives a more realistic representation of the\nuncertainty than the traditional EnKF, and the effect of not conditioning on\nthe forecast sample which is to be updated when simulating the parameters is\nremarkable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 16:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Performance-critical systems, however, must not only\noptimize the expected performance, but also reduce its variance to avoid\nperformance fluctuation during RL's course of operation. To solve the RAOC\nproblem, this paper presents the following three variants of RL algorithms and\nanalyze their advantages and preferences for different situations/systems: 1) a\none-shot static convex program -based RL, 2) an iterative value iteration (VI)\nalgorithm that solves a linear programming (LP) optimization at each iteration,\nand 3) an iterative policy iteration (PI) algorithm that solves a convex\noptimization at each iteration and guarantees the stability of the consecutive\ncontrol policies.

In this\nwork, we present a more detailed analysis. As a compelling consequence, this\nsetup provides a new mechanism for simultaneous baryogenesis and right-handed\nneutrino creation by the chiral anomaly of $W_R$ in inflation. The lightest\nright-handed neutrino is the dark matter candidate. This setup has two unknown\nfundamental scales, i.e., the scale of inflation and left-right symmetry\nbreaking $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}\\rightarrow U(1)_{Y}$. Sufficient matter\ncreation demands the left-right symmetry breaking scale happens shortly after\nthe end of inflation. Interestingly, it prefers left-right symmetry breaking\nscales above $10^{10}~GeV$, which is in the range suggested by the\nnon-supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory with an intermediate left-right\nsymmetry scale. Although $W_R$ gauge field generates equal amounts of\nright-handed baryons and leptons in inflation, i.e. $B-L=0$, in the Standard\nModel sub-sector $B-L_{SM}\\neq 0$. A key aspect of this setup is that $SU(2)_R$\nsphalerons are never in equilibrium, and the primordial $B-L_{SM}$ is conserved\nby the Standard Model interactions. This setup yields a deep connection between\nCP violation in physics of inflation and matter creation (visible and dark);\nhence it can naturally explain the observed coincidences among cosmological\nparameters, i.e., $\\eta_{B}\\simeq 0.3 P_{\\zeta}$ and $\\Omega_{DM}\\simeq\n5\\Omega_{B}$. The $SU(2)_R$-axion inflation comes with a cosmological smoking\ngun; chiral, non-Gaussian, and blue-tilted gravitational wave background, which\ncan be probed by future CMB missions and laser interferometer detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

However, such an approach has multiple drawbacks: it is\ncomputationally expensive, requires regularization and hyper-parameter tuning,\nand involves a large network trained on an unrelated task. Furthermore, it has\nbeen observed that there is no single loss function that works best across all\napplications and across different datasets. In this work, we instead propose to\ntrain a set of loss functions that are application specific in nature. Our loss\nfunction comprises a series of discriminators that are trained to detect and\npenalize the presence of application-specific artifacts.

Each\ncomputer at the basic level performs a PCA to extract common factors among the\ntime series assigned to it and transfers those factors to one and only one node\nof the second level.

The inability to cope with this load,\ncoupled with a high false positive rate of alerts, creates alert fatigue. This\nresults in failure to detect complex attacks, such as advanced persistent\nthreats (APTs), because they manifest over long time frames and attackers tread\ncarefully to evade detection mechanisms. In this paper, we contribute a new\nmethod to synthesize attack graphs from state machines. We use the network\ndirection to derive potential attack stages from single and meta-alerts and\nmodel resulting attack scenarios in a kill chain state machine (KCSM). Our\nalgorithm yields a graphical summary of the attack, APT scenario graphs, where\nnodes represent involved hosts and edges infection activity. We evaluate the\nfeasibility of our approach in multiple experiments based on the\nCSE-CIC-IDS2018 data set. We obtain up to 446 458 singleton alerts that our\nalgorithm condenses into 700 APT scenario graphs resulting in a reduction of up\nto three orders of magnitude. This reduction makes it feasible for human\nanalysts to effectively triage potential incidents. An evaluation on the same\ndata set, in which we embedded a synthetic yet realistic APT campaign, supports\nthe applicability of our approach of detecting and contextualizing complex\nattacks. The APT scenario graphs constructed by our algorithm correctly link\nlarge parts of the APT campaign and present a coherent view to support the\nhuman analyst in further analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

In such scenarios the\nperiodicity can be due to relativistic Doppler-boosting of the emitted light.\nThis hypothesis can be tested through the timing of scattered polarized light.\nFollowing the results of polarization studies in type I nuclei and of dynamical\nstudies of MBHBs with circumbinary discs, we assume a coplanar equatorial\nscattering ring, whose elements contribute differently to the total polarized\nflux, due to different scattering angles, levels of Doppler boost, and\nline-of-sight time delays.

The polarization angle\noscillates around the semi-minor axis of the projected MBHB orbital ellipse,\nwith a frequency equal either to the binary's orbital frequency (for large\nscattering screen radii), or twice this value (for smaller scattering\nstructures). These distinctive features can be used to probe the nature of\nperiodic MBHB candidates and to compile catalogs of the most promising sub-pc\nMBHBs.

By comparing the constraints, obtained by fitting the XENON1T data,\nwith the upper limits arising from various existing astrophysical and\ncosmological observations, we find that, for the background model $\\rm B_0$, a\nfair amount of the DM parameter space is allowed at $95\\%$ C.L. for DM masses\noutside the range $3.5\\,{\\rm keV} \\lesssim m_\\chi \\lesssim 8.5\\,{\\rm keV}$.\nHowever, in case of other two background models, reasonable parts of the DM\nparameter space are favoured at $95\\%$ C.L. by all astrophysical data for all\nDM masses in the range $2 - 18$ keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 18:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 18:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

When available, depth images provide\nhelpful geometric cues that complement the RGB texture information and help to\nidentify discriminative scene image features. Depth sensing technology\ndeveloped fast in the last years and a great variety of 3D cameras have been\nintroduced, each with different acquisition properties. However, those\nproperties are often neglected when targeting big data collections, so\nmulti-modal images are gathered disregarding their original nature. In this\nwork, we put under the spotlight the existence of a possibly severe domain\nshift issue within multi-modality scene recognition datasets. As a consequence,\na scene classification model trained on one camera may not generalize on data\nfrom a different camera, only providing a low recognition performance. Starting\nfrom the well-known SUN RGB-D dataset, we designed an experimental testbed to\nstudy this problem and we use it to benchmark the performance of existing\nmethods. Finally, we introduce a novel adaptive scene recognition approach that\nleverages self-supervised translation between modalities.

Constraining this history has been a target of\ninterdisciplinary efforts as it represents an astro-geodetic parameter whose\nvariation is shaped by geophysical processes, and whose imprints can be found\nin the geological signal. We revisit the classical problem of its variation\nduring ice ages, where glacial cycles exerted a varying surface loading that\nhad altered the shape of the geoid.

Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS) is then proposed to tackle the energy issue. The rich-get-richer concern\nof PoS has been heavily debated in the blockchain community. The debate is\ncentered around the argument that whether rich miners possessing more stakes\nwill obtain higher staking rewards and further increase their potential income\nin the future. In this paper, we define two types of fairness, i.e.,\nexpectational fairness and robust fairness, that are useful for answering this\nquestion. In particular, expectational fairness illustrates that the expected\nincome of a miner is proportional to her initial investment, indicating that\nthe expected return on investment is a constant. To better capture the\nuncertainty of mining outcomes, robust fairness is proposed to characterize\nwhether the return on investment concentrates to a constant with high\nprobability as time evolves. Our analysis shows that the classical PoW\nmechanism can always preserve both types of fairness as long as the mining game\nruns for a sufficiently long time. Furthermore, we observe that current PoS\nblockchains implement various incentive models and discuss three\nrepresentatives, namely ML-PoS, SL-PoS and C-PoS.

The ocean fluid is driven by combined effects of wind stress, surface\nwave, and a steady current in the presence of stable vertical stratification.\nThe resulting flow consists of two overlapping boundary layers, i.e. surface\nand bottom boundary layers, separated by an interior stratification. The\noverlapping boundary layers evolve through three phases, i.e. a rapid\ndeepening, an oscillatory equilibrium and a prompt merger, separated by two\ntransitions. Before the merger, internal waves are observed in the stratified\nlayer, and they are excited mainly by Langmuir turbulence in the surface\nboundary layer. These waves induce a clear modulation on the bottom-generated\nturbulence, facilitating the interaction between the surface and bottom\nboundary layers.

The learning of such\na policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire\nenvironment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as\nimages have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional,\nlimiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In\nthis article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent\nrepresentation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant\nsemantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network\nto predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of\nother agents and the ego car. Furthermore, we propose a hazard signal based on\nother vehicles' future trajectories and the planned route which is used in\nconjunction with the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream\npolicy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network\nresults in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model.\nIn particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help\nreinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less\ndata than baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 20:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 10:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 06:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

In this paper, we propose a novel cryptographic framework for jointly\nencrypting DNA-based fingerprints (STRs) with other biometric data, for\nexample, facial images, such that the STRs and biometrics information of an\nindividual are revealed only when a positive match is found, i.e. the STRs act\nas decryption keys. Specifically, when a search is performed on the encrypted\ndatabase using STR sequences of an individual in the database, a perfect match\ngenerates the facial image and/ or other biometrics of the individual while the\nlack of a match returns a null result. By jointly encrypting DNA fingerprints\nand other biometrics using the unique STRs generated keys, our approach ensures\nperfect privacy of the encrypted information with decryption of only the record\nwith STRs matching the query. This safeguards the information of other\nindividuals in the same database. The proposed approach can also be used to\nsecurely authenticate the identity of individuals or biological material in\nscenarios beyond forensics including tracking the identity of samples for\nclinical genetics and cell therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 21:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Here, we\npropose a novel approach to select landmarks specifically for PH that preserves\ncoarse topological information of the original dataset.

This paper gives more insights\nabout the importance of the 1-norm in quantum computing for quantum chemistry,\nand provides simple ways of decreasing its value to reduce the complexity of\nquantum algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 22:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In a two-pulse\nscheme, a pre-pulse laser is first used to deform tin microdroplets into thin,\nextended disks before the main (2$\\mu$m) pulse creates the EUV-emitting plasma.\nIrradiating 30- to 300-$\\mu$m-diameter targets with 2-$\\mu$m laser pulses, we\nfind that the efficiency in creating EUV light around 13.5nm follows the\nfraction of laser light that overlaps with the target. Next, the effects of a\nchange in 2-$\\mu$m drive laser intensity (0.6-1.8$\\times 10^{11}$W/cm$^2$) and\npulse duration (3.7-7.4ns) are studied. It is found that the angular dependence\nof the emission of light within a 2\\% bandwidth around 13.5nm and within the\nbackward 2$\\pi$ hemisphere around the incoming laser beam is almost independent\nof intensity and duration of the 2-$\\mu$m drive laser. With increasing target\ndiameter, the emission in this 2\\% bandwidth becomes increasingly anisotropic,\nwith a greater fraction of light being emitted into the hemisphere of the\nincoming laser beam.

Every\nobject in a dataset $\\mathcal{S}$ can be represented as a vector in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ by an $\\textit{encoding map}$ $E:\n\\mathcal{O}bj(\\mathcal{S})\\to\\mathbb{R}^n$. More importantly, every morphism\ncan be represented as a matrix $E:\n\\mathcal{H}om(\\mathcal{S})\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}_{n}$. The encoding map $E$ is\ngenerally modeled by a $\\textit{deep neural network}$. The goal of\nrepresentation learning is to design appropriate tasks on the dataset to train\nthe encoding map (assuming that an encoding is optimal if it universally\noptimizes the performance on various tasks). However, the latter is still a\n$\\textit{set-theoretic}$ approach. The goal of the current article is to\npromote the representation learning to a new level via a\n$\\textit{category-theoretic}$ approach.

We formulate the speech coding problem as an autoencoding task,\nwhere a convolutional neural network (CNN) performs encoding and decoding as a\nneural waveform codec (NWC) during its feedforward routine. The proposed NWC\nalso defines quantization and entropy coding as a trainable module, so the\ncoding artifacts and bitrate control are handled during the optimization\nprocess. We achieve efficiency by introducing compact model components to NWC,\nsuch as gated residual networks and depthwise separable convolution.\nFurthermore, the proposed models are with a scalable architecture, cross-module\nresidual learning (CMRL), to cover a wide range of bitrates. To this end, we\nemploy the residual coding concept to concatenate multiple NWC autoencoding\nmodules, where each NWC module performs residual coding to restore any\nreconstruction loss that its preceding modules have created. CMRL can scale\ndown to cover lower bitrates as well, for which it employs linear predictive\ncoding (LPC) module as its first autoencoder. The hybrid design integrates LPC\nand NWC by redefining LPC's quantization as a differentiable process, making\nthe system training an end-to-end manner. The decoder of proposed system is\nwith either one NWC (0.12 million parameters) in low to medium bitrate ranges\n(12 to 20 kbps) or two NWCs in the high bitrate (32 kbps). Although the\ndecoding complexity is not yet as low as that of conventional speech codecs, it\nis significantly reduced from that of other neural speech coders, such as a\nWaveNet-based vocoder. For wide-band speech coding quality, our system yields\ncomparable or superior performance to AMR-WB and Opus on TIMIT test utterances\nat low and medium bitrates. The proposed system can scale up to higher bitrates\nto achieve near transparent performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 00:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 02:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

To improve\ndata efficiency, this work utilizes the fact OPF data are not simple training\nlabels, but constitute the solutions of a parametric optimization problem. We\nthus advocate training a sensitivity-informed DNN (SI-DNN) to match not only\nthe OPF optimizers, but also their partial derivatives with respect to the OPF\nparameters (loads). It is shown that the required Jacobian matrices do exist\nunder mild conditions, and can be readily computed from the related primal/dual\nsolutions. The proposed SI-DNN is compatible with a broad range of OPF solvers,\nincluding a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), its\nsemidefinite program (SDP) relaxation, and MATPOWER; while SI-DNN can be\nseamlessly integrated in other learning-to-OPF schemes.

Our results, derived from the analysis of 975 production class-unit test\npairs, show that the Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) and Weighted Methods per Class\n(WMC) of production classes are strong indicators of the presence of smells in\ntheir associated unit tests. The Lack of Cohesion of Methods in a production\nclass (LCOM) also appears to be a good indicator of the presence of test\nsmells.

Ensemble\ntraining methods have emerged as promising solutions for defending against\nadversarial attacks by diversifying the vulnerabilities among the sub-models,\nsimultaneously maintaining comparable accuracy as standard training.

Recently, much research\nhas been devoted to improving the model robustness by training with noise\nperturbations.

In fact, excessive\nperturbations may destroy the discriminative content of an example, while\ndeficient perturbations may fail to provide helpful information for improving\nthe robustness.

By\ndesigning a cost-effective sampling strategy along with a new query type, the\nrobustness can be significantly improved with a few queries.

Different\nfrom incremental localization, global localization has no drift caused by error\naccumulation, which is desired in many application scenarios. In addition to\nGPS used in the open air, 3D maps are also widely used as alternative global\nlocalization references. In this paper, we propose a compact 3D map-based\nglobal localization system using a low-cost monocular camera and an IMU\n(Inertial Measurement Unit). The proposed compact map consists of two types of\nsimplified elements with multiple semantic labels, which is well adaptive to\nvarious man-made environments like urban environments. Also, semantic edge\nfeatures are used for the key image-map registration, which is robust against\nocclusion and long-term appearance changes in the environments. To further\nimprove the localization performance, the key semantic edge alignment is\nformulated as an optimization problem based on initial poses predicted by an\nindependent VIO (Visual-Inertial Odometry) module. The localization system is\nrealized with modular design in real time. We evaluate the localization\naccuracy through real-world experimental results compared with ground truth,\nlong-term localization performance is also demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

No\nclear-cut mechanical condition has been presented so far for when, how and how\nmuch energy the erosive landslide gains or loses, resulting in enhanced or\nreduced mobility. We pioneer a mechanical model for the energy budget of an\nerosive landslide that controls its mobility. A fundamentally new understanding\nis that the increased inertia due to the increased mass is related to an\nentrainment velocity. With this, the true inertia of an erosive landslide can\nbe ascertained, making a breakthrough in correctly determining the mobility of\nthe erosive landslide. Outstandingly, erosion velocity regulates the energy\nbudget and decides whether the landslide mobility will be enhanced or reduced.\nThis provides the first-ever explicit mechanical quantification of the state of\nerosional energy and a precise description of mobility. This addresses the\nlong-standing question of why many erosive landslides generate higher mobility,\nwhile others reduce mobility. By introducing three key concepts:\nerosion-velocity, entrainment-velocity and energy-velocity, we demonstrate that\nerosion and entrainment are essentially different processes. Landslides gain\nenergy and enhance mobility if the erosion velocity is greater than the\nentrainment velocity. We introduce two dimensionless numbers, mobility scaling\nand erosion number, delivering explicit measure of mobility. We establish a\nmechanism of landslide-propulsion providing the erosion-thrust to the\nlandslide. Analytically obtained velocity indicates that erosion controls the\nlandslide dynamics.

The main challenge for this task is the lack of\nlabeled data. Existing works circumvent this problem with pseudo labels\ngenerated from data of other easily accessible domains such as synthetic data.\nHowever, these pseudo labels are noisy even with consistency check or\nconfidence-based filtering due to the domain shift in the data. To solve this\nproblem, we design a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the\ndomain gap between the synthetic and real data. We further introduce an online\ncoarse-to-fine pseudo label updating strategy. Specifically, we propose a\nself-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in\nan outer fine-update loop to generate new pseudo labels that gradually replace\nthe old ones.

To utilize this large volume of video data generated from\nnetworks of visual sensors for various machine vision applications, it needs to\nbe compressed and securely transmitted over the Internet. H.266/VVC, as the new\ncompression standard, brings the highest compression for visual data. To\nprovide security along with high compression, a selective encryption method for\nhiding information of videos is presented for this new compression standard.\nSelective encryption methods can lower the computation overhead of the\nencryption while keeping the video bitstream format which is useful when the\nvideo goes into untrusted blocks such as transcoding or watermarking. Syntax\nelements that represent considerable information are selected for the\nencryption, i.e., luma Intra Prediction Modes (IPMs), Motion Vector Difference\n(MVD), and residual signs., then the results of the proposed method are\ninvestigated in terms of visual security and bit rate change. Our experiments\nshow that the encrypted videos provide higher visual security compared to other\nsimilar works in previous standards, and integration of the presented\nencryption scheme into the VVC encoder has little impact on the bit rate\nefficiency (results in 2% to 3% bit rate increase).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 08:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

This may be due to the\nrelationship between the knowledge in mutual learning and the individuality of\nthe networks in the ensemble. In this study, we propose an ensemble method\nusing knowledge transfer to improve the accuracy of ensembles by introducing a\nloss design that promotes diversity among networks in mutual learning. We use\nan attention map as knowledge, which represents the probability distribution\nand information in the middle layer of a network. There are many ways to\ncombine networks and loss designs for knowledge transfer methods. Therefore, we\nuse the automatic optimization of knowledge-transfer graphs to consider a\nvariety of knowledge-transfer methods by graphically representing conventional\nmutual-learning and distillation methods and optimizing each element through\nhyperparameter search. The proposed method consists of a mechanism for\nconstructing an ensemble in a knowledge-transfer graph, attention loss, and a\nloss design that promotes diversity among networks. We explore optimal ensemble\nlearning by optimizing a knowledge-transfer graph to maximize ensemble\naccuracy. From exploration of graphs and evaluation experiments using the\ndatasets of Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and CUB-200-2011, we confirm that the\nproposed method is more accurate than a conventional ensemble method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 08:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

This\npaper presents an indoor localization testbed based on a massive MIMO\northogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which supports\nphysical-layer channel measurements. Instead of exploiting channel state\ninformation (CSI) directly for localization, we focus on positioning from the\nperspective of multipath components (MPCs), which are extracted from the CSI\nthrough the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)\nalgorithm. On top of the available MPCs, we propose a generalized\nfingerprinting system based on different single-metric and hybrid-metric\nschemes.

Under KD the vocabulary of concepts,\ntheir individual distributions, and the is-a relations between them can all\nchange over time. The main challenge is that, since the ground-truth concept\nhierarchy is unobserved, it is hard to tell apart different forms of KD. For\ninstance, introducing a new is-a relation between two concepts might be\nconfused with individual changes to those concepts, but it is far from\nequivalent. Failure to identify the right kind of KD compromises the concept\nhierarchy used by the classifier, leading to systematic prediction errors.

Approaches for assessment of\nrockfall susceptibility range from purely phenomenological methods and\nstatistical methods, suitable for modeling large areas, to purely deterministic\nones, usually easier to use in local analyses. A common requirement is the need\nto locate potential detachment points, often found uphill on cliffs, and the\nsubsequent assessment of the runout areas of rockfalls stemming from such\npoints. Here, we apply a physically based model to calculate rockfall\ntrajectories along the whole Italian railway network, within a corridor of\ntotal length of about 17,000 km and varying width. We propose a data-driven\nmethod for the location of rockfall source points based on expert mapping of\npotential source areas on sample representative locations. Using empirical\ndistributions of gridded slope values in source areas mapped by experts, we\nderived probabilistic maps of rockfall sources in the proximity of the railway\nnetwork, regardless of a particular trigger. Source areas act as starting\npoints of simulated trajectories in the three-dimensional model STONE. The\nprogram provides a pixel-by-pixel trajectory count, covering 24,500 km2, the\nlargest homogeneous application of the model to date. We classified the map\ninto a vector susceptibility map of the segments of the railway, for which we\nprovide segment-wise rockfall susceptibility. Eventually, we considered a graph\nrepresentation of the network to classify the segments both on the basis of\nrockfall susceptibility and the role of each segment in the network, resulting\nin a network-ranked susceptibility.

In a precessing cylinder full of\nfluid, a steady and axisymmetric component of the azimuthal flow is generally\npresent. This component is called a zonal flow. Although zonal flows have been\noften observed in experiments and numerical simulations, their origin has\neluded theoretical approaches so far. Here, we develop an asymptotic analysis\nto calculate the zonal flow forced in a resonant precessing cylinder, that is\nwhen the harmonic response is dominated by a single Kelvin mode. We find that\nthe zonal flow originates from three different sources: (1) the nonlinear\ninteraction of the inviscid Kelvin mode with its viscous correction; (2) the\nsteady and axisymmetric response to the nonlinear interaction of the Kelvin\nmode with itself; and (3) the nonlinear interactions in the end boundary\nlayers. In a precessing cylinder, two additional sources arise due to the\nequatorial Coriolis force and the forced shear flow. However, they cancel\nexactly. The study thus generalises to any Kelvin mode, forced by precession or\nany other mechanism. The present theoretical predictions of the zonal flow are\nconfirmed by comparison with numerical simulations and experimental results. We\nalso show numerically that the zonal flow is always retrograde in a resonant\nprecessing cylinder (m=1) or when it results from resonant Kelvin modes of\nazimuthal wavenumbers m=2, 3, and presumably higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 12:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 09:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

The\nability of careful tuning of the parameters in a torque-vectoring controller\ncan significantly enhance vehicle's performance and stability. However, without\nany re-tuning of the parameters, especially in extreme driving conditions e.g.\nlow friction surface or high velocity, the vehicle fails to maintain the\nstability.

It is shown that, torque-vectoring\ncontroller with parameter tuning via reinforcement learning performs well on a\nrange of different driving environment e.g., wide range of friction conditions\nand different velocities, which highlight the advantages of reinforcement\nlearning as an adaptive algorithm for parameter tuning.

Here, we propose a comprehensive study elucidating this\nrelation for a system of microgels with tunable architecture. We synthesize\ncore-shell microgels, whose soft core can be chemically degraded in a\ncontrolled fashion, yielding particles ranging from analogues of standard\nbatch-synthesized to completely hollow microgels after total core removal. We\ncharacterize the internal structure of these particles, their swelling\nproperties in bulk and their morphologies upon adsorption at an oil-water\ninterface via a combination of numerical simulations and complementary\nexperiments.

At low compression, the mechanical response of the\nmonolayer is dominated by the presence of loosely crosslinked polymers forming\na corona surrounding the particle within the interfacial plane, regardless of\nthe presence of a core.

Existing works mainly focus on using only\none observation data source, e.g., velocity, wall pressure, lift or drag force,\nto reconstruct the flow. In practical applications observations are disparate\ndata sources that often vary in dimension and quality. Simultaneously\nincorporating these disparate data is worth investigation to improve the flow\nreconstruction. In this work, we investigate the disparate data assimilation\nwith ensemble methods to enhance the reconstruction of turbulent mean flows.\nSpecifically, a regularized ensemble Kalman method is employed to incorporate\nthe observation of velocity and different sources of wall quantities (e.g.,\nwall shear stress, wall pressure distribution, lift and drag force). Three\nnumerical examples are used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed\nframework for assimilating disparate observation data. The first two cases,\ni.e., a one-dimensional planar channel flow and a two-dimensional transitional\nflow over plate, are used to incorporate both the sparse velocity and wall\nfriction. In the third case of the flow over periodic hills, the wall pressure\ndistribution and the lift and drag force are regarded as observation in\naddition to velocity, to recover the flow fields. The results demonstrate the\nmerits of incorporating various disparate data sources to improve the accuracy\nof the flow-field estimation. The ensemble-based method can assimilate\ndisparate data non-intrusively and robustly without requiring significant\nchanges to the model simulation codes. The method demonstrated here opens up\npossibilities for assimilating realistic experimental data, which are often\ndisparate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 14:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In this research work, a schematic picture of quantum game theory has\nbeen provided with the help of the famous game Prisoners' Dilemma. It has been\nconsidered that the shared qubits of the prisoners may interact with the\nenvironment which is a bath of simple harmonic oscillators. This interaction\nintroduces decoherence and this model has been compared with phase damping.\nCalculation of the decoherence factor shows that decoherence reduces the payoff\nof the prisoners. The factor has been calculated based on whether the\ndecoherence occurred once or twice. A comparative discussion establishes that\nthe process of decoherence is faster for the case when it occurs twice. It\nneeds to be mentioned here that the total time of decoherence is the same in\nboth cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 16:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

A near-infrared spectrum taken with the Subaru\ntelescope showed H$\\beta$ emission line with FWHM of $1194\\pm77$ km s$^{-1}$\nand weak [O III] emission line but no optical Fe II lines, due to the limited\nwavelength coverage and poor signal-to-noise ratio. However, UV Fe II lines are\npresent in the SDSS optical spectrum. The source is very radio-loud,\nunresolved, and has a flat radio spectrum. The broadband SED of the source has\nthe typical two hump structure shown by blazars and other $\\gamma$-NLS1s. The\nsource exhibits strong variability at all wavelengths such as the optical,\ninfrared, and $\\gamma$-ray bands. All these observed characteristics show that\nTXS 1206+549 is the most distant $\\gamma$-NLS1 known to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 15:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 04:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

However, these works consider mostly the computation resources\nlocated at the cloud centers and wireless access nodes, ignoring the\npossibility of utilizing server-empowered relays to improve the performance. In\nthis paper, we study stochastic relay-assisted MEC in systems with discrete\ntransmission time-line and block fading wireless channels. In order to clearly\nidentify and inspect the fundamental affecting factors, we investigate the\nbuilding block of this architecture, namely a hierarchical network consisting\nof a source, a buffer-and-server-aided relay and another higher-level computing\nnode. We provide a framework to take into account the effects of the fading\nchannels, the task arrival dynamics as well as the queuing delays in both the\ntransmission and computation buffers, which facilitates the derivation of the\nexpression for the Average Response Time (ART). Based on that and the system\naverage power consumption in each slot, we introduce the concept of Average\nResponse Energy (ARE) as a novel metric to capture the energy efficiency in MEC\nwhile considering the stochastic nature of the system parameters. Accordingly,\nwe propose two offloading schemes with their respective problem formulations,\nnamely the Minimum ART (MART) and the Minimum ARE (MARE) schemes, to optimize\nthe transmission power and task assignment probability while keeping the system\nqueues stable. We demonstrate the difference of the formulated problems with\nthe relevant problem in a recent work, analyze the properties of the problems\nand noting them, we propose effective solution methods. Using extensive\nsimulations, we validate the presented analysis and show the effectiveness of\nthe proposed schemes in comparison with various baseline methods adapting\nexisting approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 19:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

This fact led us to establish an internal\nautomorphism in the ring of hybrid numbers that acts as a map of the manifolds\nand induces the space-time metric based on the quality (characteristic) of the\nassociated hypercomplex unit. From this automorphism, we built hybrid\ntrigonometric functions, which we call Poincar\\'e functions, which allowed us\nto deduce general properties of space-time, hyperbolic, parabolic and\nelliptical geometries and the groups SO (3), SO (4) and SO (1, 3). This\napproach allows us to highlight the global properties of space-time, suggests\nmethods for geodynamic models and allows us to interpret anti-matter as matter\nin a Euclidean space-time where the nature of time is imaginary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 21:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}
