Computing a pure hexahedral mesh from an\nadaptively refined grid is a prominent approach to automatic hexmeshing, and\nrequires the ability to restore the all hex property around the hanging nodes\nthat arise at the interface between cells having different size. The most\nadvanced tools to accomplish this task are based on mesh dualization. These\napproaches use topological schemes to regularize the valence of inner vertices\nand edges, such that dualizing the grid yields a pure hexahedral mesh. In this\npaper we study in detail the dual approach, and propose four main contributions\nto it: (i) we enumerate all the possible transitions that dual methods must be\nable to handle, showing that prior schemes do not natively cover all of them;\n(ii) we show that schemes are internally asymmetric, therefore not only their\nimplementation is ambiguous, but different implementation choices lead to\nhexahedral meshes with different singular structure; (iii) we explore the\ncombinatorial space of dual schemes, selecting the minimum set that covers all\nthe possible configurations and also yields the simplest singular structure in\nthe output hexmesh; (iv) we enlarge the class of adaptive grids that can be\ntransformed into pure hexahedral meshes, relaxing one of the tight requirements\nimposed by previous approaches, and ultimately permitting to obtain much\ncoarser meshes for same geometric accuracy. Last but not least, for the first\ntime we make grid-based hexmeshing truly reproducible, releasing our code and\nalso revealing a conspicuous amount of technical details that were always\noverlooked in previous literature, creating an entry barrier that was hard to\novercome for practitioners in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Although a large\nvariety of applications can be described with the P4 language, current\nprogrammable switch architectures impose significant constraints on P4\nprograms. To address this shortcoming, FPGAs have been explored as potential\ntargets for P4 applications. P4 applications are described using three\nabstractions: a packet parser, match-action tables, and a packet deparser,\nwhich reassembles the output packet with the result of the match-action tables.\nWhile implementations of packet parsers and match-action tables on FPGAs have\nbeen widely covered in the literature, no general design principles have been\npresented for the packet deparser. Indeed, implementing a high-speed and\nefficient deparser on FPGAs remains an open issue because it requires a large\namount of interconnections and the architecture must be tailored to a P4\nprogram. As a result, in several works where a P4 application is implemented on\nFPGAs, the deparser consumes a significant proportion of chip resources. Hence,\nin this paper, we address this issue by presenting design principles for\nefficient and high-speed deparsers on FPGAs. As an artifact, we introduce a\ntool that generates an efficient vendor-agnostic deparser architecture from a\nP4 program. Our design has been validated and simulated with a cocotb-based\nframework.

We proceed by spatially discretizing a given RD\nsystem and using a spinor representation of the environmental states to derive\na path integral for the lattice model. In the case of large molecular numbers,\nthe corresponding continuum path integral action is expressed in terms of an\neffective Hamiltonian, which involves a concentration field $u(\\x,t)$, $\\x\\in\n\\R^d$, a conjugate field $v(\\x,t)$, and $M$ auxiliary conjugate pairs\n$(c_m(t),\\phi_m(t))$, where $M$ is the number of discrete environmental states.\nThe variable $c_m(t)$ determines the effective probability that a sample path\nis exposed to the $m$-th environmental state at time $t$, with\n$\\sum_{m=1}^Mc_m(t)=1$. We then consider the semi-classical (adiabatic) limit\n$\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, where $\\epsilon^{-1}$ determines the rate of\nswitching between the environmental states. We show how the auxiliary variables\ncan be eliminated to yield an action functional for the fields $u$ and $v$\nalone. The associated Hamiltonian is the sum of a diffusion term and the Perron\nor principal eigenvalue of a functional linear operator involving the reaction\nterms and the matrix generator of the switching process. The reduced path\nintegral is then used to derive a functional Hamilton-Jacobi equation for least\naction paths and to obtain a Gaussian noise approximation of the stochastic\nhybrid RD system in the adiabatic limit. Finally, the path integral in the case\nof low molecular numbers is constructed by considering a corresponding RD\nmaster equation. It is now necessary to take into account two sources of noise,\none due to the switching environment and the other due to fluctuations in\nmolecular numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 17:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 17:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

Recently, it was\nsuggested [F. Caballero et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 020601 (2018)] that the\noriginal continuum model known as `Conserved Kardar-Parisi-Zhang'(CKPZ)\nequation is incomplete, as additional non-linearity is not forbidden by any\nsymmetry in $d > 1$. In this work, we perform detailed field-theoretic\nrenormalization group (RG) analysis of a general stochastic model describing\nconserved surface roughening. Systematic power counting reveals additional\nmarginal interaction at the upper critical dimension, which appears also in the\ncontext of molecular beam epitaxy. Depending on the origin of the surface\nparticle's mobility, the resulting model shows two different scaling regimes;\nIf the particles move mainly due to the gravity, the leading dispersion law is\n$\\omega \\sim k^2$, and the mean-field approximation describing a flat interface\nis exact in any spatial dimension. On the other hand, if the particles move\nmainly due to the surface curvature, the interface becomes rough with the\nmean-field dispersion law $\\omega \\sim k^4$ , and the corrections to scaling\nexponents must be taken into account. We show, that the latter model consist of\ntwo sub-class of models that are decoupled in all orders of perturbation\ntheory. Moreover, our RG analysis of the general model reveals that the\nuniversal scaling is described by a rougher interface than CKPZ universality\nclass. The universal exponents are derived within the one-loop approximation in\nboth fixed $d$ and $\\varepsilon$-expansion schemes, and their relation is\ndiscussed.

To this goal, we propose a novel method to\naugment the monolingual source data using multilingual code-switching via\nrandom translations to enhance a transformer's language neutrality when\nfine-tuning it for a downstream task. This method also helps discover novel\ninsights on how code-switching with different language families around the\nworld impact the performance on the target language. Experiments on the\nbenchmark dataset of MultiATIS++ yielded an average improvement of +4.2% in\naccuracy for intent task and +1.8% in F1 for slot task using our method over\nthe state-of-the-art across 8 different languages. Furthermore, we present an\napplication of our method for crisis informatics using a new human-annotated\ntweet dataset of slot filling in English and Haitian Creole, collected during\nHaiti earthquake disaster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 21:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Integrated microcombs can be manufactured using wafer-scale process and\nhave been applied in numerous applications. Most of these advances are based on\nthe harnessing of dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in optical microresonators\nwith anomalous group velocity dispersion (GVD). However, microcombs can also be\ngenerated with normal GVD using dissipative localized structures that are\nreferred to as \"dark pulse\", \"switching wave\" or \"platicon\". Importantly, as\nmost materials feature intrinsic normal GVD, the requirement of dispersion\nengineering is significantly relaxed for platicon generation. Therefore while\nDKS microcombs require particular designs and fabrication processes, platicon\nmicrocombs can be readily built using standard CMOS-compatible platforms such\nas thin-film (i.e. typically below 300 nm) Si3N4. Yet laser self-injection\nlocking that has been recently used to create highly compact integrated DKS\nmicrocomb modules has not been demonstrated for platicons.

Manually\nassigning ICD codes is prone to human error due to the large code vocabulary\nand the similarities between codes. Since machine learning based approaches\nrequire ground truth training data, the inconsistency among human coders is\nmanifested as noise in labeling, which makes the training and evaluation of ICD\nclassifiers difficult in presence of such noise. This paper investigates the\ncharacteristics of such noise in manually-assigned ICD-10 codes and\nfurthermore, proposes a method to train robust ICD-10 classifiers in the\npresence of labeling noise. Our research concluded that the nature of such\nnoise is systematic. Most of the existing methods for handling label noise\nassume that the noise is completely random and independent of features or\nlabels, which is not the case for ICD data. Therefore, we develop a new method\nfor training robust classifiers in the presence of systematic noise. We first\nidentify ICD-10 codes that human coders tend to misuse or confuse, based on the\ncodes' locations in the ICD-10 hierarchy, the types of the codes, and baseline\nclassifier's prediction behaviors; we then develop a novel training strategy\nthat accounts for such noise. We compared our method with the baseline that\ndoes not handle label noise and the baseline methods that assume random noise,\nand demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms all baselines when\nevaluated on expert validated labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 23:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Moreover, these cloud-based solutions often\ncentralize the resources and are far away from the end IoTs and cannot respond\nto users in time due to network congestion when massive numbers of tasks\noffload through the core network. Therefore, by decentralizing resources\nspatially close to IoT devices, mobile edge computing (MEC) can reduce latency\nand improve service quality for a smart city, where service requests can be\nfulfilled in proximity.

A simple model may\nassume the human will continue what they did previously; a more complex one\nmight predict that the human will act optimally, disregarding the robot;\nwhereas an even more complex one might capture the robot's ability to influence\nthe human. These models make different trade-offs between computational time\nand performance of the resulting robot plan.

By\nestimating how an alternate model could improve human prediction and how that\nmay translate to performance gain, the robot can dynamically switch human\nmodels whenever the additional computation is justified.

The key to successful radar-camera fusion\nis the accurate data association. The challenges in the radar-camera\nassociation can be attributed to the complexity of driving scenes, the noisy\nand sparse nature of radar measurements, and the depth ambiguity from 2D\nbounding boxes. Traditional rule-based association methods are susceptible to\nperformance degradation in challenging scenarios and failure in corner cases.\nIn this study, we propose to address radar-camera association via deep\nrepresentation learning, to explore feature-level interaction and global\nreasoning.

This phase has a different packing\nsequence from all known transition metal dichalcogenides to date. Electronic\ncalculations and detailed transport analysis of the new polymorphic\nPdSe1.3Te0.7 phase are presented. In the trigonal phase region,\nsuperconductivity with enhanced critical temperature is also observed within a\nnarrow range of Te content (1.0 \\leq x \\leq 1.2). The rich phase diagram, new\npolymorphic structure as well as abnormally enhanced superconductivity could\nfurther stimulate more interest to explore new types of polymorphs and\ninvestigate their transport and electronic properties in the transition metal\ndichalcogenides family that are of significant interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 04:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Here for the first time, we find and\ninvestigate an on-disk prominence bubble around a filament barb on 2019 March\n18 based on stereoscopic observations from NVST, SDO, and STEREO-A. In\nhigh-resolution NVST H$\\alpha$ images, this bubble has a sharp arch-like\nboundary and a projected width of $\\thicksim$26 Mm. Combining SDO and STEREO-A\nimages, we further reconstruct 3D structure of the bubble boundary, whose\nmaximum height is $\\thicksim$15.6 Mm. The squashing factor Q map deduced from\nextrapolated 3D magnetic fields around the bubble depicts a distinct\narch-shaped interface with a height of $\\thicksim$11 Mm, which agrees well with\nthe reconstructed 3D structure of the observed bubble boundary. Under the\ninterface lies a set of magnetic loops, which is rooted on a surrounding\nphotospheric magnetic patch. To be more persuasive, another on-disk bubble on\n2019 June 10 is presented as a supplement. According to these results obtained\nfrom on-disk bubble observations, we suggest that the bubble boundary\ncorresponds to the interface between the prominence dips (barb) and the\nunderlying magnetic loops rooted nearby. It is thus reasonable to speculate\nthat the bubble can form around a filament barb below which there is a\nphotospheric magnetic patch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 07:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

This is because for Smith-Purcell\nradiation it is the coherence length of a virtual photon that plays a role of\nthe radiation formation width and not the entire electron's coherence length\nthat can well be orders of magnitude larger. This is a common feature for all\nthe radiation processes in which a photon is emitted not directly by the\nelectron, which can be delocalized in space, but rather by a much better\nlocalized atom or a conduction electron on a surface. Therefore, in our opinion\nthe results of Remez et al. cannot rule out the alternative hypothesis of the\ndelocalized charge. The question, mainly addressed in the comment by Karnieli\net al., of whether the measurements were performed in the wave zone or not is\ninteresting but secondary. We emphasize that the measured distributions are\nunusually wide and neither the original paper nor the recent comment fully\ndiscusses and rules out all alternative hypotheses that could have led to the\nsame distributions. On the contrary, there exists a family of classical effects\nthat could also have resulted in the measured distributions and that were\nneither discussed nor even mentioned by the authors. Such alternative\nhypotheses include (i) effects of the beam sizes, of its angular divergence, of\nthe temporal coherence of the process, and (ii) influence of the grating shape\nand of its material. Finally, we propose to repeat the experiment and to\nmeasure diffraction radiation from a thin metallic semi-plane or Compton\nemission in a laser pulse. In these cases, the classical effects play a much\nsmaller role and the results of such measurements would have higher\ncredibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 08:17:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 22:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

In this\npaper, we proposed the general heterogeneous message passing paradigm and\ndesigned R-GSN that does not need meta-path, which is much improved compared to\nthe baseline R-GCN. Experiments have shown that our R-GSN algorithm achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance on the ogbn-mag large scale heterogeneous\ngraph dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 09:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 17:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 09:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Then, the cost function and constraints of the decision making are\ndesigned considering multiple performance indexes, i.e. the safety, comfort and\nefficiency.

Sequential orderings are well-known and a\nsimultaneous order means that all operators are used simultaneously (in\nparallel). String-averaging allows to use strings of indices, constructed by\nsubsets of the index set of all operators, to apply the operators along these\nstrings and then to combine their end-points in some agreed manner to yield the\nnext iterate of the algorithm. String-averaging methods were discussed and used\nfor solving the common fixed point problem or its important special case of the\nconvex feasibility problem. In this paper we propose and investigate\nstring-averaging methods for the problem of best approximation to the common\nfixed point set of a family of operators. This problem involves finding a point\nin the common fixed point set of a family of operators that is closest to a\ngiven point, called an anchor point. We construct string-averaging methods for\nsolving the best approximation problem to the common fixed points set of either\nfinite or infinite families of firmly nonexpansive operators in a real Hilbert\nspace.

Some of our string-averaging methods are labeled as static because\nthey use a fixed pre-determined set of strings.

This is because training sets are often relatively small due\nto the significant time and financial costs incurred in medical data\nacquisition and labelling. Data augmentation is therefore often used to expand\nthe availability of training data and to increase generalization. However,\naugmentation strategies are often chosen on an ad-hoc basis without\njustification. In this paper, we present an augmentation policy search method\nwith the goal of improving model classification performance. We include in the\naugmentation policy search additional transformations that are often used in\nmedical image analysis and evaluate their performance. In addition, we extend\nthe augmentation policy search to include non-linear mixed-example data\naugmentation strategies. Using these learned policies, we show that principled\ndata augmentation for medical image model training can lead to significant\nimprovements in ultrasound standard plane detection, with an an average\nF1-score improvement of 7.0% overall over naive data augmentation strategies in\nultrasound fetal standard plane classification.

The detection of low-magnitude seismic events is\nessential for microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing, carbon capture\nand storage, and geothermal operations for hazard detection and mitigation.\nMoreover, the detection of micro-earthquakes is crucial to understand the\nunderlying mechanisms of larger earthquakes. Various algorithms, including deep\nlearning methods, have been proposed over the years to detect such\nlow-magnitude events. However, there is still a need for improving the\nrobustness of these methods in discriminating between local sources of noise\nand weak seismic events. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to detect seismic events from shallow borehole stations in\nGroningen, the Netherlands. We train a CNN model to detect low-magnitude\nearthquakes, harnessing the multi-level sensor configuration of the G-network\nin Groningen. Each G-network station contains four geophones at depths of 50,\n100, 150, and 200 meters. Unlike prior deep learning approaches that use\n3-component seismic records only at a single sensor level, we use records from\nthe entire borehole as one training example. This allows us to train the CNN\nmodel using moveout patterns of the energy traveling across the borehole\nsensors to discriminate between events originating in the subsurface and local\nnoise arriving from the surface. We compare the prediction accuracy of our\ntrained CNN model to that of the STA/LTA and template matching algorithms on a\ntwo-month continuous record. We demonstrate that the CNN model shows\nsignificantly better performance than STA/LTA and template matching in\ndetecting new events missing from the catalog and minimizing false detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 11:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Our system aims to\nprovide accurate global 6-DoF estimation under complex indoor-outdoor\nenvironment where GNSS signals may be intermittent or even totally unavailable.\nTo connect global measurements with local states, a coarse-to-fine\ninitialization procedure is proposed to efficiently calibrate the\ntransformation online and initialize GNSS states from only a short window of\nmeasurements.

We further propose the star-of-David and tri-hexagon\n(inverse star-of-David) configurations for the density-wave order in\nKV$_3$Sb$_5$. These configurations are strongly reminiscent of $p$-wave states\nexpected in the Hubbard model on the kagome lattice at the filling level of the\nvan Hove singularity. The proximity to this regime should have intriguing and\nfar-reaching implications for the physics of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and related\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 12:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 11:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

Extracting information from these MSR images represents huge\nopportunities for enhanced feature representation and characterisation.\nHowever, MSR images suffer from two critical issues: 1) increased scale\nvariation of geo-objects and 2) loss of detailed information at coarse spatial\nresolutions. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel\nscale-aware neural network (SaNet) for semantic segmentation of MSR remotely\nsensed imagery. SaNet deploys a densely connected feature network (DCFFM)\nmodule to capture high-quality multi-scale context, such that the scale\nvariation is handled properly and the quality of segmentation is increased for\nboth large and small objects. A spatial feature recalibration (SFRM) module is\nfurther incorporated into the network to learn intact semantic content with\nenhanced spatial relationships, where the negative effects of information loss\nare removed.

Firstly,\nmost of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of\nrainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties\n(e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural\ncontinuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the\nspatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods\nseriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are\nalways deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic\nand real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real\nscenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semi-supervised\nvideo deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit\nthe rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics.\nSpecifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one\ntransition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and\ntemporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are\nparameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs).

One of the main tenets of CbD is that the\nidentity of a random variable is determined not only by its content (that which\nis measured or responded to) but also by contexts, systematically recorded\nconditions under which the variable is observed; and the variables in different\ncontexts possess no joint distributions. I explain why this principle has no\nparadoxical consequences, and why it does not support the holistic \"everything\ndepends on everything else\" view. Contextuality is defined as the difference\nbetween two differences: (1) the difference between content-sharing random\nvariables when taken in isolation, and (2) the difference between the same\nrandom variables when taken within their contexts. Contextuality thus defined\nis a special form of context-dependence rather than a synonym for the latter.\nThe theory applies to any empirical situation describable in terms of random\nvariables. Deterministic situations are trivially noncontextual in CbD, but\nsome of them can be described by systems of epistemic random variables, in\nwhich random variability is replaced with epistemic uncertainty.\nMathematically, such systems are treated as if they were ordinary systems of\nrandom variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 15:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

The combination of SCF framework and a simple local\nindex can produce an index with competitive performance and much lower\ncomplexity compared with elaborately-designed state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 07:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

While\ninitially this was mostly about textual content, over time images and videos\ngained popularity, as they are much easier to consume, attract more attention,\nand spread further than text. As a result, researchers started leveraging\ndifferent modalities and combinations thereof to tackle online multimodal\noffensive content. In this study, we offer a survey on the state-of-the-art on\nmultimodal disinformation detection covering various combinations of\nmodalities: text, images, speech, video, social media network structure, and\ntemporal information. Moreover, while some studies focused on factuality,\nothers investigated how harmful the content is. While these two components in\nthe definition of disinformation (i) factuality, and (ii) harmfulness, are\nequally important, they are typically studied in isolation. Thus, we argue for\nthe need to tackle disinformation detection by taking into account multiple\nmodalities as well as both factuality and harmfulness, in the same framework.\nFinally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 18:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Time\nseries forecasting algorithm based on complex network analysis is a research\nhotspot. How to use time series information to achieve more accurate\nforecasting is a problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a weighted\nnetwork forecasting method to improve the forecasting accuracy. Firstly, the\ntime series will be transformed into a complex network, and the similarity\nbetween nodes will be found. Then, the similarity will be used as a weight to\nmake weighted forecasting on the predicted values produced by different nodes.\nCompared with the previous method, the proposed method is more accurate. In\norder to verify the effect of the proposed method, the experimental part is\ntested on M1, M3 datasets and Construction Cost Index (CCI) dataset, which\nshows that the proposed method has more accurate forecasting performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 01:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 01:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 08:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 06:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 06:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 06:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

This research aims to\ndecrease the registration error, eliminate outcomes that are trapped in local\nminima to improve the alignment problems, handle the occlusion, and maximize\nthe overlapping parts. Methodology: markerless image registration method was\nused for Augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery to guide and\nvisualize the surgical operation. While weight least square algorithm was used\nto enhance stereo camera-based tracking by filling border occlusion in right to\nleft direction and non-border occlusion from left to right direction. Results:\nThis study has improved video precision to 0.57 mm~0.61 mm alignment error.\nFurthermore, with the use of bidirectional points, for example, forwards and\nbackwards directional cloud point, the iteration on image registration was\ndecreased. This has led to improve the processing time as well. The processing\ntime of video frames was improved to 7.4~11.74 fps. Conclusions: It seems clear\nthat this proposed system has focused on overcoming the misalignment difficulty\ncaused by movement of patient and enhancing the AR visualization during knee\nreplacement surgery. The proposed system was reliable and favorable which helps\nin eliminating alignment error by ascertaining the optimal rigid transformation\nbetween two cloud points and removing the outliers and non-Gaussian noise. The\nproposed augmented reality system helps in accurate visualization and\nnavigation of anatomy of knee such as femur, tibia, cartilage, blood vessels,\netc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 19:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}
