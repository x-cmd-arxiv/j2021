Most existing works mainly tackle this problem by\nreusing the backbone network to extract features of detected discriminative\nregions. However, this strategy inevitably complicates the pipeline and pushes\nthe proposed regions to contain most parts of the objects thus fails to locate\nthe really important parts. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) shows its strong\nperformance in the traditional classification task. The self-attention\nmechanism of the transformer links every patch token to the classification\ntoken. In this work, we first evaluate the effectiveness of the ViT framework\nin the fine-grained recognition setting. Then motivated by the strength of the\nattention link can be intuitively considered as an indicator of the importance\nof tokens, we further propose a novel Part Selection Module that can be applied\nto most of the transformer architectures where we integrate all raw attention\nweights of the transformer into an attention map for guiding the network to\neffectively and accurately select discriminative image patches and compute\ntheir relations.

In many cases a texture\nimage cannot cover a large 3D model surface because of its small resolution.\nConventional techniques like repeating, mirror repeating or clamp to edge do\nnot yield visually acceptable results. Deep learning based texture synthesis\nhas proven to be very effective in such cases. All deep texture synthesis\nmethods trying to create larger resolution textures are limited in terms of GPU\nmemory resources. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to example-based\ntexture synthesis by using a robust deep learning process for creating tiles of\narbitrary resolutions that resemble the structural components of an input\ntexture. In this manner, our method is firstly much less memory limited owing\nto the fact that a new texture tile of small size is synthesized and merged\nwith the original texture and secondly can easily produce missing parts of a\nlarge texture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Time arrow emerges only when\nensembles of classical particles are treated probabilistically, outside of\nphysics laws, and the entropy and the second law of thermodynamics are\nintroduced. In quantum physics, no mechanism for a time arrow has been proposed\ndespite its intrinsic probabilistic nature. In consequence, one cannot explain\nwhy an electron in an excited state will \"spontaneously\" transition into a\nground state as a photon is created and emitted, instead of continuing in its\nreversible unitary evolution. To address such phenomena, we introduce an\nentropy for quantum physics, which will conduce to the emergence of a time\narrow.\n  The entropy is a measure of randomness over the degrees of freedom of a\nquantum state. It is dimensionless; it is a relativistic scalar, it is\ninvariant under coordinate transformation of position and momentum that\nmaintain conjugate properties and under CPT transformations; and its minimum is\npositive due to the uncertainty principle.\n  To excogitate why some quantum physical processes cannot take place even\nthough they obey conservation laws, we partition the set of all evolutions of\nan initial state into four blocks, based on whether the entropy is (i)\nincreasing but not a constant, (ii) decreasing but not a constant, (iii) a\nconstant, (iv) oscillating. We propose a law that in quantum physics entropy\n(weakly) increases over time. Thus, evolutions in the set (ii) are disallowed,\nand evolutions in set (iv) are barred from completing an oscillation period by\ninstantaneously transitioning to a new state. This law for quantum physics\nlimits physical scenarios beyond conservation laws, providing causality\nreasoning by defining a time arrow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

However, because of the\nintricacy in the interplay between complex fluid flows and nonlinear structural\ndeformations that accompany the phenomenology of slamming, a general\nengineering theory in slamming has yet to be uncovered, and so design relies on\nspecialized theories. In this paper, we propose one such theory for a design\ncase that has, until now, eluded a proper description. In pursuit of this\ntheory, we employ a specialized implicit, partitioned fluid-structural\ninteraction (FSI) simulation approach, in order to study the underlying\nphysical mechanisms accompanying the oblique impact of a flexible plate during\nwater entry. In the present work, we first present validation results from\nflexible plate water entry experiments, to confirm the veracity of the\ndeveloped FSI solver. Subsequent to validation, we carry out a series of\nnumerical analyses, in an effort to characterize the regimes in impact force\nand plate out-of-plane deformations, as a function of impact velocities and\nplate flexural rigidity. Finally, we use our FSI solver, as a kind of\n\"microscope\", to study the mechanistic evolution of fluid flows and elastic\nplate deformations that occur during slamming. Based on these observations, we\npropose a novel, but simple engineering theory for flexible plates obliquely\nimpacting the water free surface (e.g. high speed porpoising water craft\nreentry).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 19:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 00:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 21:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

A\nhigher-level trust increases the willingness of a human operator to assign\ntasks, share plans, and reduce the interruption during robot executions,\nthereby facilitating human-robot integration both physically and mentally.\nHowever, due to real-world disturbances, robots inevitably make mistakes,\ndecreasing human trust and further influencing collaboration. Trust is fragile\nand trust loss is triggered easily when robots show incapability of task\nexecutions, making the trust maintenance challenging.

However, we find\nthree shortcomings of the currently popular definition and detection methods\nrendering the concept less powerful. First, the classical definition combines\nhigh transitivity with a low average path length in a rather ad-hoc fashion\nwhich confounds the two separate aspects. We find that in several cases,\nnetworks get flagged as \"small world\" by the current methodology solely because\nof their high transitivity. Second, the detection methods lack a formal\nstatistical inference, and third, the comparison is typically performed against\nsimplistic random graph models as the baseline which ignores well-known network\ncharacteristics. We propose three innovations to address these issues. First,\nwe decouple the properties of high transitivity and low average path length as\nseparate events to test for. Second, we define the property as a statistical\ntest between a suitable null model and a superimposed alternative model. Third,\nthe test is performed using parametric bootstrap with several null models to\nallow a wide range of background structures in the network.

These cause design\ncomplexities, e.g., due to transceiver's hardware impairments, and impose a\nsubstantial signaling overhead. We set our main goal to mitigate these\nrequirements in order to make the spectrum sharing systems practically\nfeasible. To cope with the lack of a model we develop a coexisting deep\nreinforcement learning approach for continuous power allocation in both\nsystems. Importantly, via our solution, the two systems allocate power merely\nbased on geographical location of their users. Moreover, the inter-system\nsignaling requirement is reduced to exchanging only the number of primary users\nthat their QoS requirements are violated.

Fast neutron detection with organic scintillators has been widely\nused for various nuclear applications and homeland security.

The time distributions of\nneutron and gamma-rays events for the plutonium metal plates designed as fuel\nplates for the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Zero Power were measured with\nthe Fast Neutron Multiplicity Counter (FNMC) consisting of 8 EJ-309 liquid\nscintillators and 8 stilbene detectors. Since the neutron correlated counts\nwithin the coincidence window of 40 ns are related to 240Pu effective mass of\nplutonium metal plates we investigated the randomness of the measured neutron\nand gamma-rays events. To access such information, we resort to complexity\nmeasures in the hope of being able to connect complexity values with the\nreliability of detection.

In this\npaper we present a modified batch intrinsic plasticity (modBIP) method for\npre-training the random coefficients in the ELM neural networks. The current\nmethod is devised based on the same principle as the batch intrinsic plasticity\n(BIP) method, namely, by enhancing the information transmission in every node\nof the neural network. It differs from BIP in two prominent aspects. First,\nmodBIP does not involve the activation function in its algorithm, and it can be\napplied with any activation function in the neural network. In contrast, BIP\nemploys the inverse of the activation function in its construction, and\nrequires the activation function to be invertible (or monotonic). The modBIP\nmethod can work with the often-used non-monotonic activation functions (e.g.\nGaussian, swish, Gaussian error linear unit, and radial-basis type functions),\nwith which BIP breaks down. Second, modBIP generates target samples on random\nintervals with a minimum size, which leads to highly accurate computation\nresults when combined with ELM. The combined ELM/modBIP method is markedly more\naccurate than ELM/BIP in numerical simulations. Ample numerical experiments are\npresented with shallow and deep neural networks for function approximation and\nboundary/initial value problems with partial differential equations. They\ndemonstrate that the combined ELM/modBIP method produces highly accurate\nsimulation results, and that its accuracy is insensitive to the\nrandom-coefficient initializations in the neural network.

In the past twenty years, a plethora of new artificial\nferromagnetic materials have been found by introducing defects into\nnon-magnetic host materials. In contrast to the intrinsic ferromagnetic\nmaterials, they offer an outstanding degree of material engineering freedom,\nprovided one finds a type of defect to functionalize every possible host\nmaterial to add magnetism to its intrinsic properties. Still, one controversial\nquestion remains: Are these materials really technologically relevant\nferromagnets? To answer this question, in this work the emergence of a\nferromagnetic phase upon ion irradiation is systematically investigated both\ntheoretically and experimentally. Quantitative predictions are validated\nagainst experimental data from the literature of SiC hosts irradiated with high\nenergy Ne ions and own experiments on low energy Ar ion irradiation of TiO$_2$\nhosts. In the high energy regime, a bulk magnetic phase emerges, which is\nlimited by host lattice amorphization, whereas at low ion energies an ultrathin\nmagnetic layer forms at the surface and evolves into full magnetic percolation.\nLowering the ion energy, the magnetic layer thickness reduces down to a\nbilayer, where a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy appears due to magnetic\nsurface states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 21:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 09:07:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 11:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Due to their co-occurring nature, the course of one comorbidity is\noften highly dependent on the course of the other disease and, hence,\ntreatments can have significant spill-over effects. Despite the prevalence of\ncomorbidities among patients, a comprehensive statistical framework for\nmodeling the longitudinal dynamics of comorbidities is missing. In this paper,\nwe propose a probabilistic model for analyzing comorbidity dynamics over time\nin patients. Specifically, we develop a coupled hidden Markov model with a\npersonalized, non-homogeneous transition mechanism, named Comorbidity-HMM. The\nspecification of our Comorbidity-HMM is informed by clinical research: (1) It\naccounts for different disease states (i. e., acute, stable) in the disease\nprogression by introducing latent states that are of clinical meaning. (2) It\nmodels a coupling among the trajectories from comorbidities to capture\nco-evolution dynamics. (3) It considers between-patient heterogeneity (e. g.,\nrisk factors, treatments) in the transition mechanism. Based on our model, we\ndefine a spill-over effect that measures the indirect effect of treatments on\npatient trajectories through coupling (i. e., through comorbidity\nco-evolution). We evaluated our proposed Comorbidity-HMM based on 675 health\ntrajectories where we investigate the joint progression of diabetes mellitus\nand chronic liver disease. Compared to alternative models without coupling, we\nfind that our Comorbidity-HMM achieves a superior fit. Further, we quantify the\nspill-over effect, that is, to what extent diabetes treatments are associated\nwith a change in the chronic liver disease from an acute to a stable disease\nstate. To this end, our model is of direct relevance for both treatment\nplanning and clinical research in the context of comorbidities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 22:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

In\nthis paper, we first revisit and explore the framework of LNEC coding, and then\nunify two well-known LNEC coding approaches. Furthermore, by developing a\ngraph-theoretic approach to the framework of LNEC coding, we obtain a\nsignificantly enhanced characterization of the error correction capability of\nLNEC codes in terms of the minimum distances at the sink nodes. In LNEC coding,\nthe minimum required field size for the existence of LNEC codes, in particular\nLNEC maximum distance separable (MDS) codes which are a type of most important\noptimal codes, is an open problem not only of theoretical interest but also of\npractical importance, because it is closely related to the implementation of\nthe coding scheme in terms of computational complexity and storage requirement.\nBy applying the graph-theoretic approach, we obtain an improved upper bound on\nthe minimum required field size. The improvement over the existing results is\nin general significant. The improved upper bound, which is graph-theoretic,\ndepends only on the network topology and requirement of the error correction\ncapability but not on a specific code construction.

By rotating the slit, we observed the scientific object and\na nearby comparison star in one exposure, so that the spectra of both objects\nshould have the same telluric transmission spectrum. The telluric transmission\nspectrum was constructed by dividing the observed spectrum of comparison star\nby its stellar template, and was used to correct the telluric absorption lines\nof the scientific object. Using the long slit spectrograph of Lijiang 2.4-meter\ntelescope, we designed a long-term spectroscopic observation strategy, and\nfinished a four-year spectroscopic monitoring for a pair of objects (an active\ngalactic nuclei and an non-varying comparison star). We applied this method to\ncorrect the telluric absorption lines of the long-term monitored spectra by\nLijiang 2.4-meter telescope, and investigated the variation of the telluric\nabsorptions at Lijiang Observatory. We found that the telluric absorption\ntransparency is mainly modulated by the seasonal variability of the relative\nhumidity, airmass and seeing. Using the scatter of the [O~III] $\\lambda$5007\nfluxes emitted from the narrow-line region of active galactic nuclei as an\nindicator, we found that the correction accuracy of the telluric absorption\nlines is 1%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 04:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Particularly, when mmWave communication is applied\nto a mobile terminal device, communication can be frequently broken because of\nrampant hand blockage. Although a number of mobile phone companies have\nsuggested configuring multiple sets of antenna modules at different locations\non a mobile phone to circumvent this problem, identifying an optimal antenna\nmodule and a beam pair by simultaneously opening multiple sets of antenna\nmodules causes the problem of excessive power consumption and device costs.

It is curious why some flares cause\nsunquakes while others do not. Here we propose a hypothesis to explain the\ndisproportionate occurrence of sunquakes: during a flare's impulsive phase when\nthe flare's impulse acts upon the photosphere, delivered by shock waves,\nenergetic particles from higher atmosphere, or by downward Lorentz Force, a\nsunquake tends to occur if the background oscillation at the flare footpoint\nhappens to oscillate downward in the same direction with the impulse from\nabove. To verify this hypothesis, we select 60 strong flares in Solar Cycle 24,\nand examine the background oscillatory velocity at the sunquake sources during\nthe flares' impulsive phases. Since the Doppler velocity observations at\nsunquake sources are usually corrupted during the flares, we reconstruct the\noscillatory velocity in the flare sites using helioseismic holography method\nwith an observation-based Green's function. A total of 24 flares are found to\nbe sunquake active, giving a total of 41 sunquakes. It is also found that in\n3-5 mHz frequency band, 25 out of 31 sunquakes show net downward oscillatory\nvelocities during the flares' impulsive phases, and in 5-7 mHz frequency band,\n33 out of 38 sunquakes show net downward velocities. These results support the\nhypothesis that a sunquake more likely occurs when a flare impacts a\nphotospheric area with a downward background oscillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 06:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Recently, the chaotic baseband\nwireless communication system (CBWCS) is promising to eliminate the\ninter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation. However, the\ncurrent technique is only capable of removing the partial effect of ISI, due to\nonly past decoded bits are available for the suboptimal decoding threshold\ncalculation. However, the future transmitting bits also contribute to the\nthreshold. The unavailable future information bits needed by the optimal\ndecoding threshold are an obstacle to further improve the bit error rate (BER)\nperformance. Different from the previous method using echo state network (ESN)\nto predict one future information bit, the proposed method in this paper\npredicts the optimal threshold directly using ESN. The proposed ESN-based\nthreshold prediction method simplifies the symbol decoding operation by\nremoving the threshold calculation from the transmitting symbols and channel\ninformation, which achieves better BER performance as compared to the previous\nmethod. The reason for this superior result lies in two folds, first, the\nproposed ESN is capable of using more future symbols information conveyed by\nthe ESN input to get more accurate threshold; second, the proposed method here\ndoes not need to estimate the channel information using Least Square method,\nwhich avoids the extra error caused by inaccurate channel information\nestimation.

We quantitatively determine the\nfourth-order susceptibility, which exhibits strong anisotropy depending on the\ndirections of the charge current and the light polarization. Employing symmetry\nanalysis of Berry curvature multipoles, we demonstrate that the nonlinear Kerr\nrotations can arise from the Berry curvature hexapole allowed by the\ncrystalline symmetries of WTe2. There also exist marginal signals that are\nincompatible with the symmetries, which suggest a hidden phase associated with\nthe nonlinear process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Substantial space-savings can be realized by\ntuning redundancy schemes to observed disk failure rates. However, prior design\nproposals for such tuning are unusable in real-world clusters, because the IO\nload of transitions between schemes overwhelms the storage infrastructure\n(termed transition overload).\n  This paper analyzes traces for millions of disks from production systems at\nGoogle, NetApp, and Backblaze to expose and understand transition overload as a\nroadblock to disk-adaptive redundancy: transition IO under existing approaches\ncan consume 100% cluster IO continuously for several weeks. Building on the\ninsights drawn, we present PACEMAKER, a low-overhead disk-adaptive redundancy\norchestrator. PACEMAKER mitigates transition overload by (1) proactively\norganizing data layouts to make future transitions efficient, and (2)\ninitiating transitions proactively in a manner that avoids urgency while not\ncompromising on space-savings. Evaluation of PACEMAKER with traces from four\nlarge (110K-450K disks) production clusters show that the transition IO\nrequirement decreases to never needing more than 5% cluster IO bandwidth\n(0.2-0.4% on average). PACEMAKER achieves this while providing overall\nspace-savings of 14-20% and never leaving data under-protected. We also\ndescribe and experiment with an integration of PACEMAKER into HDFS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Savanna, and Forest states coexist under certain\nconditions, consistent with past theoretical work and empirical observations.\nHowever, a new Grassland state, unseen in the corresponding deterministic\nmodel, emerges as an alternative quasi-stable state under fluctuations,\nproviding a novel theoretical basis for the appearance of widespread grasslands\nin some empirical analyses.

In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric\nchange detection in the context of a digital twin.

In this paper we present a new strategy to study the\nproperties of a regularization method on the example of Tikhonov\nregularization. The technique is based on the observation that Tikhonov\nregularization approximates the unknown exact solution in the range of the\nadjoint of the forward operator. This is closely related to the concept of\napproximate source conditions, which we generalize to describe not only the\napproximation of the unknown solution, but also noise-free and noisy data; all\nfrom the same source space. Combining these three approximation results we\nderive the well-known convergence results in a concise way and improve the\nunderstanding by tightening the relation between concepts such as convergence\nrates, parameter choice, and saturation. The new technique is not limited to\nTikhonov regularization, it can be applied also to iterative regularization,\nwhich we demonstrate by relating Tikhonov regularization and Landweber\niteration.

On a\nmathematical level, symmetry groups single out a certain structure in the\nHilbert space that leads to a reduction. This structure is given by the\nirreducible representations of the group, and in general it can be identified\nwith an operator algebra (a.k.a. C*-algebra or von Neumann algebra). The\nprimary focus of this thesis is the extension of the framework of reductions\nfrom symmetries to operator algebras, and its applications in\nfinite-dimensional quantum mechanics. Finding the irreducible representations\nstructure is the principal problem when working with operator algebras. We will\ntherefore review the representation theory of finite-dimensional operator\nalgebras and elucidate this problem with the help of two novel concepts:\nminimal isometries and bipartition tables. One of the main technical results\nthat we present is the Scattering Algorithm for analytical derivations of the\nirreducible representations structure of operator algebras. For applications,\nwe will introduce a symmetry-agnostic approach to the reduction of dynamics\nwhere we circumvent the non-trivial task of identifying symmetries, and\ndirectly reduce the dynamics generated by a Hamiltonian. We will also consider\nquantum state reductions that arise from operational constraints, such as the\npartial trace or the twirl map, and study how operational constraints lead to\ndecoherence. Apart from that, we will extend the idea of reduction beyond\noperator algebras to operator systems, and formulate a quantum notion of\ncoarse-graining that so far only existed in classical probability theory. We\nwill also characterize how the uncertainty principle transitions to the\nclassical regime under coarse-grained measurements and discuss the implications\nin a finite-dimensional setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 09:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

In particular, this is the case in dimension $n \\le 4$.\n  Optimal functions for the Sobolev inequality are weak solutions to the\ncritical $p$-Laplace equation. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we\naddress the classification of radial solutions (not necessarily optimizers) to\nsuch a PDE. Actually, we consider the more general critical or supercritical\nequation \\[ -\\Delta_p u = u^q \\, , \\quad u>0 \\, , \\qquad \\text{on }\n\\mathbb{M}^n \\, , \\] where $q \\ge p^*-1$. We show that if there exists a radial\nfinite-energy solution, then $\\mathbb{M}^n$ is necessarily isometric to\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, $q=p^*-1$ and $u$ is an Aubin-Talenti profile. Furthermore, on\nmodel manifolds, we describe the asymptotic behavior of radial solutions not\nlying in the energy space $\\dot{W}^{1,p}(\\mathbb{M}^n)$, studying separately\nthe $p$-stochastically complete and incomplete cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 09:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 10:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

In some cases, the environment is not influenced by the actions\nof the RL agent, in which case the problem can be modeled as a contextual\nmulti-armed bandit and lightweight myopic algorithms can be employed. On the\nother hand, when the RL agent's actions affect the environment, the problem\nmust be modeled as a Markov decision process and more complex RL algorithms are\nrequired which take the future effects of actions into account. Moreover, in\npractice, it is often unknown from the outset whether or not the agent's\nactions will impact the environment and it is therefore not possible to\ndetermine which RL algorithm is most fitting. In this work, we propose to avoid\nthis difficult decision entirely and incorporate a choice mechanism into our RL\nframework.

With the realistic\ncoupling between the cavity and the environment assumed, a simple master\nequation is derived, leading to the explicit analytic solution for the resonant\ncase. This solution is suitable for the analyses not only on the single\nexcitation states but also on many excitation states, which enables us to\ninvestigate the photon coherent state and to observe sharp collapses and\nrevivals under dissipation. For the off-resonant case, on the other hand, the\npresent study presents an analytic, systematic method instead. We examine the\nsmall and large detuning limits and discuss the condition where the widely-used\nphenomenological treatment is justified. Explicit evaluations of the time\nevolutions for various initial states with finite detuning are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 10:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

In\nthis paper, we present a fast algorithm that achieves global optimality called\nrotation coordinate descent (RCD). Unlike block coordinate descent (BCD) which\nsolves SDP by updating the semidefinite matrix in a row-by-row fashion, RCD\ndirectly maintains and updates all valid rotations throughout the iterations.\nThis obviates the need to store a large dense semidefinite matrix. We\nmathematically prove the convergence of our algorithm and empirically show its\nsuperior efficiency over state-of-the-art global methods on a variety of\nproblem configurations. Maintaining valid rotations also facilitates\nincorporating local optimisation routines for further speed-ups.

Several methods have been\nexplored in literature for generating captions or semi-structured descriptions\nfrom floor plan images. Since only the caption is insufficient to capture\nfine-grained details, researchers also proposed descriptive paragraphs from\nimages. However, these descriptions have a rigid structure and lack\nflexibility, making it difficult to use them in real-time scenarios.

The fluid dynamics of this process is\ndifficult to predict because the rupture involved complex liquid-gas\ntransition. Equation of state (EOS) plays a key role in the thermodynamic\nprocess of liquid-gas transition. Here, we propose an EOS-based multiphase\nlattice Boltzmann model, in which the nonideal force is directly evaluated by\nEOSs. This multiphase model is used to model the pulmonary airway reopening and\nstudy aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first\nvalidated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in\nreasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and\nwithout aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the\ninjury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the\nsame that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway\nincreases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate\nthe effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size\nand the mechanical stresses. The results show that aerosol size and the\nmechanical stresses increase as the pressure drop enlarges and thickness of\nliquid plug become thicken, while aerosol size and the mechanical stresses\ndecrease as thickness of liquid film is thicken.

Furthermore, by mapping the N-bit parity\ndetermination problem to a matrix powering problem, we provide no-go theorems\nthat limit the quantum speedups achievable in powering non-Hermitian matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 12:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In this paper,\nwe identify two main bottlenecks: (1) the lack of a publicly available imaging\ndataset for diverse species of nematodes (especially the species only found in\nnatural environment) which requires considerable human resources in field work\nand experts in taxonomy, and (2) the lack of a standard benchmark of\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques on this dataset which demands the\ndiscipline background in computer science.

To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware\ndynamic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its\ncoefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. In practice, the\nhigh-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the\nlower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the\ncomputation burden. Since pixels or image patches belong to low-frequency areas\ncontain relatively few textural details, this dynamic network will not affect\nthe quality of resulting super-resolution images.

In this work we present new thermal inertias for 239 asteroids and\nmodel all three factors in a multi-variate model of thermal inertia. Using\nmulti-epoch infrared data of a large (239) set of objects observed by WISE, we\nderive the size, albedo, thermal inertia, surface roughness, and sense of spin\nusing a thermophysical modelling approach that doesn't require a priori\nknowledge of an object's shape or spin axis direction. Our thermal inertia\nresults are consistent with previous values from the literature for similarly\nsized asteroids, and we identify an excess of retrograde rotators among\nmain-belt asteroids < 8 km. We then combine our results with thermal inertias\nfrom the literature to construct a multi-variate model and quantify the\ndependency on asteroid diameter, rotation period, and surface temperature. This\nmulti-variate model, which accounts for co-dependencies between the three\nindependent variables, identified asteroid diameter and surface temperature as\nstrong controls on thermal inertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 13:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Kinetic models\ncoupled to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide quick and efficient ways\nto test the effect of operating conditions, fuel composition and combustor\ndesign compared to physical experiments. However, detailed chemical kinetic\nmodels are too computationally expensive for use in CFD. We propose a novel\ndata orientated three-step methodology to produce compact models that replicate\na target set of detailed model properties to a high fidelity. In the first\nstep, a reduced kinetic model is obtained by removing all non-essential species\nfrom the detailed model containing 118 species using path flux analysis (PFA).\nIt is then numerically optimised to replicate the detailed model's prediction\nin two rounds; First, to selected species (OH,H,CO and CH4) profiles in\nperfectly stirred reactor (PSR) simulations and then re-optimised to the\ndetailed model's prediction of the laminar flame speed. This is implemented by\na purposely developed Machine Learned Optimisation of Chemical Kinetics (MLOCK)\nalgorithm. The MLOCK algorithm systematically perturbs all three Arrhenius\nparameters for selected reactions and assesses the suitability of the new\nparameters through an objective error function which quantifies the error in\nthe compact model's calculation of the optimisation target. This strategy is\ndemonstrated through the production of a 19 species and a 15 species compact\nmodel for methane/air combustion. Both compact models are validated across a\nrange of 0D and 1D calculations across both lean and rich conditions and shows\ngood agreement to the parent detailed mechanism. The 15 species model is shown\nto outperform the current state-of-art models in both accuracy and range of\nconditions the model is valid over.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 13:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 15:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 15:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

We use a\ndata-set from a major corporation that includes customer investments over a\nthree year period to create a semi-synthetic data distribution where the major\nqualitative properties of the real dataset are preserved. We evaluate the\nperformance of our method and discuss practical challenges of deploying our\nformal methodology and how to address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 13:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 01:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

The fairness assumptions are of\nthe form A/B and say that state trajectories that contain infinite occurrences\nof an action a from A in a state s and finite occurrence of actions from B,\nmust also contain infinite occurrences of action a in s followed by each one of\nits possible outcomes. The infinite trajectories that violate this condition\nare deemed as unfair, and the solutions are policies for which all the fair\ntrajectories reach a goal state. We show that strong and strong-cyclic FOND\nplanning, as well as QNP planning, a planning model introduced recently for\ngeneralized planning, are all special cases of FOND planning with fairness\nassumptions of this form which can also be combined. FOND+ planning, as this\nform of planning is called, combines the syntax of FOND planning with some of\nthe versatility of LTL for expressing fairness constraints. A new planner is\nimplemented by reducing FOND+ planning to answer set programs, and the\nperformance of the planner is evaluated in comparison with FOND and QNP\nplanners, and LTL synthesis tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 13:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

The commensal\nnature of the project means that MeerTRAP will keep looking for transients even\nif the telescope is not being used specifically for that purpose. Here, we\npresent a brief overview of the MeerTRAP project. We describe the overall\ndesign, specifications and the software stack required to implement such an\nundertaking. We conclude with some science highlights that have been enabled by\nthis venture over the last 10 months of operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 14:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

The\nstandard QS method possesses high computer and algorithmic complexity for large\nsystems besides parameters whose choice are not systematic. However, simpler\napproaches, such as a reflecting boundary condition (RBC), are not able to\ncapture the localization effects as the standard QS method does. In the present\nwork, we propose a QS method that consists of reactivating nodes proportionally\nto the time they were active along the preceding simulation. The method is\ncompared with the standard QS and RBC methods for the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks, which is a\nprototype of a dynamic process with strong and localization effects. We\nverified that the method performs as well the as standard QS in all\ninvestigated simulations, providing the same scaling exponents, epidemic\nthresholds, and localized phases, thus overcoming the limitations of other\nsimpler approaches. We also report that the present method has significant\nreduction of the computer and algorithmic complexity than the standard QS\nmethods. So, this method arises as a simpler and efficient tool to analyze\nlocalization on heterogeneous structures through QS simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 14:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Applying this to FYST, however, presents significant challenges because\nof the high accuracy needed, the fact that the telescope consists of two large\noff-axis mirrors, and a requirement that measurements can be made without\npersonnel present. We use a high-frequency (~300GHz) source which is relatively\nclose to the telescope aperture (<1/100th of the Fresnel distance) to minimize\natmospheric effects. The main receiver is in the receiver cabin and can be\nmoved under remote control to different positions, so that the wave-front\nerrors in different parts of the focal plane can be measured. A second receiver\nplaced on the yoke provides a phase reference. The signals are combined in a\ndigital cross-correlation spectrometer. Scanning the telescope provides a map\nof the complex beam pattern. The surface errors are found by inference, i.e. we\nmake models of the reflectors with errors and calculate the patterns expected,\nand then iterate to find the best match to the data. To do this we have\ndeveloped a fast and accurate method for calculating the patterns using the\nKirchhoff-Fresnel formulation. This paper presents details of the design and\noutlines the results from simulations of the measurement and inference process.\nThese indicate that a measurement accuracy of ~3 microns rms is achievable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 14:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Current assessment\nmetrics evaluate experiments' ability to faithfully recover microstructural\nparameters rather than their task performance. The method we propose addresses\nthis shortcoming. For a given MRI experimental design, experiments are\nsimulated start-to-finish and task performance is computed from ROC curves and\nassociated summary metrics (e.g. AUC). Two experiments were performed: first, a\nvalidation of the pipeline's task performance predictions against clinical\nresults, comparing in-silico predictions to real-world ROC/AUC; and second, a\ndemonstration of the pipeline's advantages over traditional CED approaches,\nusing two simulated clinical classification tasks.

Furthermore, the domain-invariant representations are learned through\njoint contrastive learning between the two domains.

For structured input\nsynthesis and structured output prediction problems (e.g., layout-to-image\nsynthesis and image semantic segmentation respectively), they often are studied\nseparately. This paper proposes deep consensus learning (DCL) for joint\nlayout-to-image synthesis and weakly-supervised image semantic segmentation.\nThe former is realized by a recently proposed LostGAN approach, and the latter\nby introducing an inference network as the third player joining the two-player\ngame of LostGAN. Two deep consensus mappings are exploited to facilitate\ntraining the three networks end-to-end: Given an input layout (a list of object\nbounding boxes), the generator generates a mask (label map) and then use it to\nhelp synthesize an image. The inference network infers the mask for the\nsynthesized image. Then, the latent consensus is measured between the mask\ngenerated by the generator and the one inferred by the inference network. For\nthe real image corresponding to the input layout, its mask also is computed by\nthe inference network, and then used by the generator to reconstruct the real\nimage. Then, the data consensus is measured between the real image and its\nreconstructed image. The discriminator still plays the role of an adversary by\ncomputing the realness scores for a real image, its reconstructed image and a\nsynthesized image. In experiments, our DCL is tested in the COCO-Stuff dataset.\nIt obtains compelling layout-to-image synthesis results and weakly-supervised\nimage semantic segmentation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

In\nrecent years, a promising variation called extreme mutation testing emerged\nthat is computationally less expensive. It identifies methods where their\nfunctionality can be entirely removed, and the test suite would not notice it,\ndespite having coverage. These methods are called pseudo-tested. In this paper,\nwe compare the execution and analysis times for traditional and extreme\nmutation testing and discuss what they mean in practice. We look at how extreme\nmutation testing impacts current software development practices and discuss\nopen challenges that need to be addressed to foster industry adoption. For\nthat, we conducted an industrial case study consisting of running traditional\nand extreme mutation testing in a large software project from the semiconductor\nindustry that is covered by a test suite of more than 11,000 unit tests. In\naddition to that, we did a qualitative analysis of 25 pseudo-tested methods and\ninterviewed two experienced developers to see how they write unit tests and\ngathered opinions on how useful the findings of extreme mutation testing are.\nOur results include execution times, scores, numbers of executed tests and\nmutators, reasons why methods are pseudo-tested, and an interview summary. We\nconclude that the shorter execution and analysis times are well noticeable in\npractice and show that extreme mutation testing supplements writing unit tests\nin conjunction with code coverage tools. We propose that pseudo-tested code\nshould be highlighted in code coverage reports and that extreme mutation\ntesting should be performed when writing unit tests rather than in a decoupled\nsession. Future research should investigate how to perform extreme mutation\ntesting while writing unit tests such that the results are available fast\nenough but still meaningful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

We present the first physics-based general\nanalytical landslide velocity model that incorporates internal deformation and\nexternal forces: net driving force and viscous resistant. The model stands as a\nnovel non-linear advective-dissipative system where classical Voellmy and\ninviscid Burgers' equation are specifications. Non-linear advection and\nexternal forcing fundamentally regulate the motion which substantially enhances\nour understanding of a coherently deforming landslide. Since analytical\nsolutions provide fastest, cost-effective and best rigorous answer to the\nproblem, we construct several new/general exact analytical solutions covering\nwider spectrum of landslide velocity. New solutions bridge existing gap between\nnegligibly and massively deforming landslides. This provides a novel, rapid and\nconsistent method for efficient coupling of different types of mass transports.\nMechanism of landslide advection, stretching and approaching to steady-state\nhas been explained. Shifting, up-lifting and stretching of velocity field stem\nfrom forcing and advection. Our solution describes fascinating breaking wave\nand emergence of landslide folding. This happens as the solution simultaneously\nintroduces domain propagation, velocity up-lift and non-linear advection.\nDomain translation and stretching depends on net driving force and viscous drag\ncontrols shock wave generation, wave breaking, folding and velocity. Landslide\ndynamics are architectured by advection and reigned by system forcing.\nAnalytically obtained velocities are close to observed values, constituting a\nnew foundation of landslide velocity. This provides the practitioners with key\ninformation in instantly/accurately estimating impact force that is important\nin delineating hazard zones and mitigation of landslide hazards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 09:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In 2006, a statistical analysis conducted for 19 selected OECD\ncountries for the period between 1950 and 2003 showed a very weak linear trend\nin the annual GDPpc increment for the largest economies: the USA, Japan,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain.

It has been recently proven that under\nsome conditions the Viterbi path of the PMM can almost surely be extended to\ninfinity, thereby defining the infinite Viterbi decoding of the observation\nsequence, called the Viterbi process. This was done by constructing a block of\nobservations, called a barrier, which ensures that the Viterbi path goes trough\na given state whenever this block occurs in the observation sequence. In this\npaper we prove that the joint process consisting of Viterbi process and PMM is\nregenerative.

Many professional mathematicians have applied an\nimpressive array of machinery to its analysis, and discovered some limits or\nboundaries to where violations of the Collatz conjecture must be, if they\nexist. Here we attempt to look at the conjecture differently than most\nmathematicians or number theorists, i.e. we will study the conjecture from the\npoints of view of a statistician/data scientist and of an engineer. As a\nstatistician or data scientist, we look at Collatz sequences as if they were\nsequences found in nature, like a collection of time series produced by some\nnatural process, ignoring for the time being their completely deterministic\norigins. As an engineer, we try to tinker with Collatz sequences to see what\nmakes them tick, and engineer -- tweak and build -- changes to the sequences\nthat likewise do interesting things, after first specifying exactly what we\nmean by interesting.

I formulate a mechanism for how the first droplet in a cloud\nchamber track arises, making no reference to quantum measurement axioms. I look\nspecifically at tracks of charged particles emitted in the simplest slow\ndecays, because I can reason about rather than guess the form that wave packets\ntake. The first visible droplet occurs when a randomly occurring,\nbarely-subcritical vapor droplet is pushed past criticality by ionization\ntriggered by the faint wavefunction of the emitted charged particle. This is\npossible because potential energy incurred when an ionized vapor molecule\npolarizes the other molecules in a droplet can balance the excitation energy\nneeded for the emitted charged particle to create the ion in the first place.\nThis degeneracy is a singular condition for Coulombic scattering, leading to\ninfinite or near-infinite ionization cross sections, and from there to an\nemergent Born rule in position space, but not an operator projection as in the\nprojection postulate. Analogous mechanisms may explain canonical quantum\nmeasurement behavior in detectors such as ionization chambers, proportional\ncounters, photomultiplier tubes or bubble chambers.
