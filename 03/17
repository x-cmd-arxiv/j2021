The objective is to design an optimal transmit covariance matrix at BS\nand diagonal phase-shifting matrix at RIS to maximize the achievable ergodic\nrate by exploiting the statistical channel state information at BS. Therefore,\na large-system approximation of the achievable ergodic rate is derived using\nthe replica method in large dimension random matrix theory.

Simulation results show that the large-system results\nare consistent with the achievable ergodic rate calculated by Monte Carlo\naveraging.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a human cognition-inspired framework, termed, Conceptual Text Region\nNetwork (CTRNet). The framework utilizes Conceptual Text Regions (CTRs), which\nis a class of cognition-based tools inheriting good mathematical properties,\nallowing for sophisticated label design.

Many of these workflows have high computational, storage,\nand/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of\nlarge-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) platforms. These executions must be managed using some software\ninfrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, workflow management systems\n(WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for creating and executing\nworkflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. While these efforts are all\nworthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, many of which are\nmoribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents significant\nbarriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet\nincompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large,\nstill elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or\nbuild upon, existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively\nimpacts workflow users, developers, and researchers. The \"Workflows Community\nSummit\" was held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit\nwas to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research\nchallenges in the workflow community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to\nstakeholders in the workflow community (including both developers of WMSs and\nusers of workflows) helped to identify key challenges in this community that\nwere translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them being the\nobject of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community.

Recent experiments of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without\nvimentin have shown that the IF vimentin plays a role in confined cell\nmotility.

It\nhas previously been shown that the errors that occur in the $s$-step version\nfollow the same structure as the errors in the classical algorithm, but with\nthe addition of an amplification factor that depends on the square of the\ncondition number of the $O(s)-$dimensional Krylov bases computed in each outer\nloop.

Subsequently, hydrodynamic escape driven by\ncore-powered mass-loss and/or photo-evaporation likely stripped much of these\nprimordial envelopes from the lower-mass and closer-in planets to form the\nsuper-Earth population. In this work we show that after undergoing core-powered\nmass-loss, some super-Earths can retain small residual H/He envelopes. This\nretention is possible because, for significantly depleted atmospheres, the\ndensity at the radiative-convective boundary drops sufficiently such that thhe\ncooling time-scale becomes less than the mass-loss time-scale. The residual\nenvelope is therefore able to contract, terminating further mass loss. Using\nanalytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that the mass of\nprimordial H/He envelope retained as a fraction of the planet's total mass,\n$f_{ret}$, increases with increasing planet mass, $M_{c}$, and decreases with\nincreasing equilibrium temperature, $T_{eq}$, scaling as $f_{ret} \\propto\nM_{c}^{3/2} T_{eq}^{-1/2} \\exp{[M_{c}^{3/4} T_{eq}^{-1}]}$. $f_{ret}$ varies\nfrom $< 10^{-8}$ to about $10^{-3}$ for typical super-Earth parameters. To\nfirst order, the exact amount of left-over H/He depends on the initial envelope\nmass, the planet mass, its equilibrium temperature, and the envelope's opacity.\nThese residual hydrogen envelopes reduce the atmosphere's mean molecular weight\ncompared to a purely secondary atmosphere, a signature observable by current\nand future facilities. These remnant atmospheres may, however, in many cases be\nvulnerable to long-term erosion by photo-evaporation. Any residual hydrogen\nenvelope likely plays an important role in the long-term physical evolution of\nsuper-Earths, including their geology and geochemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 17:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

To determine the eccentricity distribution of eclipsing binaries\nover a wide range of stellar temperatures ($3\\,000-50\\,000\\,$K) and orbital\nseparations $a/R_1$ ($2-300$), we combine our newly obtained TESS sample with\neclipsing binaries observed from the ground and by the Kepler mission.

Nowadays, robots are\nfound everywhere, ranging from homes, hospitals to industries, and military\noperations. Autonomous robots are developed to be robust enough to work beside\nhumans and to carry out jobs efficiently. Humans have a natural sense of\nunderstanding of the physical forces acting around them like gravity, sense of\nmotion, etc. which are not taught explicitly but are developed naturally.\nHowever, this is not the case with robots. To make the robot fully autonomous\nand competent to work with humans, the robot must be able to perceive the\nsituation and devise a plan for smooth operation, considering all the\nadversities that may occur while carrying out the tasks.

Close encounters between a star\nand a stellar mass BH make it possible for the star to be tidally disrupted by\nthe BH. Due to the relative low mass of the BH and the small cross section of\nthe tidal disruption event (TDE) for cases with high penetration, disruptions\ncaused by close encounters are usually partial disruptions. The existence of\nthe remnant stellar core and its non-negligible mass compared to the stellar\nmass BH alters the accretion process significantly. We study this problem with\nSPH simulations using the code {\\tt Phantom}, with the inclusion of radiation\npressure, which is important for small mass BHs. Additionally, we develop a\nnew, more general method of computing the fallback rate which does not rely on\nany approximation. Our study shows that the powerlaw slope of the fallback rate\nhas a strong dependence on the mass of the BH in the stellar mass BH regime.\nFurthermore, in this regime, self-gravity of the fallback stream and local\ninstabilities become more significant, and cause the disrupted material to\ncollapse into small clumps before returning to the BH. This results in an\nabrupt increase of the fallback rate, which can significantly deviate from a\npowerlaw. Our results will help in the identification of TDEs by stellar mass\nBHs in dense clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

In models with\nisolated binaries, important uncertainties remain regarding the stability of\nmass transfer (MT) and common-envelope (CE) evolution. To study some of these\nuncertainties, we have computed simulations using MESA of a $30M_\\odot$, low\nmetallicity ($Z_\\odot/10$) star with a BH companion. We developed a\nprescription to compute MT rates including possible outflows from outer\nLagrangian points, and a method to self-consistently determine the\ncore-envelope boundary in the case of CE evolution. We find that binaries\nsurvive a CE only if unstable MT happens after the formation of a deep\nconvective envelope, resulting in a narrow range (0.2 dex) in period for\nenvelope ejection. All cases where interaction is initiated with a radiative\nenvelope have large binding energies ($\\sim 10^{50}$ erg), and merge during CE\neven under the assumption that all the internal and recombination energy of the\nenvelope, as well as the energy from an inspiral, is used for ejection. This is\nindependent of core helium ignition for the donor, a condition under which\nvarious rapid-population synthesis calculations assume a successful ejection is\npossible. Moreover, we find that the critical mass ratio for instability is\nsuch that for periods between $\\sim 1-1000$ days merging binary BHs can be\nformed via stable MT. A large fraction of these systems overflow their L$_2$\nequipotential, in which case we find stable MT produces merging binary BHs even\nunder extreme assumptions of mass and angular momentum outflows. Our\nconclusions are limited to the study of one donor star, but suggest that\npopulation synthesis calculations overestimate the formation rate of merging\nbinary BHs produced by CE evolution, and that stable MT could dominate the rate\nfrom isolated binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

We find two anomalous features in the system's behavior. First, the\npulse profile observed by NICER during maximum luminosity is similar to that\nobserved by XMM-Newton in 2000, despite the fact that the X-ray luminosity was\ndifferent by two orders of magnitude. By contrast, a modest decrease in\nluminosity in the 2020 observations generated a significant change in pulse\nprofile. Second, we find that the historical optical outbursts are not strictly\nperiodic, as would be expected if the outbursts were triggered by periastron\npassage, as is generally assumed. The optical peaks are also not coincident\nwith the X-ray outbursts. We suggest that this behavior may result from a\nmisalignment of the Be star disk and the orbital plane, which might cause\nchanges in the timing of the passage of the neutron star through the disk as it\nprecesses. We conclude that the orbital period of the source remains unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Due to temporal and chromatic\nevolution of a telescope's PSF, the best correlated reference images are\nusually the most contaminated by the planet, leading to self-subtraction and\nreducing the planet throughput.

Specifically, we generate multiple characteristic curves at each\npolicy iteration from an ensemble of initial states, and compute both the value\nfunction and its gradient simultaneously on each curve as the labelled data.\nThen supervised machine learning is applied to minimize the weighted squared\nloss for both the value function and its gradients. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that this new method not only significantly increases the accuracy\nbut also improves the efficiency and robustness of the numerical estimates,\nparticularly with less amount of characteristics data or fewer training steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 06:19:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 11:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

These\nresults are often explained using the theory of propagating fluctuations in\nwhich fluctuations in the viscosity create perturbations in the accretion rate\nat all radii, propagate inwards and combine multiplicatively. While this idea\nhas been extensively studied analytically in a linear regime, there has been\nrelatively little numerical work investigating the non-linear behaviour. In\nthis paper, we present a suite of stochastically driven 1-d $\\alpha$-disc\nsimulations, exploring the behaviour of these discs. We find that the eponymous\npropagating fluctuations are present in all simulations across a wide range of\nmodel parameters, in contradiction to previous work. Of the model parameters,\nwe find by far the most important to be the timescale on which the viscosity\nfluctuations occur. Physically, this timescale will depend on the underlying\nphysical mechanism, thought to be the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We\nfind a close relationship between this fluctuation timescale and the break\nfrequency in the power spectral density (PSD) of the luminosity, a fact which\ncould allow observational probes of the behaviour of the MRI dynamo.

When the primary\nobjective is prediction, some typical approaches in the planning phase are to\nuse well-established small-sample experimental designs in the design phase\n(e.g., Definitive Screening Designs) and to construct predictive models using\nwidely used model selection algorithms such as LASSO. These design and analytic\nstrategies, however, do not guarantee high prediction performance, partly due\nto the small sample sizes that prevent partitioning the data into training and\nvalidation sets, a strategy that is commonly used in machine learning models to\nimprove out-of-sample prediction. In this work, we propose a novel framework\nfor building high-performance predictive models from experimental data that\ncapitalizes on the advantage of having both training and validation sets.\nHowever, instead of partitioning the data into two mutually exclusive subsets,\nwe propose a weighting scheme based on the fractional random weight bootstrap\nthat emulates data partitioning by assigning anti-correlated training and\nvalidation weights to each observation. The proposed methodology, called\nSelf-Validated Ensemble Modeling (SVEM), proceeds in the spirit of bagging so\nthat it iterates through bootstraps of anti-correlated weights and fitted\nmodels, with the final SVEM model being the average of the bootstrapped models.\nWe investigate the performance of the SVEM algorithm with several\nmodel-building approaches such as stepwise regression, Lasso, and the Dantzig\nselector.

Jansky Very Large\nArray (VLA), Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-Millimeter Array (ALMA), Very Large\nTelescope (VLT), New Technology Telescope (NTT), Neutron Star Interior\nComposition Explorer (NICER), and XMM-Newton. Our data set simultaneously\nsamples ten different electromagnetic bands (radio - X-ray) over a 7-hour\nperiod during the hard state of the 2018-2019 outburst. The emission we observe\nis highly variable, displaying multiple rapid flaring episodes. To characterize\nthe variability properties in our data, we implemented a combination of\ncross-correlation and Fourier analyses. We find that the emission is highly\ncorrelated between different bands, measuring time-lags ranging from hundreds\nof milliseconds between the X-ray/optical bands to minutes between the\nradio/sub-mm bands. Our Fourier analysis also revealed, for the first time in a\nblack hole X-ray binary, an evolving power spectral shape with electromagnetic\nfrequency. Through modelling these variability properties, we find that MAXI\nJ1820+070 launches a highly relativistic ($\\Gamma=6.81^{+1.06}_{-1.15}$) and\nconfined ($\\phi=0.45^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ deg) jet, which is carrying a significant\namount of power away from the system (equivalent to $\\sim0.6 \\, L_{1-100{\\rm\nkeV}}$). We additionally place constraints on the jet composition and magnetic\nfield strength in the innermost jet base region. Overall, this work\ndemonstrates that time-domain analysis is a powerful diagnostic tool for\nprobing jet physics, where we can accurately measure jet properties with\ntime-domain measurements alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:48:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 22:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

R is a multi-paradigm programming language, whose popularity in data\nscience and statistical applications has amplified in recent years. Due to R's\ninherent ability to expand through user-contributed packages, several\ncommunity-led organizations were created to organize and peer-review packages\nin a concerted effort to increase their quality. Nonetheless, it is well-known\nthat most R users do not have a technical programming background, being from\nmultiple disciplines. Objective: The goal of this study is to investigate TD in\nthe peer-review documentation of R packages led by rOpenSci. Method: We\ncollected over 5000 comments from 157 packages that had been reviewed and\napproved to be published at rOpenSci. We manually analyzed a sample dataset of\nthese comments posted by package authors, editors of rOpenSci, and reviewers\nduring the review process to investigate the TD types present in these reviews.\nResults: The findings of our study include (i) a taxonomy of TD derived from\nour analysis of the peer-reviews (ii) documentation debt as being the most\nprevalent type of debt (iii) different user roles are concerned with different\ntypes of TD. For instance, reviewers tend to report some TD types more than\nother roles, and the TD types they report are different from those reported by\nthe authors of a package. Conclusion: TD analysis in scientific software or\npeer-review is almost non-existent. Our study is a pioneer but within the\ncontext of R packages. However, our findings can serve as a starting point for\nreplication studies, given our public datasets, to perform similar analyses in\nother scientific software or to investigate the rationale behind our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 21:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Various factors like the\nRadio Resource Control (RRC) states, the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) specific\nretransmission configurations, handovers triggered by the user mobility, the\nnetwork load, etc. can cause high variability in these QoS metrics on 4G/LTE,\nand WiFi networks, which can be detrimental to the application QoE. Therefore,\nexposing the mobile application to realistic network QoS metrics is critical\nfor a tester attempting to predict its QoE. A viable approach is testing using\nsynthetic traces. The main challenge in the generation of realistic synthetic\ntraces is the diversity of environments and the lack of wide scope of real\ntraces to calibrate the generators. In this paper, we describe a\nmeasurement-driven methodology based on transfer learning with Long Short Term\nMemory (LSTM) neural nets to solve this problem. The methodology requires a\nrelatively short sample of the targeted environment to adapt the presented\nbasic model to new environments, thus simplifying synthetic traces generation.\nWe present this feature for realistic WiFi and LTE cloud access time models\nadapted for diverse target environments with a trace size of just 6000 samples\nmeasured over a few tens of minutes.

AWs energize the solar wind via\ntwo mechanisms: heating and work. We use high-resolution direct numerical\nsimulations of reflection-driven AW turbulence (RDAWT) in a fast-solar-wind\nstream emanating from a coronal hole to investigate both mechanisms. In\nparticular, we compute the fraction of the AW power at the coronal base\n($P_{\\rm AWb}$) that is transferred to solar-wind particles via heating between\nthe coronal base and heliocentric distance $r$, which we denote $\\chi_{\\rm\nH}(r)$, and the fraction that is transferred via work, which we denote\n$\\chi_{\\rm W}(r)$. We find that $\\chi_{\\rm W}(r_{\\rm A})$ ranges from 0.15 to\n0.3, where $r_{\\rm A}$ is the Alfv\\'en critical point. This value is small\ncompared to~one because the Alfv\\'en speed $v_{\\rm A} $ exceeds the outflow\nvelocity $U$ at $r<r_{\\rm A}$, so the AWs race through the plasma without doing\nmuch work. At $r>r_{\\rm A}$, where $v_{\\rm A} < U$, the AWs are in an\napproximate sense \"stuck to the plasma\", which helps them do pressure work as\nthe plasma expands. However, much of the AW power has dissipated by the time\nthe AWs reach $r=r_{\\rm A}$, so the total rate at which AWs do work on the\nplasma at $r>r_{\\rm A}$ is a modest fraction of $P_{\\rm AWb}$.

The reason that $\\chi_{\\rm H} \\geq 0.5$ in our\nsimulations is that an appreciable fraction of the local AW power dissipates\nwithin each Alfv\\'en-speed scale height in RDAWT, and there are a few\nAlfv\\'en-speed scale heights between the coronal base and $r_{\\rm A}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 23:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

In this paper, we propose (and prove) a stronger\nMulti-Prize Lottery Ticket Hypothesis:\n  A sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains\nseveral subnetworks (winning tickets) that (a) have comparable accuracy to a\ndense target network with learned weights (prize 1), (b) do not require any\nfurther training to achieve prize 1 (prize 2), and (c) is robust to extreme\nforms of quantization (i.e., binary weights and/or activation) (prize 3).\n  This provides a new paradigm for learning compact yet highly accurate binary\nneural networks simply by pruning and quantizing randomly weighted full\nprecision neural networks. We also propose an algorithm for finding multi-prize\ntickets (MPTs) and test it by performing a series of experiments on CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet datasets.

These methods are\nless useful for starshade images where such speckles are not present. This\npaper is dedicated to investigating signal processing methods tailored to work\nefficiently on starshade images. We describe a signal detection method, the\ngeneralized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), for starshade missions and look into\nthree important problems. First, even with the light suppression provided by\nthe starshade, rocky exoplanets are still difficult to detect in reflected\nlight due to their absolute faintness. GLRT can successfully flag these dim\nplanets. Moreover, GLRT provides estimates of the planets' positions and\nintensities and the theoretical false alarm rate of the detection. Second,\nsmall starshade shape errors, such as a truncated petal tip, can cause\nartifacts that are hard to distinguish from real planet signals; the detection\nmethod can help distinguish planet signals from such artifacts. The third\ndirect imaging problem is that exozodiacal dust degrades detection performance.\nWe develop an iterative generalized likelihood ratio test to mitigate the\neffect of dust on the image. In addition, we provide guidance on how to choose\nthe number of photon counting images to combine into one co-added image before\ndoing detection, which will help utilize the observation time efficiently. All\nthe methods are demonstrated on realistic simulated images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 01:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

To investigate\ndifferences induced on statistics of the 21 cm signal by various source types,\nwe use five radiative transfer simulations which have the same stellar UV\nemission model and varying combinations of more energetic sources, such as\nX-ray binaries (XRBs), accreting nuclear black holes (BHs) and hot interstellar\nmedium emission (ISM). We find that the efficient heating from the ISM\nincreases the average global 21~cm signal, while reducing its fluctuations and\nthus power spectrum. A clear impact is also observed in the bispectrum in terms\nof scale and timing of the transition between a positive and a negative value.\nThe impact of XRBs is similar to that of the ISM, although it is delayed in\ntime and reduced in intensity because of the less efficient heating.

While AHE is usually proportional\nto the magnetization, the nonlinearity suggests the existence of complex\nmagnetic and electron orders. Nonlinear AHE includes the topological Hall\neffect (THE) that has been widely used to identify the presence of spin\nchirality in real space. But it can in principle be induced by band structure\nevolution via Berry curvatures in the reciprocal space. This effect has been\nlargely overlooked due to the intertwined mechanisms in both real and\nreciprocal spaces. Here, we observed a giant nonlinear AHE with the resistivity\nup to 383.5 uohm cm, contributing unprecedentedly 97% of the total Hall\nresponse in EuCd2As2. Moreover, it can be further enhanced by tilting the\nmagnetic field 30{\\deg} away from [001] direction, reaching a large anomalous\nHall angle up to 21%. Although it shows exactly the same double-peak feature as\nTHE, our scaling analysis and first-principles calculations reveal that the\nBerry phase is extremely sensitive to the spin canting, and nonlinear AHE is a\nconsequence of band structure evolution under the external magnetic fields.\nWhen the spins gradually tilt from the in-plane antiferromagnetic ground state\nto out-of-plane direction, band crossing and band inversion occur, introducing\na bandgap at {\\Gamma} point at a canting angle of 45{\\deg}.

Inspired by this, this work is concerned with the\nmodel-free design of stochastic LQR controller for linear systems subject to\nGaussian noises, from the perspective of both RL and primal-dual optimization.\nFrom the RL perspective, we first develop a new model-free off-policy policy\niteration (MF-OPPI) algorithm, in which the sampled data is repeatedly used for\nupdating the policy to alleviate the data-hungry problem to some extent. We\nthen provide a rigorous analysis for algorithm convergence by showing that the\ninvolved iterations are equivalent to the iterations in the classical policy\niteration (PI) algorithm. From the perspective of optimization, we first\nreformulate the stochastic LQR problem at hand as a constrained non-convex\noptimization problem, which is shown to have strong duality. Then, to solve\nthis non-convex optimization problem, we propose a model-based primal-dual\n(MB-PD) algorithm based on the properties of the resulting Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\n(KKT) conditions. We also give a model-free implementation for the MB-PD\nalgorithm by solving a transformed dual feasibility condition. More\nimportantly, we show that the dual and primal update steps in the MB-PD\nalgorithm can be interpreted as the policy evaluation and policy improvement\nsteps in the PI algorithm, respectively. Finally, we provide one simulation\nexample to show the performance of the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 02:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

The deterministic (partial) synchronous\nprotocols can be simple and fast in good network conditions, but are subject to\ndenial-of-service when synchrony assumption fails. Asynchronous protocols, on\nthe contrary, are robust against the adversarial network, but are substantially\nmore complicated and slower for the inherent use of randomness.\n  Facing the issues, optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast ( Kursawe-Shoup,\n2002; Ramasamy-Cachin, 2005) was proposed to improve the normal-case\nperformance of the slow asynchronous consensus. They run a deterministic\nfastlane if the network condition remains good, and can fall back to a fully\nasynchronous protocol via a pace-synchronization mechanism if the fastlane\nfails. Unfortunately, existing pace-synchronization directly uses a heavy tool\nof asynchronous multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA).\n  We present Bolt-Dumbo Transformer (BDT), a generic framework for practical\noptimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast. At the core of BDT, we set forth a\nnew fastlane abstraction that is simple and fast, while preparing honest\nparties to gracefully face potential fastlane failures caused by malicious\nleader or bad network. This enables a highly efficient pace-synchronization to\nhandle fallback. The resulting design reduces a cumbersome MVBA to a variant of\nthe conceptually simplest binary agreement only. Besides detailed security\nanalyses, we also give concrete instantiations of our framework and implement\nthem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BDT can enjoy both the low latency\nof deterministic protocols (e.g. 2-chain version of HotStuff) and the\nrobustness of state-of-the-art asynchronous protocols in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 03:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 08:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 22:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Moreover, cells and tissues can change their sizes in response\nto mechanical cues. The present work demonstrates the role of tissue\ncompressibility and internal rearranging activities on its size and mechanics\nregulation in the context of differential growth induced by a field of\ngrowth-promoting chemical factors. We develop a mathematical model based on\nfinite elasticity and growth theory and the reference map techniques to\ndescribe the coupled tissue growth and mechanics in the Eulerian frame. We\nincorporate the tissue rearrangement by introducing a rearranging rate to the\nreference map evolution, leading to elastic-energy dissipation when tissue\ngrowth and deformation are in radial symmetry. By linearizing the model, we\nshow that the stress follows the Maxwell-type viscoelastic relaxation. The\nrearrangement rate, which we call tissue fluidity, sets the stress relaxation\ntime, and the ratio between the shear modulus and the fluidity sets the tissue\nviscosity. By nonlinear simulation of growing tissue spheroids and discs with\ngraded growth rates along the radius, we find that the tissue compressibility\nand fluidity influence their equilibrium size. By comparing the nonlinear\nsimulations with the linear analytical solutions, we show the size change as a\nnonlinear effect due to the advection of the tissue density flow, which only\noccurs when both tissue compressibility and fluidity are small.

There is, however, a recurring assumption in all the cited\ndeanonymization techniques: that each transaction output has an address\nattached to it. That assumption is false. An evidence is that, as of block\nheight 591,872, there are several millions transactions with at least one\noutput for which the Bitcoin Core client cannot infer an address.

Our\nnumerical simulations demonstrate that the enhanced optomechanical coupling can\nenter the single-photon strong-coupling and even ultrastrong-coupling regimes.\nWe also show the creation of macroscopic quantum superposed states and the\nimplementation of a weak-to-strong transition for quantum measurement in this\nsystem. This work will pave the way to quantum simulation of single-photon\noptomechanical effects with current experimental platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 06:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 03:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

In most solids\nelectron transport is dominated by extrinsic factors, such as sample geometry\nand scattering from impurities. However in the hydrodynamic regime Coulomb\ninteractions transform the electron motion from independent particles to the\ncollective motion of a viscous `electron fluid'. The fluid viscosity is an\nintrinsic property of the electron system, determined solely by the\nelectron-electron interactions. Resolving the universal intrinsic viscosity is\nchallenging, as it only affects the resistance through interactions with the\nsample boundaries, whose roughness is not only unknown but also varies from\ndevice to device. Here we eliminate all unknown parameters by fabricating\nsamples with smooth sidewalls to achieve the perfect slip boundary condition,\nwhich has been elusive both in molecular fluids and electronic systems. We\nengineer the device geometry to create viscous dissipation and reveal the true\nintrinsic hydrodynamic properties of a 2D system. We observe a clear transition\nfrom ballistic to hydrodynamic electron motion, driven by both temperature and\nmagnetic field. We directly measure the viscosity and electron-electron\nscattering lifetime (the Fermi quasiparticle lifetime) over a wide temperature\nrange without fitting parameters, and show they have a strong dependence on\nelectron density that cannot be explained by conventional theories based on the\nRandom Phase Approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 06:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

The sub-tasks of code completion are optimized via\nmulti-task learning in CCAG, and the task balance is automatically achieved\nusing uncertainty without the need to tune task weights. The experimental\nresults show that CCAG has superior performance than state-of-the-art\napproaches and it is able to provide intelligent code completion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 08:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Aims: We\ninvestigate the effects of radiogenic mantle heating, core size, and planetary\nmass on the evolution of the atmospheric partial $CO_2$ pressure, and the\nability of a long-term carbon cycle driven by plate tectonics to control the\natmospheric $CO_2$ pressure. Methods: We developed a box-model which connects\ncarbon cycling to parametrized mantle convection. The carbon cycle was coupled\nto the thermal evolution via the plate speed, which depends on the global\nRayleigh number. Results: We find decreasing atmospheric $CO_2$ pressure with\ntime, up to an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. Higher abundances of radioactive\nisotopes result in higher $CO_2$ pressures. We find a decreasing Rayleigh\nnumber and plate speed toward planets with larger core mass fractions $f_c$,\nwhich leads to lower atmospheric $CO_2$ pressure. More massive planets may\nfavor the development of more $CO_2$ rich atmospheres due to hotter interiors.\nConclusions: The dependence of plate tectonics on mantle cooling has a\nsignificant effect on the long-term evolution of the atmospheric $CO_2$\npressure. Carbon cycling mediated by plate tectonics is efficient in regulating\nplanetary climates for a wide range of mantle radioactive isotope abundances,\nplanet masses and core sizes.

From a series of LiDAR\nscans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment\nand estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally\nintensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM\nsystem on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such\nhurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and\nresource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting\nresource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed\naccelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic\npart, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator\ncan be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating\nSystem)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without\nmodifying and re-synthesizing the logic part.

The key to\nsuccess is to maintain a high-quality THINC reconstruction function using the\nlevel set field to accurately retrieve geometrical information and the VOF\nfield to fulfill numerical conservativeness. The interface is well defined as a\nsurface in form of a high-order polynomial, so-called the polynomial surface of\ninterface\n  (PSI). The THINC reconstruction function is then used to update the VOF field\nvia a finite volume method, and the level set field via a semi-Lagrangian\nmethod. Seeing the VOF field and the level set field as two different aspects\nof the THINC reconstruction function, the THINC-scaling scheme preserves at the\nsame time the advantages of both VOF and level set methods, i.e. the\nmass/volume conservation of the VOF method and the geometrical faithfulness of\nthe level set method, through a straightforward solution procedure. The\nTHINC-scaling scheme allows to represent an interface with high-order\npolynomials and has algorithmic simplicity which largely eases its\nimplementation in unstructured grids. Two and three dimensional algorithms in\nboth structured and unstructured grids have been developed and verified. The\nnumerical results reveal that the THINC-scaling scheme, as an interface\ncapturing method, is able to provide high-fidelity solution comparable to other\nmost advanced methods, and more profoundly it can resolve sub-grid filament\nstructures if the interface is represented by a polynomial higher than second\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 10:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Two different ultrasound\nfrequencies, 0.5 or 1.6 MHz, with pressures in the range 0.5-4 MPa were used to\ndrive cavitation activity which was detected in real time.

In this study, we used a variational autoencoder to\nestimate rates of aging from cross-sectional data from routine laboratory tests\nof 1.4 million individuals collected from 2016 to 2019. By incorporating\nmetrics that would ensure model's stability and distinctness of the dimensions,\nwe uncovered four aging dimensions that represent the following bodily\nfunctions: 1) kidney, 2) thyroid, 3) white blood cells, and 4) liver and heart.\nWe then examined the relationship between rates of aging on morbidity and\nhealth care expenditure.

So, instead of simply averaging two\nadjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain\nsemantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use\noptical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing\nare indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex\nproblems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without\nusing problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep\nneural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based\nGenerative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow.

After acquiring an adequately large sample of simulation\ndata, it was concluded that approximately 99.2% of the available -- at least\none hour long -- gaps could be used effectively. With an average slewing and\nstabilization time of about 16.7 minutes between scheduled exoplanet transits\nand ancillary targets, this corresponds to an additional $2881 \\pm 56$ hours of\nactive data gathering. When this additional time is used to observe our\nselected 200 ancillary targets, a typical signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim$10$^4$\ncan be achieved along the whole spectral window covered by Ariel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 12:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 14:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In the majority of\nlegal cases, fraud investigators do not know beforehand, exactly what they are\nlooking for, nor where to find it. In addition, fraudsters may use deception to\nhide their behaviour and intentions by using code words. Effectively, this\nmeans fraud investigators are looking for a needle in the haystack without\nknowing what the needle looks like.\n  As part of a larger research program, we use a framework to expedite the\ninvestigation process applying text-mining and machine learning techniques. We\nstructure this framework using three well-known methods in fraud\ninvestigations: (i) the fraud triangle (ii) the golden (\"W\") investigation\nquestions, and (iii) the analysis of competing hypotheses. With this framework,\nit is possible to automatically organize investigative data, so it is easier\nfor investigators to find answers to typical investigative questions.\n  In this research, we focus on one of the components of this framework: the\nidentification of the usage of code words by fraudsters. Here for, a novel\n(annotated) synthetic data set is created containing such code words, hidden in\nnormal email communication. Subsequently, a range of machine learning\ntechniques are employed to detect such code words. We show that the\nstate-of-the-art BERT model significantly outperforms other methods on this\ntask. With this result, we demonstrate that deep neural language models can\nreliably (F1 score of 0.9) be applied in fraud investigations for the detection\nof code words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 12:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

On the basis of precise laboratory data, a rich collection of more\nthan 200 familiar and exotic molecules have been identified in the interstellar\nmedium, the vast majority by their unique rotational fingerprint. Despite this\nlarge body of work, there is scant evidence in the radio band for the basic\nbuilding blocks of chemistry on earth -- five and six-membered rings -- despite\nlong standing and sustained efforts during the past 50 years. In contrast, a\npeculiar structural motif, highly unsaturated carbon in a chain-like\narrangement, is instead quite common in space. The recent astronomical\ndetection of cyanobenzene, the simplest aromatic nitrile, in the dark molecular\ncloud TMC-1, and soon afterwards in additional pre-stellar, and possibly\nprotostellar sources, establishes that aromatic chemistry is likely widespread\nin the earliest stages of star formation. The subsequent discovery of\ncyanocyclopentadienes and even cyanonapthlenes in TMC-1 provides further\nevidence that organic molecules of considerable complexity are readily\nsynthesized in regions with high visual extinction but where the low\ntemperature and pressure are remarkably low.

To find out whether\nautomatic personality estimates retain the properties of the original traits,\nwe reviewed 220 recent articles. First, we put together the predictive quality\nestimates from a subset of the studies which declare separation of training,\nvalidation, and testing phases, which is critical for ensuring the correctness\nof quality estimates in machine learning. Only 20% of the reviewed papers met\nthis criterion. To compare the reported quality estimates, we converted them to\napproximate Pearson correlations. The credible upper limits for correlations\nbetween predicted and self-reported personality traits vary in a range between\n0.42 and 0.48, depending on the specific trait. The achieved values are\nsubstantially below the correlations between traits measured with distinct\nself-report questionnaires. This suggests that we cannot readily interpret\npersonality predictions as estimates of the original traits or expect predicted\npersonality traits to reproduce known relationships with life outcomes\nregularly. Next, we complement quality estimates evaluation with evidence on\npsychometric properties of predicted traits. The few existing results suggest\nthat predicted traits are less stable with time and have lower effective\ndimensionality than self-reported personality. The predictive text-based models\nperform substantially worse outside their training domains but stay above a\nrandom baseline. The evidence on the relationships between predicted traits and\nexternal variables is mixed. Predictive features are difficult to use for\nvalidation, due to the lack of prior hypotheses.

To solve these limitations, we propose a flexible\nframework which can estimate extrinsic parameters without an explicit\ncalibration stage, even for sensors with unknown scale. Our first contribution\nbuilds upon standard hand-eye calibration by jointly recovering scale. Our\nsecond contribution is that our system is made robust to imperfect and\ndegenerate sensor data, by collecting independent sets of poses and\nautomatically selecting those which are most ideal. We show that our approach's\nrobustness is essential for the target scenario. Unlike previous approaches,\nours runs in real time and constantly estimates the extrinsic transform. For\nboth an ideal experimental setup and a real use case, comparison against these\napproaches shows that we outperform the state-of-the-art.

The high number of super-Earth and Earth-like planets in the\nhabitable zone (HZ) detected around M-dwarf stars in the last years has\nrevealed these stellar objects to be the key for planetary radial velocity (RV)\nsearches. Aims. Using the HARPS-N spectrograph within The HArps-n red Dwarf\nExoplanet Survey (HADES) we reach the precision needed to detect small planets\nwith a few Earth masses using the RV technique. Methods. We obtained 138\nHARPS-N RV measurements between 2013 May and 2020 September of GJ 720 A,\nclassified as an M0.5V star located at a distance of 15.56 pc. To characterize\nthe stellar variability and to discern the periodic variation due to the\nKeplerian signals from those related to stellar activity, the HARPS-N\nspectroscopic activity indicators and the simultaneous photometric observations\nwere analyzed. The combined analysis of HARPS-N RVs and activity indicators let\nus to address the nature of the periodic signals. The final model and the\norbital planetary parameters were obtained by fitting simultaneously the\nstellar variability and the Keplerian signal using a Gaussian process\nregression and following a Bayesian criterion. Results. The HARPS-N RV periodic\nsignals around 40 d and 100 d have counterparts at the same frequencies in\nHARPS-N activity indicators and photometric light curves. Then we attribute\nthese periodicities to stellar activity the former period being likely\nassociated with the stellar rotation. GJ 720 A shows the most significant\nsignal at 19.466$\\pm$0.005 d with no counterparts in any stellar activity\nindices.

Three protocols are proposed with varying characteristics.\nIt is shown that all the three protocols are secure. The proposed protocols can\nbe extended to multiple dimensions and thus are able to handle Secure\nHypersphere Range Queries (SHRQ) as well. Internally the proposed protocols use\npairing-based cryptography and a concept of lookup table. To enable the\nefficient use of limited size lookup table, a new storage scheme is presented.\nThe proposed storage scheme enables the protocols to handle query with much\nlarger radius values. Using the SHRQ protocols, we also propose a mechanism to\nanswer the Secure range Queries. Extensive performance evaluation has been done\nto evaluate the efficiency of the proposed protocols\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Although the single-source and all-pairs\nvariants of this problem are well-studied in the plane case, no non-trivial\nexact distance oracles for unit-disk graphs have been known to date, even for\n$d=2$.\n  The classical result of Sedgewick and Vitter [Algorithmica '86] shows that\nfor weighted unit-disk graphs in the plane the $A^*$ search has average-case\nperformance superior to that of a standard shortest path algorithm, e.g.,\nDijkstra's algorithm. Specifically, if the $n$ corresponding points of a\nweighted unit-disk graph $G$ are picked from a unit square uniformly at random,\nand the connectivity radius is $r\\in (0,1)$, $A^*$ finds a shortest path in $G$\nin $O(n)$ expected time when $r=\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n/n})$, even though $G$ has\n$\\Theta((nr)^2)$ edges in expectation. In other words, the work done by the\nalgorithm is in expectation proportional to the number of vertices and not the\nnumber of edges.\n  In this paper, we break this natural barrier and show even stronger sublinear\ntime results. We propose a new heuristic approach to computing point-to-point\nexact shortest paths in unit-disk graphs. We analyze the average-case behavior\nof our heuristic using the same random graph model as used by Sedgewick and\nVitter and prove it superior to $A^*$. Specifically, we show that, if we are\nable to report the set of all $k$ points of $G$ from an arbitrary rectangular\nregion of the plane in $O(k + t(n))$ time, then a shortest path between\narbitrary two points of such a random graph on the plane can be found in\n$O(1/r^2 + t(n))$ expected time.

What are the effects of social\nexpectations and perceptions of community behavior and beliefs on own behavior.\nGiven that proper infant feeding practices are observable and have significant\nhealth impacts, we explore the relevance of these questions in the context of\nexclusive infant breastfeeding behavior using social norms theory. We make use\nof a primary survey of mothers of children below the age of two years in the\nKayes and Sikasso region of Mali, which have a historically lower prevalence of\nexclusive breastfeeding. The findings from regression estimations, controlling\nfor a host of potential confounding factors, indicate that expectations about\nthe behavior of other community members can strongly predict individual\nexclusive breastfeeding. Beliefs about approval of the infant feeding behavior\nof the community though are found to be only modestly associated with it. In\naddition, mothers who hold false but positive beliefs about the community are\nfound to exclusively breastfeed their kids. Further, using responses from\nrandomly assigned vignettes where we experimentally manipulated the levels of\nsocial expectations, our data reveal a strong relationship between perceived\nprevalence of community level exclusive breastfeeding and individual behavior.\nThis result indicates the existence of a potential causal relationship. We\nargue that our findings represent an important foundation for the design of\npolicy interventions aimed at altering social expectations, and thus effecting\na measurable change in individual behaviors.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel robust tube-based smooth-MPC strategy for\nnonlinear robot manipulator planning systems with disturbances and constraints.\nBased on piecewise linearization and state prediction, our control strategy\nimproves the smoothness and optimizes the delay of the control process. By\ndeducing the deviation of the real system states and the nominal system states,\nwe can predict the next real state set at the current instant. And by using\nthis state set as the initial condition, we can solve the next OCP ahead and\nstore the optimal controls based on the nominal system states, which eliminates\nthe delay. Furthermore, we linearize the nonlinear system with a given upper\nbound of error, reducing the complexity of the OCP and improving the response\nspeed. Based on the theoretical framework of tube MPC, we prove that the\ncontrol strategy is recursively feasible and closed-loop stable with the\nconstraints and disturbances.

Here, we examined such associations in three\nexperiments, in musicians and in non-musicians. We used an explicit task, in\nwhich participants matched probe tones following key-establishing sequences to\nfacial expressions ranging from sad to happy, and an implicit speeded task, a\nvariant of the Implicit Association Test. Stabler scale-degrees were associated\nwith more positive valence in all experiments, for both musicians and\nnonmusicians. This notwithstanding, results significantly differed from those\nof a comparable goodness-of-fit task, suggesting that perceived tonal valence\nis not reducible to tonal fit. Comparisons of the explicit and implicit\nmeasures suggest that associations of tonality and emotional valence may rely\non two distinct mechanisms, one mediated by conceptual musical knowledge and\nconscious decisional processes, the other - largely by non-conceptual and\ninvoluntary processes. The joint experimental paradigms introduced here may\nhelp mapping additional connotative meanings, both emotional and cross-modal,\nembedded in tonal structure, thus suggesting how extra-musical meanings are\nconveyed to listeners through musical syntax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 15:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

The class\nimbalance issue in intrusion detection forces the classifier to be biased\ntoward the majority/benign class, thus leave many attack incidents undetected.\nSpurred by the success of deep neural networks in computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing, in this paper, we design a new system named DeepIDEA that\ntakes full advantage of deep learning to enable intrusion detection and\nclassification.

By\nguiding the agent to meaningful states and actions, this weak supervision\nimproves the convergence during training and enhances the safety of the final\ntrained policy.

According to the literature, there are two\nmain strategies to migrate a legacy system: (a) to replace the legacy system by\na new one, (b) to incrementally migrate parts from the legacy system to the new\none. Incremental migration allows developers to better control the risks that\nmay occur during the migration process. However, this strategy is more complex\nbecause it requires decomposition of the legacy system into different parts,\ne.g. a set of files, and to define the order of migration of them along the\nmigration process. To our knowledge, there is no approach to support developers\non those activities. Objective: This paper presents an approach, named\nMigrationExp, to support incremental language migrations of applications from\none source language to another target language. MigrationExp recommends the\nfiles that should be migrated first in a particular migration iteration. As a\nnovelty, our approach relies on a ranking model learned, using a\nlearning-to-rank algorithm, from migrations made by developers. Method: We\nvalidate our approach in the context of the migrations of Android apps, from\nJava to Kotlin, a new official language for Android. We train our model using\nmigrations of Java code to Kotlin written by developers on open-source\napplications. Results: The results show that, on the task of proposing files to\nmigrate, our approach outperforms a previous migration strategy proposed by\nGoogle, in terms of its ability to accurately predict empirically observed\nmigration orders. Conclusion: Since most Android applications are written in\nJava, we conclude that approaches to support developers such as MigrationExp\nmay significantly impact the development of Android applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 15:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 11:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 09:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Each\nitem has integral width, integral height and an associated integral profit. The\ngoal is to find a (non-overlapping axis-aligned) packing of a maximum profit\nsubset of rectangles into the knapsack. A well-studied and frequently used\nconstraint in practice is to allow only packings that are guillotine separable,\ni.e., every rectangle in the packing can be obtained by recursively applying a\nsequence of edge-to-edge axis-parallel cuts that do not intersect any item of\nthe solution. In this paper we study approximation algorithms for the geometric\nknapsack problem under guillotine cut constraints.

In comparison, the best-known approximation factor\nfor this setting is 3 + {\\epsilon} [Jansen-Zhang, SODA 2004], even in the\ncardinality case where all items have the same profit. Our main technical\ncontribution is a structural lemma which shows that any guillotine packing can\nbe converted into another structured guillotine packing with almost the same\nprofit. In this packing, each item is completely contained in one of a constant\nnumber of boxes and L-shaped regions, inside which the items are placed by a\nsimple greedy routine. In particular, we provide a clean sufficient condition\nwhen such a packing obeys the guillotine cut constraints which might be useful\nfor other settings where these constraints are imposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 15:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

There can be many reasons for\nthis behavior like being tired or inexperienced. The simulation environment\ndoesn't take this information into account while training the navigation agent.\nTherefore, in this study we especially focus on systematically creating these\nrisk prone scenarios with heavy traffic and unexpected random behavior for\ncreating better model-free learning agents.

For this,\nwe propose several network partitioning algorithms based on deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). Furthermore, to mitigate interference between different\ncell-free subnetworks, we develop a novel hybrid analog beamsteering-digital\nbeamforming model that zero-forces interference among cell-free subnetworks and\nat the same time maximizes the instantaneous sum-rate of all UEs within each\nsubnetwork. Specifically, the hybrid beamforming model is implemented by using\na novel mixed DRL-convex optimization method in which analog beamsteering\nbetween APs and UEs is conducted based on DRL while digital beamforming is\nmodeled and solved as a convex optimization problem. The DRL models for network\nclustering and hybrid beamsteering are combined into a single hierarchical DRL\ndesign that enables exchange of DRL agents' experiences during both network\ntraining and operation. We also benchmark the performance of DRL models for\nclustering and beamsteering in terms of network performance, convergence rate,\nand computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 03:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Despite the availability of knowledge about the emerging\nentities on the search results, yet there are no approaches to capture,\nabstract, summerize, fuse, and validate fragmented pieces of knowledge about\nthem. Thus, in this paper, we develop approaches to capture two types of\nknowledge about the emerging entities from a corpus extended from top-n search\nsnippets of a given emerging entity. The first kind of knowledge identifies the\nrole(s) of the emerging entity as, e.g., who is s/he? The second kind captures\nthe entities closely associated with the emerging entity. As the testbed, we\nconsidered a collection of 20 emerging entities and 20 popular entities as the\nground truth. Our approach is an unsupervised approach based on text analysis\nand entity embeddings.

However,\nartificially designed network structures often rely heavily on the researchers'\nknowledge and experience. Accordingly, because of the automated design of its\nnetwork structure, Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved great success\nin the image processing field and attracted substantial research attention in\nrecent years. Although some NAS methods have reduced the number of GPU search\ndays required to single digits in the image field, directly using 3D\nconvolution to extend NAS to the video field is still likely to produce a surge\nin computing volume. To address this challenge, we propose a new processing\nframework called Neural Architecture Search- Temporal Convolutional (NAS-TC).\nOur proposed framework is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the\nclassical CNN network is used as the backbone network to complete the\ncomputationally intensive feature extraction task. In the second stage, a\nsimple stitching search to the cell is used to complete the relatively\nlightweight long-range temporal-dependent information extraction.

As computer vision technology continues to develop, people are no longer\nsatisfied with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images; instead,\npeople look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about\nvisual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and\nrecognize objects in the image, but also know the relationship between objects\n(visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image\ncaptioning) based on the image content. Alternatively, we might want the\nmachine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA)), or even remove the dog from the image and find similar images\n(image editing and retrieval), etc. These tasks require a higher level of\nunderstanding and reasoning for image vision tasks.

Therefore, scene graphs have\nattracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research\nis often cross-modal, complex, and rapidly developing.

To this end, this survey\nconducts a comprehensive investigation of the current scene graph research.\nMore specifically, we first summarized the general definition of the scene\ngraph, then conducted a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the\ngeneration method of the scene graph (SGG) and the SGG with the aid of prior\nknowledge.

We exploit TCGA\n(The Cancer Genomic Atlas) dataset and synthesize the missing MRI modalities\nusing a fully convolutional network (FCN) in a conditional Generative\nAdversarial Network (cGAN).

The\nproposed FCN architecture comprises octave convolution (OctConv) and a novel\ndecoder, with skip connections in spatial and channel squeeze & excitation\n(skip-scSE) block. The OctConv can process low and high-frequency features\nindividually and improve model efficiency by reducing channel-wise redundancy.\nSkip-scSE applies spatial and channel-wise excitation to signify the essential\nfeatures and reduces the sparsity in deeper layers learning parameters using\nskip connections. The proposed approaches are evaluated by comparative\nexperiments with state-of-the-art models in synthesis, segmentation, and\noverall survival (OS) prediction.
