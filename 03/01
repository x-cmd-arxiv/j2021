The complications\nproduced by population interference in this setting are now readily recognized,\nand partial remedies are well known. Much less understood is the impact of\npopulation interference in panel experiments where treatment is sequentially\nrandomized in the population, and the outcomes are observed at each time step.\nThis paper proposes a general framework for studying population interference in\npanel experiments and presents new finite population estimation and inference\nresults. Our findings suggest that, under mild assumptions, the addition of a\ntemporal dimension to an experiment alleviates some of the challenges of\npopulation interference for certain estimands. In contrast, we show that the\npresence of carryover effects -- that is, when past treatments may affect\nfuture outcomes -- exacerbates the problem.

However, the atmospheric emission effect was not taken into account\nin this model, and the solutions are applicable only for diffusely scattering\natmosphere in absence of emission.\n  Aim: We extend the model of semi-infinite diffuse reflection problem by\nincluding the effects of thermal emission B(T ), and present how this affects\nChandrasekhar's analytical end results. Hence, we aim to generalize\nChandrasekhar's model to provide a complete picture of this problem.\n  Method: We use Invariance Principle Method to find the radiative transfer\nequation accurate for diffuse reflection in presence of B(T ). Then we derive\nthe modified scattering function S(${\\mu},{\\phi}; {\\mu}_0 , {\\phi}_0$ ) for\ndifferent kind of phase functions.\n  Results: We find that, the scattering function S(${\\mu}, {\\phi}; {\\mu}_0 ,\n{\\phi}_0$ ) as well as diffusely reflected specific intensity $I(0, {\\mu};\n{\\mu}_0 )$ for different phase functions are modified due to the emission\n$B(T)$ from layer ${\\tau} = 0$. In both cases, B(T) is added to the results of\nonly scattering case derived by Chandrasekhar, with some multiplicative\nfactors. Thus the diffusely reflected spectra will be enriched and carries the\ntemperature information of ${\\tau} = 0$ layer. As the effects are additive in\nnature, hence our model reduces to the sub-case of Chandrasekhar's scattering\nmodel in case of $B(T) = 0$.

During strong\ncavitation, detached vapor structures can reach the nozzle outlet, leading to\npartial entrainment of gas from the outflow region into the nozzle. The gas\nentrainment can affect cavitation dynamics, mass-flow rates, and jet breakup.\nMoreover, the implosion of detached vapor structures induces pressure peaks\nthat on the one hand amplify turbulent fluctuations and subsequently can\nenhance jet breakup and on the other hand can damage walls in the proximity and\nthus lead to cavitation erosion.\n  Our numerical setup is based on a reference experiment, in which liquid water\nis discharged into ambient air through a step nozzle.

Although robotic systems\ncan potentially directly provide joint values, this information is not commonly\nexploited inside the operating room, due to its possible unreliability, limited\naccess and the time-consuming calibration required, especially for continuum\nrobots. For this reason, standard approaches for 3-D pose estimation involve\nthe use of external tracking systems. Recently, image-based methods have\nemerged as promising, non-invasive alternatives. While many image-based\napproaches in the literature have shown accurate results, they generally\nrequire either a complex iterative optimization for each processed image,\nmaking them unsuitable for real-time applications, or a large number of\nmanually-annotated images for efficient learning. In this paper we propose a\nself-supervised image-based method, exploiting, at training time only, the\nimprecise kinematic information provided by the robot. In order to avoid\nintroducing time-consuming manual annotations, the problem is formulated as an\nauto-encoder, smartly bottlenecked by the presence of a physical model of the\nrobotic instruments and surgical camera, forcing a separation between image\nbackground and kinematic content.

Generating call graphs in an efficient\nmanner can be a challenging task when it comes to high-level languages that are\nmodular and incorporate dynamic features and higher-order functions.\n  Despite the language's popularity, there have been very few tools aiming to\ngenerate call graphs for Python programs. Worse, these tools suffer from\nseveral effectiveness issues that limit their practicality in realistic\nprograms. We propose a pragmatic, static approach for call graph generation in\nPython. We compute all assignment relations between program identifiers of\nfunctions, variables, classes, and modules through an inter-procedural\nanalysis. Based on these assignment relations, we produce the resulting call\ngraph by resolving all calls to potentially invoked functions. Notably, the\nunderlying analysis is designed to be efficient and scalable, handling several\nPython features, such as modules, generators, function closures, and multiple\ninheritance.\n  We have evaluated our prototype implementation, which we call PyCG, using two\nbenchmarks: a micro-benchmark suite containing small Python programs and a set\nof macro-benchmarks with several popular real-world Python packages. Our\nresults indicate that PyCG can efficiently handle thousands of lines of code in\nless than a second (0.38 seconds for 1k LoC on average). Further, it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art for Python in both precision and recall: PyCG\nachieves high rates of precision ~99.2%, and adequate recall ~69.9%.

Distancing reduces the\nindividual's probability of getting infected but comes at a cost. It creates a\nsingle-peaked epidemic, flattens the curve and decreases the size of the\nepidemic. We examine more closely the effects of distancing on the outset, the\npeak and the final size of the epidemic. First, we define a behavioral basic\nreproduction number and show that it is concave in the transmission rate. The\ninfection, therefore, spreads only if the transmission rate is in the\nintermediate region. Second, the peak of the epidemic is non-monotonic in the\ntransmission rate. A reduction in the transmission rate can lead to an increase\nof the peak. On the other hand, a decrease in the cost of distancing always\nflattens the curve. Third, both an increase in the infection rate as well as an\nincrease in the cost of distancing increase the size of the epidemic. Our\nresults have important implications on the modeling of interventions. Imposing\nrestrictions on the infection rate has qualitatively different effects on the\ntrajectory of the epidemics than imposing assumptions on the cost of\ndistancing. The interventions that affect interactions rather than the\ntransmission rate should, therefore, be modeled as changes in the cost of\ndistancing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 19:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The simplest experimental system consists of\nelectronic circuit based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and metal-oxide\nmemristive device. The hardware-software complex based on commercial data\nacquisition system is implemented for the imitation of signal from presynaptic\nneuron`s membrane and synaptic signal transmission between neurons. The main\nadvantage of our system is that it uses real time dynamics of memristive\ndevice. Electrical response of memristive device shows its behavioral\nflexibility that allows presenting a memristive device as an active synapse.\nThis means an internal adjustment of the parameters of memristive device that\nleads to modulation of neuron-like signals. Physics-based dynamical model of\nmemristor is developed in MATLAB for numerical simulation of such a memristive\ninterface to describe and predict experimentally observed regularities of\nsynchronization of neuron-like oscillators. FitzHugh-Nagumo circuits time\nseries with a linear or stepwise increase in the signal amplitude are used to\nstudy the memristor response and coupling of neuron-like oscillators taking\ninto account the stochasticity of memristor model to compare the numerical and\nexperimental data. The observed forced synchronization modes characterize the\ndynamic complexity of the memristive device, which requires further description\nusing high-order dynamical models. The developed memristive interface will\nprovide high efficiency in the imitation of the synaptic connection due to its\nstochastic nature and can be used to increase the flexibility of neuronal\nconnections for neuroprosthetic challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 19:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

However, due to the limited sensing area and the\nresistance of the fixed surface, current tactile sensors have to tap the\ntactile sensor on target object many times when assessing a large surface,\ni.e., pressing, lifting up and shifting to another region. This process is\nineffective and time consuming. It is also undesirable to drag such sensors as\nthis often damages the sensitive membrane of the sensor or the object. To\naddress these problems, we propose a cylindrical optical tactile sensor named\nTouchRoller that can roll around its center axis.

Extensive experiments show\nthat the TouchRoller sensor can cover a textured surface of 8cm*11cm in a short\ntime of 10s, much more effectively than a flat optical tactile sensor (in\n196s).

It is generally accepted that\nchildren organs are more sensitive to radiation than adults, due to their\ngrowth rate. Therefore, evaluating the absorbed dose in children to avoid\nirrecoverable damage is highly crucial. In this work, absorbed dose by\ndifferent organs of children within the SPECT imaging for the above-mentioned\nradiopharmaceuticals were estimated through the use of Monte Carlo simulation\nfor patients at the ages of 4, 8, 11, and 14-years old. The patients absorbed\ndose was estimated based on the specific radiopharmaceutical uptake patterns\nand the age-related human body models. To this end, we used the University of\nFlorida (UF) voxel-wise baby phantoms and the Monte Carlo simulation for the\npediatric patients at 4, 8, 11, and 14 years of age. The accuracy of the\ndosimetric outcomes was evaluated versus the ICRP 128 data. The highest and\nlowest doses absorbed by the kidneys were 0.48 mGy-MBq and 0.0042 mGy-MBq\nobtained for 4-year-old and 14-year-old children using 99mTc-DMSA and\n99mTc-MAG3 radiopharmaceuticals, respectively. Moreover, in these cases, the\nrelative errors of simulation results compared to the reference ICRP data were\n12.1% and 0.95%, respectively. The simulation results were in good agreement\nwith the ICRP 128 data. The results showed that the highest absorbed dose was\nby kidneys and when 99mTc-DMSA was used. The highest and lowest absorbed dose\nin the organs occurs when 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3 (in normal renal function)\nare used, respectively. On the other hand, the results indicated that the dose\nreceived by the organs decreases with age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 21:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

In many situations, a\nrobot will have only a partial camera view of the near side of an observed\nobject, for which the far side remains occluded. We show how an initial grasp\nattempt, based on an initial guess of the overall object shape, yields tactile\nglances of the far side of the object which enable the shape estimate and\nconsequently the successive grasps to be improved. We propose a grasp\nexploration approach using a probabilistic representation of shape, based on\nGaussian Process Implicit Surfaces. This representation enables initial partial\nvision data to be augmented with additional data from successive tactile\nglances.

In particular, many recent works\ndemonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep\nmodels and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on\npenalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or\nflattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the\nbenign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often\nexpensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple\nand efficient \"Convolutional Normalization\" (ConvNorm) method that can fully\nexploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple\nplug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our\nmethod is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional\nsparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry.\nFurthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm\nof the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network,\nleading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied\nto classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network\n(GAN), we show that the ConvNorm improves the robustness of common ConvNets\nsuch as ResNet and the performance of GAN.

Level of caution\nincreases with the number of infectious cases, while an increasing sense of\nsafety with increased vaccination lowers precautionary behaviors. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first model that can effectively reproduce the\ncomplete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United\nStates and provides relatable measures of dynamic changes in the population\nbehavior and disease transmission rates.

Trip\nsubstitutions from all the Parisian modes concerned are considered - personal\nor shared bicycles and motor scooters, private car, taxi and ride-hailing, bus,\nstreetcar, metro and RER (the Paris metropolitan area mass rapid transit\nsystem). All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA.\nFinal results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen\nthousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to\nmajor shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60% from the metro and the RER,\n22% from active modes).

A sensitivity analysis switching the French\nelectricity mix for eleven other country mixes suggests a better climate change\neffect of the FFES in similar metropolitan areas with higher electricity carbon\nintensity, such as in Germany and China.

To compensate for\nthe double-fading attenuation in the RIS-aided link, a large number of passive\nreflecting elements (REs) are conventionally deployed at the RIS, resulting in\nlarge surface size and considerable circuit power consumption. In this paper,\nwe propose a new type of RIS, called active RIS, where each RE is assisted by\nactive loads (negative resistance), that reflect and amplify the incident\nsignal instead of only reflecting it with the adjustable phase shift as in the\ncase of a passive RIS. Therefore, for a given power budget at the RIS, a\nstrengthened RIS-aided link can be achieved by increasing the number of active\nREs as well as amplifying the incident signal. We consider the use of an active\nRIS to a single input multiple output (SIMO) system. {However, it would\nunintentionally amplify the RIS-correlated noise, and thus the proposed system\nhas to balance the conflict between the received signal power maximization and\nthe RIS-correlated noise minimization at the receiver.

Specifically, the receive beamforming is obtained with a\nclosed-form solution based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)\ncriterion, while the reflecting coefficient matrix is obtained by solving a\nseries of sequential convex approximation (SCA) problems.

Hence to assist in\nclinical decisions in palliative settings, the relation needs to be established\nwithout tumor resection.

Thus, it is critical to\ndetect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using\nnatural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting\nmisinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language\nprocessing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)\nto combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and\neffectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with\nfact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the\nsample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good\nperformance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting\nmisinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset\nfor AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good\nperformance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on\nboth datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in\norder to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve\nmodel explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects\nexperiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE),\nand text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were\nsignificantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in\nthe TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition.

While existing energy harvesting systems\neither wake up periodically at a fixed rate to sense and process the data, or\nwake up only in accordance with the availability of the energy source, SmartON\nemploys a three-phase learning framework to learn the energy harvesting pattern\nas well as the pattern of events at run-time, and uses that knowledge to wake\nitself up when events are most likely to occur.

We hypothesize\nthat the adversarial vulnerability of DL models stems from two factors. The\nfirst factor is data sparsity which is that in the high dimensional input data\nspace, there exist large regions outside the support of the data distribution.\nThe second factor is the existence of many redundant parameters in the DL\nmodels. Owing to these factors, different models are able to come up with\ndifferent decision boundaries with comparably high prediction accuracy. The\nappearance of the decision boundaries in the space outside the support of the\ndata distribution does not affect the prediction accuracy of the model.\nHowever, it makes an important difference in the adversarial robustness of the\nmodel. We hypothesize that the ideal decision boundary is as far as possible\nfrom the support of the data distribution. In this paper, we develop a training\nframework to observe if DL models are able to learn such a decision boundary\nspanning the space around the class distributions further from the data points\nthemselves.

Osborne published in 1956 [6] an\nessential paper and proposed to treat the question of stock market motion\nthrough the prism of both the Law of Weber-Fechner [1, 4] and the branch of\nphysics developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Willard\nGibbs [3, 5] namely the statistical mechanics. He proposed an improvement of\nthe known research made by his predecessor Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse\nBachelier, by not considering the arithmetic changes of stock prices as means\nof statistical measurement, but by drawing on the Weber-Fechner Law, to treat\nthe changes of prices. Osborne emphasized that as in statistical mechanics, the\nprobability distribution of the steady-state of subjective change in prices is\ndetermined by the condition of maximum probability, a statement close to the\nGibbs distribution conditions. However, Osborne also admitted that the\nempirical observation of the probability distribution of logarithmic changes of\nstock prices was emphasizing obvious asymmetries and consequently could not\nperfectly confirm his prior theory. The purpose of this paper is to propose an\nexplanation to what we could call the Osborne paradox and then address an\nalternative approach via Bayesian inference regarding the description of the\nprobability distribution of changes in logarithms of prices that was\nthenceforth under the prism of frequentist inference. We show that the stock\nmarket returns are locally described by equilibrium statistical mechanics with\nconserved statistics variables, whereas globally there is yet other statistics\nwith persistent flowing variables that can be effectively described by a\nsuperposition of several statistics on different time scales, namely, a\nsuperstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 06:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

We argue that the revision is on the origin of the phase\nvariable for superconductivity; this phase appears as a consequence of the\nelectron-pairing in the standard theory, but its origin is a Berry connection\narising from many-body wave functions.\n  When this Berry connection is non-trivial, it gives rise to a collective mode\nthat generates supercurrent; this collective mode creates number-changing\noperators for particles participating in this mode, and these number-changing\noperators stabilize the superconducting state by exploiting the Cooper\ninstability. In the new theory, the role of the electron-pairing is to\nstabilize the nontrivial Berry connection; it is not the cause of\nsuperconductivity.\n  In BCS superconductors, however, the simultaneous appearance of the\nnontrivial Berry connection and the electron-pairing occurs. Therefore, the\nelectron-pairing amplitude can be used as an order parameter for the\nsuperconducting state. We revisit the Andreev$-$Saint-James reflection and the\nJosephson effect.

The RED-Net takes\nthe result of ICE-Net and the low light image as input, and can re-enhance the\nlow light image and denoise at the same time. Both of the networks can be\ntrained with low light images only, which is achieved by a Maximum Entropy\nbased Retinex (ME-Retinex) model and an assumption that noises are\nindependently distributed. In the ME-Retinex model, a new constraint on the\nreflectance image is introduced that the maximum channel of the reflectance\nimage conforms to the maximum channel of the low light image and its entropy\nshould be the largest, which converts the decomposition of reflectance and\nillumination in Retinex model to a non-ill-conditioned problem and allows the\nICE-Net to be trained with a self-supervised way. The loss functions of RED-Net\nare carefully formulated to separate the noises and details during training,\nand they are based on the idea that, if noises are independently distributed,\nafter the processing of smoothing filters (\\eg mean filter), the gradient of\nthe noise part should be smaller than the gradient of the detail part. It can\nbe proved qualitatively and quantitatively through experiments that the\nproposed method is efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 08:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The curve estimation is specially designed,\nconsidering pixel value range, monotonicity, and differentiability. Zero-DCE is\nappealing in its relaxed assumption on reference images, i.e., it does not\nrequire any paired or even unpaired data during training. This is achieved\nthrough a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which\nimplicitly measure the enhancement quality and drive the learning of the\nnetwork.

We show that the key reason is that\nthe generation is not Counterfactual Faithful, and thus we propose a faithful\none, whose generation is from the sample-specific counterfactual question: What\nwould the sample look like, if we set its class attribute to a certain class,\nwhile keeping its sample attribute unchanged?

In this work, we investigate\nextensively the dynamics of skyrmion motion driven by magnon in an\nantiferromagnet using the collective coordinate theory, focusing on the effect\nof magnon polarization.

Recently, a complete monogamy relation for multiparty\nquantum system was established for entanglement in [Phys. Rev.

In this work, we firstly\ndefine the complete monogamy for this multipartite quantum discord (MQD) and\nthe global quantum discord (GQD). MQD, with the same spirit as the complete\nmonogamy of entanglement, is said to be completely monogamous (i) if it does\nnot increase under coarsening of subsystems and (ii) if some given combination\nof subsystems reach the total amount of the correlation, then all other\ncombination of subsystems that do not include all the given subsystems do not\ncontain such a correlation any more. Here, coarsening of subsystems means\ndiscarding or combining some subsystems up to the given partition.\nSimultaneously, the complete monogamy of GQD is also defined with slight\nmodification on the coarsening relation.Consequently, we explore all the\ncoarsening relations of MQD and show that it is completely monogamous with a\nmodicum assumption. In addition, with the same spirit, we investigate all the\ncoarsening relations for GQD and show that GQD is not completely\nmonogamous.That is, in the sense of the complete monogamy relation, MQD as a\ngeneralization of the original QD captures the nature of such a quantum\ncorrelation, and thus it is nicer than GQD as a generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 11:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 01:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 04:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

These notions\nhave been extended also to other kinds of automata. Thus, B.~Imreh and\nM.~Steinby (1999) identified three natural types of directing words, called\nD1-, D2- and D3-directing words, for nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs).\nHere we adapt these notions for fuzzy finite automata (FFAs). The D3-directing\nwords obtained this way are precisely the directing words introduced by\nV.~Karthikeyan and M. Rajasekar (2015). With any FFA F we associate an NFA Fnd\nwhich has the same Di-directing words as F. Thus, if these definitions are\nused, the theory of directable FFAs reduces to that of NFAs.\n  We also introduce three new kinds of directing words of fuzzy automata that\nwe call DD1-, DD2- and DD3-directing words, respectively which depend more on\nthe fuzzy transition degrees between states. We establish some basic properties\nof the sets $DDi(F)$ of DDi-directing words of any given FFA F. In particular,\nit is shown that these languages are regular, and that DDi-directability is\ndecidable. For so-called normal FFAs the languages DDi(F) are shown to have\nsome special properties. Several relationships between the families of the\ncorresponding sets DDi(F) of DDi-directing words are presented. We also\ndetermine the complete meet-semilattice of the various classes of\nDDi-directable FFAs and normal FFAs and their intersections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 12:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Along with the debate\nand exploration on relevance, IR has already become a core task in many\nreal-world applications, such as Web search engines, question answering\nsystems, conversational bots, and so on. While relevance acts as a unified\nconcept in all these retrieval tasks, the inherent definitions are quite\ndifferent due to the heterogeneity of these tasks. This raises a question to\nus: Do these different forms of relevance really lead to different modeling\nfocuses? To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an empirical study\non relevance modeling in three representative IR tasks, i.e., document\nretrieval, answer retrieval, and response retrieval. Specifically, we attempt\nto study the following two questions: 1) Does relevance modeling in these tasks\nreally show differences in terms of natural language understanding (NLU)?

To address this issue, policy makers and other stakeholders, such\nas the European Commission or NIST, have proposed high-level guidelines aiming\nto promote trustworthy ML (i.e., lawful, ethical and robust). However, these\nguidelines do not specify actions to be taken by those involved in building ML\nsystems. In this paper, we argue that guidelines related to the development of\ntrustworthy ML can be translated to operational practices, and should become\npart of the ML development life cycle. Towards this goal, we ran a multi-vocal\nliterature review, and mined operational practices from white and grey\nliterature. Moreover, we launched a global survey to measure practice adoption\nand the effects of these practices. In total, we identified 14 new practices,\nand used them to complement an existing catalogue of ML engineering practices.\nInitial analysis of the survey results reveals that so far, practice adoption\nfor trustworthy ML is relatively low. In particular, practices related to\nassuring security of ML components have very low adoption. Other practices\nenjoy slightly larger adoption, such as providing explanations to users.

In this work, we propose\nAdaSpeech, an adaptive TTS system for high-quality and efficient customization\nof new voices. We design several techniques in AdaSpeech to address the two\nchallenges in custom voice: 1) To handle different acoustic conditions, we use\ntwo acoustic encoders to extract an utterance-level vector and a sequence of\nphoneme-level vectors from the target speech during training; in inference, we\nextract the utterance-level vector from a reference speech and use an acoustic\npredictor to predict the phoneme-level vectors. 2) To better trade off the\nadaptation parameters and voice quality, we introduce conditional layer\nnormalization in the mel-spectrogram decoder of AdaSpeech, and fine-tune this\npart in addition to speaker embedding for adaptation. We pre-train the source\nTTS model on LibriTTS datasets and fine-tune it on VCTK and LJSpeech datasets\n(with different acoustic conditions from LibriTTS) with few adaptation data,\ne.g., 20 sentences, about 1 minute speech.

We have presented a numerical model for the non-thermal emission of\ngamma-ray binaries in a pulsar-wind driven scenario. Aims. We apply this model\nto one of the best-observed gamma-ray binaries, the LS 5039 system. Methods.\nThe model involves a joint simulation of the pulsar- and stellar-wind\ninteraction and the transport of electronic pairs from the pulsar wind\naccelerated at the emerging shock structure. We compute the synchrotron and\ninverse Compton emission in a post-processing step, while consistently\naccounting for relativistic beaming and $\\gamma \\gamma$-absorption in the\nstellar radiation field. Results. The stellar- and pulsar-wind interaction\nleads to the formation of an extended, asymmetric wind collision region\ndeveloping strong shocks, turbulent mixing, and secondary shocks in the\nturbulent flow. Both the structure of the collision region and the resulting\nparticle distributions show significant orbital variation. Next to the\nacceleration of particles at the bow-like pulsar wind and Coriolis shock the\nmodel naturally accounts for the reacceleration of particles at secondary\nshocks contributing to the emission at very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays. The\nmodel successfully reproduces the main spectral features of LS 5039. While the\npredicted lightcurves in the high-energy and VHE gamma-ray band are in good\nagreement with observations, our model still does not reproduce the X-ray to\nlow-energy gamma-ray modulation, which we attribute to the employed magnetic\nfield model. Conclusions. We successfully model the main spectral features of\nthe observed multiband, non-thermal emission of LS 5039 and thus further\nsubstantiates a wind-driven interpretation of gamma-ray binaries. Open issues\nrelate to the synchrotron modulation, which might be addressed through a\nmagnetohydrodynamic extension of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 13:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Experiments are conducted in a test rig operating at atmospheric\nconditions. The system is equipped with the BASIS (Beihang Axial Swirler\nIndependently-Stratified) burner fuelled with premixed methane-air mixtures. To\nillustrate the interactions between the pilot and main flames, three operating\nmodes are studied, where the burner works with: (i) only the pilot flame, (ii)\nonly the main flame, and (iii) the stratified flame (with both the pilot and\nmain flames). We found that: (1) In the pilot flame mode, the flame changes\nfrom V-shape to M-shape when the main stage is switched from closed to\nsupplying a pure air stream. Strong oscillations in the M-shape flame are found\ndue to the dilution of the main air to the pilot methane flame. (2) In the main\nflame mode, the main flame is lifted off from the burner if the pilot stage is\nsupplied with air. The temperature of the primary recirculation zone drops\nsubstantially and the unsteady heat release is intensified. (3) In the\nstratified flame mode, unique beating oscillations exhibiting dual\nclosely-spaced frequencies in the pressure spectrum. is found. This is observed\nwithin over narrow window of equivalence ratio combinations between the pilot\nand main stages. Detailed analysis of the experimental data shows that flame\ndynamics and thermoacoustic couplings at these two frequencies are similar to\nthose of the unstable pilot flame and the attached main flame cases,\nrespectively. Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) are carried out with OpenFOAM to\nunderstand the mechanisms of the time averaged flame shapes in different\noperating modes. Finally, a simple acoustic analysis is proposed to understand\nthe acoustic mode nature of the beating oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 13:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

If no stabilizing\nterminal ingredients are used, stability can be guaranteed via a sufficiently\nlong horizon. A suboptimality index can be derived that gives bounds on the\nperformance of the MPC law over an infinite-horizon (IH). While for\ntime-invariant schemes such index can be computed offline, less attention has\nbeen paid to time-varying strategies with adapting cost function which can be\nfound, e.g., in learning-based optimal control. This work addresses the\nperformance bounds of nonlinear MPC with stabilizing horizon and time-varying\nterminal cost. A scheme is proposed that uses the decay of the optimal\nfinite-horizon cost and convolutes a history stack to predict the bounds on the\nIH performance. Based on online information on the decay rate, the performance\nbound estimate is improved while the terminal cost is adapted using methods\nfrom adaptive dynamic programming. The adaptation of the terminal cost leads to\nperformance improvement over a time-invariant scheme with the same horizon\nlength. The approach is demonstrated in a case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 14:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

During this PhD work, several directions were\nexplored to understand and mitigate their effects. First, more efficient and\nrobust numerical methods for their prediction in complex combustors were\ndesigned. In this matter, a novel type of modal expansion, named a frame\nexpansion and comparable to the classical Galerkin expansion, was introduced to\nbuild more accurate acoustic Low-Order Models (LOMs), able to account for the\nfull geometrical complexity of industrial combustors. In particular, the frame\nexpansion is able to accurately represent the acoustic velocity field near\nnon-rigid-wall boundaries, a crucial ability that the Galerkin method lacks. An\nentire class of novel numerical methods, based on the frame expansion, were\nthen designed and combined with the state-space formalism to build acoustic\nnetworks of complex systems. The second ingredient in the prediction of\nthermoacoustic instabilities is the flame dynamics modeling. This work dealt\nwith this problem, in the specific case of a cryogenic coaxial jet-flame\ncharacteristic of a LRE. Flame dynamics driving phenomena were identified\nthanks to three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of the Mascotte\nexperimental test rig where both reactants (CH4 and O2) are injected in\ntranscritical conditions. Several LES with harmonic modulation of the fuel\ninflow at various frequencies and amplitudes were performed in order to\nevaluate the flame response to acoustic oscillations and compute a Flame\nTransfer Function (FTF). The stabilization of this flame in the near-injector\nregion, which is of primary importance on the overall flame dynamics, was also\ninvestigated thanks to multi-physics two-dimensional Direct Numerical\nSimulations (DNS), where a conjugate heat transfer problem is resolved at the\ninjector lip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 14:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Methods: [CII] observations of RCW36 covering an area\nof ~30 arcmin$\\times$30 arcmin were carried out with a Fabry-P\\'{e}rot\nspectrometer aboard a 100-cm balloon-borne far-infrared (IR) telescope with an\nangular resolution of 90 arcsec. By using AKARI and Herschel images, the\nspatial distribution of the [CII] intensity was compared with those of emission\nfrom the large grains and PAH. Results: The [CII] emission is spatially in good\nagreement with shell-like structures of a bipolar lobe observed in IR images,\nwhich extend along the direction perpendicular to the direction of a cold dense\nfilament. We found that the [CII]--160 $\\mu$m relation for RCW36 shows higher\nbrightness ratio of [CII]/160 $\\mu$m than that for RCW 38, while the [CII]--9\n$\\mu$m relation for RCW36 is in good agreement with that for RCW38.\nConclusions: The [CII] emission spatially well correlates with PAH and cold\ndust emissions. This means that the observed [CII] emission dominantly comes\nfrom PDRs. Moreover, the L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio shows large variation compared\nwith the L_[CII]/L_PAH ratio. In view of the observed tight correlation between\nL_[CII]/L_FIR and the optical depth at $\\lambda$=160 $\\mu$m, the large\nvariation in L_[CII]/L_FIR can be simply explained by the geometrical effect,\nviz., L_FIR has contributions from the entire dust-cloud column along the line\nof sight, while L_[CII] has contributions from far-UV illuminated cloud\nsurfaces. Based on the picture of the geometry effect, the enhanced brightness\nratio of [CII]/160 $\\mu$m is attributed to the difference in gas structures\nwhere massive stars are formed: filamentary (RCW36) and clumpy (RCW38)\nmolecular clouds and thus suggests that RCW36 is dominated by far-UV\nilluminated cloud surfaces compared with RCW38.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 14:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Too much, and the network would\noverfit to the training data. Too little, and the network would not fit to\nanything at all. Na\\\"ively, the amount of information the network stores should\nscale in proportion to the number of trainable weights. This raises the\nquestion: how can neural networks with vastly more weights than training data\nstill generalise? A simple resolution to this conundrum is that the number of\nweights is usually a bad proxy for the actual amount of information stored. For\ninstance, typical weight vectors may be highly compressible. Then another\nquestion occurs: is it possible to compute the actual amount of information\nstored? This paper derives both a consistent estimator and a closed-form upper\nbound on the information content of infinitely wide neural networks. The\nderivation is based on an identification between neural information content and\nthe negative log probability of a Gaussian orthant.

However,\nwithout exploiting the intrinsic characteristics such as model-agnostic and\nhuman-specific patterns, existing works generate weak adversarial perturbations\nin the physical world, which fall short of attacking across different models\nand show visually suspicious appearance. Motivated by the viewpoint that\nattention reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the recognition process,\nthis paper proposes the Dual Attention Suppression (DAS) attack to generate\nvisually-natural physical adversarial camouflages with strong transferability\nby suppressing both model and human attention. As for attacking, we generate\ntransferable adversarial camouflages by distracting the model-shared similar\nattention patterns from the target to non-target regions. Meanwhile, based on\nthe fact that human visual attention always focuses on salient items (e.g.,\nsuspicious distortions), we evade the human-specific bottom-up attention to\ngenerate visually-natural camouflages which are correlated to the scenario\ncontext.

To leverage their full potential,\nhowever, it is important to understand and engineer the properties of the\ndifferent exciton species that exist in these monolayers, as well as to control\ntheir transport through the material. A promising approach relies on\nengineering strain landscapes in atomically thin semiconductors that excitons\nnavigate. In WSe$_2$ monolayers, for example, localized strain has been used to\ncontrol the emission wavelength of excitons, induce exciton funneling and\nconversion, and even realize single-photon sources and quantum dots. Before\nthese phenomena can be fully leveraged for applications, including quantum\ninformation processing, the details of excitons' interaction with the strain\nlandscape must be well understood. To address this, we have developed a\ncryogenic technique capable of probing the dynamics of both bright and dark\nexcitons in nanoscale strain landscapes in TMDs. In our approach, a\nnanosculpted tapered optical fiber is used to simultaneously generate strain\nand probe the near-field optical response of WSe$_2$ monolayers at 5 K. When\nthe monolayer is pushed by the fiber, its lowest energy photoluminescence (PL)\npeaks red shift by as much as 390 meV, (corresponding to 20% of the bandgap of\nan unstrained WSe$_2$ monolayer). The red-shifting peaks are polarized\nperpendicularly to the WSe$_2$ plane and have long rising times (10 ps) and\nlifetimes (52 ps), indicating that they originate from nominally spin-forbidden\ndark excitons. Taken together, these observations indicate that dark excitons\nare funneled to the high-strain regions during their long lifetime and are the\nprincipal participants in drift and diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Our\nwork elucidates the important role that dark excitons play in locally strained\nWSe$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 15:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

To alleviate the constraint of few\nsamples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel\nobjects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process of FSOD should\nfocus more on intrinsical object characteristics, which are invariant under\ndifferent visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization.\nUnlike previous attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we\nexplore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that\nare universal across different object categories. We propose a new prototype,\nnamely universal prototype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides\nthe advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal\nprototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After\nenhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a\nconsistency loss to maximize the agreement between the enhanced features and\nthe original ones, which is beneficial for learning invariant object\ncharacteristics. Thus, we develop a new framework of few-shot object detection\nwith universal prototypes ({FSOD}^{up}) that owns the merit of feature\ngeneralization towards novel objects. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS\nCOCO show the effectiveness of {FSOD}^{up}. Particularly, for the 1-shot case\nof VOC Split2, {FSOD}^{up} outperforms the baseline by 6.8% in terms of mAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 15:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 07:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

These issues are usually caused by various types of\nservice anomalies which propagate along service dependencies. Accurate and\nhigh-efficient root cause localization is thus a critical challenge for\nlarge-scale industrial microservice systems. Existing approaches use service\ndependency graph based analysis techniques to automatically locate root causes.\nHowever, these approaches are limited due to their inaccurate detection of\nservice anomalies and inefficient traversing of service dependency graph. In\nthis paper, we propose a high-efficient root cause localization approach for\navailability issues of microservice systems, called MicroHECL. Based on a\ndynamically constructed service call graph, MicroHECL analyzes possible anomaly\npropagation chains, and ranks candidate root causes based on correlation\nanalysis. We combine machine learning and statistical methods and design\ncustomized models for the detection of different types of service anomalies\n(i.e., performance, reliability, traffic). To improve the efficiency, we adopt\na pruning strategy to eliminate irrelevant service calls in anomaly propagation\nchain analysis. Experimental studies show that MicroHECL significantly\noutperforms two state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy\nand efficiency. MicroHECL has been used in Alibaba and achieves a top-3 hit\nratio of 68% with root cause localization time reduced from 30 minutes to 5\nminutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 11:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

For compositional reasoning, QE\nprovides the foundation of our approach, serving as the calculus for\ncomposition to derive the strongest system-property in a single step, from the\ngiven component atomic-properties and their interconnection relation. We first\ndeveloped this framework for time-independent properties, and later extended it\nto time-dependent property composition. The extension requires, in addition,\nshifting the given properties along time to span the time horizon of interest,\nhe least of which for the strongest system-property is no more than the total\ntime horizons of the component level atomic-properties. The\nsystem-initial-condition is also composed from atomic-initial-conditions of the\ncomponents the same way. It is used to verify a desired system-level property,\nalongside the derived strongest system-property, by way of induction. Our\ncomposition approach is uniform regardless of the composition types\n(cascade/parallel/feedback) for both time-dependent and time-independent\nproperties.\n  We developed a new prototype verifier named ReLIC (Reduced Logic Inference\nfor Composition) that implements our above approaches. We demonstrated it\nthrough several illustrative and practical examples. Further, we advanced the\n$k$-induction based model-checking with QE capabilities, by formulating its\nbase and inductive steps into QE problems where all the variables are\nuniversally quantified. Our integration of the QE solver Redlog with the\n$k$-induction based model-checking tool JKind, shows the successful solving of\na non-linear problem that the SMT capable JKind failed to resolve.

This embedding enables a\nsemantic similarity score between queries and documents that can be an\nimportant feature in document ranking and relevancy. To train such a customized\nsentence encoder, it is beneficial to leverage users search data in the form of\nquery-document clicked pairs however, we must avoid relying too much on search\nclick data as it is biased and does not cover many unseen cases. The search\ndata is heavily skewed towards short queries and for long queries is small and\noften noisy. The goal is to design a universal multi-lingual encoder that works\nfor all cases and covers both short and long queries. We select a number of\npublic NLI datasets in different languages and translation data and together\nwith user search data we train a language model using a multi-task approach. A\nchallenge is that these datasets are not homogeneous in terms of content, size\nand the balance ratio. While the public NLI datasets are usually two-sentence\nbased with the same portion of positive and negative pairs, the user search\ndata can contain multi-sentence documents and only positive pairs.

However, a great effort has been made trying to obtain\nsimilar condensed structures from either ssRNA or dsRNA, which the latter\ncarries similar negative charge density as dsDNA, although it adopts a\ndifferent helical form. But the analogous condensation of RNA molecules into\nwell-defined structures has so far been elusive. In this work, we show that\nssRNA molecules can easily be condensed into nanoring structures on a mice\nsurface, where each nanoring structure is formed mostly by a single RNA\nmolecule. The condensation occurs in a concentration range of different atomic\ncations, from monovalent to trivalent. The structures of the RNA nanorings on\nmica surfaces were oberved by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The samples were\nobserved in tapping mode and were prepared by drop evaporation of a solution of\nRNA in the presence of one type of the different cations used. As far as we\nknow, this is the first time that nanorings or any other well-defined condensed\nRNA structures have been reported. The RNA nanorings formation can be\nunderstood by an energy competition between the hydrogen bonding forming\nhairpin stems, weakened by the salts, and hairpin loops. This results may have\nan important biological relevance, since it has been proposed that RNA is the\noldest genome coding molecule and the formation of these structures could have\ngiven it stability against degradation in primeval times. Even more, the\nnanoring structures could have the potential to be used as biosensors and\nfunctionalized nanodevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2021 16:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}
