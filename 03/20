Methods: We analyzed the temporal distribution of EMS\ncalls in the Austin-Travis County area between January 1st, 2019, and December\n31st, 2020. Change point detection was performed to identify critical dates\nmarking changes in EMS call distributions, and time series regression was\napplied for forecasting Covid-19 EMS incidents. Results: Two critical dates\nmarked the impact of Covid-19 on the distribution of EMS calls: March 17th,\nwhen the daily number of non-pandemic EMS incidents dropped significantly, and\nMay 13th, by which the daily number of EMS calls climbed back to 75% of the\nnumber in pre-Covid-19 time. The new daily count of the hospitalization of\nCovid-19 patients alone proves a powerful predictor of the number of pandemic\nEMS calls, with an r2 value equal to 0.85. In particular, for every 2.5 cases\nwhere EMS takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, one person is admitted.\nConclusion: The mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demand was significantly\nless than the period before Covid-19 pandemic. The number of EMS calls for\nCovid-19 symptoms can be predicted from the daily new hospitalization of\nCovid-19 patients.

In addition, DL methods have relatively poor generalizability to\nout-of-sample data. Multi-atlas segmentation (MAS), on the other hand, has\npromising performance using limited amounts of training data and good\ngeneralizability. A hybrid method that integrates the high accuracy of DL and\ngood generalizability of MAS is highly desired and could play an important role\nin segmentation problems where manually labeled data is hard to generate. Most\nof the prior work focuses on improving single components of MAS using DL rather\nthan directly optimizing the final segmentation accuracy via an end-to-end\npipeline.

However, the dependence of this law on metallicity is still largely\ndebated. In this paper, we combine three samples of Cepheids in the Milky Way\n(MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in\norder to derive the metallicity term (hereafter $\\gamma$) of the PL relation.\nThe recent publication of extremely precise LMC and SMC distances based on\nlate-type detached eclipsing binary systems (DEBs) provides a solid anchor for\nthe Magellanic Clouds. In the MW, we adopt Cepheid parallaxes from the early\nthird Gaia Data Release. We derive the metallicity effect in $V$, $I$, $J$,\n$H$, $K_S$, $W_{VI}$ and $W_{JK}$. In the $K_S$ band we report a metallicity\neffect of $-0.221 \\pm 0.051$ mag/dex, the negative sign meaning that more\nmetal-rich Cepheids are intrinsically brighter than their more metal-poor\ncounterparts of the same pulsation period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 16:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Sewer pipes are manually inspected to\ndetermine whether the pipes are defective. However, this process is limited by\nthe number of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect a pipe.\nAutomatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the\nsuccess of computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been\nlimited when compared to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of\npublic datasets. To this end, in this work we present a large novel and\npublicly available multi-label classification dataset for image-based sewer\ndefect classification called Sewer-ML.\n  The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional\nsewer inspectors from three different utility companies across nine years.\nTogether with the dataset, we also present a benchmark algorithm and a novel\nmetric for assessing performance. The benchmark algorithm is a result of\nevaluating 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, six from the sewer defect\nclassification domain and six from the multi-label classification domain, and\ncombining the best performing algorithms. The novel metric is a\nclass-importance weighted F2 score, $\\text{F}2_{\\text{CIW}}$, reflecting the\neconomic impact of each class, used together with the normal pipe F1 score,\n$\\text{F}1_{\\text{Normal}}$.

Meanwhile, an IRS is\ndeployed to enhance the performances of wireless energy transfer (WET) and\nwireless information transfer (WIT) by intelligently adjusting the phase shift\nof each reflecting element. To evaluate the performance of this IRS assisted\nWPSN, we are interested in maximizing its system sum throughput to jointly\noptimize the energy beamforming of the PS, the transmission time allocation, as\nwell as the phase shifts of the WET and WIT phases. The formulated problem is\nnot jointly convex due to the multiple coupled variables. To deal with its\nnon-convexity, we first independently find the phase shifts of the WIT phase in\nclosed-form. We further propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to\niteratively solve the sum throughput maximization problem. To be specific, a\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is adopted to design the\nenergy beamforming and the time allocation for given phase shifts of WET phase,\nwhich is then optimized for given energy beamforming and time allocation.\nMoreover, we propose an AO low-complexity scheme to significantly reduce the\ncomputational complexity incurred by the SDP relaxation, where the optimal\nclosed-form energy beamforming, time allocation, and phase shifts of the WET\nphase are derived.

A\ndependency is reflected in the fact that information about one random variable\nprovides information about the likely distribution of values of another random\nvariable. Insurance companies in particular must investigate such dependencies\nbetween different lines of business and the effects that an extreme loss event,\nsuch as an earthquake or hurricane, has across multiple lines of business\nsimultaneously. Copulas provide a popular model-based approach to analysing the\ndependency between risks, and the coefficient of tail dependence is a measure\nof dependence for extreme losses. Besides commonly used empirical estimators\nfor estimating the tail dependence coefficient, copula fitting can lead to\nestimation of such coefficients directly or can verify their existence.\nGenerally, a range of copula models is available to fit a data set well,\nleading to multiple different tail dependence results; a method based on\nBayesian model averaging is designed to obtain a unified estimate of tail\ndependence. In this article, this model-based coefficient estimation method is\nillustrated through a variety of copula fitting approaches and results are\npresented for several simulated data sets and also a real general insurance\nloss data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

The particles can\nsense if a target is close, e.g., by detecting signaling molecules released by\na target, but they cannot deduce any directional cues. We focus on composite\nsearch strategies, where particles switch between extensive outer search and\nintensive inner search; inner search is started when the proximity of a target\nis detected and ends again when a certain inner search time has elapsed. In the\nsimplest strategy, active particles move ballistically during outer search, and\ntransiently reduce their directional persistence during inner search. In a\nsecond, adaptive strategy, particles exploit a dynamic scattering effect by\nreducing directional persistence only outside a well-defined target zone. These\ntwo search strategies require only minimal information processing capabilities\nand a single binary or tertiary internal state, respectively, yet increases the\nrate of target encounter substantially. The optimal inner search time scales as\na power-law with exponent -2/3 with target density, reflecting a trade-off\nbetween exploration and exploitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

Experiments on bird flocks\nand insect swarms show that social forces act on the particles' velocity\nthrough the generator of its rotations, namely the spin, indicating that\nmode-coupling field theories are necessary to reproduce the correct dynamical\nbehaviour. Unfortunately, a theory for three coupled fields - density, velocity\nand spin - has a prohibitive degree of intricacy. A simplifying path consists\nin getting rid of density fluctuations by studying incompressible systems. This\nrequires imposing a solenoidal constraint on the primary field, an unsolved\nproblem even for equilibrium mode-coupling theories. Here, we perform an\nequilibrium dynamic renormalization group analysis of a mode-coupling field\ntheory subject to a solenoidal constraint; using the classification of Halperin\nand Hohenberg, we can dub this case as a solenoidal Model G. We demonstrate\nthat the constraint produces a new vertex that mixes static and dynamical\ncoupling constants, and that this vertex is essential to grant the closure of\nthe renormalization group structure and the consistency of dynamics with\nstatics. Interestingly, although the solenoidal constraint leads to a\nmodification of the static universality class, we find that it does not change\nthe dynamical universality class, a result that seems to represent an exception\nto the general rule that dynamical universality classes are narrower than\nstatic ones. Our results constitute a solid stepping stone in the admittedly\nlarge chasm towards developing an off-equilibrium mode-coupling theory of\nbiological groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

We present a model for the growth of directed\ncitation networks and show that citations disparities arise from individual\npreferences to cite authors from the same group (homophily), highly cited or\nactive authors (preferential attachment), as well as the size of the group and\nhow frequently new authors join. We analyze the model and show that its\npredictions align well with real-world observations. Our theoretical and\nempirical analysis also suggests potential strategies to mitigate structural\ninequalities in science. In particular, we find that merely increasing the\nminority group size does little to narrow the disparities. Instead, reducing\nthe homophily of each group, frequently adding new authors to a research field\nwhile providing them an accessible platform among existing, established\nauthors, together with balanced group sizes can have the largest impact on\nreducing inequality. Our work highlights additional complexities of mitigating\nstructural disparities stemming from asymmetric relations (e.g., directed\ncitations) compared to symmetric relations (e.g., collaborations).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 02:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

However, such a\ncorrelation may be driven/formed by selection effects. In this study, we\ninvestigate how H$\\alpha$ EWs correlate with galaxy properties and how\nselection biases could alter such correlations using a $z = 0.47$\nnarrowband-selected sample of 1572 H$\\alpha$ emitters from the Ly$\\alpha$\nGalaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) survey.

At lower masses, we find there are more\nhigh-EW outliers compared to high masses, even after taking into account\nselection effects.

Feedback can shape the stellar-halo mass (SHM) relation\nby driving gas out of galaxies, by modulating the first-time infall of gas onto\ngalaxies (i.e., preventative feedback), and by instigating fountain flows of\nrecycled wind material. We present and apply a method to disentangle these\neffects for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. We build a model of\nlinear coupled differential equations that by construction reproduces the flows\nof gas onto and out of galaxies and haloes in the EAGLE cosmological\nsimulation. By varying individual terms in this model, we isolate the relative\neffects of star formation, ejection via outflow, first-time inflow and wind\nrecycling on the SHM relation. We find that for halo masses $M_{200} < 10^{12}\n\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ the SHM relation is shaped primarily by a combination of\nejection from galaxies and haloes, while for larger $M_{200}$ preventative\nfeedback is also important. The effects of recycling and the efficiency of star\nformation are small. We show that if, instead of $M_{200}$, we use the\ncumulative mass of dark matter that fell in for the first time, the evolution\nof the SHM relation nearly vanishes. This suggests that the evolution is due to\nthe definition of halo mass rather than to an evolving physical efficiency of\ngalaxy formation. Finally, we demonstrate that the mass in the circum-galactic\nmedium is much more sensitive to gas flows, especially recycling, than is the\ncase for stars and the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 18:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

In this work, we\ninvestigate its impact on robotic bin-picking tasks such as 6D object pose\nestimation. The performance of object pose estimation relies heavily on the\nquality of depth data. However, due to the prevalence of shiny surfaces and\ncluttered scenes, industrial grade depth cameras often fail to sense depth or\ngenerate unreliable measurements from a single viewpoint. To this end, we\npropose a novel probabilistic framework for scene reconstruction in robotic\nbin-picking. Based on active stereo camera data, we first explicitly estimate\nthe uncertainty of depth measurements for mitigating the adverse effects of\nboth noise and outliers. The uncertainty estimates are then incorporated into a\nprobabilistic model for incrementally updating the scene. To extensively\nevaluate the traditional fusion approach alongside our own approach, we will\nrelease a novel representative dataset with multiple views for each bin and\ncurated parts. Over the entire dataset, we demonstrate that our framework\noutperforms a traditional fusion approach by a 12.8% reduction in\nreconstruction error, and 6.1% improvement in detection rate.

However, despite their remarkable early\npromise, they typically require large training data-sets consisting of paired\ninput-output observations which may be expensive to obtain, while their\npredictions may not be consistent with the underlying physical principles that\ngenerated the observed data. In this work, we propose a novel model class\ncoined as physics-informed DeepONets, which introduces an effective\nregularization mechanism for biasing the outputs of DeepOnet models towards\nensuring physical consistency. This is accomplished by leveraging automatic\ndifferentiation to impose the underlying physical laws via soft penalty\nconstraints during model training. We demonstrate that this simple, yet\nremarkably effective extension can not only yield a significant improvement in\nthe predictive accuracy of DeepOnets, but also greatly reduce the need for\nlarge training data-sets.

However, high classification performances of DNNs are related\nto their large training sets. Unfortunately, in the literature, the datasets\nused to classify motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain\na small number of samples. To achieve high performances with small-sized\ndatasets, most of the studies have employed a transformation such as common\nspatial patterns (CSP) before the classification process.

It is observed in the literature that the augmentation process is\nnot applied for increasing the classification performance of EEG signals.

In other words, there is indeed no distinction\nbetween Hermitian systems, PT-symmetric systems, and non PT-symmetric systems\nwhen viewed from a complex domain. Their eigen-structures can be made\ncoincident through linear transformation of complex coordinates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 18:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Nonetheless, the motion blur from longer exposures, the\nnoise from short exposures, and inherent spatial artifacts of the SVE methods\nremain huge obstacles. Additionally, temporal coherence must be taken into\naccount for the stability of video reconstruction. To tackle these challenges,\nwe introduce a novel network architecture that divides-and-conquers these\nproblems. In order to better adapt the network to the large dynamic range, we\nalso propose LDR-reconstruction loss that takes equal contributions from both\nthe highlighted and the shaded pixels of HDR frames.

Secondly, we tackle the\nproblem of parametric inference by constructing differentially private\nestimators of the asymptotic variance of our private M-estimators.

The\nliterature recognizes that methods in one domain do not have a counterpart in\nthe other domain. This paper shows that in fact one can develop a unified graph\nsignal sampling theory with analogous interpretations in both domains just like\nsampling in traditional DSP. To achieve it, we introduce a spectral shift $M$\nacting in the spectral domain rather than shift $A$ that acts in the vertex\ndomain. This leads to a GSP theory that starts from the spectral domain, for\nexample, linear shift invariant (LSI) filtering in the spectral domain is with\npolynomials $P(M)$.

The proposed procedure is based on domain decomposition and combines\nthe Multiscale Perturbation Method (MPM) with the Multiscale Robin Coupled\nMethod (MRCM). When an update of the velocity field is called by the operator\nsplitting algorithm, the MPM-2P may provide, depending on the magnitude of a\ndimensionless algorithmic parameter, an accurate and computationally\ninexpensive approximation for the velocity field by reusing previously computed\nmultiscale basis functions. Thus, a full update of all multiscale basis\nfunctions required by the MRCM for the construction of a new velocity field is\navoided. There are two main steps in the formulation of the MPM-2P. Initially,\nfor each subdomain one local boundary value problem with trivial Robin boundary\nconditions is solved (instead of a full set of multiscale basis functions, that\nwould be required by the MRCM). Then, the solution of an inexpensive interface\nproblem provides the velocity field on the skeleton of the decomposition of the\ndomain.

Our\nmetric has the potential to help physicians for diagnosis as well as monitoring\nthe rehabilitation of patients with one-sided facial paralysis. A deep learning\nbased landmark detection technique is used to estimate style invariant facial\nlandmark points and dense optical flow is used to generate motion maps from a\nshort sequence of frames. Six face regions are considered corresponding to the\nleft and right parts of the forehead, eyes, and mouth. Motion is computed and\ncompared between the left and the right parts of each region of interest to\nestimate the symmetry score. For testing, asymmetric sequences are\nsynthetically generated from a facial expression dataset. A score equation is\ndeveloped to quantify symmetry in both symmetric and asymmetric face sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 00:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

However,\ndifferent types of loss functions can be proposed for the same PDE. For the\nPoisson equation, the loss function can be based on the weak formulation of\nenergy variation or the least squares method, which leads to the deep Ritz\nmodel and deep Galerkin model, respectively. But loss landscapes from these\ndifferent models give arise to different practical performance of training the\nNN parameters. To investigate and understand such practical differences, we\npropose to compare the loss landscapes of these models, which are both high\ndimensional and highly non-convex. In such settings, the roughness is more\nimportant than the traditional eigenvalue analysis to describe the\nnon-convexity. We contribute to the landscape comparisons by proposing a\nroughness index to scientifically and quantitatively describe the heuristic\nconcept of \"roughness\" of landscape around minimizers. This index is based on\nrandom projections and the variance of (normalized) total variation for one\ndimensional projected functions, and it is efficient to compute. A large\nroughness index hints an oscillatory landscape profile as a severe challenge\nfor the first order optimization method. We apply this index to the two models\nfor the Poisson equation and our empirical results reveal a consistent general\nobservation that the landscapes from the deep Galerkin method around its local\nminimizers are less rough than the deep Ritz method, which supports the\nobserved gain in accuracy of the deep Galerkin method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 01:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Thus we propose a novel energy management protocol for\nenergy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs), named the adaptive sensor\nnode management protocol (ASMP). The proposed protocol makes system components\nto systematically control their performance to conserve the energy. Through\nthis protocol, sensor nodes autonomously activate an additional energy\nconservation algorithm. ASMP embeds three sampling algorithms. For the\noptimized environment sampling, we proposed the adaptive sampling algorithm for\nmonitoring (ASA-m). ASA-m estimates the expected time period to occur\nmeaningful change. The meaningful change refers to the distance between two\ntarget data for the monitoring QoS. Therefore, ASA-m merely gathers the data\nthe system demands. The continuous adaptive sampling algorithm (CASA) solves\nthe problem to be continuously decreasing energy despite of ASA-m. When the\nmonitored environment shows a linear trend property, the sensor node in CASA\nrests a sampling process, and the server generates predicted data at the\nestimated time slot. For guaranteeing the self-sustainability, ASMP uses the\nrecoverable adaptive sampling algorithm (RASA). RASA makes consumed energy\nsmaller than harvested energy by utilizing the predicted data. RASA recharges\nthe energy of the sensor node. Through this method, ASMP achieves both energy\nconservation and service quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 04:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

However, most existing\nmachine learning-based approaches rely on a traditional workflow where models\nare usually trained once for all, with limited involvement from end-users in\nthe process and neglecting the dynamic nature of the learning process. This\nmakes the models static and can not be updated in time, which usually leads to\nhigh false positive or false negative.

We\nprovide sufficient conditions for an algorithm to converge almost surely (a.s.)\nto a global optimum. We then propose a general, simple and effective strategy,\ncalled Perturbation-Projection (PP), to enhance an algorithm's exploration\ncapability so that our convergence conditions are guaranteed to hold. We\nillustrate this approach using three widely used nature-inspired swarm-based\noptimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), bat algorithm (BAT)\nand competitive swarm optimizer (CSO). Extensive numerical experiments show\nthat each of the three algorithms with the enhanced PP strategy outperforms the\noriginal version in a number of notable ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 06:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

While significant progress has been made\nrecently in this area, existing solutions: (i) are still largely focused on\nlow-resolution images, (ii) often generate editing results with visual\nartefacts, or (iii) lack fine-grained control and alter multiple (entangled)\nattributes at once, when trying to generate the desired facial semantics. In\nthis paper, we aim to address these issues though a novel attribute editing\napproach called MaskFaceGAN that focuses on local attribute editing. The\nproposed approach is based on an optimization procedure that directly optimizes\nthe latent code of a pre-trained (state-of-the-art) Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (i.e., StyleGAN2) with respect to several constraints that ensure: (i)\npreservation of relevant image content, (ii) generation of the targeted facial\nattributes, and (iii) spatially--selective treatment of local image areas. The\nconstraints are enforced with the help of an (differentiable) attribute\nclassifier and face parser that provide the necessary reference information for\nthe optimization procedure. MaskFaceGAN is evaluated in extensive experiments\non the CelebA-HQ, Helen and SiblingsDB-HQf datasets and in comparison with\nseveral state-of-the-art techniques from the literature, i.e., StarGAN, AttGAN,\nSTGAN, and two versions of InterFaceGAN. Our experimental results show that the\nproposed approach is able to edit face images with respect to several local\nfacial attributes with unprecedented image quality and at high-resolutions\n(1024x1024), while exhibiting considerably less problems with attribute\nentanglement than competing solutions.

In particular, learning methods\nbased on noise contrastive estimation have shown promising results.

TOI-263b is a validated ultra-short period\nsubstellar object in a 0.56-day orbit around a faint (V=18.97) M3.5 dwarf star.\nThe substellar nature of TOI-263b was explored using multi-color photometry,\nwhich determined a true radius of 0.87+-0.21 Rj, establishing TOI-263b's nature\nranging from an inflated Neptune to a brown dwarf. The orbital period-radius\nparameter space occupied by TOI-263b is quite unique, which prompted a further\ncharacterization of its true nature. Here, we report radial velocity\nmeasurements of TOI-263 obtained with 3 VLT units and the ESPRESSO spectrograph\nto retrieve the mass of TOI-263b. We find that TOI-263b is a brown dwarf with a\nmass of 61.6+-4.0 Mj. Additionally, the orbital period of the brown dwarf is\nfound to be synchronized with the rotation period of the host star, and the\nsystem is found to be relatively active, possibly revealing a star--brown dwarf\ninteraction. All these findings suggest that the system's formation history\nmight be explained via disc fragmentation and later migration to close-in\norbits. If the system is found to be unstable, TOI-263 is an excellent target\nto test the migration mechanisms before the brown dwarf becomes engulfed by its\nparent star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 10:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Unfortunately,\nthese methods are often observed less effective or inefficient in handling\nconditional GANs (cGANs) -- conditioning on a class (aka class-conditional\nGANs) or a continuous variable (aka continuous cGANs or CcGANs). In this work,\nwe introduce an effective and efficient subsampling scheme, named conditional\ndensity ratio-guided rejection sampling (cDR-RS), to sample high-quality images\nfrom cGANs. Specifically, we first develop a novel conditional density ratio\nestimation method, termed cDRE-F-cSP, by proposing the conditional Softplus\n(cSP) loss and an improved feature extraction mechanism. We then derive the\nerror bound of a density ratio model trained with the cSP loss. Finally, we\naccept or reject a fake image in terms of its estimated conditional density\nratio. A filtering scheme is also developed to increase fake images' label\nconsistency without losing diversity when sampling from CcGANs. We extensively\ntest the effectiveness and efficiency of cDR-RS in sampling from both\nclass-conditional GANs and CcGANs on five benchmark datasets. When sampling\nfrom class-conditional GANs, cDR-RS outperforms modern state-of-the-art methods\nby a large margin (except DRE-F-SP+RS) in terms of effectiveness. Although the\neffectiveness of cDR-RS is often comparable to that of DRE-F-SP+RS, cDR-RS is\nsubstantially more efficient. When sampling from CcGANs, the superiority of\ncDR-RS is even more noticeable in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, with the consumption of reasonable computational resources, cDR-RS can\nsubstantially reduce Label Score without decreasing the diversity of\nCcGAN-generated images, while other methods often need to trade much diversity\nfor slightly improved Label Score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 12:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 12:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 06:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 13:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 15:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

To address this challenge, we\npresent an adaptive sampling method which makes use of sampling-based planners\nalong with local, closed-form solutions to generate training samples.

To face this issue, the natural visibility\ngraph approach is proposed in this work to map the full velocity signals into\ncomplex networks. We show that the network degree centrality is able to capture\nthe signal structure at local scales directly from the full signal, thereby\nquantifying FM. Velocity signals from numerically-simulated turbulent channel\nflows and an experimental turbulent boundary layer are investigated at\ndifferent Reynolds numbers. A correction of Taylor's hypothesis for time-series\nis proposed to overcome the overprediction of near-wall frequency modulation\nobtained when local mean velocity is used as the convective velocity.

Local\noperations have difficulty to model the relation between two elements with a\nlong-distance interval. However, directly modeling the contextual information\nbetween any two points brings huge cost in computation and memory, especially\nfor action recognition, where there is an additional temporal dimension.\nInspired from 2D criss-cross attention used in segmentation task, we propose a\nrecurrent 3D criss-cross attention (RCCA-3D) module to model the dense\nlong-range spatiotemporal contextual information in video for action\nrecognition. The global context is factorized into sparse relation maps. We\nmodel the relationship between points in the same line along the direction of\nhorizon, vertical and depth at each time, which forms a 3D criss-cross\nstructure, and duplicate the same operation with recurrent mechanism to\ntransmit the relation between points in a line to a plane finally to the whole\nspatiotemporal space. Compared with the non-local method, the proposed RCCA-3D\nmodule reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs by 25% and 30% for video\ncontext modeling. We evaluate the performance of RCCA-3D with two latest action\nrecognition networks on three datasets and make a thorough analysis of the\narchitecture, obtaining the optimal way to factorize and fuse the relation\nmaps.

Taylor cones, which emit\ncharged droplets from the tip of a conical cusp, are among the most prominent\nand well-studied examples of EHD instabilities. In liquid-liquid systems, more\ncomplex interface deformation modes than simple Taylor cones can be observed,\nwith the interface being pushed away from the electrode, and additional cone\nstructures emerging from the rim of the dimple. In this article, we investigate\nthe mechanisms behind these deformation modes experimentally and numerically,\nand demonstrate that the presence of droplets triggers the dimple at the\ninterface. In order to characterize the underlying processes, we replace the\npin electrode by a hollow metallic needle with a prescribed electrolyte volume\nflow. The submerged electrospray introduces droplets of an aqueous KCl solution\nwith varying ion concentrations into silicone oils with varying viscosities. By\nmeasuring the corresponding electric current and by optical investigation of\nthe interface deformation, we study the system response to variations of the\nionic concentration, viscosity, applied voltage as well as flow rate. In\naddition to the experiments, we use a finite element solver and compute the\ncharge transport due to the droplets in the oil phase.

After\ncalibration of our model with particle tracking velocimetry data of the flow\ninside the oil phase, we reproduce the experimentally observed dimple at the\nliquid-liquid interface.

We have considered two versions of the shift-symmetric model,\none where the energy density of dark energy is given solely by the scalar\nfield, and another where it also has a contribution from the cosmological\nconstant. By including current data, we show how theoretical priors can be used\nto improve constraints by up to an order of magnitude.

The relevant\nmathematical tools are: (1) Geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the stochastic\nprocess representing evolution as the stochastic increase of the number of\nspecies living on Earth over the last 3.5 billion years. This GBM is well known\nin the mathematics of finances (Black-Sholes models). (2) The probability\ndistributions known as b-lognormals, i.e. lognormals starting at a certain\npositive instant b>0 rather than at the origin. In the framework of Darwinian\nEvolution, the resulting mathematical construction was shown to be what\nevolutionary biologists call Cladistics. (3) The (Shannon) entropy of such\nb-lognormals is then seen to represent the 'degree of progress' reached by each\nliving organism or by each big set of living organisms, like historic human\ncivilizations. (4) All these results also match with SETI in that the\nstatistical Drake equation (generalization of the ordinary Drake equation to\nencompass statistics) leads just to the lognormal distribution as the\nprobability distribution for the number of extra-terrestrial civilizations\nexisting in the Galaxy. (5) The well-known 'Molecular Clock of Evolution',\nnamely the 'constant rate of Evolution at the molecular level' as shown by\nKimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, identifies with growth rate of\nthe entropy of our Evo-SETI model.

Despite progress\nin developing data-driven deep learning approaches for converting low dynamic\nrange images to high dynamic range images, existing approaches are limited by\nthe assumption that all conversions are governed by the same nonlinear mapping.\nTo address this problem, we propose \"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for HDR Image\nReconstruction\" (MetaHDR), which applies meta-learning to the LDR-to-HDR\nconversion problem using existing HDR datasets. Our key novelty is the\nreinterpretation of LDR-to-HDR conversion scenes as independently sampled tasks\nfrom a common LDR-to-HDR conversion task distribution. Naturally, we use a\nmeta-learning framework that learns a set of meta-parameters which capture the\ncommon structure consistent across all LDR-to-HDR conversion tasks. Finally, we\nperform experimentation with MetaHDR to demonstrate its capacity to tackle\nchallenging LDR-to-HDR image conversions.

Constructed in a nondimensional form,\nthe model takes the effective wind angle of attack as lagged exogenous input\nand outputs a probability distribution of the forces.

The training input is designed as random harmonic motion consisting of\nvertical and rotational displacements. Once trained, the model can predict the\naerodynamic forces for both prescribed input motion and aeroelastic analysis.\nThe concept is first verified for a flat plate's analytical solution by\npredicting the self-excited forces and flutter velocity. Finally, the framework\nis applied to a streamlined and bluff bridge deck based on Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) data.

In less common but appropriate occasions as an alternative to X-rays\nor gammas, neutron radiation is used in oncological treatments or in imaging of\npatients. The following work is also potentially of interest to Radiation\nSafety Planners. Especially in regard to uses for neutron beams, we introduce\nand present a deterministic and semi-analytical method for doing transport\nanalysis on neutrons and which are judiciously set to be distributed into two\nenergy groups. There are advantages for doing such 2-group and higher\nmulti-group analysis of radiative particles (i.e. neutrons and photons). These\nadvantages are that we can more directly keep track of what percentages of\nradiative particles are close to the original high energy and how many are at\nsignificantly lower energy. For photons, the profile of any build-up function\nshows that the function is slightly larger than 1.0 at entry, then it rises to\nperhaps 2 or 3 within roughly one mean free path of the fast primary particles,\nand finally approaches the asymptote of 1.0 as the penetration depth gets\nprogressively larger.
