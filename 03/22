Behavioural strategies may determine where species are located and\nhow their interactions change the local environment arrangement. In response to\nstimuli in the environment, individuals may move in a specific direction\ninstead of walking randomly. This behaviour can be innate or learned from\nexperience, and allow the individuals to conquer or the maintain territory,\nforaging or taking refuge. We study a generalisation of the spatial\nrock-paper-scissors model where individuals of one out of the species may\nperform directional movement tactics. Running a series of stochastic\nsimulations, we investigate the effects of the behavioural tactics on the\nspatial pattern formation and the maintenance of the species diversity. We also\nexplore a more realistic scenario, where not all individuals are conditioned to\nperform the behavioural strategy or have different levels of neighbourhood\nperception. Our outcomes show that self-preservation behaviour is more\nprofitable in terms of territorial dominance, with the best result being\nachieved when all individuals are conditioned and have a long-range vicinity\nperception. On the other hand, invading is more advantageous if part of\nindividuals is conditioned and if they have short-range neighbourhood\nperception. Finally, our findings reveal that the self-defence strategy is the\nleast jeopardising to biodiversity which can help biologists to understand\npopulation dynamics in a setting where individuals may move strategically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 16:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

More than 40% of the\nquestions are about customization, i.e., developers frequently face challenges\nwith customizing user interfaces or services offered by LCSD platforms. The\ntopic \"Dynamic Event Handling\" under the \"Customization\" category is the most\npopular (in terms of average view counts per question of the topic) as well as\nthe most difficult. It means that developers frequently search for\ncustomization solutions such as how to attach dynamic events to a form in\nlow-code UI, yet most (75.9%) of their questions remain without an accepted\nanswer.

These complex non-Gaussian\nentangled states can be classified by the nonlinear squeezing parameter (NLSP),\nas a generalisation of the RSP with respect to nonlinear observables, and\nidentified via the Fisher information.

Using a 19-qubit programmable superconducting\nprocessor, here we report the characterisation of multiparticle entangled\nstates generated during its nonlinear dynamics. First, selecting 10 qubits, we\nmeasure the RSP and the NLSP by single-shot readouts of collective spin\noperators in several different directions.

A large\nrange of schemes for realizing the long-distance delivery of remote\nentanglement has been proposed, both for bipartite and multipartite\nentanglement. For assessing the viability of these schemes, knowledge of the\ntime at which entanglement is delivered is crucial. Specifically, if the\ncommunication task requires multiple remote-entangled quantum states and these\nstates are generated at different times by the scheme, the earlier states will\nneed to wait and thus their quality will decrease while being stored in an\n(imperfect) memory. For the remote-entanglement delivery schemes which are\nclosest to experimental reach, this time assessment is challenging, as they\nconsist of nondeterministic components such as probabilistic entanglement\nswaps. For many such protocols even the average time at which entanglement can\nbe distributed is not known exactly, in particular when they consist of\nfeedback loops and forced restarts. In this work, we provide improved\nanalytical bounds on the average and on the quantiles of the completion time of\nentanglement distribution protocols in the case that all network components\nhave success probabilities lower bounded by a constant. A canonical example of\nsuch a protocol is a nested quantum repeater scheme which consists of heralded\nentanglement generation and entanglement swaps.

Nevertheless, CuO- containing\nMBG of nitrates batch showed nuclei of metallic copper nanoparticles larger\nthan 50 nm and quicker in vitro bioactive responses. Thus, they were coated by\nan apatite-like layer after 24 h soaked in simulated body fluid, a remarkably\nshort period for MBG containing up to 5 % of CuO. A model, focused in the\ncopper location in the glass network, was proposed to relate nanostructure and\nin vitro behaviour. Moreover, after 24 h in MEM or THB culture media, all the\nMBG released therapeutic amounts of Ca2+ and Cu2+ ions. Because the quick\nbioactive response in SBF, the capacity to host biomolecules in their pores and\nto release therapeutic concentrations of Ca2+ and Cu2+ ions, MBG of the nitrate\nbatch are considered as excellent biomaterials for bone regeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 18:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

As such, they offer a fast and light-weight\nalternative to traditional localization schemes based on image retrieval. Pose\nregression approaches simultaneously learn two regression tasks, aiming to\njointly estimate the camera position and orientation using a single embedding\nvector computed by a convolutional backbone. We propose an attention-based\napproach for pose regression, where the convolutional activation maps are used\nas sequential inputs. Transformers are applied to encode the sequential\nactivation maps as latent vectors, used for camera pose regression. This allows\nus to pay attention to spatially-varying deep features. Using two Transformer\nheads, we separately focus on the features for camera position and orientation,\nbased on how informative they are per task.

In particular, we study the Bit Error Rate\n(BER) across interstellar distances with and without using the gravitational\nlens effect of the Sun (ref. [2]). The conclusion is that only when we will\nexploit the Sun as a gravitational lens we will be able to communicate with our\nown probes (or with nearby Aliens) across the distances of even the nearest\nstars to us in the Galaxy, and that at a reasonable Bit Error Rate. We also\nstudy the radio bridge between the Sun and any other Star that is made up by\nthe two gravitational lenses of both the Sun and that Star. The alignment for\nthis radio bridge to work is very strict, but the power-saving is enormous, due\nto the huge contributions of the two stars' lenses to the overall antenna gain\nof the system. We study a few cases in detail. Finally, we find the information\nchannel capacity for each of those radio bridges, putting thus a physical\nconstraint to the amount of information transfer that will be possible even by\nexploiting the stars as gravitational lenses\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 20:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

We study the effects that destabilise and stabilise\nthe flux tube of a simulated sunspot in the upper convection zone. The\ndepth-varying effects of fluting instability, buoyancy forces, and timescales\non the flux tube are analysed. The simulation was calculated with the MURaM\ncode. The domain has a lateral extension of 98 Mm x 98 Mm and extends almost 18\nMm below the solar surface. The analysed data set of 30 hours shows a stable\nsunspot at the solar surface. We studied the evolution of the flux tube at\nhorizontal layers by means of the relative change in perimeter and area with a\nlinear stability analysis. We find a corrugation along the perimeter of the\nflux tube that proceeds fastest at a depth of about 8 Mm below the surface.\nTowards the surface and towards deeper layers, the decrease in compactness is\ndamped. From the stability analysis, we find that above a depth of 2 Mm, the\nsunspot is stabilised by buoyancy forces. The spot is least stable at a depth\nof about 3 Mm because of fluting instability. The stability of the sunspot at\nthe surface affects the behaviour of the field lines in deeper layers by\nmagnetic tension. Therefore the fluting instability is damped at depths of\nabout 3 Mm, and the decrease in compactness is strongest at a depth of about 8\nMm. The more vertical orientation of the magnetic field and the longer\nconvective timescale slow down the corrugation process in layers deeper than 10\nMm. The formation of large intrusions of field-free plasma below the surface\ndestabilises the sunspot, and eventually lead to the disruption and decay of\nthe sunspot. This process is not visible at the surface, where the sunspot is\nstabilised by buoyancy forces. The onset of sunspot decay occurs in deeper\nlayers, while the sunspot still appears stable in the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 21:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

This\nassumption does not hold in real-world applications where the outlierness of\ndifferent entities is dependent on each other and/or taken from different\nprobability distributions (non-IID). This may lead to the failure of detecting\nimportant outliers that are too subtle to be identified without considering the\nnon-IID nature. The issue is even intensified in more challenging contexts,\ne.g., high-dimensional data with many noisy features. This work introduces a\nnovel outlier detection framework and its two instances to identify outliers in\ncategorical data by capturing non-IID outlier factors. Our approach first\ndefines and incorporates distribution-sensitive outlier factors and their\ninterdependence into a value-value graph-based representation. It then models\nan outlierness propagation process in the value graph to learn the outlierness\nof feature values. The learned value outlierness allows for either direct\noutlier detection or outlying feature selection.

However, it demands the time-consuming task of labeling the\nacquired data, prohibiting its fast deployment, specially in forensic\nscenarios. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) emerges as a promising\nalternative, as it performs feature-learning adaptation from a model trained on\na source to a target domain without identity-label annotation. However, most\nUDA-based algorithms rely upon a complex loss function with several\nhyper-parameters, which hinders the generalization to different scenarios.\nMoreover, as UDA depends on the translation between domains, it is important to\nselect the most reliable data from the unseen domain, thus avoiding error\npropagation caused by noisy examples on the target data -- an often overlooked\nproblem. In this sense, we propose a novel UDA-based ReID method that optimizes\na simple loss function with only one hyper-parameter and that takes advantage\nof triplets of samples created by a new offline strategy based on the diversity\nof cameras within a cluster. This new strategy adapts the model and also\nregularizes it, avoiding overfitting on the target domain.

Polynomial\ngraph filters (PGFs), defined as polynomials of a fundamental graph operator,\ncan be implemented in the vertex domain, and usually have a lower complexity\nthan frequency domain filter implementations. In this paper, we focus on the\ndesign of filters for graphs with graph Fourier transform (GFT) corresponding\nto a discrete trigonometric transform (DTT), i.e., one of 8 types of discrete\ncosine transforms (DCT) and 8 discrete sine transforms (DST). In this case, we\nshow that multiple sparse graph operators can be identified, which allows us to\npropose a generalization of PGF design: multivariate polynomial graph filter\n(MPGF). First, for the widely used DCT-II (type-2 DCT), we characterize a set\nof sparse graph operators that share the DCT-II matrix as their common\neigenvector matrix. This set contains the well-known connected line graph.\nThese sparse operators can be viewed as graph filters operating in the DCT\ndomain, which allows us to approximate any DCT graph filter by a MPGF, leading\nto a design with more degrees of freedom than the conventional PGF approach.\nThen, we extend those results to all of the 16 DTTs as well as their 2D\nversions, and show how their associated sets of multiple graph operators can be\ndetermined. We demonstrate experimentally that ideal low-pass and exponential\nDCT/DST filters can be approximated with higher accuracy with similar runtime\ncomplexity. Finally, we apply our method to transform-type selection in a video\ncodec, AV1, where we demonstrate significant encoding time savings, with a\nnegligible compression loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 01:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

For GBI and EI systems, the phase-stepping acquisition with multiple\nexposures at a constant fluence is usually adopted in the literature. This\nwork, however, attempts to challenge such a constant fluence concept during the\nphase-stepping process and proposes a fluence adaptation mechanism for dose\nreduction. Method: Recently, analytic multi-order moment analysis has been\nproposed to improve the computing efficiency. In these algorithms, multiple\ncontrasts can be calculated by summing together the weighted phase-stepping\ncurves (PSCs) with some kernel functions, which suggests us that the raw data\nat different steps have different contributions for the noise in retrieved\ncontrasts. Based on analytic retrieval formulas and the Gaussian noise model\nfor detected signals, we derived an optimal adaptive fluence distribution,\nwhich is proportional to the absolute weighting kernel functions and the root\nof original sample PSCs acquired under the constant fluence. Results: To\nvalidate our analyses, simulations and experiments are conducted for GBI and EI\nsystems. Simulated results demonstrate that the dose reduction ratio between\nour proposed fluence distributions and the typical constant one can be about\n20% for the phase contrast, which is consistent with our theoretical\npredictions. Although the experimental noise reduction ratios are a little\nsmaller than the theoretical ones, synthetic and real experiments both observe\nbetter noise performance by our proposed method. Our simulated results also\ngive out the effective ranges of the parameters of the PSCs, such as the\nvisibility in GBI, the standard deviation and the mean value in EI, providing a\nguidance for the use of our proposed approach in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 02:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

All our results presented here\nrely on: 1) observational evidence that the Sun lies near the corotation\ncircle, where stars rotate with the same angular velocity as the spiral-arm\npattern; the corotation circle establishes domains of the corotation resonance\n(CR) in the Galactic disk; 2) dynamical constraints that put the spiral-arm\npotential as the dominant perturbation in the SN, comparing with the effects of\nthe central bar in the SN; 3) a long-lived nature of the spiral structure,\npromoting a state of dynamical relaxing and phase-mixing of the stellar orbits\nin response to the spiral perturbation. With an analytical model for the\nGalactic potential, composed of an axisymmetric background deduced from the\nobserved rotation curve, and perturbed by a four-armed spiral pattern,\nnumerical simulations of stellar orbits are performed to delineate the domains\nof regular and chaotic motions shaped by the resonances. Such studies show that\nstars can be trapped inside the stable zones of the spiral CR, and this orbital\ntrapping mechanism could explain the dynamical origin of the Local arm of the\nMilky Way (MW). The spiral CR and the near high-order epicyclic resonances\ninfluence the velocity distribution in the SN, creating the observable\nstructures such as moving groups and their radially extended counterpart known\nas diagonal ridges. The Sun and most of the SN stars evolve inside a stable\nzone of the spiral CR, never crossing the main spiral-arm structure, but\noscillating in the region between the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus arms. This\norbital behavior of the Sun brings insights to our understanding of questions\nconcerning the solar system evolution, the Earth environment changes, and the\npreservation of life on Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 02:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

In particular, electron-hole pairs (excitons) in TMDCs\nare stable at room temperature and interact strongly with light. When TMDCs are\nembedded in an optical microcavity, the excitons can hybridise with cavity\nphotons to form exciton polaritons (polaritons herein), which display both\nultrafast velocities and strong interactions. The ability to manipulate and\ntrap polaritons on a microchip is critical for future applications. Here, we\ncreate a potential landscape for room-temperature polaritons in monolayer\nWS$_2$, and demonstrate their free propagation and trapping. We show that the\neffect of dielectric disorder, which restricts the diffusion of WS$_2$ excitons\nand broadens their spectral resonance, is dramatically reduced in the strong\nexciton-photon coupling regime leading to motional narrowing.

Moreover, the dephasing of\ntrapped polaritons is dramatically suppressed compared to both WS$_2$ excitons\nand free polaritons.

While $O(n^{2})$ mixing was\nalready known before, our approach additionally yields Chernoff-type\nconcentration bounds for Hamming Lipschitz functions in this regime, which was\nnot known before. Our approach is markedly different from prior works\nestablishing spectral independence for spin systems using spatial mixing\n\\cite{ALO20, CLV20, CGSV20, FGYZ20}, which crucially is still open in this\nregime for proper list-colorings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 06:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 07:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The quadruplet Pauli\nspin blockade, which is caused by the quadruplet and doublet states, occurs at\nlow temperatures affecting the transport properties. As the temperature\nincreases, the quadruplet Pauli spin blockade occurs as a result of the thermal\nenergy, even in regions where it does not occur at low temperatures. This is\nbecause the triplet state is formed in one dot as a result of the gradual\nchange of the Fermi distribution function of the electrodes with increasing\ntemperature. Moreover, the thermally assisted Pauli spin blockade results in\ncoexistence of the Coulomb and Pauli spin blockades.

This is the so-called resolution limit problem.\nCharacterization of this resolution limit is still a long-standing puzzle\ndespite the prevalent use of the classic Rayleigh limit. It is well-known that\nRayleigh limit is heuristic and its drawbacks become prominent when dealing\nwith data that is subjected to delicate processing, as is what modern\ncomputational imaging methods do. Therefore, more precise characterization of\nthe resolution limit becomes increasingly necessary with the development of\ndata processing methods.

However,\nthese methods suffer from the representation ambiguity for oriented object\ndefinition, which leads to suboptimal regression optimization and the\ninconsistency between the loss metric and the localization accuracy of the\npredictions. In this paper, we propose a Representation Invariance Loss (RIL)\nto optimize the bounding box regression for the rotating objects. Specifically,\nRIL treats multiple representations of an oriented object as multiple\nequivalent local minima, and hence transforms bounding box regression into an\nadaptive matching process with these local minima. Then, the Hungarian matching\nalgorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal regression strategy. We also propose\na normalized rotation loss to alleviate the weak correlation between different\nvariables and their unbalanced loss contribution in OBB representation.\nExtensive experiments on remote sensing datasets and scene text datasets show\nthat our method achieves consistent and substantial improvement.

At the community level, multiple species with such\nlong-lasting life stages can be more likely to coexist. While the implications\nof this process for biodiversity have been studied in terrestrial plants, seed\nbanks are usually neglected in phytoplankton multispecies dynamic models, in\nspite of widespread empirical evidence for such seed banks. In this study, we\nbuild a metacommunity model of interacting phytoplankton species, including a\nresting stage supplying the seed bank. The model is parameterized with\nempirically-driven growth rate functions and field-based interaction estimates,\nwhich include both facilitative and competitive interactions. Exchanges between\ncompartments (coastal pelagic cells, coastal resting cells on the seabed, and\nopen ocean pelagic cells) are controlled by hydrodynamical parameters to which\nthe sensitivity of the model is assessed. We consider two models, i.e., with\nand without a saturating effect of the interactions on the growth rates. Our\nresults are consistent between models, and show that a seed bank allows to\nmaintain all species in the community over 30 years. Indeed, a fraction of the\nspecies are vulnerable to extinction at specific times within the year, but\nthis process is buffered by their survival in their resting stage. We thus\nhighlight the potential role of the seed bank in the recurrent re-invasion of\nthe coastal community, and of coastal environments in re-seeding oceanic\nregions. Moreover, the seed bank enables populations to tolerate stronger\ninteractions within the community as well as more severe changes to the\nenvironment, such as those predicted in a climate change context.

However, due to the color of an object is\nsignificantly influenced by the color of the illumination, the existing\nresearches still suffer from the near-duplicate challenge, that is, the\nseparation becomes unstable when the illumination color is close to the surface\ncolor. In this paper, we derive a polarization guided model to incorporate the\npolarization information into a designed iteration optimization separation\nstrategy to separate the specular reflection. Based on the analysis of\npolarization, we propose a polarization guided model to generate a polarization\nchromaticity image, which is able to reveal the geometrical profile of the\ninput image in complex scenarios, such as diversity of illumination. The\npolarization chromaticity image can accurately cluster the pixels with similar\ndiffuse color. We further use the specular separation of all these clusters as\nan implicit prior to ensure that the diffuse components will not be mistakenly\nseparated as the specular components. With the polarization guided model, we\nreformulate the specular reflection separation into a unified optimization\nfunction which can be solved by the ADMM strategy.

We\ndecompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the\nintra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively. The intra-camera\ncomputation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation\nwithin each camera. Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the\nre-id model in a multi-branch network.

The more challenging the edge\narrival model has seen significant progress recently in the online algorithms\nliterature.

We start\nwith the general case in which a thin-shell separates the two spacetimes at the\nseparation hypersurface, for which the general junction conditions are deduced,\nand the particular case for smooth matching is considered when the\nstress-energy tensor of the thin-shell vanishes. The set of junction conditions\nis similar to the one previously obtained for $f\\left(R\\right)$ gravity but\nfeatures also constraints in the continuity of the trace of the stress-energy\ntensor $T_{ab}$ and its partial derivatives, which force the thin-shell to\nsatisfy the equation of state of radiation $\\sigma=2p_t$. As a consequence, a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for spherically symmetric thin-shells to\nsatisfy all the energy conditions is the positivity of its energy density\n$\\sigma$.

Brain surgery constitutes the first and decisive step for the\ntreatment of such tumors. It is extremely crucial to achieve complete tumor\nresection during surgery, however, this is a highly challenging task, as it is\nvery difficult to visually differentiate tumorous cells from the surrounding\nhealthy white matter. The nerve fiber bundles constitutive of the white matter\nare organized in such a way that they exhibit a certain degree of structural\nanisotropy and birefringence. The birefringence exhibited by such aligned\nfibrous tissue is known to be extremely sensitive to small pathological\nalterations. Indeed, highly aligned anisotropic fibers exhibit higher\nbirefringence than structures with weaker alignment and anisotropy, such as\ncancerous tissue. In this study, we performed experiments on thick coronal\nslices of a healthy human brain to explore the possibility of (i) measuring,\nwith a polarimetric microscope (employed in the backscattering geometry to\nfacilitate non-invasive diagnostics), the birefringence exhibited by the white\nmatter and (ii) relating the measured birefringence to the fiber orientation\nand the degree of alignment.

Fractionalized states\nof matter correspond to its deconfined phases, where the gauge field is\neffectively noncompact, while conventional broken-symmetry phases are\nassociated with confinement triggered by the proliferation of\nmonopole-instantons. While much attention has been devoted lately to the\nsymmetry classification of monopole operators in massless CQED$_3$ and related\n3D conformal field theories, explicit derivations of instanton dynamics in\nparton gauge theories with fermions have been lacking. In this work, we use\nsemiclassical methods analogous to those used by 't Hooft in the solution of\nthe $U(1)$ problem in 4D quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to explicitly demonstrate\nthe symmetry-breaking effect of instantons in CQED$_3$ with massive fermions,\nmotivated by a fermionic parton description of hard-core bosons on a lattice.\nBy contrast with the massless case studied by Marston, we find that massive\nfermions possess Euclidean zero modes exponentially localized to the center of\nthe instanton. Such Euclidean zero modes produce in turn an effective\nfour-fermion interaction -- known as the 't Hooft vertex in QCD -- which\nnaturally leads to two possible superfluid phases for the original microscopic\nbosons: a conventional single-particle condensate or an exotic boson pair\ncondensate without single-particle condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 10:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 06:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 07:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

When the aim is to solve such PDEs for a large\nnumber of parameter values, Reduced Basis Methods (RBM) are often used to\nreduce computational costs of a classical high fidelity code based on Finite\nElement Method (FEM), Finite Volume (FVM) or Spectral methods. The efficient\nimplementation of most of these RBM requires to modify this high fidelity code,\nwhich cannot be done, for example in an industrial context if the high fidelity\ncode is only accessible as a \"black-box\" solver. The Non Intrusive Reduced\nBasis method (NIRB) has been introduced in the context of finite elements as a\ngood alternative to reduce the implementation costs of these\nparameter-dependent problems. The method is efficient in other contexts than\nthe FEM one, like with finite volume schemes, which are more often used in an\nindustrial environment. In this case, some adaptations need to be done as the\ndegrees of freedom in FV methods have different meenings. At this time, error\nestimates have only been studied with FEM solvers. In this paper, we present a\ngeneralisation of the NIRB method to Finite Volume schemes and we show that\nestimates established for FEM solvers also hold in the FVM setting.

We propose a novel\nmethod for automatic separation of pulmonary arteries and veins from chest CT\nimages. The method consists of three parts. First, global connection\ninformation and local feature information are used to construct a complete\ntopological tree and ensure the continuity of vessel reconstruction. Second,\nthe Twin-Pipe network proposed can automatically learn the differences between\narteries and veins at different levels to reduce classification errors caused\nby changes in terminal vessel characteristics. Finally, the topology optimizer\nconsiders interbranch and intrabranch topological relationships to maintain\nspatial consistency to avoid the misclassification of A/V irrigations. We\nvalidate the performance of the method on chest CT images. Compared with manual\nclassification, the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 96.2% on\nnoncontrast chest CT. In addition, the method has been proven to have good\ngeneralization, that is, the accuracies of 93.8% and 94.8% are obtained for CT\nscans from other devices and other modes, respectively.

A fundamental challenge when analysing\nrecorded single particle trajectories is the inverse problem of inferring the\nphysical model or class of models of the underlying random walks. Reliable\ninference is made difficult by the inherent stochastic nature of single\nparticle motion, by experimental noise, and by the short duration of most\nexperimental trajectories. Model identification is further complicated by the\nfact that main physical properties of random walk models are only defined\nasymptotically, and are thus degenerate for short trajectories. Here, we\nintroduce a new, fast approach to inferring random walk properties based on\ngraph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach consists in associating a vector of\nfeatures with each observed position, and a sparse graph structure with each\nobserved trajectory. By performing simulation-based supervised learning on this\nconstruct [1], we show that we can reliably learn models of random walks and\ntheir anomalous exponents. The method can naturally be applied to trajectories\nof any length. We show its efficiency in analysing various anomalous random\nwalks of biological relevance that were proposed in the AnDi challenge [2]. We\nexplore how information is encoded in the GNN, and we show that it learns\nrelevant physical features of the random walks. We furthermore evaluate its\nability to generalize to types of trajectories not seen during training, and we\nshow that the GNN retains high accuracy even with few parameters. We finally\ndiscuss the possibility to leverage these networks to analyse experimental\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 11:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Our results strongly\nhighlight the importance of undertaking stringent measures along the entire\nelectoral process to minimize its epidemiological consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

To answer this question, we performed several simulations\nusing Babcock-Leighton type flux transport dynamo models with the\nstochastically forced source for the poloidal field ($\\alpha$ term). We show\nthat when the dynamo is operating near the critical dynamo transition or only\nweakly supercritical, the polar field of the cycle n determines the amplitude\nof the next several cycles (at least three). However, when the dynamo is\nsubstantially supercritical, this correlation of the polar field is reduced to\none cycle. This change in the memory of the polar field from multi- to\none-cycle with the increase of the super-criticality of the dynamo is\nindependent of the importance of various turbulent transport processes in the\nmodel. We further show that when the dynamo operates near the critical, it\nproduces frequent extended episodes of weaker activity, resembling the solar\ngrand minima. The occurrence of grand minima is accompanied by the multi-cycle\ncorrelation of polar field. The frequency of grand minima decreases with the\nincrease of supercriticality of the dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 09:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Temporal network data often\nconsist in a succession of static networks over consecutive time windows whose\nlength, however, is arbitrary, not necessarily corresponding to any intrinsic\ntimescale of the system. Moreover, the resulting view of social network\nevolution is unsatisfactory: short time windows contain little information,\nwhereas aggregating over large time windows blurs the dynamics. Going from a\ntemporal network to a meaningful evolving representation of a social network\ntherefore remains a challenge. Here we introduce a framework to that purpose:\ntransforming temporal network data into an evolving weighted network where the\nweights of the links between individuals are updated at every interaction. Most\nimportantly, this transformation takes into account the interdependence of\nsocial relationships due to the finite attention capacities of individuals:\neach interaction between two individuals not only reinforces their mutual\nrelationship but also weakens their relationships with others. We study a\nconcrete example of such a transformation and apply it to several data sets of\nsocial interactions. Using temporal contact data collected in schools, we show\nhow our framework highlights specificities in their structure and temporal\norganization. We then introduce a synthetic perturbation into a data set of\ninteractions in a group of baboons to show that it is possible to detect a\nperturbation in a social group on a wide range of timescales and parameters.\nOur framework brings new perspectives to the analysis of temporal social\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 08:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

The\ngravitational stability of threads, in the absence of non-ideal effects, is\ncomprehensively investigated in the present work by means of an elementary but\neffective model. Based on purely hydrodynamic equations in one spatial\ndimension and applying line-tying conditions at the footpoints of the magnetic\nfield lines, we derive analytical expressions for the different feasible\nequilibria and the corresponding frequencies of oscillation. We find that the\nsystem allows for stable and unstable equilibrium solutions subject to the\ninitial position of the thread, its density contrast and length, and the total\nlength of the magnetic field lines. The transition between the two types of\nsolutions is produced at specific bifurcation points that have been determined\nanalytically in some particular cases. When the thread is initially at the top\nof the concave magnetic field, that is at the apex, we find a supercritical\npitchfork bifurcation, while for a shifted initial thread position with respect\nto this point the symmetry is broken and the system is characterised by an\nS-shaped bifurcation. The plain results presented in this paper shed new light\non the behaviour of threads in curved magnetic fields under the presence of\ngravity and help to interpret more complex numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nsimulations about similar structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

We answer this question\naffirmatively by showing that improving a model can deteriorate the performance\nof downstream models, even after those downstream models are retrained. Such\nself-defeating improvements are the result of entanglement between the models\nin the system. We perform an error decomposition of systems with multiple\nmachine-learning models, which sheds light on the types of errors that can lead\nto self-defeating improvements.

One of the bands has a net attractive interaction ($J_d$) that is\nresponsible for SC. The model includes on-site Coulomb repulsion between\nquasi-particles in different bands ($U_{dc}$) and the hybridization ($V$)\nbetween them. We are interested in describing inter-metallic systems with a\n$d$-band of moderately correlated electrons, for which a mean-field\napproximation is adequate, coexisting with a large $sp$-band. For simplicity,\nall interactions and the hybridization $V$ are considered site-independent. We\nobtain the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian numerically and minimize the free\nenergy density with respect to the relevant parameters to obtain the phase\ndiagrams as function of $J_d$, $U_{dc}$, $V$, composition ($n_{\\mathrm{tot}}$)\nand the relative depth of the bands ($\\epsilon_{d0}$). We consider two types of\nsuperconducting ground states coexisting with the CDW. One is a homogeneous\nground state and the other is a pair density wave where the SC order parameter\nhas the same spatial modulation of the CDW. Our results show that the CDW and\nSC orders compete, but depending on the parameters of the model these phases\nmay coexist. The model reproduces most of the experimental features of high\ndimensionality ($d>1$) metals with competing CDW and SC states, including the\nexistence of first and second-order phase transitions in their phase diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Recently, there are some works trying to speed up the\nskeleton modeling by designing light-weight modules. However, in addition to\nthe model size, the amount of the data involved in the calculation is also an\nimportant factor for the running speed, especially for the skeleton data where\nmost of the joints are redundant or non-informative to identify a specific\nskeleton. Besides, previous works usually employ one fix-sized model for all\nthe samples regardless of the difficulty of recognition, which wastes\ncomputations for easy samples. To address these limitations, a novel approach,\ncalled AdaSGN, is proposed in this paper, which can reduce the computational\ncost of the inference process by adaptively controlling the input number of the\njoints of the skeleton on-the-fly. Moreover, it can also adaptively select the\noptimal model size for each sample to achieve a better trade-off between\naccuracy and efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging\ndatasets, namely, NTU-60, NTU-120 and SHREC, to verify the superiority of the\nproposed approach, where AdaSGN achieves comparable or even higher performance\nwith much lower GFLOPs compared with the baseline method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Although it\nhas long been the dream of economists to stabilize the buying power of the\nmonetary units, the goal we have honest money always broken since the central\nbank depreciate the currency without limit. From the point of view of modern\nlogistics, the key functions of money are the store of value and low logistics\n(circulation and warehouse) cost. Although commodity money (such as gold and\nsilver) has the advantages of a wealth store, its disadvantage is the high\nlogistics cost. In comparison to commodity money, credit currency and digital\ncurrency cannot protect wealth from loss over a long period while their\nlogistics costs are negligible. We proved that there is not such honest money\nfrom the perspective of logistics costs, which is both the store of value like\nprecious metal and without logistics costs in circulation like digital\ncurrency. The reason hidden in the back of the depreciation of banknotes is the\nblack hole of storage charge of the anchor overtime after digitizing commodity\nmoney. Accordingly, it is not difficult to infer the inevitable collapse of the\nBretton woods system. Therefore, we introduce a brand-new currency named honest\ndevalued stable-coin and built a attenuation model of intrinsic value of the\nhonest money based on the change mechanism of storage cost of anchor assets,\nlike gold, which will lay the theoretical foundation for a stable monetary\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

In metrology,\nthe dynamic range is a basic quality of a metric tool, indicating its\nflexibility to accommodate various scales. Larger dynamic range offers higher\nflexibility. In visual recognition, the multiple scale problem also exist.\nDifferent visual concepts may have different semantic scales. For example,\n``Animal'' and ``Plants'' have a large semantic scale while ``Elk'' has a much\nsmaller one. Under a small semantic scale, two different elks may look quite\n\\emph{different} to each other . However, under a large semantic scale (\\eg,\nanimals and plants), these two elks should be measured as being \\emph{similar}.\n%We argue that such flexibility is also important for deep metric learning,\nbecause different visual concepts indeed correspond to different semantic\nscales.\n  Introducing the dynamic range to deep metric learning, we get a novel\ncomputer vision task, \\ie, the Dynamic Metric Learning. It aims to learn a\nscalable metric space to accommodate visual concepts across multiple semantic\nscales. Based on three types of images, \\emph{i.e.}, vehicle, animal and online\nproducts, we construct three datasets for Dynamic Metric Learning. We benchmark\nthese datasets with popular deep metric learning methods and find Dynamic\nMetric Learning to be very challenging. The major difficulty lies in a conflict\nbetween different scales: the discriminative ability under a small scale\nusually compromises the discriminative ability under a large one, and vice\nversa. As a minor contribution, we propose Cross-Scale Learning (CSL) to\nalleviate such conflict. We show that CSL consistently improves the baseline on\nall the three datasets.

Temperature dependence of the superfluid\ndensity and electronic specific heat can be described by two-gap $s$-wave\nsuperconductivity, consistent with the presence of multiple Fermi surfaces in\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$. These results evidence nodeless superconductivity in\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$ under ambient pressure, and constrain the allowed pairing\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 13:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

To combat it, technology companies are increasingly identifying and\nsanctioning `hateful users' rather than simply moderating hateful content. Yet,\nmost research in online hate detection to date has focused on hateful content.\nThis paper examines how fairer and more accurate hateful user detection systems\ncan be developed by incorporating social network information through geometric\ndeep learning. Geometric deep learning dynamically learns information-rich\nnetwork representations and can generalise to unseen nodes. This is essential\nfor moving beyond manually engineered network features, which lack scalability\nand produce information-sparse network representations. This paper compares the\naccuracy of geometric deep learning with other techniques which either exclude\nnetwork information or incorporate it through manual feature engineering (e.g.,\nnode2vec). It also evaluates the fairness of these techniques using the\n`predictive equality' criteria, comparing the false positive rates on a subset\nof 136 African-American users with 4836 other users. Geometric deep learning\nproduces the most accurate and fairest classifier, with an AUC score of 90.8\\%\non the entire dataset and a false positive rate of zero among the\nAfrican-American subset for the best performing model. This highlights the\nbenefits of more effectively incorporating social network features in automated\nhateful user detection. Such an approach is also easily operationalized for\nreal-world content moderation as it has an efficient and scalable design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 13:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

An approach with stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\ncalled SGD-influence to calculate the influence scores was proposed, but, the\ncalculation costs are expensive. It is necessary to temporally store the\nparameters of the model during training phase for inference phase to calculate\ninfluence sores. In close connection with the previous method, we propose a\nmethod to reduce cache files to store the parameters in training phase for\ncalculating inference score. We only adopt the final parameters in last epoch\nfor influence functions calculation. In our experiments on classification, the\ncache size of training using MNIST dataset with our approach is 1.236 MB. On\nthe other hand, the previous method used cache size of 1.932 GB in last epoch.\nIt means that cache size has been reduced to 1/1,563. We also observed the\naccuracy improvement by data cleansing with removal of negatively influential\ndata using our approach as well as the previous method.

In this\npaper, we consider automating the search space design to minimize human\ninterference, which however faces two challenges: the explosive complexity of\nthe exploration space and the expensive computation cost to evaluate the\nquality of different search spaces. To solve them, we propose a novel\ndifferentiable evolutionary framework named AutoSpace, which evolves the search\nspace to an optimal one with following novel techniques: a differentiable\nfitness scoring function to efficiently evaluate the performance of cells and a\nreference architecture to speedup the evolution procedure and avoid falling\ninto sub-optimal solutions. The framework is generic and compatible with\nadditional computational constraints, making it feasible to learn specialized\nsearch spaces that fit different computational budgets. With the learned search\nspace, the performance of recent NAS algorithms can be improved significantly\ncompared with using previously manually designed spaces.

Acoustic\nfast-mode imbalances of the order of the slower dynamics can be negated by\nemploying a blended numerical model with seamless access to the compressible\nand the soundproof pseudo-incompressible dynamics. Here, the blended modelling\nstrategy by Benacchio et al., MWR, vol. 142 (2014) is upgraded in an advanced\nnumerical framework and extended with a Bayesian local ensemble data\nassimilation method. Upon assimilation of data, the model configuration is\nswitched to the pseudo-incompressible regime for one time-step. After that, the\nmodel configuration is switched back to the compressible model for the duration\nof the assimilation window. The switching between model regimes is repeated for\neach subsequent assimilation window. An improved blending strategy for the\nnumerical model ensures that a single time-step in the pseudo-incompressible\nregime is sufficient to suppress imbalances coming from the initialisation and\ndata assimilation. This improvement is based on three innovations: (i) the\nassociation of pressure fields computed at different stages of the numerical\nintegration with actual time levels; (ii) a conversion of pressure-related\nvariables between the model regimes derived from low Mach number asymptotics;\nand (iii) a judicious selection of the pressure variables used in converting\nnumerical model states when a switch of models occurs.

The number of free parameters scales exponentially with\nrespect to the number of random variables. Hence, most work on nonparametric\nPMF estimation is based on some structural assumptions such as clique\nfactorization adopted by probabilistic graphical models, imposition of low rank\non the joint probability tensor and reconstruction from 3-way or 2-way\nmarginals, etc. In the present work, we link random projections of data to the\nproblem of PMF estimation using ideas from tomography.

We provide a\nnovel algorithm for recovering factors of the tensor from one-way marginals,\ntest it across a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, and also perform\nMAP inference on the estimated model for classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 14:00:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

A Bayesian\nanalysis yields estimates of the mass of the host star, $M_{\\rm host} =\n0.61_{-0.24}^{+0.29}~M_\\odot$, the mass of its planet, $M_{\\rm planet} =\n2.48_{-0.98}^{+1.19}~M_{\\oplus}$, the projected planet-host separation,\n$a_\\perp = 3.4_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ au, and the lens distance of $D_{\\rm L} =\n6.8_{-0.9}^{+0.6}$ kpc. The discovery of this very low mass-ratio planet\nillustrates the utility of our method and opens a new window for a large and\nhomogeneous sample to study the microlensing planet-host mass-ratio function\ndown to $q \\sim 10^{-5}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 14:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 17:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

To\nrecover from high uncertainty cases, the robot monitors its uncertainty along a\ntrajectory and explores possible actions in the state-action space to bring\nitself to a more certain state.

In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution\nneural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional\nlayers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More\nspecifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by\nthe attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention\nmaps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In\nother words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep\nViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the\nself-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation\nlearning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on\nabove observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named\nRe-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at\ndifferent layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed\nmethod makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance\nimprovements via minor modification to existing ViT models.

Challenges of exoskeletons motor intent\ndecoding schemes remain in making a continuous prediction to compensate for the\nhysteretic response caused by mechanical transmission. In this paper, we solve\nthis problem by proposing an ahead of time continuous prediction of lower limb\nkinematics, with the prediction of knee angles during level walking as a case\nstudy. Firstly, an end-to-end kinematics prediction network(KinPreNet),\nconsisting of a feature extractor and an angle predictor, is proposed and\nexperimentally compared with features and methods traditionally used in\nahead-of-time prediction of gait phases. Secondly, inspired by the\nelectromechanical delay(EMD), we further explore our algorithm's capability of\ncompensating response delay of mechanical transmission by validating the\nperformance of the different sections of prediction time. And we experimentally\nreveal the time boundary of compensating the hysteretic response. Thirdly, a\ncomparison of employing EMG signals or not is performed to reveal the EMG and\nkinematic signals collaborated contributions to the continuous prediction.\nDuring the experiments, EMG signals of nine muscles and knee angles calculated\nfrom inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals are recorded from ten healthy\nsubjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of continuously\npredicting lower-limb kinematics in an ahead-of-time manner based on the\nelectromechanical delay (EMD).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 14:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

To be effective, these algorithms often require accurate\nsegmentation of the region of interest, such as the fetal brain in suspected\npathological cases. In the case of Spina Bifida, Ebner, Wang et al.\n(NeuroImage, 2020) combined their SRR algorithm with a 2-step segmentation\npipeline (2D localisation followed by a 2D segmentation network). However, if\nthe localisation step fails, the second network is not able to recover a\ncorrect brain mask, thus requiring manual corrections for an effective SRR. In\nthis work, we aim at improving the fetal brain segmentation for SRR in Spina\nBifida. We hypothesise that a well-trained single-step UNet can achieve\naccurate performance, avoiding the need of a 2-step approach. We propose a new\ntool for fetal brain segmentation called MONAIfbs, which takes advantage of the\nMedical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) framework.
