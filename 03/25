We show that both interaction between susceptible\nand infected individuals and the imitation of opinions concerning safe sex\npractices between individuals in favor of using such practices and those\nopposed to them leads to a phase transition. If the parameters of the epidemic\nare in the supercritical state, corresponding to an unlimited growth of\ninfection, the interaction parameter of the sociological debate must also be in\nthe supercritical state to control the spread of infection, and bring the\nsystem to criticality.\n  Adopting a theoretical perspective like that of multilayer complex networks,\nwe study the case where the epidemic network is under the influence of the\nabove-mentioned sociological debate. We show that at criticality this debate\ngenerates clusters of individuals in favor of safe sex practices and clusters\nof individuals opposing their use. We study the influence of a sociological\ndebate on whether to use safe sex or not, on the spreading of sexually\ntransmitted infections. We show that due to this debate in the epidemic network\na pattern mirroring the structures of the sociological network appears.\n  Finally, we introduce a feedback of the epidemic network on the sociological\nnetwork and prove that due to this feedback the sociological system undergoes a\nprocess of self-organization keeping it at criticality. We hope that these\nresults have the effect of giving interesting suggestions to behavioral\npsychologists and information scientists actively involved in the analysis of\nthe social debate on the moral issues connected to sexual activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 16:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

Many group variable\nselection methods are developed to select the groups of predictors that are\nclosely related to the continuous or categorical response. These existing\nmethods usually assume the group structures are well known. For example,\nvariables with similar practical meaning, or dummy variables created by\ncategorical data. However, in practice, it is impractical to know the exact\ngroup structure, especially when the variable dimensional is large. As a\nresult, the group variable selection results may be selected. To solve the\nchallenge, we propose a two-stage approach that combines a variable clustering\nstage and a group variable stage for the group variable selection problem. The\nvariable clustering stage uses information from the data to find a group\nstructure, which improves the performance of the existing group variable\nselection methods. For ultrahigh dimensional data, where the predictors are\nmuch larger than observations, we incorporated a variable screening method in\nthe first stage and shows the advantages of such an approach. In this article,\nwe compared and discussed the performance of four existing group variable\nselection methods under different simulation models, with and without the\nvariable clustering stage.

The aim of the present letter is to propose a mechanism\nthat can explain the origin of such giant planets. We investigate the formation\nof giant planets in a rapidly dissipating disk using N-body simulations that\nconsider pebble accretion. The results show that although the pebble isolation\nmass is smaller than the metal mass (> 30 Earth masses) in some giant planets,\nthe interior metal mass can be increased by giant impacts between planets with\nthe isolation mass. Regarding the metal fraction, the cores accrete massive\nenvelopes by runaway gas accretion during the disk-dissipation phase of 1-10\nMyr in a disk that evolves without photoevaporation. Although a large fraction\nof the envelope can be lost during giant impacts, the planets can reaccrete the\nenvelope after impacts in a slowly dissipating disk. Here, we demonstrate that,\nby photoevaporation in a rapidly dissipating disk, the runaway gas accretion is\nquenched in the middle, resulting in the formation of giant planets with large\nmetal-mass fractions. The origins of HD 149026b and TOI-849b, which are\ncharacterized by their large metal-mass fractions, can be naturally explained\nby a model that considers a disk evolving with photoevaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 17:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

On one of the boundary of the\nphase transition, it is easy to learn the sign of LATE and on the other side of\nthe boundary, it is impossible to learn the sign of LATE. Unfortunately, the\nimpossible side of the phase transition includes data-generating processes\nunder which the proportion of defiers tends to zero. This boundary of phase\ntransition is explicitly characterized in the case of binary outcomes. Outside\na special case, it is impossible to test whether the data-generating process is\non the nice side of the boundary. However, in the special case that the\nnon-compliance is almost one-sided, such a test is possible. We also provide\nsimple alternatives to monotonicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 17:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

To give spatial\napproximations of these random fields, they are discretized. Then, different\ntechniques of geostatistical inversion are used to condition them on\nmeasurement data. Among these techniques, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechniques stand out, because they yield asymptotically unbiased conditional\nrealizations. However, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer\nthe curse of dimensionality when refining the discretization. This means that\ntheir efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of discretization\ncells. Several MCMC approaches have been developed such that the MCMC\nefficiency does not depend on the discretization of the random field. The\npre-conditioned Crank Nicolson Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pCN-MCMC) and the\nsequential Gibbs (or block-Gibbs) sampling are two examples. In this paper, we\nwill present a combination of the pCN-MCMC and the sequential Gibbs sampling.\nOur algorithm, the sequential pCN-MCMC, will depend on two tuning-parameters:\nthe correlation parameter $\\beta$ of the pCN approach and the block size\n$\\kappa$ of the sequential Gibbs approach. The original pCN-MCMC and the Gibbs\nsampling algorithm are special cases of our method. We present an algorithm\nthat automatically finds the best tuning-parameter combination ($\\kappa$ and\n$\\beta$) during the burn-in-phase of the algorithm, thus choosing the best\npossible hybrid between the two methods. In our test cases, we achieve a\nspeedup factors of $1-5.5$ over pCN and of $1-6.5$ over Gibbs.

The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which we take as the\nlightest neutralino, can furthermore account for the observed Dark Matter (DM)\ncontent of the universe via coannihilation with the next-to-LSP (NLSP), while\nbeing in agreement with negative results from Direct Detection (DD)\nexperiments. Concerning the unsuccessful searches for EW superparticles at the\nLHC, owing to relatively small production cross-sections, a comparably light EW\nsector of the MSSM is in full agreement with the experimental data. The DM\nrelic density can fully be explained by a mixed bino/wino LSP. Here we take the\nrelic density as an upper bound, which opens up the possibility of wino and\nhiggsino DM. We first analyze which mass ranges of neutralinos, charginos and\nscalar leptons are in agreement with all experimental data, including relevant\nLHC searches. We find roughly an upper limit of ~ 600 GeV for the LSP and NLSP\nmasses. In a second step we assume that the new result of the Run 1 of the\n'MUON G-2' collaboration at Fermilab yields a precision comparable to the\nexisting experimental result with the same central value. We analyze the\npotential impact of the combination of the Run 1 data with the existing muon\ng-2 data on the allowed MSSM parameter space. We find that in this case the\nupper limits on the LSP and NLSP masses are substantially reduced by roughly\n100 GeV.

High spatial variation in\nparticle packing density, driven by the stochastic nature of the spreading\nprocess, impedes optical interrogation of these layer attributes. Thus, we\npresent transmission X-ray imaging as a method for directly mapping the\neffective depth of powder layers at process-relevant scale and resolution.\nSpecifically, we study layers of nominal 50-250 micrometer thickness, created\nby spreading a selection of commercially obtained Ti-6Al-4V, 316 SS, and\nAl-10Si-Mg powders into precision-depth templates. We find that powder layer\npacking fraction may be predicted from a combination of the relative thickness\nof the layer as compared to mean particle size, and flowability assessed by\nmacroscale powder angle of repose. Power spectral density analysis is\nintroduced as a tool for quantification of defect severity as a function of\nmorphology, and enables separate consideration of layer uniformity and\nsparsity. Finally, spreading is studied using multi-layer templates, providing\ninsight into how particles interact with both previously deposited material and\nabrupt changes in boundary condition.

This prediction assumes that test particles have fixed\nrest mass and follow timelike geodesics in the MK metric in the vacuum region\nexterior to a spherically-symmetric representation of the galactic mass\ndistribution. Such geodesics are not conformally invariant, however, which\nleads to an apparent discrepancy with the analogous calculation performed in\nthe conformally-equivalent Schwarzschild-de-Sitter (SdS) metric, where the\nlatter does not predict flat rotation curves. This difference arises since the\nmass of particles in CG must instead be generated dynamically through\ninteraction with a scalar field. The energy-momentum of this required scalar\nfield means that, in a general conformal frame from the equivalence class of CG\nsolutions outside a static, spherically-symmetric matter distribution, the\nspacetime is not given by the MK vacuum solution. A unique frame does exist,\nhowever, for which the metric retains the MK form, since the scalar field\nenergy-momentum vanishes despite the field being non-zero and radially\ndependent. Nonetheless, we show that in both this MK frame and the Einstein\nframe, in which the scalar field is constant, massive particles follow timelike\ngeodesics of the SdS metric, thereby resolving the apparent frame dependence of\nphysical predictions and unambiguously yielding rotation curves with no flat\nregion.

Once these wall-models are, however, applied to a\nvery coarse near-wall WMLES mesh, in which a portion of the turbulent boundary\nlayer's outer region dynamics is treated in a Reynolds-averaged manner as well,\nlarge-scale horizontal shifts in the wake's orientation are no longer detected.\nThis suggests larger-scale flow structures found within the turbulent boundary\nlayer's outer domain are responsible for generating the critical amount of flow\nintermittency needed to trigger a bimodal switching event. By looking at mean\nflow structures, instantaneous flow features and their associated turbulent\nkinetic energy (TKE) production, it becomes clear that the front separation\nbubbles just aft of the Ahmed body nose generate high levels of TKE through the\nshedding of large hairpin vortices. Only in the reference WRLES and\n(relatively) fine near-wall mesh WMLES simulations are these features present,\nexemplifying their importance in triggering a bimodal event. This motivates\nstudies on the suppression of wake bimodality by acting upon the front\nseparation bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 21:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Narrowband photometry was obtained on nine epochs from\n2018 October through 2019 March as well as 10 epochs during the 1991, 1997, and\n2008 apparitions. The ensemble photometry reveals a typical composition and a\nsecular decrease in activity since 1991. Production rates were roughly\nsymmetric around perihelion for the carbon-bearing species (CN, C$_3$, and\nC$_2$), but steeper for OH and NH outbound. Our imaging program emphasized CN,\nwhose coma morphology and lightcurve yielded rotation periods reported in a\ncompanion paper (Farnham et al., PSJ, 2, 7). Here, we compare the gas and dust\nmorphology on the 18 nights for which observations of additional species were\nobtained. The carbon-bearing species exhibited similar morphology that varied\nwith rotation. OH and NH had broad, hemispheric brightness enhancements in the\ntailward direction that did not change significantly with rotation, which we\nattribute to their originating from a substantial icy grain component. We\nconstructed a Monte Carlo model that replicates the shape, motion, and\nbrightness distribution of the CN coma throughout the apparition with a single,\nself-consistent solution in principal axis rotation.

However, the representation learning for a group is most\ncomplex beyond the fusion of group member representation, as the personal\npreferences and group preferences may be in different spaces. In addition, the\nlearned user representation is not accurate due to the sparsity of users'\ninteraction data. Moreover, the group similarity in terms of common group\nmembers has been overlooked, which however has the great potential to improve\nthe group representation learning. In this work, we focus on addressing the\nabove challenges in group representation learning task, and devise a\nhierarchical hyperedge embedding-based group recommender, namely HyperGroup.\nSpecifically, we propose to leverage the user-user interactions to alleviate\nthe sparsity issue of user-item interactions, and design a GNN-based\nrepresentation learning network to enhance the learning of individuals'\npreferences from their friends' preferences, which provides a solid foundation\nfor learning groups' preferences.

We\ninvestigate the extension of Goldstone's theorem and the Higgs mechanism, which\nwe demonstrate to work in the conventional fashion in the CPT symmetric regime,\nbut which needs to be modified technically at the standard exceptional points\nof the mass spectrum and entirely fails at what we refer to as zero exceptional\npoints as well as in the broken CPT-symmetric regime. In the full non-Hermitian\nnon-Abelian gauge theory we identify the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopoles by means of\na fourfold Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We investigate this\nlimit further for other types of non-Hermitian field theories in 1+1 dimensions\nthat possess complex super-exponential and inverse hyperbolic kink/anti-kink\nsolutions and for 3+1 dimensional Skyrme models for which we find new types of\ncomplex solutions, that all have real energies due to the presence of different\ntypes of CPT-symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 23:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 21:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

Based on this mathematical modeling, we\npropose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly\ndetect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into\nnormal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out\nextensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of\n20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as\nwell as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system\ndetects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds\nsince the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a\nprobability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep\nmovements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show\nthe great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal\nseizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their\ncaregivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 01:44:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 23:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

In this paper, we demonstrate that\nthe learning paradigm for SSL should be different from supervised learning and\nthe information encoded by the contrastive loss is expected to be much less\nthan that encoded in the labels in supervised learning via the cross entropy\nloss.

This is induced by a novel kind of meson endowed with\nboth spin and isospin degrees of freedom. The interactions in the strongly\ncoupled quark-gluon system are governed by the topological winding number of\nthe monopoles, which is an odd integer to ensure that the overall wave function\nis antisymmetric. The states of the quark-gluon plasma and the nucleons are\nthus uniquely determined by the combination of the monopole winding number m\nand the total quark number N.

However,\nthe optimization objective of such domain alignment is generally not\ncoordinated with that of the object classification task itself such that their\ndescent directions for optimization may be inconsistent. This will reduce the\neffectiveness of domain alignment in improving the performance of UDA. In this\npaper, we aim to study and alleviate the optimization inconsistency problem\nbetween the domain alignment and classification tasks. We address this by\nproposing an effective meta-optimization based strategy dubbed MetaAlign, where\nwe treat the domain alignment objective and the classification objective as the\nmeta-train and meta-test tasks in a meta-learning scheme. MetaAlign encourages\nboth tasks to be optimized in a coordinated way, which maximizes the inner\nproduct of the gradients of the two tasks during training.

Over the last two decades,\nnetwork sizes have continued to grow. The popularity of BFS has brought with it\na need for significantly faster traversals. Thus, BFS algorithms have been\ndesigned to exploit shared-memory and shared-nothing systems -- this includes\nalgorithms for accelerators such as the GPU. GPUs offer extremely fast\ntraversals at the cost of processing smaller graphs due to their limited memory\nsize. In contrast, CPU shared-memory systems can scale to graphs with several\nbillion edges but do not have enough compute resources needed for fast\ntraversals.

Most of the existing methods for\nfeature alignment in few-shot learning only consider image-level or\nspatial-level alignment while omitting the channel disparity. Our insight is\nthat these methods would lead to poor adaptation with redundant matching, and\nleveraging channel-wise adjustment is the key to well adapting the learned\nknowledge to new classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to learn a\ndynamic alignment, which can effectively highlight both query regions and\nchannels according to different local support information.

The filter\nis used to align the query feature with position-specific and channel-specific\nknowledge.

In such a sense our model is\nable to better capture fine-grained semantic context of the few-shot example\nand thus facilitates dynamical knowledge adaptation for few-shot learning.

The internal blocks\nwithin such systems are restricted only to be causal mappings, but are allowed\nto be non-linear, stochastic and time varying. These blocks can for example\nrepresent source encoders, decoders or even communication channels. Moreover,\nthe involved signals can be arbitrarily distributed. Our first main result\nrelates mutual and directed informations and can be interpreted as a law of\nconservation of information flow. Our second main result is a pair of\ndata-processing inequalities (one the conditional version of the other) between\nnested pairs of random sequences entirely within the closed loop. Our third\nmain result is introducing and characterizing the notion of in-the-loop (ITL)\ntransmission rate for channel coding scenarios in which the messages are\ninternal to the loop. Interestingly, in this case the conventional notions of\ntransmission rate associated with the entropy of the messages and of channel\ncapacity based on maximizing the mutual information between the messages and\nthe output turn out to be inadequate. Instead, as we show, the ITL transmission\nrate is the unique notion of rate for which a channel code attains zero error\nprobability if and only if such ITL rate does not exceed the corresponding\ndirected information rate from messages to decoded messages. We apply our\ndata-processing inequalities to show that the supremum of achievable (in the\nusual channel coding sense) ITL transmission rates is upper bounded by the\nsupremum of the directed information rate across the communication channel.\nMoreover, we present an example in which this upper bound is attained.

With the Fourier\npseudo-spectral spatial discretization, the scheme conserves the first and\nthird invariant quantities (momentum and energy) exactly in the space-time full\ndiscrete sense. The discrete mass possesses the precision of the spectral\naccuracy. Our numerical experiment shows the great efficiency of this scheme in\nsimulating the breathers for the mKdV equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 04:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 04:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 20:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Then, the related articles are summarized\nbased on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by\nmethodologies. Moreover, commonly used image processing methods for\nmicroorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological\npoints. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this\npaper provides new ideas for the future development trend of microorganism\ncounting, and provides systematic suggestions for implementing integrated\nmicroorganism counting systems in the future. Researchers in other fields can\nrefer to the techniques analyzed in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 06:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:32:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 07:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

This\nperennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory\nand/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the\nforefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network\nmodels in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas.\nMoving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer\nvalues represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the\nmemory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x\nto 8x are often realized in practice in these applications.

We provide a paradigm to\nresolve those two problems potentially existing in the PQ symmetry breaking\nscenario, with keeping successful axion relaxation for the QCD strong CP phase.\nThe proposed theory includes an axicolor dynamics with the axicolored fermions\npartially gauged by the QCD color, and is shown to be governed by an\nasymptotically safe (AS) fixed point: quantum scale invariance is built. The AS\naxicolor is actually a ``walking\" dynamics, which dynamically breaks a PQ\nsymmetry, a part of the chiral symmetry carried by the axicolored fermions.

In this article we\ndescribe for the first time how the polaron transformation can be applied in\nthe context of the \"Hierarchical Equations of Motion\" (HEOM) technique for\ntreatment of open quantum systems with all vibrational components attributed to\nan environment. By using a generating function approach to introduce a shift in\nthe excited state potential energy surface, we derive hierarchical equations\nfor polaron transformation in analogy to those for time propagation. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the developed approach by calculating the\ndynamics of underdamped and overdamped oscillators coupled to electronic\nexcitation of a monomer without and with previous polaron transformation and\nstudy the dynamics of the expectation value of the respective vibrational\ncoordinates. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of a dimer with a barrier\ncomparable to the thermal energy between the minima of the lower excitonic\npotential energy surface. It turns out that the assumption of localization at\nthe monomer unit with energetically higher potential minimum, introduced via\npolaron transformation, has a substantial influence on the transfer dynamics.\nHere, it makes a clear difference whether the polaron transformation is\nperformed in the local or exciton basis. This reflects the fact that the\npolaron transformation only accounts for equilibration of the vibrational, but\nnot of the excitonic dynamics. We sketch an approach to compensate this\nshortcoming in view of obtaining an initial state for the calculation of\nemission spectra of molecular aggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

However, these methods suffer from large errors due\nto loss of information during summarization and inherent assumptions.\nSampling-based methods are unbiased but suffer from large estimation variance\ndue to large sample space.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Alley, a hybrid method that combines\nboth sampling and synopses.

This novel\nmodel class allows us to formalise the problem of optimal robust subgroup\ndiscovery using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, where we resort\nto optimal Normalised Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian encodings for nominal and\nnumeric targets, respectively.

We are interested in fluids presenting a specific change in rheology:\nNewtonian below a certain shear rate and power law above. Since porous media\ngenerally exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity at large geological scales, we\nstudy the interaction between such inhomogeneity and the nonlinear rheology of\nthe fluid. The coupling between permeability heterogeneity and nonlinear\nrheology significantly affects the flow. We are particularly in the statistical\nproperties of the velocity field (mean, variance, correlation, etc). Depending\non the imposed mean pressure gradient, three macroscopic flow regimes are\nidentified. For a low or high average pressure gradient, the average flow rate\nincreases linearly or according to a power law, respectively. In the latter\nregime, we observe that the velocity field is more heterogeneous for\nshear-thinning fluids than for shear-thickening fluids. This is corresponding\nto a channeling effect of shear-thinning fluids. The intermediate regime\ncorresponds to a progressive and inhomogeneous change of the local rheology.\nThis transient regime is then characterized in terms of pressure gradient\nrange. The flow field is also analyzed statistically. The spatial distribution\nof the regions above the rheology threshold shows interesting statistical\nproperties. For instance, they exhibit multiscale characteristics (fractal),\nsimilar to other critical systems (percolation, avalanches, etc.).\n  More surprisingly, even though some statistical properties are independent of\nthe parameters, an interesting abrupt rotation of the correlations is found for\na particular set of parameters.

However, testing these\nmodels is often a difficult process and the uncertainties of the derived\nparameters are not easy to estimate. Here, we make an attempt to verify a\nwidely accepted thermophysical model (TPM) against unique thermal infrared\n(IR), full-disk, and well-calibrated measurements of the Moon. The data were\nobtained by the High-resolution InfraRed Sounder (HIRS) instruments on board a\nfleet of Earth weather satellites that serendipitously scan over the Moon. We\nfound 22 Moon intrusions, taken in 19 channels between 3.75 micron and 15.0\nmicron, and over a wide phase angle range from -73.1 deg to +73.8 deg. The\nsimilarity between these Moon data and typical asteroid spectral-IR energy\ndistributions allows us to benchmark the TPM concepts and to point out\nproblematic aspects.

As a case study, an instrumented\nsteel railway bridge of 27.34 m length located along the West Coast Mainline\nnear Staffordshire in the UK is considered. Using strain data captured from\nfibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors at 108 locations along the bridge\nsuperstructure, statFEM can predict the `true' system response while taking\ninto account the uncertainties in sensor readings, applied loading and finite\nelement model misspecification errors.

We apply the IF approach to describe quantum many-body dynamics in\nisolated spin systems, viewing the system as an environment for its local\nsubsystems. While the IF can be computed exactly only in certain many-body\nmodels, it generally satisfies a self-consistency equation, provided the\nsystem, or an ensemble of systems, are translationally invariant. We view the\nIF as a fictitious wavefunction in the temporal domain, and approximate it\nusing matrix-product states (MPS). This approach is efficient provided the\ntemporal entanglement of the IF is sufficiently low. We illustrate the\nversatility of the IF approach by analyzing several models that exhibit a range\nof dynamical behaviors, from thermalizing to many-body localized. In\nparticular, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics in the quantum Ising model in\nboth Floquet and Hamiltonian settings. We find that temporal entanglement\nentropy may be significantly lower compared to the spatial entanglement and\nanalyze the IF in the continuous-time limit.

The $t$-$U$ and $t$-$t'$-$t''$-$U$ models are\nconsidered in the regime of strong correlations, for the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion $U=8t$, in the range of temperatures $0.02t\\lesssim T\\lesssim 0.3t$.\nTo avoid the influence of the phase separation and size effects the\ncalculations are performed in an infinite crystal, in the part of the phase\ndiagram without inhomogeneities, for the electron concentration $\\bar{n}\n=0.92$. Solutions of the Eliashberg equation for singlet and triplet pairing,\nwhich are transformed according to one-dimensional representations of the\nlattice point group $D_4$, are considered. For both models and all considered\nsymmetries, eigenvalues of the Eliashberg equation are less than unity and\ndemonstrate no upward trend with decreasing temperature. This result points to\nthe absence of superconductivity in the Hubbard model in the strong-coupling\nregime. We discuss the reason for the small eigenvalue of the Eliashberg\nequation in the case of the singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 11:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

When it comes to\nvideo sequences, harnessing this force is even more beneficial due to the\ntemporal redundancy. In the context of image and video denoising, many\nclassically-oriented algorithms employ self-similarity, splitting the data into\noverlapping patches, gathering groups of similar ones and processing these\ntogether somehow. With the emergence of convolutional neural networks (CNN),\nthe patch-based framework has been abandoned. Most CNN denoisers operate on the\nwhole image, leveraging non-local relations only implicitly by using a large\nreceptive field. This work proposes a novel approach for leveraging\nself-similarity in the context of video denoising, while still relying on a\nregular convolutional architecture. We introduce a concept of patch-craft\nframes - artificial frames that are similar to the real ones, built by tiling\nmatched patches. Our algorithm augments video sequences with patch-craft frames\nand feeds them to a CNN.

The defining characteristics of the QAH ground state\nare the quantized Hall resistivity ($\\rho_{yx}$) and vanishing longitudinal\nresistivity ($\\rho_{xx}$) in the absence of external magnetic field. A\nfundamental question concerning the QAH effect is whether it is merely a\nzero-magnetic-field quantum Hall (QH) effect, or if it can host unique quantum\nphases and phase transitions that are unavailable elsewhere. The most dramatic\ndeparture of the QAH systems from other QH systems lies in the strong magnetic\ndisorders that induce spatially random magnetization. Because disorder and\nmagnetism play pivotal roles in the phase diagram of two-dimensional electron\nsystems, the high degree of magnetic disorders in QAH systems may create novel\nphases and quantum critical phenomena. In this work, we perform systematic\ntransport studies of a series of magnetic TIs with varied strength of magnetic\ndisorders. We find that the ground state of QAH effect can be categorized into\ntwo distinct classes: the QAH insulator and anomalous Hall (AH) insulator\nphases, as the zero-magnetic-field counterparts of the QH liquid and Hall\ninsulator in the QH systems. In the low disorder limit of the QAH insulator\nregime, we observe a universal quantized longitudinal resistance $\\rho_{xx} =\nh/e^{2}$ at the coercive field. In the AH insulator regime, we find that a\nmagnetic field can drive it to the QAH insulator phase through a quantum\ncritical point with distinct scaling behaviors from that in the QH phase\ntransition. We propose that the transmission between chiral edge states at\ndomain boundaries, tunable by disorder and magnetic fields, is the key for\ndetermining the QAH ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 12:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

The\nmain characteristic of such systems is that they remain uncontrolled for\ncertain periods of time. As a consequence, punctual equilibria\ncharacterizations outside the origin are no longer useful, and the whole\nconcept of equilibrium and its natural extension, the controlled invariant\nsets, needs to be redefined. Also, an exact characterization of the admissible\nstates, i.e., states such that their uncontrolled evolution between impulse\ntimes remain within a predefined set, is required. An approach to such tasks --\nbased on the Markov-Lukasz theorem -- is presented, providing a tractable and\nnon-conservative characterization, emerging from polynomial positivity that has\napplication to systems with rational eigenvalues. This is in turn the basis for\nobtaining a tractable approximation to the maximal admissible invariant sets.\nIn this work, it is also demonstrated that, in order for the problem to have a\nsolution, an invariant set (and moreover, an equilibrium set) must be contained\nwithin the target zone. To assess the proposal, the so-obtained impulsive\ninvariant set is explicitly used in the formulation of a set-based model\npredictive controller, with application to zone tracking. In this context,\nspecific MPC theory needs to be considered, as the target is not necessarily\nstable in the sense of Lyapunov. A zone MPC formulation is proposed, which is\nable to i) track an invariant set such that the uncontrolled propagation\nfulfills the zone constraint at all times and ii) converge asymptotically to\nthe set of periodic orbits completely contained within the target zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

In this work, we solve this problem using our\nproposed approach called {self-imitation learning by planning (SILP)}, where\ndemonstration data are collected automatically by planning on the visited\nstates from the current policy. SILP is inspired by the observation that\nsuccessfully visited states in the early reinforcement learning stage are\ncollision-free nodes in the graph-search based motion planner, so we can plan\nand relabel robot's own trials as demonstrations for policy learning. Due to\nthese self-generated demonstrations, we relieve the human operator from the\nlaborious data preparation process required by IL and RL methods in solving\ncomplex motion planning tasks. The evaluation results show that our SILP method\nachieves higher success rates and enhances sample efficiency compared to\nselected baselines, and the policy learned in simulation performs well in a\nreal-world placement task with changing goals and obstacles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 21:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

However,\nutilizing such tools is not straightforward when the data matrix consists of\ncount random variables, e.g., Poisson, in which case the noise can be\nheteroskedastic with an unknown variance in each entry. In this work, we\nconsider a Poisson random matrix with independent entries, and propose a simple\nprocedure termed \\textit{biwhitening} for estimating the rank of the underlying\nsignal matrix (i.e., the Poisson parameter matrix) without any prior knowledge.\nOur approach is based on the key observation that one can scale the rows and\ncolumns of the data matrix simultaneously so that the spectrum of the\ncorresponding noise agrees with the standard Marchenko-Pastur (MP) law,\njustifying the use of the MP upper edge as a threshold for rank selection.\nImportantly, the required scaling factors can be estimated directly from the\nobservations by solving a matrix scaling problem via the Sinkhorn-Knopp\nalgorithm. Aside from the Poisson, our approach is extended to families of\ndistributions that satisfy a quadratic relation between the mean and the\nvariance, such as the generalized Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, gamma,\nand many others. This quadratic relation can also account for missing entries\nin the data. We conduct numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical\nfindings, and showcase the advantage of our approach for rank estimation in\nchallenging regimes.

Though strong magnetic fields\ncan induce a GHz-scale splitting, weak fields are desirable to avoid noise in\nexperiments. Here, we provide two solutions to this outstanding challenge with\nrealistic data of well-studied AEL isotopes. In the first theory, the two\nnuclear spin qubit states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are excited to Rydberg\nstates $|r\\rangle$ with detuning $\\Delta$ and 0, respectively, where a\nMHz-scale detuning $\\Delta$ arises from a weak magnetic field on the order of\n1~G.

In the fitness evaluation phase, for each sub-network, a machine\nlearning model was trained using various entropy features of the sub-network\nand its performance was measured. Proper model performance implies extracting a\ngood discriminative sub-network. Network entropies can be used as network\ntopological descriptors. The evaluation results indicate the acceptable\nperformance of the proposed screening method based on extracted discriminative\nsub-networks and the machine learning models succeeded in obtaining a maximum\naccuracy of 73.1% in structural networks of the UCLA dataset, 82.2% in\nfunctional networks of the UCLA dataset, and 66.1% in functional networks of\nABIDE datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

In this study, we desire to fully exploit the multi-level deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) feature set for robust CRFR. In particular,\nour contributions are threefold. (i) To learn more robust and discriminative\nfeatures, we desire to adaptively fuse the contextual features from different\nlayers.

Previous methods such as Coteaching and JoCoR introduce two different\nnetworks to select clean samples out of the noisy ones and only use these clean\nones to train the deep models.

Most deep UDA approaches\noperate in a single-source, single-target scenario, i.e. they assume that the\nsource and the target samples arise from a single distribution. However, in\npractice most datasets can be regarded as mixtures of multiple domains. In\nthese cases, exploiting traditional single-source, single-target methods for\nlearning classification models may lead to poor results. Furthermore, it is\noften difficult to provide the domain labels for all data points, i.e. latent\ndomains should be automatically discovered. This paper introduces a novel deep\narchitecture which addresses the problem of UDA by automatically discovering\nlatent domains in visual datasets and exploiting this information to learn\nrobust target classifiers. Specifically, our architecture is based on two main\ncomponents, i.e. a side branch that automatically computes the assignment of\neach sample to its latent domain and novel layers that exploit domain\nmembership information to appropriately align the distribution of the CNN\ninternal feature representations to a reference distribution.

Traditional methods of transition prediction cannot be easily\nextended to flow configurations where the transition process depends on a large\nset of parameters. In comparison, neural network methods allow higher\ndimensional input features to be considered without compromising the efficiency\nand accuracy of the traditional data driven models. Neural network methods\nproposed earlier follow a cumbersome methodology of predicting instability\ngrowth rates over a broad range of frequencies, which are then processed to\nobtain the N-factor envelope, and then, the transition location based on the\ncorrelating N-factor. This paper presents an end-to-end transition model based\non a recurrent neural network, which sequentially processes the mean\nboundary-layer profiles along the surface of the aerodynamic body to directly\npredict the N-factor envelope and the transition locations over a\ntwo-dimensional airfoil. The proposed transition model has been developed and\nassessed using a large database of 53 airfoils over a wide range of chord\nReynolds numbers and angles of attack. The sequence-to-sequence transduction\nmodel proposed herein provides a more direct approach for accurate predictions\nof the transition location than the earlier neural network methods, which\npredict the local amplification rate of a single instability mode at a fixed\nlocation along the airfoil. The large universe of airfoils encountered in\nvarious applications causes additional difficulties.

Two methods\nwere used to extract daily variability from the raw geomagnetic hourly data.\nThe first method uses the so-called geomagnetically quiet days to calculate\nS-type variations as daily means resulting in the data sub-set named IQD Sq and\nSD. The second method uses the principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose\nthe original series into main variability modes. The first three modes produced\nby PCA and explaining up to 98 per cent of the variability of the raw data are\nin the data sub-set named PCA modes. Both methods allow to extract regular\ngeomagnetic field variations related to daily variations (S-type variations) in\nthe ionospheric dynamo region and some magnetospheric currents. The COI\nlocation near the mean latitude of the ionospheric Sq current vortex focus\nallows studying its variability using the S-type regular variations of the\ngeomagnetic field measured near the ground. The S-type variations for the X and\nY components of the geomagnetic field obtained at the COI observatory can also\nbe re-scaled and used to analyze field variations obtained at other European\ngeomagnetic observatories at close latitudes. The S-type variations for the Z\ncomponent of the geomagnetic field obtained at the COI observatory can be\ncompared to similar variations observed at more continental regions to study\nthe so-called coastal effect in the geomagnetic field variations.

Recently, WMC has been extended to\nweighted model integration (WMI) in order to additionally handle continuous\nvariables. At their core, WMI problems consist of computing integrals and sums\nover weighted logical formulas. From a theoretical standpoint, WMI has been\nformulated by patching the sum over weighted formulas, which is already present\nin WMC, with Riemann integration. A more principled approach to integration,\nwhich is rooted in measure theory, is Lebesgue integration. Lebesgue\nintegration allows one to treat discrete and continuous variables on equal\nfooting in a principled fashion. We propose a theoretically sound measure\ntheoretic formulation of weighted model integration, which naturally reduces to\nweighted model counting in the absence of continuous variables.

The expansion rate $H_0$ is thought to be\nspatially constant, while bulk flows are often presumed to be negligible\ncompared to the Hubble expansion, even at local scales. Their effects on the\nredshift-distance conversion are hence usually ignored. Any deviation from this\nconsensus can strongly bias the results of such studies and thus the importance\nof testing these assumptions cannot be understated. Scaling relations of galaxy\nclusters can be effectively used for that. In previous works, we observed\nstrong anisotropies in cluster scaling relations, whose origins remain\nambiguous. By measuring many different cluster properties, several scaling\nrelations with different sensitivities can be built. Nearly independent tests\nof cosmic isotropy and bulk flows are then feasible. We make use of up to 570\nclusters with measured properties at X-ray, microwave, and infrared\nwavelengths, to construct 10 different cluster scaling relations (five of them\npresented for the first time) and test the isotropy of the local Universe.\nThrough rigorous tests, we ensure that our analysis is not prone to generally\nknown systematic biases and X-ray absorption issues. By combining all available\ninformation, we detect an apparent $9\\%$ spatial variation in the local $H_0$\nbetween $(l,b)\\sim\n({280^{\\circ}}^{+35^{\\circ}}_{-35^{\\circ}},{-15^{\\circ}}^{+20^{\\circ}}_{-20^{\\circ}})$\nand the rest of the sky. The observed anisotropy has a nearly dipole form.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the statistical significance of the\nanisotropy to be $>5\\sigma$. This result could also be attributed to a $\\sim\n900$ km/s bulk flow which seems to extend out to at least $\\sim 500$ Mpc. These\ntwo effects are indistinguishable until more high$-z$ clusters are observed by\nfuture all-sky surveys, such as eROSITA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The use of such convolutions requires sampling short clips from the\ninput video, where each clip is a collection of closely sampled frames. Since\neach short clip covers a small fraction of an input video, multiple clips are\nsampled at inference in order to cover the whole temporal length of the video.\nThis leads to increased computational load and is impractical for real-world\napplications. We address the computational bottleneck by significantly reducing\nthe number of frames required for inference. Our approach relies on a temporal\ntransformer that applies global attention over video frames, and thus better\nexploits the salient information in each frame. Therefore our approach is very\ninput efficient, and can achieve SotA results (on Kinetics dataset) with a\nfraction of the data (frames per video), computation and latency. Specifically\non Kinetics-400, we reach $80.5$ top-1 accuracy with $\\times 30$ less frames\nper video, and $\\times 40$ faster inference than the current leading method.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/STAM\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:25:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

To address this problem, we propose\na Disentanglement-based Cross-Domain Feature Augmentation (DCDFA) strategy,\nwhere the augmented features characterize well the target and source domain\ndata distributions while inheriting reliable identity labels. Particularly, we\ndisentangle each sample feature into a robust domain-invariant/shared feature\nand a domain-specific feature, and perform cross-domain feature recomposition\nto enhance the diversity of samples used in the training, with the constraints\nof cross-domain ReID loss and domain classification loss. Each recomposed\nfeature, obtained based on the domain-invariant feature (which enables a\nreliable inheritance of identity) and an enhancement from a domain specific\nfeature (which enables the approximation of real distributions), is thus an\n\"ideal\" augmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Candidate mechanisms include some combination\nof maladaptive priors and reduced updating of these priors during perception. A\npotential benefit of models with such mechanisms is their ability to link\nmultiple levels of explanation. This is key to improving how we understand the\nexperience of psychosis. Moreover, it points us towards more comprehensive\navenues for therapeutic research by providing a putative mechanism that could\nallow for the generation of new treatments from first principles. In order to\ndemonstrate this, our conceptual paper will discuss the application of the\ninsights from previous computational models to an important and complex set of\nevidence-based clinical interventions with strong social elements, such as\ncoordinated specialty care clinics in early psychosis and assertive community\ntreatment. These interventions may include but also go beyond\npsychopharmacology, providing, we argue, structure and predictability for\npatients experiencing psychosis. We develop the argument that this structure\nand predictability directly counteract the relatively low precision afforded to\nsensory information in psychosis, while also providing the patient more access\nto external cognitive resources in the form of providers and the structure of\nthe programs themselves. We discuss how computational models explain the\nresulting reduction in symptoms, as well as the predictions these models make\nabout potential responses of patients to modifications or to different\nvariations of these interventions. We also link, via the framework of\ncomputational models, the experiences of patients and response to interventions\nto putative neurobiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Although the read-retry mechanism is\nessential to ensuring the reliability of modern NAND flash memory, it can\nsignificantly increase the read latency of an SSD by introducing multiple retry\nsteps that read the target page again with adjusted read-reference voltage\nvalues. Through a detailed analysis of the read mechanism and rigorous\ncharacterization of 160 real 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find new\nopportunities to reduce the read-retry latency by exploiting two advanced\nfeatures widely adopted in modern NAND flash-based SSDs: 1) the CACHE READ\ncommand and 2) strong ECC engine. First, we can reduce the read-retry latency\nusing the advanced CACHE READ command that allows a NAND flash chip to perform\nconsecutive reads in a pipelined manner. Second, there exists a large\nECC-capability margin in the final retry step that can be used for reducing the\nchip-level read latency. Based on our new findings, we develop two new\ntechniques that effectively reduce the read-retry latency: 1) Pipelined\nRead-Retry (PR$^2$) and 2) Adaptive Read-Retry (AR$^2$). PR$^2$ reduces the\nlatency of a read-retry operation by pipelining consecutive retry steps using\nthe CACHE READ command. AR$^2$ shortens the latency of each retry step by\ndynamically reducing the chip-level read latency depending on the current\noperating conditions that determine the ECC-capability margin.

We found\nthat the police shooting rate of a state depends on many variables. The top\nfour most relevant attributes were state joined year, state land area, gun\nownership rate, and violent crime rate. Third, we proposed four regression\nmodels to predict police shooting rates at the state level. The best model\nKstar could predict the fatal police shooting rate with about 88.53%\ncorrelation coefficient. We also proposed classification models, including\nGradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and\nNaive Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.\nOur classification models show no significant evidence to conclude that racial\ndiscrimination happened during fatal police shootings recorded by the WP\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 21:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}
