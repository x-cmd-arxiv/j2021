SG's attractiveness is due in part to its\nsimplicity of executing a single step along the negative subsampled gradient\ndirection to update the incumbent iterate. In this paper, we question SG's\nchoice of executing a single step as opposed to multiple steps between\nsubsample updates. Our investigation leads naturally to generalizing SG into\nRetrospective Approximation (RA) where, during each iteration, a \"deterministic\nsolver\" executes possibly multiple steps on a subsampled deterministic problem\nand stops when further solving is deemed unnecessary from the standpoint of\nstatistical efficiency. RA thus rigorizes what is appealing for implementation\n-- during each iteration, \"plug in\" a solver, e.g., L-BFGS line search or\nNewton-CG, as is, and solve only to the extent necessary. We develop a complete\ntheory using relative error of the observed gradients as the principal object,\ndemonstrating that almost sure and $L_1$ consistency of RA are preserved under\nespecially weak conditions when sample sizes are increased at appropriate\nrates. We also characterize the iteration and oracle complexity (for linear and\nsub-linear solvers) of RA, and identify a practical termination criterion\nleading to optimal complexity rates. To subsume non-convex $f$, we present a\ncertain \"random central limit theorem\" that incorporates the effect of\ncurvature across all first-order critical points, demonstrating that the\nasymptotic behavior is described by a certain mixture of normals. The message\nfrom our numerical experiments is that the ability of RA to incorporate\nexisting second-order deterministic solvers in a strategic manner might be\nimportant from the standpoint of dispensing with hyper-parameter tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 16:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 04:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

Teamwork theory and experiments have\nresulted in a set of states and processes for team effectiveness in both\nhuman-human and agent-agent teams. However, human-agent teaming is less well\nstudied because it is so new and involves asymmetry in policy and intent not\npresent in human teams. To optimize team performance in human-agent teaming, it\nis critical that agents infer human intent and adapt their polices for smooth\ncoordination. Most literature in human-agent teaming builds agents referencing\na learned human model. Though these agents are guaranteed to perform well with\nthe learned model, they lay heavy assumptions on human policy such as\noptimality and consistency, which is unlikely in many real-world scenarios. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel adaptive agent architecture in human-model-free\nsetting on a two-player cooperative game, namely Team Space Fortress (TSF).\nPrevious human-human team research have shown complementary policies in TSF\ngame and diversity in human players' skill, which encourages us to relax the\nassumptions on human policy. Therefore, we discard learning human models from\nhuman data, and instead use an adaptation strategy on a pre-trained library of\nexemplar policies composed of RL algorithms or rule-based methods with minimal\nassumptions of human behavior. The adaptation strategy relies on a novel\nsimilarity metric to infer human policy and then selects the most complementary\npolicy in our library to maximize the team performance. The adaptive agent\narchitecture can be deployed in real-time and generalize to any off-the-shelf\nstatic agents. We conducted human-agent experiments to evaluate the proposed\nadaptive agent framework, and demonstrated the suboptimality, diversity, and\nadaptability of human policies in human-agent teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 20:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

In the case of superconducting qubits, the weak anharmonicity of\ntransmons imposes profound constraints on the gate design, leading to increased\ncomplexity of devices and control protocols. Here we demonstrate a\nresource-efficient control over the interaction of strongly-anharmonic\nfluxonium qubits. Namely, applying an off-resonant drive to non-computational\ntransitions in a pair of capacitively-coupled fluxoniums induces a\n$\\textrm{ZZ}$-interaction due to unequal ac-Stark shifts of the computational\nlevels. With a continuous choice of frequency and amplitude, the drive can\neither cancel the static $\\textrm{ZZ}$-term or increase it by an order of\nmagnitude to enable a controlled-phase (CP) gate with an arbitrary programmed\nphase shift. The cross-entropy benchmarking of these non-Clifford operations\nyields a sub $1\\%$ error, limited solely by incoherent processes. Our result\ndemonstrates the advantages of strongly-anharmonic circuits over transmons in\ndesigning the next generation of quantum processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 00:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

The projection direction is\nidentified through minimizing an empirical risk function that contains the\nparticular loss function in a DWD classifier, over a reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace.

Unlike previous weather analogs that are sought within a\nlarge spatial domain and an extended temporal window, AnEn strictly confines\nspace and time, and independently generates results at each grid point within a\nshort time window. AnEn can find similar forecasts that lead to accurate and\ncalibrated ensemble forecasts. The central core of the AnEn technique is a\nsimilarity metric that sorts historical forecasts with respect to a new target\nprediction. A commonly used metric is Euclidean distance. However, a\nsignificant difficulty using this metric is the definition of the weights for\nall the parameters. Generally, feature selection and extensive weight search\nare needed.\n  This paper proposes a novel definition of weather analogs through a Machine\nLearning (ML) based similarity metric. The similarity metric uses neural\nnetworks that are trained and instantiated to search for weather analogs. This\nnew metric allows incorporating all variables without requiring a prior feature\nselection and weight optimization. Experiments are presented on the application\nof this new metric to forecast wind speed and solar irradiance. Results show\nthat the ML metric generally outperforms the original metric.

The existing attacks\nrely on sensing the micro-architectural state changes made by victims, and this\nassumption can be invalidated by combining spatial (\\eg, Intel CAT) and\ntemporal isolation (\\eg, time protection). In this work, we advance the state\nof cache side-channel attacks by showing stateless cache side-channel attacks\nthat cannot be defeated by both spatial and temporal isolation.\n  This side-channel exploits the timing difference resulted from interconnect\ncongestion. Specifically, to complete cache transactions, for Intel CPUs, cache\nlines would travel across cores via the CPU mesh interconnect. Nonetheless, the\nmesh links are shared by all cores, and cache isolation does not segregate the\ntraffic. An attacker can generate interconnect traffic to contend with the\nvictim's on a mesh link, hoping that extra delay will be measured. With the\nvariant delays, the attacker can deduce the memory access pattern of a victim\nprogram, and infer its sensitive data. Based on this idea, we implement Volcano\nand test it against the existing RSA implementations of JDK. We found the RSA\nprivate key used by a victim process can be partially recovered.

In large two-player\nzero-sum imperfect-information games, modern extensions of counterfactual\nregret minimization (CFR) are currently the practical state of the art for\ncomputing a Nash equilibrium. Most regret-minimization algorithms for tree-form\nsequential decision making, including CFR, require (i) an exact model of the\nplayer's decision nodes, observation nodes, and how they are linked, and (ii)\nfull knowledge, at all times t, about the payoffs -- even in parts of the\ndecision space that are not encountered at time t. Recently, there has been\ngrowing interest towards relaxing some of those restrictions and making regret\nminimization applicable to settings for which reinforcement learning methods\nhave traditionally been used -- for example, those in which only black-box\naccess to the environment is available. We give the first, to our knowledge,\nregret-minimization algorithm that guarantees sublinear regret with high\nprobability even when requirement (i) -- and thus also (ii) -- is dropped. We\nformalize an online learning setting in which the strategy space is not known\nto the agent and gets revealed incrementally whenever the agent encounters new\ndecision points. We give an efficient algorithm that achieves $O(T^{3/4})$\nregret with high probability for that setting, even when the agent faces an\nadversarial environment. Our experiments show it significantly outperforms the\nprior algorithms for the problem, which do not have such guarantees. It can be\nused in any application for which regret minimization is useful: approximating\nNash equilibrium or quantal response equilibrium, approximating coarse\ncorrelated equilibrium in multi-player games, learning a best response,\nlearning safe opponent exploitation, and online play against an unknown\nopponent/environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 04:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

In\ntime-reversal-invariant (TRI) systems, the inversion of spin-degenerate bands\nwith opposite parity leads to nontrivial topological states, such as\ntopological insulators and Dirac semimetals. When the TRS is broken, the\nexchange field induces spin splitting of the bands. The inversion of a pair of\nspin-splitting subbands can generate more exotic topological states, such as\nquantum anomalous Hall insulators and magnetic Weyl semimetals. So far, such\ntopological phase transitions driven by the TRS breaking have not been\nvisualized.

So far, only two families of\nexceptional scattered polynomials are known. Very recently, Longobardi and\nZanella weakened the property of being scattered by introducing the notion of\nL-$q^t$-partially scattered and R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials, for\n$t$ a divisor of $n$. Indeed, a polynomial is scattered if and only if it is\nboth L-$q^t$-partially scattered and R-$q^t$-partially scattered. In this\npaper, by using techniques from algebraic geometry over finite fields and\nfunction fields theory, we show that the property which is is the hardest to be\npreserved is the L-$q^t$-partially scattered one. On the one hand, we are able\nto extend the classification results of exceptional scattered polynomials to\nexceptional L-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials. On the other hand, the\nR-$q^t$-partially scattered property seems more stable. We present a large\nfamily of R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials, containing examples of\nexceptional R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials, which turn out to be\nconnected with linear sets of so-called pseudoregulus type. In order to detect\nnew examples of polynomials which are R-$q^t$-partially scattered, we introduce\ntwo different notions of equivalence preserving this property and concerning\nnatural actions of the groups ${\\rm \\Gamma L}(2,q^n)$ and ${\\rm \\Gamma\nL}(2n/t,q^t)$. In particular, our family contains many examples of inequivalent\npolynomials, and geometric arguments are used to determine the equivalence\nclasses under the action of ${\\rm \\Gamma L}(2n/t,q^t)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 08:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

It has been recently suggested that the non-detection of such hot\nwind signatures in the hard states could be due to the thermal instability of\nthe wind in the ionisation domain consistent with Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. Studying\nthe wind thermal stability requires however a very good knowledge of the\nspectral shape of the ionizing Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We discuss\nin this paper the expected evolution of the disk wind properties during an\nentire outburst by using the RXTE observations of GX 339-4 during its 2010-2011\noutburst. While GX 339-4 never showed signatures of a hot wind in the X-rays,\nthe dataset used is optimal to illustrate our purposes. We compute the\ncorresponding stability curves of the wind using the SED obtained with the\nJet-Emitting Disk model. We show that the disk wind can transit from stable to\nunstable states for Fe XXV and Fe XXVI ions on a day time scale. While the\nabsence of wind absorption features in hard states could be explained by this\ninstability, their presence in soft states seems to require changes of the wind\nproperties (e.g. density) during the spectral transitions between hard and soft\nstates. We propose that these changes could be partly due to the variation of\nheating power release at the accretion disk surface through irradiation by the\ncentral X-ray source. The evolution of the disk wind properties discussed in\nthis paper could be confirmed through the daily monitoring of the spectral\ntransition of a high-inclination BH XrB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 08:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

However, simple examples show\nthat when $p = o(1)$, there is no hypercontractive inequality that is strong\nenough.\n  In this paper, we establish an effective hypercontractive inequality for\ngeneral $p$ that applies to `global functions', i.e. functions that are not\nsignificantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This\nclass of functions appears naturally, e.g. in Bourgain's sharp threshold\ntheorem, which states that such functions exhibit a sharp threshold.

Although this kind of approach has shown promising accuracy, it is\nhampered by 1) noisy labels produced by clustering and 2) feature variations\ncaused by camera shift. The former will lead to incorrect optimization and thus\nhinders the model accuracy. The latter will result in assigning the intra-class\nsamples of different cameras to different pseudo-label, making the model\nsensitive to camera variations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework\nto solve both problems. Concretely, we propose a Dynamic and Symmetric\nCross-Entropy loss (DSCE) to deal with noisy samples and a camera-aware\nmeta-learning algorithm (MetaCam) to adapt camera shift. DSCE can alleviate the\nnegative effects of noisy samples and accommodate the change of clusters after\neach clustering step. MetaCam simulates cross-camera constraint by splitting\nthe training data into meta-train and meta-test based on camera IDs. With the\ninteracted gradient from meta-train and meta-test, the model is enforced to\nlearn camera-invariant features. Extensive experiments on three re-ID\nbenchmarks show the effectiveness and the complementary of the proposed DSCE\nand MetaCam. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both fully\nunsupervised re-ID and unsupervised domain adaptive re-ID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 09:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

Several essentials that may influence the lifetime\nestimation have been explored, including the dark matter (DM) halo mass\nfunction (HMF), the width of redshift bin, the growth of DM halos within each\nredshift bin, and the stellar mass. We find that the HMF difference results in\nscatters of $\\sim0.2$ dex on lifetime estimation; adopting a redshift bin width\nof $\\Delta z = 0.5$ is good enough to estimate the lifetime; and no significant\neffect on lifetime estimation is found due to the growth of DM halos within\neach redshift bin.

We assume that the\nconstant speed $v>0$ of the particle during each running phase is independently\ndrawn from a probability distribution $W(v)$ and that the direction of the\nparticle is chosen isotropically after each tumbling. The position distribution\nis clearly isotropic, $P(\\vec{R},N)\\to P(R,N)$ where $R=|\\vec{R}|$. We show\nthat, under certain conditions on $d$ and $W(v)$ and for large $N$, a\ncondensation transition occurs at some critical value of $R=R_c\\sim O(N)$\nlocated in the large deviation regime of $P(R,N)$. For $R<R_c$ (subcritical\nfluid phase), all runs are roughly of the same size in a typical trajectory. In\ncontrast, an RTP trajectory with $R>R_c$ is typically dominated by a\n`condensate', i.e., a large single run that subsumes a finite fraction of the\ntotal displacement (supercritical condensed phase). Focusing on the family of\nspeed distributions $W(v)=\\alpha(1-v/v_0)^{\\alpha-1}/v_0$, parametrized by\n$\\alpha>0$, we show that, for large $N$, $P(R,N)\\sim\n\\exp\\left[-N\\psi_{d,\\alpha}(R/N)\\right]$ and we compute exactly the rate\nfunction $\\psi_{d,\\alpha}(z)$ for any $d$ and $\\alpha$. We show that the\ntransition manifests itself as a singularity of this rate function at $R=R_c$\nand that its order depends continuously on $d$ and $\\alpha$.

In this work, for the first time, we investigate\nthe idea of \"You Only Learn Once (YOLO)\" and develop a universal anatomical\nlandmark detection model to realize multiple landmark detection tasks with\nend-to-end training based on mixed datasets. The model consists of a local\nnetwork and a global network: The local network is built upon the idea of\nuniversal U-Net to learn multi-domain local features and the global network is\na parallelly-duplicated sequential of dilated convolutions that extract global\nfeatures to further disambiguate the landmark locations.

In contrast, controlled behavior synthesis and transfer\nacross individuals requires a deep understanding of body dynamics and calls for\na representation of behavior that is independent of appearance and also of\nspecific postures.

These networks\nuse an efficient implementation of reverse differentiation, called\nbackpropagation (BP).

Therefore, biologically plausible learning methods that rely on\npredictive coding (PC), a framework for describing information processing in\nthe brain, are increasingly studied. Recent works prove that these methods can\napproximate BP up to a certain margin on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and\nasymptotically on any other complex model, and that zero-divergence inference\nlearning (Z-IL), a variant of PC, is able to exactly implement BP on MLPs.\nHowever, the recent literature shows also that there is no biologically\nplausible method yet that can exactly replicate the weight update of BP on\ncomplex models. To fill this gap, in this paper, we generalize (PC and) Z-IL by\ndirectly defining them on computational graphs, and show that it can perform\nexact reverse differentiation.

Sharing\ninformation between unrelated tasks might hurt performance, and it is unclear\nhow to transfer knowledge across tasks with a hierarchical structure. Our\nresearch extends a model agnostic meta-learning model, MAML, by exploiting\nhierarchical task relationships. Our algorithm, TreeMAML, adapts the model to\neach task with a few gradient steps, but the adaptation follows the\nhierarchical tree structure: in each step, gradients are pooled across tasks\nclusters, and subsequent steps follow down the tree. We also implement a\nclustering algorithm that generates the tasks tree without previous knowledge\nof the task structure, allowing us to make use of implicit relationships\nbetween the tasks. We show that the new algorithm, which we term TreeMAML,\nperforms better than MAML when the task structure is hierarchical for synthetic\nexperiments.

Models for count data are\nneeded when the variable of interest take only non-negative integer values and\nthese integers arise from counting occurrences. Several R-packages are\ncurrently available to deal with spatiotemporal areal count data. Each package\nfocuses on different models and/or statistical methodologies. Unfortunately,\nthe results generated by these models are rarely comparable due to differences\nin notation and methods. The main objective of this paper is to present a\nreview describing the most important approaches that can be used to model and\nanalyse count data when questions of scientific interest concern both their\nspatial and their temporal behaviour and we monitor their performance under the\nsame data set.\n  For this review, we focus on the three R-packages that can be used for this\npurpose and the different models assessed are representative of the two most\nwidespread methodologies used to analyse spatiotemporal count data: the\nclassical approach (based on Penalised Likelihood or Estimating Equations) and\nthe Bayesian point of view.\n  A case study is analysed as an illustration of these different methodologies.\nIn this case study, these packages are used to model and predict daily\nhospitalisations from COVID-19 in 24 health regions within the Valencian\nCommunity (Spain), with data corresponding to the period from 28 June to 13\nDecember 2020.

To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on\ndual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three\nstages.

We can obtain two\ncomplementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from\nholistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by\ndistilling knowledge from these two teachers.

Transfer is based on the idea of reusing the\nknowledge acquired in the learning of a set of source tasks to a new learning\nprocess in a target task, assuming that the target and source tasks are close\nenough. In recent years, transfer learning has succeeded in making\nReinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms more efficient (e.g., by reducing the\nnumber of samples needed to achieve the (near-)optimal performance). Transfer\nin RL is based on the core concept of similarity: whenever the tasks are\nsimilar, the transferred knowledge can be reused to solve the target task and\nsignificantly improve the learning performance. Therefore, the selection of\ngood metrics to measure these similarities is a critical aspect when building\ntransfer RL algorithms, especially when this knowledge is transferred from\nsimulation to the real world. In the literature, there are many metrics to\nmeasure the similarity between MDPs, hence, many definitions of similarity or\nits complement distance have been considered. In this paper, we propose a\ncategorization of these metrics and analyze the definitions of similarity\nproposed so far, taking into account such categorization.

In civil aviation,\nskin-friction drag accounts for around 50% of the total drag in cruise\nconditions, thus being a preferential target for research. With laminar\nconditions excluded, skin friction is intimately linked to the turbulence\nphysics in the fluid layer closest to the skin. Thus, research into drag\nreduction has focused on methods to depress the turbulence activity near the\nsurface. The most effective method of doing so is to subject the drag-producing\nflow in the near-wall layer to an unsteady and/or spatially varying cross-flow\ncomponent, either by the action of transverse wall oscillations, by embedding\nrotating discs into the surface or by plasma-producing electrodes that\naccelerate the near-wall fluid in the transverse direction.

We generated a velocity\nmap of transients in 3D space based on 2D white-light images and used it to\nestimate the expansion rate as well as some kinematic properties of solar wind\ntransients. Based on the recently developed correlation-aided reconstruction\n(CORAR) method in our previous work, which can recognize and locate 3D solar\nwind transients from STEREO/HI1 image data, we further developped a new\ntechnique for deriving the spatial distribution of the radial velocities of the\nmost pronounced features inside solar wind transients. The technique was\napplied to events including a coronal mass ejection (CME) and three small-scale\ntransients, so-called blobs, observed by HI1 on 3-4 April 2010 to reconstruct\ntheir radial velocity maps. The results match the forward-modeling results,\nsimulations, and in situ observations at $1$ AU fairly well. According to the\nobtained spatial distributions of height and radial velocity of the CME, we\nanalyzed the self-similarity of the radial expansion of the CME ejecta. The\ndimensionless radial expansion rate of the northern and middle parts of the CME\nejecta varies in the range of 0.7 - 1.0 at heliocentric distance between 25 Rs\nand 55Rs and the rate of the southern part in the range of 0.3 - 0.5,\nsuggesting that the CME structure was distorted and shaped by the ambient solar\nwind. The technique we developed is expected to be applied to more events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 13:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 04:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

The sensitivity as well as the detectivity of\nthe sensor are characterized in the parallel state and at 0 mT. We observe that\nthe sensitivity shows a strong voltage dependence and the noise presents an\nunexpected decrease, not anticipated by the Hooge's law. Moreover,\nsurprisingly, an almost stable detectivity (140-200 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz and\n15-20 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz) as a function of the bias voltage is observed,\ntending to highlight that the variation of sensitivity and noise are\ncorrelated.

However, the nature of discrete\nnetwork traffic at the packet level makes it hard for GAN to craft adversarial\ntraffic as GAN is efficient in generating continuous data like image synthesis.\nUnlike previous methods that convert discrete network traffic into a grayscale\nimage, this paper gains inspiration from SeqGAN in sequence generation with\npolicy gradient. Based on the structure of SeqGAN, we propose Attack-GAN to\ngenerate adversarial network traffic at packet level that complies with domain\nconstraints.

While navigating in complex urban\nenvironments, the Bayesian occupancy grid is one of the most popular types of\nmaps, where the information of occupancy is stored as the probability of\ncollision. Although widely used, this kind of representation is not well suited\nfor risk assessment: because of its discrete nature, the probability of\ncollision becomes dependent on the tessellation size. Therefore, risk\nassessments on Bayesian occupancy grids cannot yield risks with meaningful\nphysical units. In this article, we propose an alternative framework called\nDynamic Lambda-Field that is able to assess generic physical risks in dynamic\nenvironments without being dependent on the tessellation size. Using our\nframework, we are able to plan safe trajectories where the risk function can be\nadjusted depending on the scenario. We validate our approach with quantitative\nexperiments, showing the convergence speed of the grid and that the framework\nis suitable for real-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 14:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

Conventionally, because the photons detected\nat each pixel are distributed across as many as 200 energy channels,\nenergy-selective images are characterised by low count-rates and poor\nsignal-to-noise ratio. This means high X-ray exposures, long scan times and\nhigh doses are required to image unique spectral markers. Here, we achieve high\nquality energy-dispersive tomograms from low dose, noisy datasets using a\ndedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. This exploits the spatial\nsmoothness and inter-channel structural correlation in the spectral domain\nusing two carefully chosen regularisation terms. For a multi-phase phantom, a\nreduction in scan time of 36 times is demonstrated. Spectral analysis methods\nincluding K-edge subtraction and absorption step-size fitting are evaluated for\nan ex vivo, single (iodine)-stained biological sample, where low chemical\nconcentration and inhomogeneous distribution can affect soft tissue\nsegmentation and visualisation. The reconstruction algorithms are available\nthrough the open-source Core Imaging Library. Taken together, these tools offer\nnew capabilities for visualisation and elemental mapping, with promising\napplications for multiply-stained biological specimens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 14:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Two new binaries, 47 Tuc ac and 47 Tuc ad,\nare eclipsing \"spiders\", featuring compact orbits ($\\lesssim 0.32$ days), very\nlow-mass companions and regular occultations of their pulsed emission. The\nother three new binary pulsars (NGC 6624G, M62G, and Ter 5 an) are in wider ($>\n0.7$ days) orbits, with companions that are likely to be white dwarfs or\nneutron stars. NGC 6624G has a large eccentricity of $e\\simeq 0.38$, which\nenabled us to detect the rate of advance of periastron. This suggests that the\nsystem is massive, with a total mass of $M{\\rm tot} = 2.65 \\pm 0.07$\nM$_{\\odot}$. Likewise, for Ter 5 an, with $e \\simeq 0.0066$, we obtain $M{\\rm\ntot}= 2.97 \\pm 0.52$ M$_{\\odot}$. The other three new discoveries (NGC 6522D,\nNGC 6624H and NGC 6752F) are faint isolated pulsars. Finally, we have used the\nwhole MeerKAT array and synthesized 288 beams, covering an area of $\\sim2$\narcmin in radius around the center of NGC 6624. This has allowed us to localize\nmany of the pulsars in the cluster, demonstrating the beamforming capabilities\nof the TRAPUM software backend and paving the way for the upcoming MeerKAT\nglobular cluster pulsar survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 14:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Applications in the literature tend to\nfocus solely on analytical accuracy bounds, not include data in error\nprediction, or use arbitrary settings to measure error empirically.\n  To fill the gap in the literature, we propose a novel application of factor\nexperiments to create data aware error predictions. Basically, factor\nexperiments provide a systematic approach to conducting empirical experiments.\nTo demonstrate our methodology in action, we conduct a case study where error\nis dependent on arbitrarily complex tree structures. We first construct a tool\nto simulate poll data. Next, we use our simulated data to construct a least\nsquares model to predict error. Last, we show how to validate the model.\nConsequently, our contribution is a method for constructing error prediction\nmodels that are data aware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 15:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 09:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Most of the\ndust models that are used to explain these observations have major drawbacks:\nThey either use much smaller grains than expected from dust evolution models,\nor result in lower polarisations than observed. We investigate the effect of\ndust grain porosity on the polarisation due to scattering at sub-mm wavelengths\narising from grains of up to mm sizes, as they are expected to be present in\nthe midplane of PPDs. Using the effective medium theory, we calculated the\noptical properties of porous dust and used them to predict the behaviour of the\nscattering polarisation. Subsequently, radiative transfer simulations for PPDs\nwith porous dust were performed to analyse the additional effect of the optical\ndepth structure, and thus the effect of multiple scattering events and\ninhomogeneous temperature distributions on the polarisation. We find that\nporous dust with moderate filling factors of about 10\\% increase the\npolarisation compared to compact grains. For higher grain porosities, that is,\ngrains with a filling factor of 1\\% or lower, the extinction opacity decreases,\nas does the optical depth of a disk with constant mass. Consequently, the\nunpolarised direct radiation dominates the scattered flux, and the polarisation\ndrops rapidly. Even though the simulated polarisation is higher than in the\ncase of compact grains, it is still below the typical observed values for\nface-on disks. However, the polarisation can be increased when crucial model\nassumptions derived from disk and dust evolution theories, for instance, dust\nsettling and mm-sized dust grains, are dropped. In the case of inclined disks,\nhowever, our reference model is able to achieve polarisation degrees of about\n1\\%, and using higher disk masses, even higher than this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 15:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The current work investigates the\nspatial properties of congestion, that is, we aim to characterize the city\nareas where traffic bottlenecks occur. The analysis of a large amount of real\nroad networks in previous works showed that congestion points experience\nspatial abrupt transitions, namely they shift away from the city center as\nlarger urban areas are incorporated. The fundamental ingredient behind this\neffect is the entanglement of central and arterial roads, embedded in separated\ngeographical regions. In this paper we extend the analysis of the conditions\nyielding abrupt transitions of congestion location. First, we look into the\nmore realistic situation in which arterial and central roads, rather than lying\non sharply separated regions, present spatial overlap. It results that this\naffects the position of bottlenecks and introduces new possible congestion\nareas. Secondly, we pay particular attention to the role played by the edge\ndistribution, proving that it allows to smooth the transitions profile, and so\nto control the congestion displacement.

As silicon scaling\nslows down, the industry is increasingly dependent on IC package technologies\nto contribute to further circuit integration and performance improvements. This\nis a paradigm shift and requires the IC package industry to reduce the size and\nincrease the density of internal interconnects on a scale which has never been\ndone before. Traditional package characterization and process optimization\nrelies on destructive techniques such as physical cross-sections and delayering\nto extract data from internal package features. These destructive techniques\nare not practical with today's advanced packages. In this paper we will\ndemonstrate how data acquired non-destructively with a 3D X-ray microscope can\nbe enhanced and optimized using machine learning, and can then be used to\nmeasure, characterize and optimize the design and production of buried\ninterconnects in advanced IC packages.

Most models\nin the literature focus on the elastic behaviour of the tendon, and there are\nfew which model beyond the elastic limit without introducing phenomenological\nparameters. We develop a model, built upon a collagen recruitment approach,\nthat only contains microstructural parameters. We split the stress in the\nfibrils into elastic and plastic parts, and assume that the fibril yield\nstretch and rupture stretch are each described by a distribution function,\nrather than being single-valued.

Firstly, a sampled Peak Point(the highest point in pulse\nsignal), which carries the values of amplitude feature voltage and amplitude\narriving time, is added to traditional MVT with a simple peak sampling circuit.\nSecondly, an amplitude deviation statistical analysis, which compares the\nenergy deviation of various reconstruction models, is used to select adaptive\nreconstruction models for signal pulses with different amplitudes.

The proposed\ntransmit waveforms avoid the frequency bands occupied by narrowband interferers\nor communication links, while simultaneously have a small cross-correlation\namong each other to enable their separability at the MIMO radar receiver. The\nperformance of the optimized set of sequences obtained through solving a\nnon-convex bi-objective optimization problem, is compared with the\nstate-of-the-art counterparts, and its applicability is illustrated by the\ndeveloped prototype.

Although\nthere is a large quantity of papers on twisted pairs, the papers in the\nliterature mostly focus on the sub-1GHz spectrum, where the current digital\nsubscriber line technologies operate. Higher carrier frequencies on twisted\npairs can enable the data rates required by the future communication networks;\nhence, the existing copper infrastructure can be utilised on the last mile\ncomplementing the fibre networks. Towards this objective, we derive analytical\nexpression for the electromagnetic fields and characteristic equation of\ntwisted pairs. With these derivations we show a fundamental limit on the\noperating frequency of twisted pairs beyond which twisted pairs start to\nradiate and behave like an antenna. To validate our theory through\nmeasurements, we designed a microstrip balun in order to excite the\ndifferential mode on the twisted pairs. Unlike off-the-shelf devices, this\nbalun has a nearly linear transmission curve across 1-12GHz. This linearity\nallows us to detect the radiation which would not have been possible with an\noff-the-shelf device. At the end, we demonstrate that the standard twisted\npairs used in the UK can be used up to 5GHz carrier frequency without any\nradiation effect and this upper-bound can be moved to higher frequencies by\ndecreasing the twist lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 12:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

We advocate and develop a special approach\nto residual stresses based on the transition between reference configurations.\nThe finite strain kinematics of the viscoplastic material is modelled by the\nmultiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. Numerical\nalgorithms originally developed for unstressed materials are extended to\nmaterials with pre-stresses. Owing to the weak invariance of constitutive\nequations, the incorporation of pre-stresses happens without additional costs.\nThus, the advocated approach is especially efficient. A novel\nexperimental/theoretical method for assessment of residual stresses in welded\nstructures is presented; the method combines advantages of purely experimental\nand theoretical approaches. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed\nprocedure, we simulate plate welding. As an example we show that the procedure\nallows to extrapolate the filed of residual stresses away from the measurement\npoints. As another example, we address the reduction of weldment-related\nresidual stresses by mechanical treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 13:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}
