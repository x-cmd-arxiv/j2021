Major unresolved questions concern whether any material will yield\nsmoothly and gradually (ductile behaviour) or fail abruptly and\ncatastrophically (brittle behaviour); the roles of sample annealing, disorder\nand shear band formation in the onset of yielding and failure; and, most\nimportantly from a practical viewpoint, whether any impending catastrophic\nfailure can be anticipated before it happens. We address these questions by\nstudying the yielding of slowly sheared athermal amorphous materials, within a\nminimal mesoscopic lattice elastoplastic model. Our contributions are fourfold.\nFirst, we elucidate whether yielding will be ductile or brittle, for any given\nlevel of sample annealing. Second, we show that yielding comprises two distinct\nstages: a pre-failure stage, in which small levels of strain heterogeneity\nslowly accumulate, followed by a catastrophic brittle failure event, in which a\ncrack quickly propagates across the sample via a cooperating line of plastic\nevents. Third, we provide an expression for the slowly growing level of strain\nheterogeneity in the pre-failure stage, expressed in terms of the macroscopic\nstress-strain curve and the sample size, and in excellent agreement with our\nsimulation results. Fourth, we elucidate the basic mechanism via which a crack\nthen nucleates and provide an approximate expression for the probability\ndistribution of shear strains at which failure occurs, as determined by the\ndisorder inherent in the sample, expressed in terms of a single annealing\nparameter, and the system size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 16:43:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 17:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

As\nrecently discussed in [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.156401], the\nBSIE of the CCSD correlation energy is dominated by the second-order\nM{\\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation energy and the particle-particle ladder\nterm.

The evaluation of the derived expressions is simple to implement\nin any existing code. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for the\nuniform electron gas.

The\nmetal pads that form the qubit capacitance support standing wave modes at\nfrequencies of order 100~GHz; these modes are strongly coupled to free-space\nimpedance through their electric dipole moment. While the antenna mode of the\n3D transmon qubit is easily seen to be a resonant dipole, other 2D qubit types\ncan be understood as the aperture duals of wire loop antennas or folded\ndipoles. For typical Josephson junction parameters, the junction provides a\nreasonable conjugate match to the fundamental antenna mode. We calculate the\ncontribution to quasiparticle poisoning from resonant absorption of blackbody\nradiation. We extend our analysis to dissipation at the qubit frequency, where\nradiative losses provide an ultimate limit to qubit energy relaxation time. A\nclear understanding of the spurious antenna modes of qubits will allow designs\nthat are insensitive to pair-breaking radiation and that display reduced\nradiative losses at the qubit frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 17:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 16:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Its effects can be\nidentified based on the evidence of interactions between the radio structures\nand the ambient ionised gas. We investigate this in a sample of 13 optically\nselected type-2 quasars (QSO2) at z<0.2 with FIRST radio detections. None are\nradio loud. All show complex optical morphologies, with signs of distortion\nacross tens of kpc due to mergers/interactions. The radio luminosity has an AGN\ncomponent in 11/13 QSO2. It is spatially extended in 9 of them\n(jets/lobes/bubbles/other). The maximum sizes are in the range few kpc to ~500\nkpc. Evidence for radio-gas interactions exist in 10/13 QSO2; that is, all but\none with confirmed AGN radio components. The interactions are identified across\ndifferent spatial scales, from the nuclear narrow line region up to tens of kpc\nfrom the AGN. Large scale low/modest power radio sources can exist in\nradio-quiet QSO2, which can provide a source of feedback on scales of the\nspheroidal component of galaxies and well into the circumgalactic medium in\nsystems where radiative mode feedback is expected to dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 17:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

We compute the\ntime-averaged (annealed) conductance in the insulating regime and find three\ndistinct insulating phases, separated by two transitions. The first occurs\nbetween a non-resonating insulator and an intermittent metal. The average\nconductance is always dominated by rare temporal fluctuations. However, in the\nintermittent metal, they are so strong that the system becomes metallic for an\nexponentially small fraction of the time. A second transition occurs within\nthat phase. At stronger disorder, there is a single optimal path providing the\ndominant contribution to the conductance at all times, but closer to\ndelocalization, a transition to a phase with fluctuating paths occurs. This\nlast phase displays the quantum analogon of configurational chaos in glassy\nsystems in that thermal fluctuations induce significant changes of the dominant\ndecay channels. While in the insulator the annealed conductance is strictly\nbigger than the conductance with typical, frozen disorder, we show that the\nthreshold to delocalization is insensitive to whether or not thermal\nfluctuations are admitted. This rules out a potential bistability, at fixed\ndisorder, of a localized phase with suppressed internal fluctuations and a\ndelocalized, internally fluctuating phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 17:24:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 13:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The\nsignificant legislation changes currently underway, combined with increased\ncybersecurity requirements, create unique challenges for manufacturers to\ncomply with the regulatory framework.

It provides a well motivated origin for the\nscalar inflaton, the \"scaleron\" with a mass of $O(10^{13})$ GeV, emerging as a\ngraviton degree of freedom from $R^2$ corrections to Einstein-Hilbert gravity.\nHowever the coupling of such a heavy state to the BEH (\"Higgs\") scalar is\nproblematic as its quantum loop corrections can induce an unacceptably large\ncontribution to the radiatively induced BEH scalar mass. The calculation of\nthese corrections is normally done by Weyl transforming to the Einstein frame,\nyet at the quantum level Weyl transformations are fraught with ambiguities.\nHowever the recent realization that there exist \"gravitational contact\ninteractions\" largely sidesteps these ambiguities. Such contact terms are\nnecessarily present, coming from t-channel graviton exchange interactions, and\nthey show that the theory defined in the \"Jordan Frame\" is identical to the\ntheory in the Einstein frame, with additional Planck-scale suppressed\ninteractions that take on the form of a Weyl transformation. This avoids\nambiguous nonlinear field redefinitions, and reliable loop calculations are\npossible leading to a consistent low energy theory in an expansion in $1/M^2$.\nTaking account of the contact terms we study the radiative corrections to the\nBEH mass in the mixed Higgs/$R^2$ model with explicit scale breaking, and in an\nextension of the model in which exact scale symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 17:53:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 11:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Phase shifted Bragg gratings implemented by\nsidewall modulation of photonic nanowire waveguides are a good solution for\non-chip narrowband operation with reasonable requirements in fabrication and\nscalability. In this work we report on their implementation and optimization in\nthin film lithium niobate, a photonic platform that affords reconfigurability\nby exploiting electrooptic effects. The phase-shifted Bragg grating filters\nhave a footprint smaller than 1 {\\mu}m x 1mm and operate at telecom\nwavelengths, featuring extinction ratios up to 25 dB.

One key question is how a metal is incorporated into dust\nfor an environment rich in elements involved in stardust formation (C, H, O,\nSi). To address experimentally this question we have used a radiofrequency cold\nplasma reactor in which cyclic organosilicon dust formation is observed.\nMetallic (silver) atoms were injected in the plasma during the dust nucleation\nphase to study their incorporation in the dust. The experiments show formation\nof silver nanoparticles (~15 nm) under conditions in which organosilicon dust\nof size 200 nm or less is grown. The presence of AgSiO bonds, revealed by\ninfrared spectroscopy, suggests the presence of junctions between the metallic\nnanoparticles and the organosilicon dust. Even after annealing we could not\nconclude on the formation of silver silicates, emphasizing that most of silver\nis included in the metallic nanoparticles.

In the case of a homogeneous tree with a\nclosed terminal node and no resetting, it is known that the system undergoes a\nclassical localization-delocalization (LD) transition at a critical mean\nvelocity $v_c= -(D/L)\\ln (z-1)$ where $D$ is the diffusivity, $L$ is the branch\nlength and $z$ is the coordination number of the tree. If $v <v_c$ then the\nsteady state concentration at the terminal node is non-zero (drift-dominated\nlocalized state), whereas it is zero when $v >v_c $ (diffusion-dominated\ndelocalized state). This is equivalent to the transition between recurrent and\ntransient transport on the tree, with the mean first passage time (MFPT) to be\nabsorbed by an open terminal node switching from a finite value to infinity.\nHere we show how the LD transition provides a basic framework for understanding\nanalogous phase transitions in optimal resetting rates. First, we establish the\nexistence of an optimal resetting rate $r^{**}(z)$ that maximizes the\nsteady-state solution at a closed terminal node. In addition, we show that\nthere is a phase transition at a critical velocity $v_c^{**}(z)$ such that\n$r^{**}>0$ for $v>v_c^{**}$ and $r^{**}=0$ for $v<v_c^{**}$. We then identify a\ncritical velocity $v^*(z)$ for a phase transition in a second optimal resetting\nrate $r^*$ that minimizes the MFPT to be absorbed by an open terminal node.\nPrevious results for the semi-infinite line are recovered on setting $z=2$. The\ncritical velocity of the LD transition provides an upper bound for the other\ncritical velocities such that $v_c^*(z)<v_c^{**}(z)<v_c(z)$ for all finite $z$.\nOnly $v_c(z)$ has a simple universal dependence on the coordination number $z$.\nWe end by considering the combined effects of quenched disorder and stochastic\nresetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 18:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, these\nmethods have inherent limitations: (1) statistical inferences about the\nassociations are often not robust; (2) the associations within each data\nmodality are not modelled; (3) missing values need to be imputed or removed.\nGroup Factor Analysis (GFA) is a hierarchical model that addresses the first\ntwo limitations by providing Bayesian inference and modelling modality-specific\nassociations. Here, we propose an extension of GFA that handles missing data,\nand highlight that GFA can be used as a predictive model. We applied GFA to\nsynthetic and real data consisting of brain connectivity and non-imaging\nmeasures from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

We\npresent the results of follow-up observations of the $z=6.515$ radio-quiet QSO\nPSO167-13, which is interacting with a close companion galaxy. The PSO167-13\nsystem has been recently proposed to host the first heavily obscured X-ray\nsource at high redshift. We observed PSO167-13 with Chandra/ACIS-S (177 ks),\nand obtained new spectroscopic observations (7.2 h) with Magellan/FIRE. No\nsignificant X-ray emission is detected from the PSO167-13 system, suggesting\nthat the obscured X-ray source previously tentatively detected was either due\nto a strong background fluctuation or is highly variable. The upper limit (90%\nconfidence level) on the X-ray emission of PSO167-13\n($L_{2-10\\,\\mathrm{keV}}<8.3\\times10^{43}\\,\\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$) is the lowest\navailable for a $z>6$ QSO.

In particular, its\nX-ray emission is $>6$ times weaker than the expectation based on its UV\nluminosity. The new Magellan/FIRE spectrum of PSO167-13 is strongly affected by\nthe unfavorable sky conditions, but the tentatively detected C IV and Mg II\nemission lines appear strongly blueshifted. The most plausible explanations for\nthe X-ray weakness of PSO167-13 are intrinsic weakness or small-scale\nabsorption by Compton-thick material. The possible strong blueshift of its\nemission lines hints at the presence of nuclear winds, which could be related\nto its X-ray weakness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 19:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Such\ndifferences are the basis for the categorization of anaphoric expressions\naccording to their anaphoric capacity, being important to determine what are\nthe sets of admissible antecedents and how to represent and process this\nanaphoric capacity for each type of anaphor.\n  From an empirical perspective, these constraints stem from what appears as\nquite cogent generalisations and exhibit a universal character, given their\ncross linguistic validity. From a conceptual point of view, in turn, the\nrelations among binding constraints involve non-trivial cross symmetry, which\nlends them a modular nature and provides further strength to the plausibility\nof their universal character.

Through detailed\nnumerical simulations, we study the role of thermal flipping on the grain\ndynamics during periods of relatively slow rotation, known as `crossovers', for\nthe special case of a spheroidal grain with a non-uniform mass distribution.\nLazarian & Draine proposed that rapid flipping during a crossover would lead to\n`thermal trapping', in which a systematic torque, fixed relative to the grain\nbody, would time average to zero, delaying spin-up to larger rotational speeds.\nWe find that the time-averaged systematic torque is not zero during the\ncrossover and that thermal trapping is not prevalent. As an application, we\nexamine whether the classic Davis-Greenstein alignment mechanism is viable, for\ngrains residing in the cold neutral medium and lacking superparamagnetic\ninclusions. We find that Davis-Greenstein alignment is not hindered by thermal\ntrapping, but argue that it is, nevertheless, too inefficient to yield the\nalignment of large grains responsible for optical and infrared starlight\npolarization. Davis-Greenstein alignment of small grains could potentially\ncontribute to the observed ultraviolet polarization.

In previous work, we showed that when\nendowed with an additional low-rank connectivity consisting of the outer\nproduct of orthogonal vectors, these networks generate large-scale coherent\nfluctuations. Although a striking phenomenon, that result depended on a\nfine-tuned choice of low-rank structure. Here we extend that work by\ngeneralizing the theory of excitation-inhibition balance to networks with\narbitrary low-rank structure and show that low-dimensional variability emerges\nintrinsically through what we call incomplete recurrent alignment. We say that\na low-rank connectivity structure exhibits incomplete alignment if its\nrow-space is not contained in its column-space. In the setting of incomplete\nalignment, recurrent connectivity can be decomposed into a subspace-recurrent\ncomponent and an effective-feedforward component.

In\nthis paper, we give a general formulation, where no simplifying assumption\nabout the background metric is made, and show that the gauge theory source is\naffected by a curvature term that characterizes the deviation of the background\nspacetime from a constant curvature spacetime. We demonstrate this effect\nexplicitly by studying gravitational solutions with non-zero cosmological\nconstant. We show that, when the background is flat, the constant charge\ndensity filling all space in the gauge theory that has been observed in\nprevious works is a consequence of this curvature term. As an example of a\nsolution with a curved background, we study the Lifshitz black hole with two\ndifferent matter couplings. The curvature of the background, i.e., the Lifshitz\nspacetime, again yields a constant charge density; however, unlike the previous\nexamples, it is canceled by the contribution from the matter fields.

In this work, we propose a\nhighly effective use of the surface-GKP code, i.e., the surface code consisting\nof bosonic GKP qubits instead of bare two-dimensional qubits. In our proposal,\nwe use error-corrected two-qubit gates between GKP qubits and introduce a\nmaximum likelihood decoding strategy for correcting shift errors in the\ntwo-GKP-qubit gates. Our proposed decoding reduces the total CNOT failure rate\nof the GKP qubits, e.g., from $0.87\\%$ to $0.36\\%$ at a GKP squeezing of\n$12$dB, compared to the case where the simple closest-integer decoding is used.\nThen, by concatenating the GKP code with the surface code, we find that the\nthreshold GKP squeezing is given by $9.9$dB under the the assumption that\nfinite-squeezing of the GKP states is the dominant noise source. More\nimportantly, we show that a low logical failure rate $p_{L} < 10^{-7}$ can be\nachieved with moderate hardware requirements, e.g., $291$ modes and $97$ qubits\nat a GKP squeezing of $12$dB as opposed to $1457$ bare qubits for the standard\nrotated surface code at an equivalent noise level (i.e., $p=0.36\\%$). Such a\nlow failure rate of our surface-GKP code is possible through the use of\nspace-time correlated edges in the matching graphs of the surface code decoder.\nFurther, all edge weights in the matching graphs are computed dynamically based\non analog information from the GKP error correction using the full history of\nall syndrome measurement rounds. We also show that a highly-squeezed GKP state\nof GKP squeezing $\\gtrsim 12$dB can be experimentally realized by using a\ndissipative stabilization method, namely, the Big-small-Big method, with fairly\nconservative experimental parameters. Lastly, we introduce a three-level\nancilla scheme to mitigate ancilla decay errors during a GKP state preparation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 23:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 05:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

We find a typical mass fraction of\n$M_{\\textrm{DM}}$/$M_{\\textrm{DYN}}$ = 62\\%, and find significant correlations\nbetween $M_{\\textrm{BH}}$ $-$ $M_{\\textrm{DYN}}$ and $M_{\\textrm{BH}}$ $-$\n$M_{\\textrm{DM}}$. Finally, we scale our galaxy radii based on estimated\nrelationships between visible and halo radii and assume a flat rotation curve\nout to the halo radius to approximate $M_{\\textrm{HALO}}$. Over the range of\n$M_{\\textrm{BH}}$ and $M_{\\textrm{HALO}}$ in this sample, we find good\nagreement with observationally-constrained relationships between\n$M_{\\textrm{BH}}$ and $M_{\\textrm{HALO}}$ and with hydrodynamical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 23:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Because of transmission\nat the same time and on the same frequency band, the signal from the local\ntransmitter creates self-interference (SI) that contaminates the signal from\nthe remote transmitter. At the local receiver, channel state information for\nboth the SI and remote channels is required to remove the SI and equalize the\nSI-free signal, respectively. However, because of the rapid time-variations of\nthe UWA environment, real-time tracking of the channels is necessary. In this\npaper, we propose a receiver for UWA-FD communication in which the variations\nof the SI and remote channels are jointly tracked by using a recursive least\nsquares (RLS) algorithm fed by feedback from the previously detected data\nsymbols. Because of the joint channel estimation, SI cancellation is more\nsuccessful compared to UWA-FD receivers with separate channel estimators. In\naddition, due to providing a real-time channel tracking without the need for\nfrequent training sequences, the bandwidth efficiency is preserved in the\nproposed receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 23:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

To\ncalibrate these confidences, we propose a confidence ranking network with a\npairwise ranking loss to re-rank the predicted confidences locally within the\nsame image. Our confidence ranker is model-agnostic, so we can augment the data\nby choosing the pairs from multiple face detectors during the training, and\ngeneralize to a wide range of face detectors during the testing. On WiderFace,\nwe achieve the highest AP on the single-scale, and our AP is competitive with\nthe previous multi-scale methods while being significantly faster. On 8K\nresolution, our method solves the GPU memory issue and allows us to indirectly\ntrain on 8K. We collect 8K resolution test set to show the improvement, and we\nwill release our test set as a new benchmark for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Inspired by the\ninterleaving learning technique of humans, in this paper we explore whether\nthis learning methodology is beneficial for improving the performance of\nmachine learning models as well. We propose a novel machine learning framework\nreferred to as interleaving learning (IL). In our framework, a set of models\ncollaboratively learn a data encoder in an interleaving fashion: the encoder is\ntrained by model 1 for a while, then passed to model 2 for further training,\nthen model 3, and so on; after trained by all models, the encoder returns back\nto model 1 and is trained again, then moving to model 2, 3, etc. This process\nrepeats for multiple rounds. Our framework is based on multi-level optimization\nconsisting of multiple inter-connected learning stages. An efficient\ngradient-based algorithm is developed to solve the multi-level optimization\nproblem.

We propose a new impulse control\nframework to tackle this issue based on a simple but new stochastic growth\nmodel of individual fishes. The novel growth model governing individuals' body\nweights uses a Wright-Fisher model as a latent driver to reproduce plausible\ngrowth dynamics. The optimization problem is formulated as an impulse control\nproblem of a cost-benefit functional constrained by a degenerate parabolic\nFokker-Planck equation of the stochastic growth dynamics.

A common approach is to minor embed the\ndesired Hamiltonian in a native Hamiltonian. In Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023020\n(2020) it was shown that minor embedding can be detrimental for classical\nthermal sampling. Here, we generalize these results by considering quantum\nthermal sampling in the transverse-field Ising model, i.e. sampling a\nHamiltonian with non-zero off diagonal terms. To study these systems\nnumerically we introduce a modification to standard cluster update quantum\nMonte-Carlo (QMC) techniques, which allows us to much more efficiently obtain\nthermal samples of an embedded Hamiltonian, enabling us to simulate systems of\nmuch larger sizes and larger transverse-field strengths than would otherwise be\npossible. Our numerics focus on models that can be implemented on current\nquantum devices using planar two-dimensional lattices, which exhibit\nfinite-temperature quantum phase transitions. Our results include: i) An\nestimate on the probability to sample the logical subspace directly as a\nfunction of transverse-field, temperature, and total system size, which agrees\nwith QMC simulations. ii) We show that typically measured observables (diagonal\nenergy and magnetization) are biased by the embedding process, in the regime of\nintermediate transverse field strength, meaning that the extracted values are\nnot the same as in the native model. iii) By considering individual embedding\nrealizations akin to 'realizations of disorder', we provide numerical evidence\nsuggesting that as the embedding size is increased, the critical point shifts\nto increasingly large values of the transverse-field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 01:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 22:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Previous methods suffer from inefficient category-level\npose feature extraction which leads to low accuracy and inference speed. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a fast shape-based network (FS-Net) with\nefficient category-level feature extraction for 6D pose estimation. First, we\ndesign an orientation aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent\nfeature extraction. The learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift\nand object size thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of the 3D\ngraph convolution. Then, to efficiently decode category-level rotation\ninformation from the latent feature, we propose a novel decoupled rotation\nmechanism that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation\ninformation. Meanwhile, we estimate translation and size by two residuals,\nwhich are the difference between the mean of object points and ground truth\ntranslation, and the difference between the mean size of the category and\nground truth size, respectively.

For such\nissues, a common thread of research uses adversarial reactions, e.g., replies\npointing out factual inaccuracies in rumors. Though adversarial reactions are\nprevalent in online conversations, inferring those adverse views (or stance)\nfrom the text in replies is difficult and requires complex natural language\nprocessing (NLP) models. Moreover, conventional NLP models for stance mining\nneed labeled data for supervised learning. Getting labeled conversations can\nitself be challenging as conversations can be on any topic, and topics change\nover time. These challenges make learning the stance a difficult NLP problem.\n  In this research, we first create a new stance dataset comprised of three\ndifferent topics by labeling both users' opinions on the topics (as in pro/con)\nand users' stance while replying to others' posts (as in favor/oppose). As we\nfind limitations with supervised approaches, we propose a weakly-supervised\napproach to predict the stance in Twitter replies.

Using multiperspective observations\nfrom the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board SDO and the Extreme Ultraviolet\nImager on board STEREO, we reconstructed 3D coordinates of three stable\nprominences: a quiescent, an intermediate, and a mixed type.

The HF\ntheory requires nuclear physics input such as masses, level densities,\n$\\gamma$-ray strength functions and proton-nucleus optical potentials (pOMP).\nThe scope of this work is to improve a global semi-microscopic pOMP at energies\nrelevant to the p-process. This is achieved by adjusting the normalization\nparameters of the OMP to all available proton-capture cross sections measured\nat low energies. By establishing the systematic behaviour of these parameters,\none expects to enhance the predictive power of the pOMP when expanding to mass\nregions where no data exists. The HF calculations were obtained using TALYS\ncode. The normalization parameters for the real and imaginary central\npotentials ($\\lambda_V$ and $\\lambda_W$) were adjusted to fit the proton data\nin the energy range where the cross-section are independent of the other\nnuclear inputs.

Three\nclasses of electrolyte solution are then distinguished: (i) 'Strong'\nelectrolytes with 4{\\Lambda}_mass \\approx {\\Lambda}_charge; (ii) 'weak charge\ntransport electrolytes' with {\\Lambda}_charge << 4{\\Lambda}_mass; and (iii)\n'weak mass transport electrolytes' with 4{\\Lambda}_mass << {\\Lambda}_charge.\nWhile classes (i) and (ii) encompass the classical 'strong' and 'weak'\nelectrolytes, respectively, many highly concentrated electrolytes fall into\nclass (iii) and thus exhibit transport properties clearly distinct from\nclassical 'strong' and 'weak' electrolytes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

We argue that generating putative 2D-3D\ncorrespondences 1) leads to an important loss of information that needs to be\ncompensated as far as possible, within RE, through the choice of a robust loss\nand the tuning of its hyperparameters and 2) may lead to an RE that conveys\nerroneous data to the pose estimator. In this paper, we introduce the Neural\nReprojection Error (NRE) as a substitute for RE. NRE allows to rethink the\ncamera pose estimation problem by merging it with the feature learning problem,\nhence leveraging richer information than 2D-3D correspondences and eliminating\nthe need for choosing a robust loss and its hyperparameters. Thus NRE can be\nused as training loss to learn image descriptors tailored for pose estimation.\nWe also propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method able to very efficiently\nminimize a sum of NRE terms with respect to the camera pose.

To this end we present and study an adaptive version of\nthe ADMM which incorporates generalized notions of convexity and varying\npenalty parameters adapted to the convexity constants of the functions. We\nprove convergence of the scheme under natural assumptions. To this end we\nemploy the recent adaptive Douglas--Rachford algorithm by revisiting the well\nknown duality relation between the classical ADMM and the Douglas--Rachford\nsplitting algorithm, generalizing this connection to our setting. We illustrate\nour approach by relating and comparing to alternatives, and by numerical\nexperiments on a signal denoising problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 09:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 18:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

In this paper, we\npropose a Multi-Modal Transformer-based (MMTrans) code summarization approach\nfor smart contracts. Specifically, the MMTrans learns the representation of\nsource code from the two heterogeneous modalities of the Abstract Syntax Tree\n(AST), i.e., Structure-based Traversal (SBT) sequences and graphs. The SBT\nsequence provides the global semantic information of AST, while the graph\nconvolution focuses on the local details. The MMTrans uses two encoders to\nextract both global and local semantic information from the two modalities\nrespectively, and then uses a joint decoder to generate code comments. Both the\nencoders and the decoder employ the multi-head attention structure of the\nTransformer to enhance the ability to capture the long-range dependencies\nbetween code tokens. We build a dataset with over 300K <method, comment> pairs\nof smart contracts, and evaluate the MMTrans on it.

Researchers and industry prefer to use end-to-end ASR systems for\non-device speech recognition tasks. This is because end-to-end systems can be\nmade resource-efficient while maintaining a higher quality compared to hybrid\nsystems. However, building end-to-end models requires a significant amount of\nspeech data. Another challenging task associated with speech assistants is\npersonalization, which mainly lies in handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.\nIn this work, we consider building an effective end-to-end ASR system in\nlow-resource setups with a high OOV rate, embodied in Babel Turkish and Babel\nGeorgian tasks. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a method of\ndynamic acoustic unit augmentation based on the BPE-dropout technique.

We thus solve the second part of\nHilbert's 16th problem providing a uniform upper bound for the number of limit\ncycles which only depends on the degree of the polynomial differential system.\nWe would like to highlight that the bound is sharp for quadratic systems\nyielding a maximum of four limit cycles for such subclass of differential\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 10:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

This study considers the pricing\nand fulfillment strategies of a retailer that has two sales channels: online\nand one physical store. The retailer offers consumers three purchasing options:\ndelivery from the fulfillment center, buy online and pick up in-store (BOPS),\nand purchasing at the store. Consumers choose one of these options to maximize\ntheir utility, dividing them into several segments. Given the retailer can\ninduce consumers to the profitable segment by adjusting the online and store\nprices, our analysis shows that it has three optimal strategies: (1) The\nretailer excludes consumers far from the physical store from the market and\nlets the others choose BOPS or purchasing at the store. (2) It lets consumers\nfar from the physical store choose delivery from the fulfillment center and the\nothers choose BOPS or purchasing at the store.

Finally, we present simple dynamic\nsimulations that considers how the retailer's optimal strategy changes as\nconsumers' subjective probability of believing the product is in stock\ndecreases. The results show that the retailer should offer BOPS in later\nperiods of the selling season to maximize its profit as the subjective\nprobability decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 11:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

The challenge is to find a\nmaterial system that exhibits both a high charge-carrier density and mobility,\nat and even above room temperature. Here, we explore the potential of\ninterfaces formed by two lattice-matched wide-gap oxides of emerging interest,\n$\\textit{i.e.}$, the polar, orthorhombic perovskite LaInO$_{3}$ and the\nnon-polar, cubic perovskite BaSnO$_{3}$, employing density-functional theory\nand many-body theory. We demonstrate that this material combination exhibits\nall the key features for reaching the goal. For periodic heterostructures, we\nfind that the polar discontinuity at the interface is mainly compensated by\nelectronic relaxation through charge transfer from the LaInO$_{3}$ to the\nBaSnO$_{3}$ side. This leads to the formation of a 2DEG hosted by the\nhighly-dispersive Sn-$s$-derived conduction band and a 2D hole gas of O-$p$\ncharacter, strongly localized inside LaInO$_{3}$. Remarkably, structural\ndistortions through octahedra tilts induce a depolarization field counteracting\nthe polar discontinuity, and thus increasing the $critical$ (minimal)\nLaInO$_{3}$ thickness, $t_c$, required for the formation of a 2DEG. These polar\ndistortions decrease with increasing LaInO$_{3}$ thickness, enhancing the polar\ndiscontinuity and leading to a 2DEG density of 0.5 electron per unit-cell\nsurface. Interestingly, in non-periodic heterostructures, these distortions\nlead to a decrease of $t_c$, thereby enhancing and delocalizing the 2DEG. We\nrationalize how polar distortions, termination, and thickness can be exploited\nin view of tailoring the 2DEG characteristics, and why this material is\nsuperior to the most studied prototype LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 11:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 21:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

To address this issue, we\nintroduce discriminative region suppression (DRS) module that is a simple yet\neffective method to expand object activation regions.

Animals use sound for communication, mating, navigation and territorial\ndefence. Animal sounds provide valuable information and help conservationists\nto quantify biodiversity. Acoustic monitoring has grown in popularity due to\nthe availability of diverse sensor types which include camera traps, portable\nacoustic sensors, passive acoustic sensors, and even smartphones. Passive\nacoustic sensors are easy to deploy and can be left running for long durations\nto provide insights on habitat and the sounds made by animals and illegal\nactivity. While this technology brings enormous benefits, the amount of data\nthat is generated makes processing a time-consuming process for\nconservationists. Consequently, there is interest among conservationists to\nautomatically process acoustic data to help speed up biodiversity assessments.\nProcessing these large data sources and extracting relevant sounds from\nbackground noise introduces significant challenges. In this paper we outline an\napproach for achieving this using state of the art in machine learning to\nautomatically extract features from time-series audio signals and modelling\ndeep learning models to classify different bird species based on the sounds\nthey make. The acquired bird songs are processed using mel-frequency cepstrum\n(MFC) to extract features which are later classified using a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP).

To better characterize the node\nrelationships and further facilitate the learning of node representation, an\nintuitive way is to refine the originally given graph structure with the\nembedded node representations.

For\nexample, these vectorial representations can be employed for optimization as\nwell as uncertainty representation on groups. The most common mapping is the\nmatrix exponential, which maps elements of a Lie algebra onto the associated\nLie group. However, this choice is not unique.

Images and Point\nClouds (PCs) are fundamental data representations, particularly in urban\nmapping applications. Textured 3D meshes integrate both data representations\ngeometrically by wiring the PC and texturing the surface elements with\navailable imagery. We present a mesh-centered holistic geometry-driven\nmethodology that explicitly integrates entities of imagery, PC and mesh. Due to\nits integrative character, we choose the mesh as the core representation that\nalso helps to solve the visibility problem for points in imagery. Utilizing the\nproposed multi-modal fusion as the backbone and considering the established\nentity relationships, we enable the sharing of information across the\nmodalities imagery, PC and mesh in a two-fold manner: (i) feature transfer and\n(ii) label transfer. By these means, we achieve to enrich feature vectors to\nmulti-modal feature vectors for each representation. Concurrently, we achieve\nto label all representations consistently while reducing the manual label\neffort to a single representation. Consequently, we facilitate to train machine\nlearning algorithms and to semantically segment any of these data\nrepresentations - both in a multi-modal and single-modal sense. The paper\npresents the association mechanism and the subsequent information transfer,\nwhich we believe are cornerstones for multi-modal scene analysis.

Topological\npersistence which provides a set of birth and death pairs for the topological\nfeatures is one instrument for analyzing such changing graph data. However,\nstandard persistent homology defined over a growing space cannot always capture\nsuch a dynamic process unless shrinking with deletions is also allowed. Hence,\nzigzag persistence which incorporates both insertions and deletions of\nsimplices is more appropriate in such a setting. Unlike standard persistence\nwhich admits nearly linear-time algorithms for graphs, such results for the\nzigzag version improving the general $O(m^\\omega)$ time complexity are not\nknown, where $\\omega< 2.37286$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. In this\npaper, we propose algorithms for zigzag persistence on graphs which run in\nnear-linear time. Specifically, given a filtration with $m$ additions and\ndeletions on a graph with $n$ vertices and edges, the algorithm for\n$0$-dimension runs in $O(m\\log^2 n+m\\log m)$ time and the algorithm for\n1-dimension runs in $O(m\\log^4 n)$ time. The algorithm for $0$-dimension draws\nupon another algorithm designed originally for pairing critical points of Morse\nfunctions on $2$-manifolds. The algorithm for $1$-dimension pairs a negative\nedge with the earliest positive edge so that a $1$-cycle containing both edges\nresides in all intermediate graphs. Both algorithms achieve the claimed time\ncomplexity via dynamic graph data structures proposed by Holm et al. In the\nend, using Alexander duality, we extend the algorithm for $0$-dimension to\ncompute the $(p-1)$-dimensional zigzag persistence for $\\mathbb{R}^p$-embedded\ncomplexes in $O(m\\log^2 n+m\\log m+n\\log n)$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 15:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Our\ncentral insight is that, starting from a coherent spin state, a generic\n$U(1)$-symmetric Hamiltonian featuring the Anderson's tower of states generates\nthe same squeezing evolution at short times as the one governed by the\nparadigmatic one-axis-twisting (or planar-rotor) model of squeezing dynamics.\nThe full squeezing evolution of the planar-rotor model is seemingly reproduced\nfor interactions decaying with distance $r$ as $r^{-\\alpha}$ when $\\alpha <\n5d/3$ in $d$ dimensions.

Conventional 2D\nCNNs are computationally cheap but cannot catch temporal relationships; 3D CNNs\ncan achieve good performance but are computationally intensive. In this work,\nwe tackle this dilemma by designing a generic and effective module that can be\nembedded into 2D CNNs. To this end, we propose a spAtio-temporal, Channel and\nmoTion excitatION (ACTION) module consisting of three paths: Spatio-Temporal\nExcitation (STE) path, Channel Excitation (CE) path, and Motion Excitation (ME)\npath. The STE path employs one channel 3D convolution to characterize\nspatio-temporal representation. The CE path adaptively recalibrates\nchannel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between\nchannels in terms of the temporal aspect. The ME path calculates feature-level\ntemporal differences, which is then utilized to excite motion-sensitive\nchannels. We equip 2D CNNs with the proposed ACTION module to form a simple yet\neffective ACTION-Net with very limited extra computational cost.

Then these equations are recast in a form that allows one\nto interpret them as the fundamental dynamical equations for particles with\nfractional spin, which we study in detail for the case of $N=4$ and $N=3$. We\nexplicitly prove that the equation is invariant to rotations and boosts and\nindeed represents spin-$\\frac{3}{8}$ and spin-$\\frac{1}{8}$ particles for $N=4$\nand spin-$\\frac{1}{6}$ and $0$ for $N=3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 03:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

If the physical current density ${\\bf\nj}=(-ie\\hbar/2m)(\\Psi^* \\nabla \\Psi- \\Psi \\nabla \\Psi^*)$ is not locally\nconserved but can be re-adjusted by a non-local term, which current should be\nregarded as real? We prove that the extended Maxwell equations by Aharonov-Bohm\ngive the e.m.\\ field generated by such currents without any ambiguity. For an\noscillating dipole we show that the radiated electrical field has a\nlongitudinal component proportional to $ \\omega \\hat{P}$, where $\\hat{P}$ is\nthe anomalous moment $\\int \\hat{I}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x} d^3x$ and $\\hat{I}$ is\nthe space-dependent part of the anomaly $I=\\partial_t \\rho+\\nabla \\cdot\n\\mathbf{j}$. In the case of a stationary current in a molecular device, a\nfailure of local current conservation causes a \"missing field\" effect that can\nbe experimentally observable, especially if its entity depends on the total\ncurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 11:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}
