The typical space velocities of\nseveral hundred km/s have been attributed to \"kicks\" resulting from asymmetries\neither in the supernova ejecta or in the neutrino emission. Observations have\nshown a strong tendency for alignment of the pulsar space velocity and spin\naxis in young pulsars but, up to now, these comparisons have been restricted to\ntwo dimensions. We report here the first evidence for three-dimensional\nalignment between the spin and velocity vectors, largely based on observations\nmade with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope of the\npulsar PSR~J0538+2817 and its associated supernova remnant S147. Analysis of\nthese and related observations has enabled us to determine the location of the\npulsar within the supernova remnant and hence its radial velocity. Current\nsimulations of supernova explosions have difficulty producing such\nthree-dimensional alignment. Our results, which depend on the unprecedented\nsensitivity of the new observations, add another dimension to the intriguing\ncorrelation between pulsar spin-axis and birth-kick directions, thus deepening\nthe mysteries surrounding the birth of neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 16:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Leveraging recent works obtaining a tractable\nsafety maximizing plan for a single robot, we propose a scalable two-stage\nframework to solve the problem at hand. Specifically, the problem is split into\na low-level single-agent control problem and a high-level task allocation\nproblem. The low-level problem uses an efficient approximation of stochastic\nreachability for a Markov decision process to derive the optimal control policy\nunder dynamic uncertainty. The task allocation is solved using polynomial-time\nforward and reverse greedy heuristics and in a distributed auction-based\nmanner. By leveraging the properties of our safety objective function, we\nprovide provable performance bounds on the safety of the approximate solutions\nproposed by these two heuristics.

Method: We further analyse responses from a\npreviously conducted attitudinal survey of 44 software engineering researchers.\nWe conduct a heatmap analysis, simple statistical analysis, and a thematic\nanalysis. Results: We find no clear consensus from respondents on researchers'\nattitudes to the credibility of blog posts, or on a standard set of criteria to\nevaluate blog-post credibility.

When graphs are modeling relations between\npeople, however, they will inevitably reflect biases, prejudices, and other\nforms of inequity and inequality. An important challenge is thus to design\naccurate graph modeling approaches while guaranteeing fairness according to the\nspecific notion of fairness that the problem requires. Yet, past work on the\ntopic remains scarce, is limited to debiasing specific graph modeling methods,\nand often aims to ensure fairness in an indirect manner.\n  We propose a generic approach applicable to most probabilistic graph modeling\napproaches. Specifically, we first define the class of fair graph models\ncorresponding to a chosen set of fairness criteria. Given this, we propose a\nfairness regularizer defined as the KL-divergence between the graph model and\nits I-projection onto the set of fair models. We demonstrate that using this\nfairness regularizer in combination with existing graph modeling approaches\nefficiently trades-off fairness with accuracy, whereas the state-of-the-art\nmodels can only make this trade-off for the fairness criterion that they were\nspecifically designed for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 16:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 14:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

We observe that\nup-sampling is a necessary step of most face forgery techniques, and cumulative\nup-sampling will result in obvious changes in the frequency domain, especially\nin the phase spectrum. According to the property of natural images, the phase\nspectrum preserves abundant frequency components that provide extra information\nand complement the loss of the amplitude spectrum. To this end, we present a\nnovel Spatial-Phase Shallow Learning (SPSL) method, which combines spatial\nimage and phase spectrum to capture the up-sampling artifacts of face forgery\nto improve the transferability, for face forgery detection. And we also\ntheoretically analyze the validity of utilizing the phase spectrum. Moreover,\nwe notice that local texture information is more crucial than high-level\nsemantic information for the face forgery detection task. So we reduce the\nreceptive fields by shallowing the network to suppress high-level features and\nfocus on the local region.

Our RME depends on three\nparameters: the network size $n$, the size of the smaller set $m$, and the\nconnectivity between the two sets $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the ratio of\ncurrent adjacent pairs over the total number of possible adjacent pairs between\nthe sets. We focus on the the spectral, eigenvector and topological properties\nof the RME by computing, respectively, the ratio of consecutive eigenvalue\nspacings $r$, the Shannon entropy of the eigenvectors $S$, and the Randi\\'c\nindex $R$. First, within a random matrix theory approach (i.e., a statistical\napproach), we identify a parameter $\\xi\\equiv\\xi(n,m,\\alpha)$ that scales the\naverage normalized measures $\\left< \\overline{X} \\right>$ (with $X$\nrepresenting $r$, $S$ and $R$). Specifically, we show that (i) $\\xi\\propto\n\\alpha n$ with a weak dependence on $m$, and (ii) for $\\xi<1/10$ most vertices\nin the mutualistic network are isolated, while for $\\xi>10$ the network\nacquires the properties of a complete network, i.e., the transition from\nisolated vertices to a complete-like behavior occurs in the interval\n$1/10<\\xi<10$. Then, we demonstrate that our statistical approach predicts\nreasonably well the properties of real-world mutualistic networks; that is, the\nuniversal curves $\\left< \\overline{X} \\right>$ vs. $\\xi$ show good\ncorrespondence with the properties of real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 18:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Most of current research in ESC focuses on\ndesigning deep models with special architectures tailored for specific audio\ndatasets, which usually cannot exploit the intrinsic patterns in the data.\nHowever recent studies have surprisingly shown that transfer learning from\nmodels trained on ImageNet is a very effective technique in ESC. Herein, we\npropose SoundCLR, a supervised contrastive learning method for effective\nenvironment sound classification with state-of-the-art performance, which works\nby learning representations that disentangle the samples of each class from\nthose of other classes. Our deep network models are trained by combining a\ncontrastive loss that contributes to a better probability output by the\nclassification layer with a cross-entropy loss on the output of the classifier\nlayer to map the samples to their respective 1-hot encoded labels. Due to the\ncomparatively small sizes of the available environmental sound datasets, we\npropose and exploit a transfer learning and strong data augmentation pipeline\nand apply the augmentations on both the sound signals and their log-mel\nspectrograms before inputting them to the model. Our experiments show that our\nmasking based augmentation technique on the log-mel spectrograms can\nsignificantly improve the recognition performance.

Cannon in\nhis \"The wisdom of the body\" (1932) used the engineering vision of regulation.\nIn 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This\nterm causes much debate when one takes it literally, i.e. as a sort of energy.\nSelye did not use the language of mathematics, but the formalization of his\nphenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to\nverifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in\nsystems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and\nthe universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors\nwas discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious\nsymptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and\nvolatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many\nobservations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial\ntime series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new\nexperiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of\ndepression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were\ndeveloped: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several\nfamilies of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of\nmodels was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness\nestimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor\nbifurcation and on the advection--diffusion model for distribution of\npopulation in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of\nmodels and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention\nto the results of the last ten years and open questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 18:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 02:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Many LIM applications crucially rely on cross-correlations of two line\nintensity maps, or of intensity maps with galaxy surveys or galaxy/CMB lensing.\nWe present a consistent halo model to predict all these cross-correlations and\nenable joint analyses, in 3D redshift-space and for 2D projected maps. We\nextend the conditional luminosity function formalism to the multi-line case, to\nconsistently account for correlated scatter between multiple galaxy line\nluminosities. This allows us to model the scale-dependent decorrelation between\ntwo line intensity maps, a key input for foreground rejection and for\napproaches that estimate auto-spectra from cross-spectra. This also enables LIM\ncross-correlations to reveal astrophysical properties of the interstellar\nmedium inacessible with LIM auto-spectra. We expose the different sources of\nluminosity scatter or \"line noise\" in LIM, and clarify their effects on the\n1-halo and galaxy shot noise terms.

We investigate how the\nmultiplicity distributions and orbital periods of planetary systems depend on\nthe 6D phase space density of stars surrounding planet host systems. We find\nthat stars in high stellar phase space density environments (overdensities)\nhave a factor 1.6 - 2.0 excess in the number of single planet systems compared\nto stars in low stellar phase space density environments (the field). The\nmultiplicity distribution of planets around field stars is much flatter (i.e.\nthere is a greater fraction of multi-planet systems) than in overdensities.\nThis result is primarily driven by the combined facts that: (i) `hot Jupiters'\n(HJs) are almost exclusively found in overdensities; (ii) HJs are predominantly\nobserved to be single-planet systems. Nevertheless, we find that the difference\nin multiplicity is even more pronounced when only considering planets in the\nKepler sample, which contains few HJs. This suggests that the Kepler dichotomy\n-- an apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet -- plausibly\narises from environmental perturbations. In overdensities, the orbital periods\nof single-planet systems are smaller than orbital periods of multiple-planet\nsystems. As this difference is more pronounced in overdensities, the mechanism\nresponsible for this effect may be enhanced by stellar clustering. Taken\ntogether, the pronounced dependence of planetary multiplicity and orbital\nperiod distributions on stellar clustering provides a potentially powerful tool\nto diagnose the impact of environment on the formation and evolution of\nplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Capabilities\nof the PTROM method are demonstrated on the two-dimensional fluid-dynamic\nBiot-Savart kernel within a parametric and reproductive setting. Results show\nthe PTROM is capable of achieving over 2000$\\times$ wall-time speed-up with\nrespect to the full-order model, where the speed-up increases with $N$. The\nresulting solution delivers quantities of interest with errors that are less\nthan 0.1$\\%$ with respect to full-order model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 19:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 15:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

The temperature inversion mechanism is a\npuzzle over 30 years old that has defied conventional explanations. One\nhypothesis is a unipolar inductor that achieves surface heating via ohmic\ndissipation of a current loop between a conducting planet and a magnetic white\ndwarf. To investigate this model, new time-resolved spectroscopy,\nspectropolarimetry, and photometry of the prototype GD 356 are studied. The\nemission features vary in strength on the rotational period, but in anti-phase\nwith the light curve, consistent with a cool surface spot beneath an optically\nthin chromosphere. Possible changes in the line profiles are observed at the\nsame photometric phase, potentially suggesting modest evolution of the emission\nregion, while the magnetic field varies by 10 per cent over a full rotation.\nThese comprehensive data reveal neither changes to the photometric period, nor\nadditional signals such as might be expected from an orbiting body. A closer\nexamination of the unipolar inductor model finds points of potential failure:\nthe observed rapid stellar rotation will inhibit current carriers due to the\ncentrifugal force, there may be no supply of magnetospheric ions, and no\nanti-phase flux changes are expected from ohmic surface heating. Together with\nthe highly similar properties of the four cool, emission-line white dwarfs,\nthese facts indicate that the chromospheric emission is intrinsic. A\ntantalizing possibility is that intrinsic chromospheres may manifest in\n(magnetic) white dwarfs, and in distinct parts of the HR diagram based on\nstructure and composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 19:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

After the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the\nmasses and physical fields of the particle content are obtained. The fermions\ncontent of the 331 model is enlarged to include exotic quarks with known\nelectric charge and with masses defined at the TeV scale. The existence of\nthese exotic quarks induces extra CP violations via couplings with quarks of\nthe Standard Model mediated by charged gauge boson with mass fixed at the TeV\nscale. An extra discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry is introduced in the 331\nmodel to get a stable scalar field that can be a candidate to the dark matter\ncontent. The new scalar field interacts at tree level with the $Z^{\\prime}$\ngauge boson that works as a dark matter portal. The relic density associated\nwith the scalar field is calculated to yield the solution mass that satisfies\nthe observed dark matter.

However, the complexity of such\nmodels, their multi-scale dynamics and their overparameterized character\nrenders them inaccessible for wide utilization. In this work, the dynamics of a\nfundamental model formulating the interactions of tumor cells with natural\nkiller cells, CD8$^+$ T cells and circulating lymphocytes is examined. It is\nfirst shown that the long-term evolution of the system towards high-tumor or\ntumor-free equilibria is determined by the dynamics of an initial\n\\emph{explosive stage} of tumor progression. Focusing on this stage, the\nalgorithmic Computational Singular Perturbation methodology is employed to\nidentify the underlying mechanisms confining the system's evolution towards the\nequilibrium and the governing slow dynamics along them. It is shown that these\ninsights are preserved along different tumor-immune system and\npatient-dependent realizations. Utilizing the obtained mechanistic\nunderstanding, a novel reduced model is constructed in an algorithmic fashion,\nwhich accurately predicts the dynamics of the system during the explosive stage\nand includes half of the parameters of the detailed model. This present\nanalysis demonstrates the potential of algorithmic asymptotic analysis to\nsimplify the complex, overeparameterized and multi-scale nature of cancer\nimmunology models and to indicate the interactions and cell types to target for\nmore effective treatment development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 19:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Observational data on the ULX donors could\nsignificantly boost our understanding of these systems, but only a few were\ndetected.

This approximate\ninteracting wave function is constructed by using a projection determined by an\niterative procedure that makes parts of the reduced density matrix of an\nauxiliary system the same as the approximate interacting density matrix.

The\nresponse between those virtual transducers form the so-called focused\nreflection matrix that actually contains much more information than a confocal\nultrasound image.

A fitting\nprocess enables the quantification of the single scattering, multiple\nscattering and noise components in the image.

This article describes\nthe quantification and correction of aberration, i.e. the distortion of an\nimage caused by spatial variations in the medium speed-of-sound. Adaptive\nfocusing can compensate for aberration, but is only effective over a restricted\narea called the isoplanatic patch. Here, we use an experimentally-recorded\nmatrix of reflected acoustic signals tosynthesize a set of virtual transducers.\nWe then examine wave propagation between these virtual transducers and an\narbitrary correction plane. Such wave-fronts consist of two components: (i) An\nideal geometric wave-front linked to diffraction and the input focusing point,\nand; (ii) Phase distortions induced by the speed-of-sound variations. These\ndistortions are stored in a so-called distortion matrix, the singular value\ndecomposition of which gives access to an optimized focusing law at any point.\nWe show that, by decoupling the aberrations undergone by the outgoing and\nincoming waves and applying an iterative strategy, compensation for even\nhigh-order and spatially-distributed aberrations can be achieved. After a\nnumerical validation of the process, ultrasound matrix imaging (UMI) is applied\nto the in-vivo imaging of a gallbladder. A map of isoplanatic modes is\nretrieved and is shown to be strongly correlated with the arrangement of\ntissues constituting the medium.

These methods can perform well under a\ncontrolled situation but will often break down in clinical and everyday use due\nto poor robustness, weak adaptability, long-term training, and heavy mental\nburden during use.

Gauss diagrams are a well-established tool in the\nstudy of topology of knots and of planar and spherical curves. Not every Gauss\ndiagram corresponds to a knot (or an immersed curve); if it does, it is called\nrealizable. A classical question of computational topology asked by Gauss\nhimself is which chords diagrams are realizable. An answer was first discovered\nin the 1930s by Dehn, and since then many efficient algorithms for checking\nrealizability of Gauss diagrams have been developed. Recent studies in\nGrinblat-Lopatkin (2018,2020) and Biryukov (2019) formulated especially simple\nconditions related to realizability which are expressible in terms of parity of\nchords intersections.

Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms\nhave proved themselves to be able to find high-quality signal timing plans.\nHowever, they generally suffer from performance deterioration when solving\nlarge-scale traffic signal optimization problems due to the huge search space\nand limited computational budget. Directing against this issue, this study\nproposes a surrogate-assisted cooperative signal optimization (SCSO) method.\nDifferent from existing methods that directly deal with the entire traffic\nnetwork, SCSO first decomposes it into a set of tractable sub-networks, and\nthen achieves signal setting by cooperatively optimizing these sub-networks\nwith a surrogate-assisted optimizer. The decomposition operation significantly\nnarrows the search space of the whole traffic network, and the\nsurrogate-assisted optimizer greatly lowers the computational burden by\nreducing the number of expensive traffic simulations.

In order to overcome this challenge, we\npropose a federated learning (FL) based solution in which we take advantage of\nthe MR data available at different institutions while preserving patients'\nprivacy.

In\nthis paper, we propose RGBD-Grasp, a pipeline that solves this problem by\ndecoupling 7-DoF grasp detection into two sub-tasks where RGB and depth\ninformation are processed separately. In the first stage, an encoder-decoder\nlike convolutional neural network Angle-View Net(AVN) is proposed to predict\nthe SO(3) orientation of the gripper at every location of the image.\nConsequently, a Fast Analytic Searching(FAS) module calculates the opening\nwidth and the distance of the gripper to the grasp point.

To enhance the\ngeneralization abilities, robustness and the interoperability of the\nfingerprint spoof detectors, the learning models need to be adaptive towards\nthe data.

Due to the coupling between the Navier-Stokes equation and the\nCahn-Hilliard equation, the CHNS system is non-trivial to solve numerically.\nTraditionally, a numerical extrapolation for the coupling terms is used.\nHowever, such brute-force extrapolation usually destroys the intrinsic\nthermodynamic structures of this CHNS system. This paper proposes a new\nstrategy to reformulate the CHNS system into a constraint gradient flow\nformation. Under the new formulation, the reversible and irreversible\nstructures are clearly revealed. This guides us to propose operator splitting\nschemes. The operator splitting schemes have several advantageous properties.\nFirst of all, the proposed schemes lead to several decoupled systems in smaller\nsizes to be solved at each time marching step. This significantly reduces\ncomputational costs. Secondly, the proposed schemes still guarantee the\nthermodynamic laws of the CHNS system at the discrete level. It ensures the\nthermodynamic laws, accuracy, and stability for the numerical solutions.

In order to make use\nof the transformed INS mechanization in inertial based integration, both the\nright and left vector error state models are derived.

Therefore, the\nderived error state models can be used in the so-called attitude alignment for\nthe two applications.

Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook\nthe complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them\ndifficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world\nmotions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the\nlatter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus,\nsimultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the\nkey to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these\nobservations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex\nvariations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN\nhas two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit,\nwhich can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The\nsecond is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and\nindicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway\nthat can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and\navoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models.

In this work, we suggest combining the operator\ninference with certain deep neural network approaches to infer the unknown\nnonlinear dynamics of the system. The approach uses recent advancements in deep\nlearning and possible prior knowledge of the process if possible.

Our method initially extracts features from vehicle images\nand stores them in a dictionary. Thereafter, based on the dictionary, the\nproposed method conducts dictionary-based positive label mining (DPLM) to\nsearch for positive labels. Pair-wise similarity, relative-rank consistency,\nand adjacent feature distribution similarity are jointly considered to find\nimages that may belong to the same vehicle of a given probe image. The results\nof DPLM are applied to dictionary-based triplet loss (DTL) to improve the\ndiscriminativeness of learnt features and to refine the quality of the results\nof DPLM progressively. The iterative process with DPLM and DTL boosts the\nperformance of unsupervised vehicle Re-ID.

Some great approaches have been proposed to identify these\nconflicts.

Objective: We aim to propose\nan approach Finer Semantic Analysis-based Requirements Conflict Detector\n(FSARC) to automatically detecting the conflicts between the given natural\nlanguage functional requirements by analyzing their finer semantic\ncompositions. Method: We build a harmonized semantic meta-model of functional\nrequirements with the form of eight-tuple.

These models emit potent\noscillatory neutrino signals with a period of $\\sim$ms for tens of ms after the\nsecond bounce, which can be a strong indicator of the PT in failing CCSNe if\ndetected in the future. However, no shock revival occurs and BH formation\ninevitably takes place in our spherically-symmetric simulations. Furthermore,\nvia a diagram of mass-specific entropy evolution of the PCS, the progenitor\ndependence can be understood through the appearance of third-family of compact\nstars emerging at large entropy induced by the PT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 09:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

We propose Nested Policy Iteration as a general training algorithm\nfor PIC-augmented policy which ensures monotonically non-decreasing updates\nunder some mild conditions. Further, we derive a practical DRL algorithm,\nnamely Nested Soft Actor-Critic. Experiments on a collection of autonomous\ndriving tasks and several Atari games suggest that our approach demonstrates\nsubstantial oscillation reduction in comparison to a range of commonly adopted\nbaselines with almost no performance degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 09:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

This process aims to sort eggs that only have embryos to remain in\nthe incubator until the end of the hatching process. This process aims to sort\neggs with embryos to remain hatched until the end.

Egg images are segmented using\nthe K-means algorithm based on Lab color images. The results of the image\nacquisition are converted into Lab color space images. The results of Lab color\nspace images are processed using K-means for each color. The K-means process\nuses cluster k=3 and divides into three parts: background, eggs, and yolk. Egg\nyolks are part of eggs that have embryonic characteristics. This study applies\nthe concept of color in the initial segmentation and grayscale in the final\nstages. The initial phase results show that the image segmentation results\nusing k-means clustering based on Lab color space provide a grouping of three\nparts. At the grayscale image processing stage, the results of color image\nsegmentation are processed with grayscaling, image enhancement, and morphology.\nThus, it seems clear that the yolk segmented shows the presence of egg embryos.\nBased on this results, the initial stages of the embryo detection process used\nK-means segmentation based on Lab color space. The evaluation uses MSE and\nMSSIM, with values of 0.0486 and 0.9979; this can be used to reference that the\nresults obtained can detect embryos in egg yolk.

The result is a category-theoretic framework for\ndiscussing the following general question: How do different implementations of\nthe same input-output process compare to each other? In the proposed framework,\nan input-output process is modelled by a causally structured channel in some\nfixed theory, and its implementations are modelled by causally structured\ndilations formalising hidden side-computations. These dilations compare through\na pre-order formalising relative strength of side-computations. Chapter 1\nreviews a mathematical model for physical theories as semicartesian symmetric\nmonoidal categories. Many concrete examples are discussed, in particular\nquantum and classical information theory. The key feature is that the model\nfacilitates the notion of dilations. Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of\ndilations. It introduces a handful of simple yet potent axioms about dilations,\none of which (resembling the Purification Postulate [CDP10]) entails a duality\ntheorem encompassing a large number of classic no-go results for quantum\ntheory. Chapter 3 considers metric structure on physical theories, introducing\nin particular a new metric for quantum channels, the purified diamond distance,\nwhich generalises the purified distance [TCR10,Tom12] and relates to the Bures\ndistance [KSW08a]. Chapter 4 presents a category-theoretic formalism for\ncausality in terms of '(constructible) causal channels' and 'contractions'. It\nsimplifies aspects of the formalisms [CDP09,KU17] and relates to traces in\nmonoidal categories [JSV96]. The formalism allows for the definition of 'causal\ndilations' and the establishment of a non-trivial theory of such dilations.\nChapter 5 realises quantum self-testing from the perspective of chapter 4, thus\npointing towards the first known operational foundation for self-testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 10:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

This circumstance allows a completely geometrical formulation of\nQuantum Mechanics, the Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics (CQG), which was\nproved to be useful, for example, to clarify some aspects of the quantum\nparadoxes and to simplify the demonstration of difficult theorems as the\nSpin-Statistics connection. The present work extends our previous derivation of\nDirac's equation from the flat Minkowski space-time to a general curved\nspace-time. Charge and the e.m. fields are introduced by adding\nextra-coordinates and then gauging the associated group symmetry. The resulting\nDirac's equation yields naturally to the correct gyromagnetic ratio $g_e=2$ for\nthe electron, but differs from the one derived in the Standard Quantum\nMechanics (SQM) in two respects. First, the coupling with the space-time\nRiemann scalar curvature is found to be about 1/4 in the CQG instead of 1/2 as\nin the SQM and, second, in the CQG result two very small additional terms\nappear as scalar potentials acting on the particle.

In this context, it is\nvery important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize\npropagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained\nmomentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of\nnodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality\nmeasures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this\nstudy, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of\nnodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model\nand only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes\naccording to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the\nExpected Value Estimation (EVE).

At certain threshold\nlevels of axial load, the grillage manifests instabilities and displays\nnon-trivial axial and flexural incremental vibrations. Floquet-Bloch wave\nasymptotics is used to homogenize the in-plane mechanical response, so to\nobtain an equivalent prestressed elastic solid subject to incremental\ntime-harmonic vibration, which includes, as a particular case, the incremental\nquasi-static response. The equivalent elastic solid is obtained from its\nacoustic tensor, directly derived from homogenization and shown to be\nindependent of the rods' rotational inertia. Loss of strong ellipticity in the\nequivalent continuum coincides with macro-bifurcation in the lattice, while\nmicro-bifurcation remains undetected in the continuum and corresponds to a\nvibration of vanishing frequency of the lowest dispersion branch of the\nlattice, occurring at finite wavelength. A perturbative approach based on\ndynamic Green's function is applied to both the lattice and its equivalent\ncontinuum. This shows that only macro-instability corresponds to localization\nof incremental strain, while micro-instabilities occur in modes that spread\nthroughout the whole lattice with an 'explosive' character. Extremely localized\nmechanical responses are found both in the lattice and in the solid, with the\nadvantage that the former can be easily realized, for instance via 3D printing.\nIn this way, features such as shear band inclination, or the emergence of a\nsingle shear band, or competition between micro and macro instabilities become\nall designable features. The presented results pave the way for the design of\narchitected materials to be used in applications involving extreme\ndeformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 11:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

The state of MDR, the ultimate state of DRT\ninduced by adding polymers to Newtonian IT, is recently regarded as EIT. This\nletter quantitatively demonstrates the role of IT and EIT in DRT via the\ncontributions of RSS and the nonlinear part of ESS to flow drag. The nature of\nDRT is re-examined in a wide range of flow conditions covering a series of flow\nregimes from the onset of DR to MDR. We argue that EIT related dynamics appears\nin DRT long before settling to MDR regime and competitively coexists with IT in\nboth spatial and temporal domain at moderate and high Re. More specifically, at\nlow DR condition, EIT firstly emerges close to the channel walls.

Inspired by the idea of JPEG that converts spatial images\ninto multiple frequency components (FCs), we propose Frequency Space Domain\nRandomization (FSDR) that randomizes images in frequency space by keeping\ndomain-invariant FCs (DIFs) and randomizing domain-variant FCs (DVFs) only.\nFSDR has two unique features: 1) it decomposes images into DIFs and DVFs which\nallows explicit access and manipulation of them and more controllable\nrandomization; 2) it has minimal effects on semantic structures of images and\ndomain-invariant features. We examined domain variance and invariance property\nof FCs statistically and designed a network that can identify and fuse DIFs and\nDVFs dynamically through iterative learning.

The same calculation is carried out for electrons. The magnetic field in\nthe post-shock region is calculated by using an analytic treatment of the\nmagnetic field amplification due to non--resonant and resonant streaming\ninstability and their saturation.

Here, a phase-field formulation is used to\nresolve failure mechanisms by regularizing the sharp crack topology on the\nlocal state. The coupling of plasticity to the crack phase-field is realized by\na constitutive work density function, which is characterized through a degraded\nstored elastic energy and the accumulated dissipated energy due to plasticity\nand damage. Two different Global-Local approaches based on the idea of\nmultiplicative Schwarz' alternating method are proposed: (i) A global\nconstitutive model with an elastic-plastic behavior is first proposed, while it\nis enhanced with a single local domain, which, in turn, describes an\nelastic-plastic fracturing response. (ii) The main objective of the second\nmodel is to introduce an adoption of the Global-Local approach toward the\nmultilevel local setting. To this end, an elastic-plastic global constitutive\nmodel is augmented with two distinct local domains; in which, the first local\ndomain behaves as an elastic-plastic material and the next local domain is\nmodeled due to the fracture state. To further reduce the computational cost,\npredictor-corrector adaptivity within Global-Local concept is introduced. An\nadaptive scheme is devised through the evolution of the effective global\nplastic flow (for only elastic-plastic adaptivity), and through the evolution\nof the local crack phase-field state (for only fracture adaptivity). Thus, two\nlocal domains are dynamically updated during the computation, resulting with\ntwo-way adaptivity procedure. The overall response of the Global-Local approach\nin terms of accuracy/robustness and efficiency is verified using single-scale\nproblems.

Under the ad hoc microphone array setup where the array consists\nof spatially distributed asynchronous microphones, additional challenges must\nbe overcome as the geometry and number of microphones are unknown beforehand.\nPrior studies show, with a spatial-temporalinterleaving structure, neural\nnetworks can efficiently utilize the multi-channel signals of the ad hoc array.\nIn this paper, we further extend this approach to continuous speech separation.\nSeveral techniques are introduced to enable speech separation for real\ncontinuous recordings. First, we apply a transformer-based network for\nspatio-temporal modeling of the ad hoc array signals. In addition, two methods\nare proposed to mitigate a speech duplication problem during single talker\nsegments, which seems more severe in the ad hoc array scenarios. One method is\ndevice distortion simulation for reducing the acoustic mismatch between\nsimulated training data and real recordings. The other is speaker counting to\ndetect the single speaker segments and merge the output signal channels.\nExperimental results for AdHoc-LibiCSS, a new dataset consisting of continuous\nrecordings of concatenated LibriSpeech utterances obtained by multiple\ndifferent devices, show the proposed separation method can significantly\nimprove the ASR accuracy for overlapped speech with little performance\ndegradation for single talker segments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 13:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

To find the optimal coordinate order for\nthe given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward\norderings with high silhouette coefficients.

Existing researches have attempted to automatically identify lots of\nBCs. Unfortunately, a large number of identified BCs make assessing and\nresolving divergences expensive. Existing methods adopt a coarse-grained\nmetric, generality, to filter out less general BCs. However, the results still\nretain a large number of redundant BCs since a general BC potentially captures\nredundant circumstances that do not lead to a divergence. Furthermore, the\nlikelihood of BC can be misled by redundant BCs resulting in costly repeatedly\nassessing and resolving divergences.\n  In this paper, we present a fine-grained metric to filter out the redundant\nBCs. We first introduce the concept of contrasty of BC. Intuitively, if two BCs\nare contrastive, they capture different divergences. We argue that a set of\ncontrastive BCs should be recommended to engineers, rather than a set of\ngeneral BCs that potentially only indicates the same divergence. Then we design\na post-processing framework (PPAc) to produce a set of contrastive BCs after\nidentifying BCs. Experimental results show that the contrasty metric\ndramatically reduces the number of BCs recommended to engineers. Results also\ndemonstrate that lots of BCs identified by the state-of-the-art method are\nredundant in most cases. Besides, to improve efficiency, we propose a joint\nframework (JAc) to interleave assessing based on the contrasty metric with\nidentifying BCs. The primary intuition behind JAc is that it considers the\nsearch bias toward contrastive BCs during identifying BCs, thereby pruning the\nBCs capturing the same divergence. Experiments confirm the improvements of JAc\nin identifying contrastive BCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 13:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

Here, we trace the heritage of\npristine components from the relatively unaltered CV chondrite Leoville through\ntheir mass-independent Cr and mass-dependent Zn isotope compositions.\nInvestigating these chondritic fractions in such detail reveals an onion-shell\nstructure of chondrules, which is characterized by 54Cr- and 66Zn-poor cores\nsurrounded by increasingly 54Cr- and 66Zn-rich igneous rims and an outer\ncoating of fine-grained dust. This is interpreted as a progressive addition of\n54Cr- and 66Zn-rich, CI-like material to the accretion region of these\ncarbonaceous chondrites. Our findings show that the observed Cr isotopic range\nin chondrules from more altered CV chondrites is the result of chemical\nequilibration between chondrules and matrix during secondary alteration. The\n54Cr-poor nature of the cores of Leoville chondrules implies formation in the\ninner Solar System and subsequent massive outward chondrule transport past the\nJupiter barrier. At the same time, CI-like dust is transferred inwards. We\npropose that the accreting Earth acquired CI-like dust through this mechanism\nwithin the lifetime of the disk. This radial mixing of chondrules and matrix\nshows the limited capacity of Jupiter to act as an efficient barrier and\nmaintain the proposed non-carbonaceous and carbonaceous chondrite dichotomy\nover time. Finally, also considering current astrophysical models, we explore\nboth inner and outer Solar System origins for the CV chondrite parent body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 13:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Nevertheless, there are still fierce debates on containerizing\nproduction databases, mainly due to the data persistence issues and concerns.\nDriven by a project of refactoring an Automated Machine Learning system, this\nresearch proposes the container-native data persistence as a conditional\nsolution to running database containers in production. In essence, the proposed\nsolution distinguishes the stateless data access (i.e. reading) from the\nstateful data processing (i.e. creating, updating, and deleting) in databases.\nA master database handles the stateful data processing and dumps database\ncopies for building container images, while the database containers will keep\nstateless at runtime, based on the preloaded dump in the image. Although there\nare delays in the state/image update propagation, this solution is particularly\nsuitable for the read-only, the eventual consistency, and the asynchronous\nprocessing scenarios.

In OAG-BERT, we\ndevelop strategies for pre-training text and entity data along with zero-shot\ninference techniques. Its zero-shot capability furthers the path to mitigate\nthe need of expensive annotations. OAG-BERT has been deployed for real-world\napplications, such as the reviewer recommendation function for National Nature\nScience Foundation of China (NSFC) -- one of the largest funding agencies in\nChina -- and paper tagging in AMiner. All codes and pre-trained models are\navailable via the CogDL toolkit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 14:00:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 09:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 04:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

The learned embedding in the subnetworks are then concatenated to\nform the multi-view embedding for classification similar to a simple\nconcatenation network.

A novel method is then proposed to keep track of\nthe learning behavior on the classification branches and adapt their weights to\nproportionally blend their gradients for network training. The weights are\nadapted in such a way that learning on a branch that is generalizing well will\nbe encouraged whereas learning on a branch that is overfitting will be slowed\ndown.

Noise\nreduction (NR) algorithms used in CI reduce the noise in favor of\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), regardless of plausible accompanying distortions\nthat may degrade the speech quality perception. To gain better understanding of\nCI speech quality perception, the present work aimed investigating speech\nquality perception in a diverse noise conditions, including factors of\nspeech/noise levels, type of noise, and distortions caused by NR models.\nFifteen NH and seven CI subjects participated in this study. Speech sentences\nwere set to two different levels (65 and 75 dB SPL). Two types of noise\n(Cafeteria and Babble) at three levels (55, 65, and 75 dB SPL) were used.\nSentences were processed using two NR algorithms to investigate the perceptual\nsensitivity of CI and NH listeners to the distortion. All sentences processed\nwith the combinations of these sets were presented to CI and NH listeners, and\nthey were asked to rate the sound quality of speech as they perceived. The\neffect of each factor on the perceived speech quality was investigated based on\nthe group averaged quality rated by CI and NH listeners. Consistent with\nprevious studies, CI listeners were not as sensitive as NH to the distortion\nmade by NR algorithms. Statistical analysis showed that the speech level has\nsignificant effect on quality perception. At the same SNR, the quality of 65 dB\nspeech was rated higher than that of 75 dB for CI users, but vice versa for NH\nlisteners. Therefore, the present study showed that the perceived speech\nquality patterns were different between CI and NH listeners in terms of their\nsensitivity to distortion and speech level in complex listening environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 14:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

We quantify several aspects of core collapse over\nmultiple realizations and different parameters, while always resolving the\ncluster core with a realistic number of particles.

Leading up to core collapse, we find a power-law relation between the\nsize of the core and the time left to core collapse. Our simulations thus\nconfirm the theoretical self-similar contraction picture but with a dependence\non the slope of the mass function. The time of core collapse has a\nnon-monotonic dependence on the slope, which is well fit by a parabola. This\nholds also for the depth of core collapse and for the dynamical friction\ntimescale of heavy particles. Cluster density profiles at core collapse show a\nbroken power law structure, suggesting that central cusps are a genuine feature\nof collapsed cores.

Leveraging cavity QED for the\nquantum simulation of complex, many-body systems has thus far relied on\nmulti-photon processes, scaling down the light-matter interaction to the low\nenergy and slow time scales of the many-body problem. Here we report on cavity\nQED experiments using molecular transitions in a strongly interacting Fermi\ngas, directly coupling cavity photons to pairs of atoms. The interplay of\nstrong light-matter and strong inter-particle interactions leads to well\nresolved pair-polaritons, hybrid excitations coherently mixing photons, atom\npairs and molecules. The dependence of the pair-polariton spectrum on\ninteratomic interactions is universal, independent of the transition used,\ndemonstrating a direct mapping between pair correlations in the ground state\nand the optical spectrum. This represents a magnification of many-body effects\nby two orders of magnitude in energy.

Here, the two main problems are: 1) how to\navoid collisions by temporarily breaking the formation, i.e., collision\navoidance reformation, and 2) how do such reformation while minimizing the\ndeviation resulting in minimization of the overall time and energy consumption\nof the drones. To address the first question, we use cellular automata based\ntechnique to find an efficient formation that avoids the obstacle while\nminimizing the time and energy. Concerning the second question, a near-optimal\nreformation of the swarm after successful collision avoidance is achieved by\napplying a temperature function reduction technique, originally used in the\npoint set registration process. The goal of the reformation process is to\nremove the disturbance while minimizing the overall time it takes for the swarm\nto reach the destination and consequently reducing the energy consumption\nrequired by this operation. To measure the degree of formation disturbance due\nto collision avoidance, deviation of the centroid of the swarm formation is\nused, inspired by the concept of the center of mass in classical mechanics.\nExperimental results show the efficiency of the proposed technique, in terms of\nperformance and energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 15:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

Due to the presence of a mass hierarchy,\neffective field theory (EFT) is a suitable tool for the study of such\nextensions. In this thesis, we provide a solution to the matching problem at\nthe one-loop level in the form of the Bispinor Universal One-Loop Effective\nAction (BSUOLEA), which is a pre-computed expression for the effective action,\nparameterised in terms of derivatives of the Lagrangian of the ultraviolet (UV)\nmodel. The BSUOLEA is derived using functional methods and is sufficiently\ngeneral to match any renormalisable, Lorentz invariant UV model to an EFT,\ncontaining operators of mass dimension up to and including six at the one-loop\nlevel. This includes supersymmetric models regularised in dimensional\nreduction. Since the pre-computed expression contains many operators, it is\nimplemented into a currently private Mathematica package, which automatically\nperforms the matching based on the BSUOLEA. We illustrate the use of this\npackage, which will be made publicly available in the near future, by applying\nit to the matching of the Singlet Extended SM to the SM EFT. We then expand the\nframework in order to apply it to a non-renormalisable extension of the SM\ncontaining a vector resonance, which is assumed to arise from the confinement\nof a gauge group at high energies. This model raises some interesting\ntheoretical questions since such a vector resonance comprises a system with\nsecond-class constraints.

Current methods for\nassessing the progression of respiratory symptoms are either subjective and\ninaccurate, or complex and cumbersome, and do not incorporate environmental\nfactors. Lacking predictive assessments and early intervention, unexpected\nexacerbations can lead to hospitalizations and high medical costs. This work\npresents a multi-modal solution for predicting the exacerbation risks of\nrespiratory diseases, such as COPD, based on a novel spatio-temporal machine\nlearning architecture for real-time and accurate respiratory events detection,\nand tracking of local environmental and meteorological data and trends. The\nproposed new machine learning architecture blends key attributes of both\nconvolutional and recurrent neural networks, allowing extraction of both\nspatial and temporal features encoded in respiratory sounds, thereby leading to\naccurate classification and tracking of symptoms. Combined with the data from\nenvironmental and meteorological sensors, and a predictive model based on\nretrospective medical studies, this solution can assess and provide early\nwarnings of respiratory disease exacerbations.

This work fills this gap\nby exploiting the Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK), which governs the\noptimization trajectory under gradient descent for wide GCNs. We formulate the\nasymptotic behaviors of GNTK in the large depth, which enables us to reveal the\ndropping trainability of wide and deep GCNs at an exponential rate in the\noptimization process.

This phenomenon is known as the chiral induced spin\nselectivity (CISS) effect. One of the most surprising experimental results\nrecently demonstrated is that magnetization reversal in a ferromagnet (FM) with\nperpendicular anisotropy can be realized solely by chemisorbing a chiral\nmolecular monolayer without applying any current or external magnetic field.\nThis result raises the currently open question of whether this effect is due to\nthe bonding event, held by the ferromagnet, or a long timescale effect\nstabilized by exchange interactions. In this work we have performed vectorial\nmagnetic field measurements of the magnetization reorientation of a\nferromagnetic layer exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy due to CISS using\nnitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and followed the time dynamics of this\neffect. In parallel, we have measured the molecular monolayer tilt angle in\norder to find a correlation between the time dependence of the magnetization\nre-orientation and the change of the tilt angle of the molecular monolayer. We\nhave identified that changes in the magnetization direction correspond to\nchanges of the molecular monolayer tilt angle, providing evidence for a\nlong-timescale characteristic of the induced magnetization reorientation. This\nsuggests that the CISS effect has an effect over long-timescales which we\nattribute to exchange interactions.

We\nargue that 3D integration not only provides strategic advantages to the\ncost-effective and flexible design of neuromorphic chips, it may provide design\nflexibility in incorporating advanced capabilities to further benefits the\ndesigns in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 21:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

The\nmanuscript presents the complete analysis of researches over the past 10 years\non the use of neural networks for the classification and tracking of weeds due\nto neural networks. In particular, the analysis of the results of using various\nneural network algorithms for the task of classification and tracking was\npresented. As a result, we presented the recommendation for the use of neural\nnetworks in the tasks of recognizing a cultivated object and weeds.

The learning and assessment process is inherently\nsubjective and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for objective methods to\nassess surgical skills. Here, we use the Preferred Reporting Items for\nSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to systematically\nsurvey the literature on the use of Deep Neural Networks for automated and\nobjective surgical skill assessment, with a focus on kinematic data as putative\nmarkers of surgical competency. There is considerable recent interest in deep\nneural networks (DNN) due to the availability of powerful algorithms, multiple\ndatasets, some of which are publicly available, as well as efficient\ncomputational hardware to train and host them. We have reviewed 530 papers, of\nwhich we selected 25 for this systematic review. Based on this review, we\nconcluded that DNNs are powerful tools for automated, objective surgical skill\nassessment using both kinematic and video data. The field would benefit from\nlarge, publicly available, annotated datasets that are representative of the\nsurgical trainee and expert demographics and multimodal data beyond kinematics\nand videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 10:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

However, negative transfer may deteriorate the\nperformance due to the feature distribution divergence between two datasets and\ntask semantic difference in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 that rely on\ndifferent characteristics. It is even more challenging when the target dataset\nhas no labels available, i.e., unsupervised task transfer learning. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Task Adaptation Network (TAN) to solve this\nunsupervised task transfer problem. In addition to learning transferable\nfeatures via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic\nadaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics.\nExperiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod achieves superior performance. Especially on COVID-DA dataset, TAN\nsignificantly increases the recall and F1 score by 5.0% and 7.8% compared to\nrecently strong baselines. Moreover, we show that TAN also achieves superior\nperformance on several public domain adaptation benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 11:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

However,\nwireless RF data possesses unique characteristics that differentiate it from\nthese other domains. For instance, RF data encompasses intermingled time and\nfrequency features that are dictated by the underlying hardware and protocol\nconfigurations. In addition, wireless RF communication signals exhibit\ncyclostationarity due to repeated patterns (PHY pilots, frame prefixes, etc.)\nthat these signals inherently contain. In this paper, we begin by explaining\nand showing the unsuitability as well as limitations of existing DNN feature\ndesign approaches currently proposed to be used for wireless device\nclassification. We then present novel feature design approaches that exploit\nthe distinct structures of the RF communication signals and the spectrum\nemissions caused by transmitter hardware impairments to custom-make DNN models\nsuitable for classifying wireless devices using RF signal data. Our proposed\nDNN feature designs substantially improve classification robustness in terms of\nscalability, accuracy, signature anti-cloning, and insensitivity to environment\nperturbations. We end the paper by presenting other feature design strategies\nthat have great potentials for providing further performance improvements of\nthe DNN-based wireless device classification, and discuss the open research\nchallenges related to these proposed strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 20:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}
