We are interested in finding\ntheir relation with magnetic field perturbations and in the processes driving\ntheir evolution. For the analysis, the swirling strength criterion and its\nevolution equation are applied in order to identify vortical motions and to\nstudy their dynamics. We introduce a new criterion, the magnetic swirling\nstrength, which allows us to recognize torsional perturbations in the magnetic\nfield. We find a strong correlation between swirling strength and magnetic\nswirling strength, in particular in intense magnetic flux concentrations, which\nsuggests a tight relation between vortical motions and torsional magnetic field\nperturbations. Furthermore, we find that swirls propagate upward with the local\nAlfv\\'en speed as unidirectional swirls, in the form of pulses, driven by\nmagnetic tension forces alone. In the photosphere and low chromosphere, the\nrotation of the plasma co-occurs with a twist in the upwardly directed magnetic\nfield that is in the opposite direction of the plasma flow. All together, these\nare characteristics of torsional Alfv\\'en waves. We also find indications of an\nimbalance between the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic baroclinic effects\nbeing at the origin of the swirls. At the base of the chromosphere, we find a\nnet upwardly directed Poynting flux, which is mostly associated with large and\ncomplex swirling structures that we interpret as the superposition of various\nsmall-scale vortices. We conclude that the ubiquitous swirling events observed\nin simulations are tightly correlated with perturbations of the magnetic field.\nAt photospheric and chromospheric levels, they form Alfv\\'en pulses that\npropagate upward and may contribute to chromospheric heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Each request which specifies its pick-up time and pick-up location\n(among 0 and 1, and the other is the drop-off location) is released in each\nstage a fixed amount of time before its specified start (i.e. pick-up) time.\nThe time between the booking (i.e. released) time and the start time is enough\nto move empty cars between 0 and 1 for relocation if they are not used in that\nstage. The model, called $k$S2L-F, assumes that requests in each stage arrive\nsequentially regardless of the same booking time and the decision (accept or\nreject) must be made immediately. The goal is to accept as many requests as\npossible. In spite of only two locations, the analysis does not seem easy and\nthe (tight) competitive ratio (CR) is only known to be 2.0 for $k=2$ and 1.5\nfor a restricted value of $k$, i.e., a multiple of three. In this paper, we\nremove all the holes of unknown CR's; namely we prove that the CR is\n$\\frac{2k}{k + \\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor}$ for all $k\\geq 2$. Furthermore, if the\nalgorithm can delay its decision until all requests have come in each stage,\nthe CR is improved to roughly 4/3. We can take this advantage even further,\nprecisely we can achieve a CR of $\\frac{2+R}{3}$ if the number of requests in\neach stage is at most $Rk$, $1 \\leq R \\leq 2$, where we do not have to know the\nvalue of $R$ in advance. Finally we demonstrate that randomization also helps\nto get (slightly) better CR's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 17:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 11:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

By extending the\nself-supervised approach, we propose a novel single-phase clustering method\nthat simultaneously learns meaningful representations and assigns the\ncorresponding annotations.

This framework is\nthen applied to well-studied examples including Galilean invariance and the\nsymmetries of the Kepler problem. We find that our framework gives a precise\ndynamical criterion for identifying the observables of those systems, and that\nthose observables agree with epistemic expectations. We then apply our\nframework to dynamical similarity. First we give a general definition of\ndynamical similarity. Then we show, with the help of some previous results, how\nthe dynamics of our observables leads to singularity resolution and the\nemergence of an arrow of time in cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 14:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

One of\nthe main reasons for developing a digital twin, is to enable the simulation of\npossible consequences of a given action, without the need to interfere with the\nphysical system itself. Physical systems of interest, and the environments they\noperate in, do not always behave deterministically. Moreover, information about\nthe system and its environment is typically incomplete or imperfect.\nProbabilistic representations of systems and environments may therefore be\ncalled for, especially to support decisions in application areas where actions\nmay have severe consequences.\n  In this paper we introduce the probabilistic digital twin (PDT). We will\nstart by discussing how epistemic uncertainty can be treated using measure\ntheory, by modelling epistemic information via $\\sigma$-algebras. Based on\nthis, we give a formal definition of how epistemic uncertainty can be updated\nin a PDT. We then study the problem of optimal sequential decision making. That\nis, we consider the case where the outcome of each decision may inform the\nnext. Within the PDT framework, we formulate this optimization problem. We\ndiscuss how this problem may be solved (at least in theory) via the maximum\nprinciple method or the dynamic programming principle. However, due to the\ncurse of dimensionality, these methods are often not tractable in practice. To\nmend this, we propose a generic approximate solution using deep reinforcement\nlearning together with neural networks defined on sets. We illustrate the\nmethod on a practical problem, considering optimal information gathering for\nthe estimation of a failure probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 17:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Black hole images have a wide\nrange of physically interesting image structures, ranging from extremely fine\nscales in their lensed \"photon rings\" to the very large scales in their\nrelativistic jets. The multi-scale nature of the black hole system is therefore\nsuitable for a multi-scale approach to generating simulated images that capture\nall key elements of the system.

One of the\ninteresting natural examples is transpiration on plant leaves. Most of water in\nthe inner space of the leaves escapes through stomata, whose rate depends on\nthe surface topography and a difference in vapor concentrations inside and just\noutside of the leaves. Previous research on the vapor flux on various surfaces\nhas focused on numerically solving the vapor diffusion equation or using\nscaling arguments based on a simple solution with a flat surface. In this\npresent work, we present and discuss simple analytical solutions on various 2D\nsurface shapes (e.g., semicylinder, semi-ellipse, hair). The method of solving\nthe diffusion equation is to use the complex potential theory, which provides\nanalytical solutions for vapor concentration and flux. We find that a high mass\nflux of vapor is formed near the top of the microstructures while a low mass\nflux is developed near the stomata at the leaf surface. Such a low vapor flux\nnear the stomata may affect transpiration in two ways. First, condensed\ndroplets on the stomata will not grow due to a low mass flux of vapor, which\nwill not inhibit the gas exchange through the stomatal opening. Second, the low\nmass flux from the atmosphere will facilitate the release of high concentrated\nvapor from the substomatal space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 17:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 13:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

For instance, in\nGlioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor, the increase in intracranial\npressure due to tumor burden often leads to brain herniation and poor outcomes.\nOur work is based on the rationale that highly aggressive tumors tend to grow\nuncontrollably, leading to pronounced biomechanical tissue deformations in the\nnormal parenchyma, which when combined with local morphological differences in\nthe tumor confines on MRI scans, will comprehensively capture tumor field\neffect. Specifically, we present an integrated MRI-based descriptor,\nradiomic-Deformation and Textural Heterogeneity (r-DepTH). This descriptor\ncomprises measurements of the subtle perturbations in tissue deformations\nthroughout the surrounding normal parenchyma due to mass effect. This involves\nnon-rigidly aligning the patients MRI scans to a healthy atlas via\ndiffeomorphic registration. The resulting inverse mapping is used to obtain the\ndeformation field magnitudes in the normal parenchyma. These measurements are\nthen combined with a 3D texture descriptor, Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic\nGradient Orientations (COLLAGE), which captures the morphological heterogeneity\nwithin the tumor confines, on MRI scans.

This enables objects to be detected and the\nidentification of materials that have subtle differences between them. However,\nthe increase in spectral resolution often means that there is a decrease in the\nnumber of photons received in each channel, which means that the noise linked\nto the image formation process is greater. This degradation limits the quality\nof the extracted information and its potential applications. Thus, denoising is\na fundamental problem in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. As images of\nnatural scenes with highly correlated spectral channels, HSIs are characterized\nby a high level of self-similarity and can be well approximated by low-rank\nrepresentations. These characteristics underlie the state-of-the-art methods\nused in HSI denoising. However, where there are rarely occurring pixel types,\nthe denoising performance of these methods is not optimal, and the subsequent\ndetection of these pixels may be compromised. To address these hurdles, in this\narticle, we introduce RhyDe (Robust hyperspectral Denoising), a powerful HSI\ndenoiser, which implements explicit low-rank representation, promotes\nself-similarity, and, by using a form of collaborative sparsity, preserves rare\npixels. The denoising and detection effectiveness of the proposed robust HSI\ndenoiser is illustrated using semireal and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 18:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Despite the promising applications of hBN as a heat spreader,\nthe thickness dependence of the cross-plane thermal conductivity is not known,\nand the cross-plane phonon mean free paths in hBN have not been measured. We\nmeasure the cross-plane thermal conductivity of hBN flakes exfoliated from bulk\ncrystals. We find that the thermal conductivity is extremely sensitive to film\nthickness. We measure a forty-fold increase in the cross-plane thermal\nconductivity between 7 nm and 585 nm flakes at 295 K. We attribute the large\nincrease in thermal conductivity with increasing thickness to contributions\nfrom phonons with long mean free paths (MFPs), spanning many hundreds of\nnanometers in the thickest flakes. When planar twist interfaces are introduced\ninto the crystal by mechanically stacking multiple thin flakes, the cross-plane\nthermal conductivity of the stack is found to be a factor of seven below that\nof individual flakes with similar total thickness, thus providing strong\nevidence that phonon scattering at twist boundaries limits the maximum phonon\nMFPs. These results have important implications for hBN integration in\nnanoelectronics and improve our understanding of thermal transport in\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 18:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 04:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 14:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

The algorithm learns\nfrom the data in the machine learning style to efficiently place knots. The\noptimality criterion is based on the average (per functional data point) mean\nsquare error and is utilized both in the learning algorithms and in comparison\nstudies.

We\nintegrate the orbit of MOs in a multi-component galaxy model via a\nsemi-analytical approach that accounts for dynamical friction generalized to\nrotationally supported backgrounds. We compare the MO evolution in a galaxy\nfeaturing a Milky Way-like rotating bar to the evolution within an analogous\naxisymmetric galaxy without the bar. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that the bar presence may significantly affect the inspiral, sometimes\nmaking it shorter by a factor of a few, sometimes hindering it for a Hubble\ntime. The erratic behaviour is mainly impacted by the relative phase at which\nthe MO encounters the stronger bar-induced resonances. In particular, the\neffect of the bar is more prominent for initially in-plane, prograde MOs,\nespecially those crossing the bar co-rotation radius or outer Lindblad\nresonance. In the barred galaxy, we find the sinking of the most massive MOs\n(>~10^7.5 Msun) approaching the galaxy from large separations (>~8 kpc) to be\nmost efficiently hampered. Neglecting the effect of global torques associated\nwith the non-symmetric mass distribution is thus not advisable even within an\nidealized, smooth galaxy model; we further note that spiral patterns are\nunlikely to affect the inspiral due to their transient and fluctuating nature.\nWe speculate that the sinking efficiency of massive black holes involved in\nminor galaxy mergers may be hampered in barred galaxies, making them less\nlikely to host a gravitational wave signal accessible to low-frequency\ndetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 19:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 14:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

By selecting high orbital eccentricity, metal-rich stars, we\nidentify red giants in our APOGEE sample that are likely associated with the\n$Gaia$-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger. We compare the abundance profiles of the\nJhelum stars and GES stars and find similar trends in $\\alpha$-elements, as\nexpected for low-metallicity populations. However, we find that the orbits for\nGES and Jhelum stars are not generally consistent with a shared origin. The\nchemical abundances for the APOGEE Jhelum star and other confirmed members of\nthe stream are similar to stars in known stellar streams and thus are\nconsistent with an accreted dwarf galaxy origin for the progenitor of the\nstream, although we cannot rule out a globular cluster origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 19:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

One of the primary objectives of designing a QoS prediction\nalgorithm is to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, accuracy is\nnot the only criteria to meet while developing a QoS prediction algorithm. The\nalgorithm has to be faster in terms of prediction time so that it can be\nintegrated into a real-time recommendation or composition system. The other\nimportant factor to consider while designing the prediction algorithm is\nscalability to ensure that the prediction algorithm can tackle large-scale\ndatasets. The existing algorithms on QoS prediction often compromise on one\ngoal while ensuring the others. In this paper, we propose a semi-offline QoS\nprediction model to achieve three important goals simultaneously: higher\naccuracy, faster prediction time, scalability. Here, we aim to predict the QoS\nvalue of service that varies across users. Our framework consists of\nmulti-phase prediction algorithms: preprocessing-phase prediction, online\nprediction, and prediction using the pre-trained model.

Using this approach in the radiative transfer code CMFGEN we produce\nsynthetic spectra for AzV83, an O7Iaf+ supergiant located in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud.

In this paper, we present a continuous-time 3D radar-to-camera\nextrinsic calibration algorithm that utilizes radar velocity measurements and,\nunlike the majority of existing techniques, does not require specialized radar\nretroreflectors to be present in the environment. We derive the observability\nproperties of our formulation and demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm\nthrough synthetic and real-world experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 19:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 07:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

The accumulation of implanted slowly diffusing gas atoms in solids\ndrives damage through the meso-scale processes of bubble formation, blistering,\nand exfoliation.

In addition,\nthese inputs often vary over time, and models that can account for these\nchanging conditions are needed. Simulations are in some cases needed to provide\nsufficient training data. These typically represent the designed machine before\nconstruction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite\ndifferent due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled.\nTherefore, surrogate models that can leverage both simulation and measured data\nsuccessfully are needed.

In the\nfree-form design of discrete architectural surfaces, the Gaussian curvature\nplays an important role not only aesthetically but also in terms of stiffness\nand constructability. However, designing a surface manually with specific\nGaussian curvatures can be a time-consuming task. We propose a method to find a\ntriangulated surface with user-specified Gaussian curvatures (not limited to\nconstant Gaussian curvatures) and boundary vertex positions. In addition, the\nconformal class of the final design can be specified; that is, the user has\ncontrol over the shape (the corner angles) of each triangular panel. The panels\ncould be encouraged to form a regular tessellation or kept close to those of\nthe initial design. The controllability of the conformal class suppresses\npossible distortion of the panels, resulting in higher structural performance\nand aesthetics. Our method relies on the idea in computational conformal\ngeometry called circle packing. In this line of research, the discrete Ricci\nflow has been widely used for surface modelling. However, it is not trivial to\nincorporate constraints such as boundary locations and convexity of the spanned\nsurface, which are essential to architectural applications.

If neutrinos are magnetic monopoles, as\nphysicists have reported the possibility, the Earth should show signs of having\nmagnetic monopole charge on a macroscopic scale since neutrons must also have\nmagnetic monopole charge if general charge conservation principle is valid. To\ntest this hypothesis, experiments were performed to detect the collective\neffect of magnetic monopole charge of neutrons on the earth's equator using two\nbalanced high strength neodymium rod magnets. We were able to identify non-zero\nmagnetic monopole charge of the individual neutrons from the experiments. The\npresence of individual magnetic monopole charges in the universe prompted\nproposition of the new symmetric form of Maxwell's equations.

We focus on making recommendations\nfor a new group of users whose preferences are unknown, but we are given the\ndecisions/choices of other groups. By formulating this problem as group\nrecommendation from group implicit feedback, we focus on two of its practical\ninstances: group decision prediction and reverse social choice. Given a set of\ngroups and their observed decisions, group decision prediction intends to\npredict the decision of a new group of users, whereas reverse social choice\naims to infer the preferences of those users involved in observed group\ndecisions. These two problems are of interest to not only group recommendation,\nbut also to personal privacy when the users intend to conceal their personal\npreferences but have participated in group decisions. To tackle these two\nproblems, we propose and study DeepGroup -- a deep learning approach for group\nrecommendation with group implicit data. We empirically assess the predictive\npower of DeepGroup on various real-world datasets, group conditions (e.g.,\nhomophily or heterophily), and group decision (or voting) rules.

To formalize, we define a model\nproperty, Knowledge to Translate Individual Words (KTIW) (e.g. knowing that `i`\ntranslates to `o`), and claim that it drives the learning of the attention.\nThis claim is supported by the fact that before the attention mechanism is\nlearned, KTIW can be learned from word co-occurrence statistics, but not the\nother way around. Particularly, we can construct a training distribution that\nmakes KTIW hard to learn, the learning of the attention fails, and the model\ncannot even learn the simple task of copying the input words to the output.

Active control systems are an efficient\nsolution for structural response control when a structure is subjected to\nunexpected extreme loads.

Recent\nadvancements in adaptive learning methods, in particular, reinforcement\nlearning (RL), for real-time decision making problems, along with rapid growth\nin high-performance computational resources, help structural engineers to\ntransform the classic model-based active control problem to a purely\ndata-driven one.

We present an approach for high-quality\nintuitive editing of the camera viewpoint and scene illumination in a portrait\nimage. This requires our method to capture and control the full reflectance\nfield of the person in the image. Most editing approaches rely on supervised\nlearning using training data captured with setups such as light and camera\nstages. Such datasets are expensive to acquire, not readily available and do\nnot capture all the rich variations of in-the-wild portrait images. In\naddition, most supervised approaches only focus on relighting, and do not allow\ncamera viewpoint editing. Thus, they only capture and control a subset of the\nreflectance field. Recently, portrait editing has been demonstrated by\noperating in the generative model space of StyleGAN. While such approaches do\nnot require direct supervision, there is a significant loss of quality when\ncompared to the supervised approaches. In this paper, we present a method which\nlearns from limited supervised training data. The training images only include\npeople in a fixed neutral expression with eyes closed, without much hair or\nbackground variations. Each person is captured under 150 one-light-at-a-time\nconditions and under 8 camera poses. Instead of training directly in the image\nspace, we design a supervised problem which learns transformations in the\nlatent space of StyleGAN. This combines the best of supervised learning and\ngenerative adversarial modeling. We show that the StyleGAN prior allows for\ngeneralisation to different expressions, hairstyles and backgrounds. This\nproduces high-quality photorealistic results for in-the-wild images and\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods.

We obtain analytical expressions for the flow fields\nupto O(Ca) (capillary number) and the deformed shape of the confining drop upto\nO(Ca^2) using a domain perturbation technique. Further, we develop an O(Ca)\nconstitutive equation for the volume-averaged stress for a dilute dispersion of\ncompound particles. Compared to linear theory, O(Ca^2) calculations are found\nto be important as they make qualitatively different predictions in some linear\nflows. We find that the strong hydrodynamic interaction between the\nencapsulated particle and the confining interface results in an increased\ndeformation of the confining drop compared to that of a simple drop, and\nenhances the rheological quantities such as the effective shear viscosity,\nextensional viscosity, and normal stress differences in a dilute dispersion.\nThese measures pertaining to particles, drops, and particles coated with a\nfluid film are also derived as limiting cases of compound particles. Moreover,\nlinear viscoelastic behavior of a dilute dispersion of compound particles is\ncharacterized in terms of complex modulus by subjecting the dispersion to a\nsmall amplitude oscillatory shear flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 09:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Since ASTE\nconsists of multiple subtasks, including opinion entity extraction, relation\ndetection, and sentiment classification, it is critical and challenging to\nappropriately capture and utilize the associations among them. In this paper,\nwe transform ASTE task into a multi-turn machine reading comprehension (MTMRC)\ntask and propose a bidirectional MRC (BMRC) framework to address this\nchallenge. Specifically, we devise three types of queries, including\nnon-restrictive extraction queries, restrictive extraction queries and\nsentiment classification queries, to build the associations among different\nsubtasks. Furthermore, considering that an aspect sentiment triplet can derive\nfrom either an aspect or an opinion expression, we design a bidirectional MRC\nstructure. One direction sequentially recognizes aspects, opinion expressions,\nand sentiments to obtain triplets, while the other direction identifies opinion\nexpressions first, then aspects, and at last sentiments. By making the two\ndirections complement each other, our framework can identify triplets more\ncomprehensively. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct\nextensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that BMRC achieves state-of-the-art performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 09:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Compactness\nprovides efficiency and comprehensibility whereas robustness provides\nresilience. Both topics have been studied in recent years but in isolation.\nHere we present a robust model compression scheme which is independent of model\ntypes: it can compress ensembles, neural networks and other types of models\ninto diverse types of small models. The main building block is the notion of\ndepth derived from robust statistics. Originally, depth was introduced as a\nmeasure of the centrality of a point in a sample such that the median is the\ndeepest point. This concept was extended to classification functions which\nmakes it possible to define the depth of a hypothesis and the median\nhypothesis. Algorithms have been suggested to approximate the median but they\nhave been limited to binary classification. In this study, we present a new\nalgorithm, the Multiclass Empirical Median Optimization (MEMO) algorithm that\nfinds a deep hypothesis in multi-class tasks, and prove its correctness. This\nleads to our Compact Robust Estimated Median Belief Optimization (CREMBO)\nalgorithm for robust model compression. We demonstrate the success of this\nalgorithm empirically by compressing neural networks and random forests into\nsmall decision trees, which are interpretable models, and show that they are\nmore accurate and robust than other comparable methods. In addition, our\nempirical study shows that our method outperforms Knowledge Distillation on DNN\nto DNN compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 09:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

I also study the\nstatistics of the clusters that form in presence of long-range interactions and\nshow how it relates to the statistics of the global avalanches. Finally I\npresent analytical advances towards the understanding of the spatial structure\nof avalanches within a mean-field model, the Brownian force model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 12:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Phase averaging aims to capture the slow dynamics in\na solution that is smoother in time (in transformed variables) so that larger\ntimesteps may be taken. We overcome the two key technical challenges that stand\nin the way of studying the phase averaging and advancing its implementation: 1)\nwe have developed a stable matrix exponential specific to finite elements and\n2) we have developed a parallel finite averaging proceedure. Following Peddle\net al (2019), we consider finite width phase averaging windows, since the\nequations have a finite timescale separation. In our numerical implementation,\nthe averaging integral is replaced by a Riemann sum, where each term can be\nevaluated in parallel. This creates an opportunity for parallelism in the\ntimestepping method, which we use here to compute our solutions. Here, we focus\non the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution. We confirm there is an\noptimal averaging window, in agreement with theory. Critically, we observe that\nthe combined time discretisation and averaging error is much smaller than the\ntime discretisation error in a semi-implicit method applied to the same spatial\ndiscretisation.

In the context of\nSMBH-disks, the rates of Bondi accretion onto BHs are $\\sim 10^{9}L_{\\rm\nEdd}/c^{2}$, where $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$ is the\nspeed of light.

The first layer\ndescribes the direct contact interactions, while the second layer is the\ninformation propagation layer. Both layers consist of the same nodes. The\nsociety consists of five different categories of individuals: susceptibles,\ninfective, recovered, vaccinated and precautioned.

The SIR model is employed for the infection spread, while the\nBass equation models the adoption of information.

Specifically, we shall present the Jordan frame\ntheory of the $a$-attractors, and by using a conformal transformation we shall\nderive the Einstein frame theory. We discuss the inflationary context of\n$a$-attractors in order to specify the allowed range of values for the free\nparameters of the model based on the latest cosmic-microwave-background-based\nPlanck 2018 data. Accordingly, using the notation and physical units frequently\nused in theoretical astrophysics contexts, we shall derive the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in the Einstein frame. Assuming a\npiecewise polytropic equation of state, the lowest density part of which shall\nbe chosen to be the WFF1, or APR or the SLy EoS, we numerically solve the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations using a double shooting python-based\n\"LSODA\" numerical code.

Also, for large $a$-values,\nthe WFF1 equation of state is excluded, due to the GW170817 constraints.

Different from objects in natural images, aerial objects are\noften distributed with arbitrary orientation. Therefore, the detector requires\nmore parameters to encode the orientation information, which are often highly\nredundant and inefficient. Moreover, as ordinary CNNs do not explicitly model\nthe orientation variation, large amounts of rotation augmented data is needed\nto train an accurate object detector. In this paper, we propose a\nRotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) to address these issues, which explicitly\nencodes rotation equivariance and rotation invariance. More precisely, we\nincorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract\nrotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and\nlead to a huge reduction of model size. Based on the rotation-equivariant\nfeatures, we also present Rotation-invariant RoI Align (RiRoI Align), which\nadaptively extracts rotation-invariant features from equivariant features\naccording to the orientation of RoI.

Therefore, the quality of the sensory traffic data is of paramount\nimportance. However, like any sensory data, urban traffic data are prone to\nimperfections leading to missing measurements. In this paper, we focus on\ninter-region traffic data completion. We model the inter-region traffic as a\nspatiotemporal tensor that suffers from missing measurements. To recover the\nmissing data, we propose an enhanced CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) completion approach\nthat considers the urban and temporal aspects of the traffic. To derive the\nurban characteristics, we divide the area of study into regions. Then, for each\nregion, we compute urban feature vectors inspired from biodiversity which are\nused to compute the urban similarity matrix. To mine the temporal aspect, we\nfirst conduct an entropy analysis to determine the most regular time-series.\nThen, we conduct a joint Fourier and correlation analysis to compute its\nperiodicity and construct the temporal matrix. Both urban and temporal matrices\nare fed into a modified CP-completion objective function. To solve this\nobjective, we propose an alternating least square approach that operates on the\nvectorized version of the inputs. We conduct comprehensive comparative study\nwith two evaluation scenarios. In the first one, we simulate random missing\nvalues. In the second scenario, we simulate missing values at a given area and\ntime duration.

ML models, however, can be unfair to certain demographic groups (e.g.,\nAfrican Americans or females) according to various fairness metrics. Existing\ntechniques for producing fair ML models either are limited to the type of\nfairness constraints they can handle (e.g., preprocessing) or require\nnontrivial modifications to downstream ML training algorithms (e.g.,\nin-processing).\n  We propose a declarative system OmniFair for supporting group fairness in ML.\nOmniFair features a declarative interface for users to specify desired group\nfairness constraints and supports all commonly used group fairness notions,\nincluding statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. OmniFair\nis also model-agnostic in the sense that it does not require modifications to a\nchosen ML algorithm. OmniFair also supports enforcing multiple user declared\nfairness constraints simultaneously while most previous techniques cannot. The\nalgorithms in OmniFair maximize model accuracy while meeting the specified\nfairness constraints, and their efficiency is optimized based on the\ntheoretically provable monotonicity property regarding the trade-off between\naccuracy and fairness that is unique to our system.\n  We conduct experiments on commonly used datasets that exhibit bias against\nminority groups in the fairness literature. We show that OmniFair is more\nversatile than existing algorithmic fairness approaches in terms of both\nsupported fairness constraints and downstream ML models.

The results indicate\nthat using multiple monitors is indeed perceived as beneficial and desirable.\n19% of the respondents reported adding a monitor to their home setup in\nresponse to the Covid-19 situation. At the same time, the single most\ninfluential factor cited as affecting productivity was not the physical setup\nbut interactions with co-workers -- both reduced productivity due to lack of\nconnections available at work, and improved productivity due to reduced\ninterruptions from co-workers. A central implication of our work is that\nempirical research on software development should be conducted in settings\nsimilar to those actually used by practitioners, and in particular using\nworkstations configured with multiple monitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 20:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

In experimental and real settings, the system equations\nare often unknown, raising the need to develop a prediction framework that is\nmodel free and fully data driven. We contemplate that this challenging problem\ncan be addressed with machine learning. In particular, exploiting reservoir\ncomputing or echo state networks, we devise a \"parameter-aware\" scheme to train\nthe neural machine using asynchronous time series, i.e., in the parameter\nregime prior to the onset of synchronization. A properly trained machine will\npossess the power to predict the synchronization transition in that, with a\ngiven amount of parameter drift, whether the system would remain asynchronous\nor exhibit synchronous dynamics can be accurately anticipated. We demonstrate\nthe machine-learning based framework using representative chaotic models and\nsmall network systems that exhibit continuous (second-order) or abrupt\n(first-order) transitions. A remarkable feature is that, for a network system\nexhibiting an explosive (first-order) transition and a hysteresis loop in\nsynchronization, the machine learning scheme is capable of accurately\npredicting these features, including the precise locations of the transition\npoints associated with the forward and backward transition paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 03:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Many studies\nhave been conducted to predict the COVID-19 diffusion, assess the impacts of\nthe pandemic on human mobility and air quality, and assess the impacts of\nlockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML)\ntechniques. This review study aims to analyze results from past research to\nunderstand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures,\nhuman mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates\nthat urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social\ncohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility\nand COVID-19 transmission. during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are\ninclined to use private transportation for necessary travel purposes to\nmitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed\nthat COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by\nreducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the\nCOVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths of\npeople. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic\nparadigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic. This\nstudy also discusses policy implications, which will be helpful for\npolicymakers to take prompt actions to moderate the severity of the pandemic\nand improve urban environments by adopting data-driven analytic methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 10:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

In this work, we investigate how would the robot with the\nhelp of a simulator, learn to maximize the number of boxes unloaded by each\naction. Most high-fidelity robotic simulators like ours are time-consuming.\nTherefore, we investigate the above learning problem with a focus on minimizing\nthe number of simulation runs required. The optimal decision-making problem\nunder this setting can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem.\nHowever, to obtain the outcome of any action requires us to run the\ntime-consuming simulator, thereby restricting the amount of training data that\ncan be collected. Thus, we need a data-efficient approach to learn the\nclassifier and generalize it with a minimal amount of data. A high-fidelity\nphysics-based simulator is common in general for complex manipulation tasks\ninvolving multi-body interactions. To this end, we train an optimal decision\ntree as the classifier, and for each branch of the decision tree, we reason\nabout the confidence in the decision using a Probably Approximately Correct\n(PAC) framework to determine whether more simulator data will help reach a\ncertain confidence level. This provides us with a mechanism to evaluate when\nsimulation can be avoided for certain decisions, and when simulation will\nimprove the decision making. For the truck unloading problem, our experiments\nshow that a significant reduction in simulator runs can be achieved using the\nproposed method as compared to naively running the simulator to collect data to\ntrain equally performing decision trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 06:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}
