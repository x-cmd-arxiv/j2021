In the present paper, the resonance $\nX_1(2900)$ is modeled as an exotic vector state, $ J^P=1^- $, built of the\nlight diquark $u^{T}C\\gamma_5d$ and heavy antidiquark $\\overline{c}\n\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5C\\overline{s}^{T}$.

Leveraging on recent advances in graph sampling, we propose a fast\nPC sub-sampling algorithm that reduces its size while preserving the overall\nobject shape. Specifically, to articulate a sampling objective, we first assume\na super-resolution (SR) method based on feature graph Laplacian regularization\n(FGLR) that reconstructs the original high-resolution PC, given 3D points\nchosen by a sampling matrix $\\H$. We prove that minimizing a worst-case SR\nreconstruction error is equivalent to maximizing the smallest eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_{\\min}$ of a matrix $\\H^{\\top} \\H + \\mu \\cL$, where $\\cL$ is a\nsymmetric, positive semi-definite matrix computed from the neighborhood graph\nconnecting the 3D points. Instead, for fast computation we maximize a lower\nbound $\\lambda^-_{\\min}(\\H^{\\top} \\H + \\mu \\cL)$ via selection of $\\H$ in three\nsteps. Interpreting $\\cL$ as a generalized graph Laplacian matrix corresponding\nto an unbalanced signed graph $\\cG$, we first approximate $\\cG$ with a balanced\ngraph $\\cG_B$ with the corresponding generalized graph Laplacian matrix\n$\\cL_B$. Second, leveraging on a recent theorem called Gershgorin disc perfect\nalignment (GDPA), we perform a similarity transform $\\cL_p = \\S \\cL_B \\S^{-1}$\nso that Gershgorin disc left-ends of $\\cL_p$ are all aligned at the same value\n$\\lambda_{\\min}(\\cL_B)$. Finally, we perform PC sub-sampling on $\\cG_B$ using a\ngraph sampling algorithm to maximize $\\lambda^-_{\\min}(\\H^{\\top} \\H + \\mu\n\\cL_p)$ in roughly linear time.

It helps the clinicians immensely if the\nintelligibility assessment system is reliable, automatic, simple for (a)\npatients to undergo and (b) clinicians to interpret.

However, due to the high cost and poor convergence of CCSD\nwith respect to basis size, applying CCSD to periodic systems often leads to\nlarge basis set errors. In a common \"composite\" method, MP2 is used to recover\nthe missing dynamical correlation energy through a focal-point correction, but\nthe inadequacy of MP2 for metals raises questions about this approach. Here we\ndescribe how high-energy excitations treated by MP2 can be \"downfolded\" into a\nlow-energy active space to be treated by CCSD. Comparing how the composite and\ndownfolding approaches perform for the uniform electron gas, we find that the\nlatter converges more quickly with respect to the basis set size. Nonetheless,\nthe composite approach is surprisingly accurate because it removes the\nproblematic MP2 treatment of double excitations near the Fermi surface. Using\nthe method to estimate the CCSD correlation energy in the combined complete\nbasis set and thermodynamic limits, we find CCSD recovers over 90% of the exact\ncorrelation energy at $r_s=4$.

However, over the past years, the quantity\nof polymer counterfeits has been increasing, so has the quality of\ncounterfeits. This shows that the initial advantage of bringing a new polymer\ntechnology to fight against counterfeiting is reducing. To maintain one step\nahead of counterfeiters, we propose a novel anti-counterfeiting technique\ncalled Polymer Substrate Fingerprinting (PSF). Our technique is built based on\nthe observation that the opacity coating, a critical step during the production\nof polymer notes, is a stochastic manufacturing process, leaving uneven\nthickness in the coating layer and the random dispersion of impurities from the\nink. The imperfections in the coating layer result in random translucent\npatterns when a polymer banknote is back-lit by a light source. We show these\npatterns can be reliably captured by a commodity negative-film scanner and\nprocessed into a compact fingerprint to uniquely identify each banknote. Using\nan extensive dataset of 6,200 sample images collected from 340 UK banknotes, we\nshow that our method can reliably authenticate banknotes, and is robust against\nrough daily handling of banknotes. Furthermore, we show the extracted\nfingerprints contain around 900 bits of entropy, which makes it extremely\nscalable to identify every polymer note circulated globally. As compared with\nprevious or existing anti-counterfeiting mechanisms for banknotes, our method\nhas a distinctive advantage: it ensures that even in the extreme case when\ncounterfeiters have procured the same printing equipment and ink as used by a\nlegitimate government, counterfeiting banknotes remains infeasible because of\nthe difficulty to replicate a stochastic manufacturing process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 17:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

These shortcomings can be clearly shown in\nlower-level artificial tasks, mostly on synthetic data. Abstract patterns are\nthe best known examples of a hard problem for neural networks in terms of\ngeneralisation to unseen data.

It has been argued that these\nlow-level problems demonstrate the inability of neural networks to learn\nsystematically. In this study, we propose Embedded Relation Based Patterns\n(ERBP) as a novel way to create a relational inductive bias that encourages\nlearning equality and distance-based relations for abstract patterns. ERBP is\nbased on Relation Based Patterns (RBP), but modelled as a Bayesian prior on\nnetwork weights and implemented as a regularisation term in otherwise standard\nnetwork learning. ERBP is is easy to integrate into standard neural networks\nand does not affect their learning capacity.

Therefore, we experimentally and numerically studied two identical\ncircular cylinders oscillating in the still water with either a side-by-side or\na tandem configuration for a wide range of Keulegan-Carpenter number and Stokes\nnumber $\\beta$. The experiment result shows that the hydrodynamic performance\nof an oscillating cylinder pair in the still water is greatly altered due to\nthe interference between the multiple structures with different configurations.\nIn specific, compared to the single-cylinder case, the drag coefficient is\ngreatly enhanced when two cylinders are placed side-by-side at a small gap\nratio, while dual cylinders in a tandem configuration obtain a smaller drag\ncoefficient and oscillating lift coefficient. In order to reveal the detailed\nflow physics that result in significant fluid forces alternations, the detailed\nflow visualization is provided by the numerical simulation: the small gap\nbetween two cylinders in a side-by-side configuration will result in a strong\ngap jet that enhances the energy dissipation and increase the drag, while due\nto the flow blocking effect for two cylinders in a tandem configuration, the\ndrag coefficient decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 17:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

These confusing results were the first clues to the\nastounding complexity of plutonium. As this complexity was revealed, it\nintroduced new challenges for the fabrication of kilogram-scale parts. In a\nremarkable period from January 1944 to June 1945, Manhattan Project scientists\nmade rapid progress in understanding plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. By\nearly 1945, they had discovered five of the six ambient-pressure phases of\nunalloyed plutonium and reported the density of these phases to within a value\nof 0.1 g/cm$^3$ of those accepted today. They solved the stability problem\nintroduced by these phases with a rapid alloy development program that\nultimately identified gallium as the preferred element to stabilize the\ndelta-phase, producing a plutonium alloy still of scientific and technical\ninterest today. We conclude with a description of post-war developments in\nthese areas, including applications of wartime plutonium metallurgy to civilian\napplications in nuclear reactors.

A quantum advantage arises due to the intractability\nof quantum operations on a classical computer. Many datasets used in machine\nlearning are crowd sourced or contain some private information. To the best of\nour knowledge, no current QML models are equipped with privacy-preserving\nfeatures, which raises concerns as it is paramount that models do not expose\nsensitive information. Thus, privacy-preserving algorithms need to be\nimplemented with QML. One solution is to make the machine learning algorithm\ndifferentially private, meaning the effect of a single data point on the\ntraining dataset is minimized. Differentially private machine learning models\nhave been investigated, but differential privacy has yet to be studied in the\ncontext of QML. In this study, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that\nis trained to preserve privacy using differentially private optimization\nalgorithm. This marks the first proof-of-principle demonstration of\nprivacy-preserving QML. The experiments demonstrate that differentially private\nQML can protect user-sensitive information without diminishing model accuracy.\nAlthough the quantum model is simulated and tested on a classical computer, it\ndemonstrates potential to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum\ndevices (noisy intermediate-scale quantum [NISQ]). The approach's success is\nillustrated via the classification of spatially classed two-dimensional\ndatasets and a binary MNIST classification.

They have also shown promising results for synthesizing new\ndesigns, which is crucial for creating products and enabling innovation.\nGenerative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), have\nproven to be effective for design synthesis with applications ranging from\nproduct design to metamaterial design. These automated computational design\nmethods can support human designers, who typically create designs by a\ntime-consuming process of iteratively exploring ideas using experience and\nheuristics. However, there are still challenges remaining in automatically\nsynthesizing `creative' designs. GAN models, however, are not capable of\ngenerating unique designs, a key to innovation and a major gap in AI-based\ndesign automation applications. This paper proposes an automated method, named\nCreativeGAN, for generating novel designs. It does so by identifying components\nthat make a design unique and modifying a GAN model such that it becomes more\nlikely to generate designs with identified unique components. The method\ncombines state-of-art novelty detection, segmentation, novelty localization,\nrewriting, and generative models for creative design synthesis. Using a dataset\nof bicycle designs, we demonstrate that the method can create new bicycle\ndesigns with unique frames and handles, and generalize rare novelties to a\nbroad set of designs. Our automated method requires no human intervention and\ndemonstrates a way to rethink creative design synthesis and exploration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Electrochemical methods for harvesting low-grade heat\nhave attracted research interest in recent years due to the relatively high\neffective temperature coefficient of the electrolytes (> 1 mV/K) compared with\nthe thermopower of traditional thermoelectric devices. Comparing with other\nelectrochemical devices such as temperature-variation based thermally\nregenerative electrochemical cycle and temperature-difference based\nthermogalvanic cells, the thermally regenerative flow battery (TRFB) has the\nadvantages of providing a continuous power output, decoupling the heat source\nand heat sink and recuperating heat, and compatible with stacking for scaling\nup. However, TRFB suffers from the issue of stable operation due to the\nchallenge of pH matching between catholyte and anolyte solutions with desirable\ntemperature coefficients. In this work, we demonstrate a PH-neutral TRFB based\non KI/KI3 and K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 as the catholyte and anolyte, respectively,\nwith a cell temperature coefficient of 1.9 mV/K and a power density of 9\nuW/cm2.

We estimate that the efficiency of the pH-neutral TRFB\ncan reach 11% of the Carnot efficiency at the maximum power output with a\ntemperature difference of 37 K. Via analysis, we identify that the mass\ntransfer overpotential inside the porous electrode and the resistance of the\nion exchange membrane are the two major factors limiting the efficiency and\npower density, pointing to directions for future improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 16:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 01:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Previously, various researchers have considered the double wedge\nflow configuration for inviscid flow with variations of different inflows as\nwell as geometric parameters such as inflow Mach number , wedge angles, and\nwedge lengths. Few recently published articles reveal an unsteady flow physics\ninvolved with the hypersonic viscous flow for double wedge configuration with\nlarge second wedge angles. However, the reason for such self sustained flow\noscillations is not completely clear. The present work seeks out to investigate\nthe origin of such oscillations in a low enthalpy hypersonic flow with\ndifferent aft wedge angles and wedge length ratios.In the current study,\nviscous flow over a double wedge at Mach 7 and fore wedge angle of 30{\\deg} is\nconsidered. An improved version of rhoCentralFoam solver in OpenFOAM is used to\ninvestigate the double wedge flow over different grid resolutions in the\nseparation region and shock shock interaction region. This study corroborates\nthe observation from the previous literature with an improvement in the range\nof parameters which results in a self sustained periodic oscillation. The\npresent study also suggests that the unsteadiness becomes possible when the\nincidence shock is in the proximity of the aft wedge expansion corner as a\nconsequence of different wedge length ratios(L1/L2) or aft wedge angles\n({\\theta}2). Flow can still be steady at a large aft wedge angle if the\nincidence shock is far ahead of the aft wedge expansion corner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Even though such problems are\nubiquitous in statistics, machine learning and computer vision, however, this\nperception has not yet received a theoretical justification. To fill this gap,\nwe prove that computing the Wasserstein distance between a discrete probability\nmeasure supported on two points and the Lebesgue measure on the standard\nhypercube is already #P-hard. This insight prompts us to seek approximate\nsolutions for semi-discrete optimal transport problems. We thus perturb the\nunderlying transportation cost with an additive disturbance governed by an\nambiguous probability distribution, and we introduce a distributionally robust\ndual optimal transport problem whose objective function is smoothed with the\nmost adverse disturbance distributions from within a given ambiguity set. We\nfurther show that smoothing the dual objective function is equivalent to\nregularizing the primal objective function, and we identify several ambiguity\nsets that give rise to several known and new regularization schemes. As a\nbyproduct, we discover an intimate relation between semi-discrete optimal\ntransport problems and discrete choice models traditionally studied in\npsychology and economics. To solve the regularized optimal transport problems\nefficiently, we use a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with imprecise\nstochastic gradient oracles. A new convergence analysis reveals that this\nalgorithm improves the best known convergence guarantee for semi-discrete\noptimal transport problems with entropic regularizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 08:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

In September 1944, Robert Christy, working\nin the theoretical implosion group, proposed a novel concept that altered the\ndesign of the nuclear core in Fat Man. While scientists originally intended to\nuse a hollow sphere of plutonium, this design entailed substantial risk, due to\nthe likelihood of asymmetries resulting from implosion. Christy proposed\nchanging the design to a solid sphere of plutonium with a modulated neutron\nsource, and the design was eventually adopted, tested at Trinity, and used in\nthe attack on Nagasaki. While there is no question regarding the important role\nthat Christy played in demonstrating its feasibility as a reliable design,\nthere is a debate as to who initially proposed the idea; though most sources\nhave attributed this invention to Christy, some historical sources have\nattributed credit to Christy's group leader, Rudolf Peierls, or indeed other\nscientists. This paper seeks to outline and resolve this dispute. We present\nnew unclassified evidence extracted from previously unavailable sources (to\nunclassified audiences) from the National Security Research Center archives at\nLos Alamos National Laboratory. This evidence consists of 1945-1946 patent\ndocumentation, oral history interview tapes of Christy and Peierls, and monthly\n1944 progress reports from the Theoretical Division. Though Christy and Peierls\nshare joint credit on the patent, both Christy's and Peierls' words and\nwritings, together with sources from Hans Bethe and Edward Teller, support the\ntraditional view that Christy was indeed the originator of the idea. While\nChristy does deserve the majority of the credit for the invention and design,\nwe acknowledge the important role Peierls and von Neumann played in its\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

The properties of the population of Galactic supernova remnants\n(SNRs) are essential to our understanding of the dynamics of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in the Milky Way.

Deep interferometric radio continuum surveys of the Galactic\nplane help in rectifying this apparent deficiency by identifying low surface\nbrightness SNRs and compact SNRs that have not been detected in previous\nsurveys. However, SNRs are routinely confused with H II regions, which can have\nsimilar radio morphologies.

In some models helium accretion onto a\ncarbon-oxygen (CO) WD from a companion was suggested to dynamically trigger a\ndetonation of the accreted helium shell. The helium detonation then produces a\nshock that after converging on itself close to the core of the CO-WD, triggers\na secondary carbon detonation and gives rise to an energetic explosion.\nHowever, most studies of such scenarios have been done in one or two\ndimensions, and/or did not consider self-consistent models for the accretion\nand the He-donor. Here we make use of detailed 3D simulation to study the\ninteraction of a He-rich hybrid $0.69\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ HeCO WD with a more\nmassive $0.8\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ CO~WD. We find that accretion from the hybrid\nWD onto the CO~WD gives rise to a helium detonation. However, the helium\ndetonation does not trigger a carbon detonation in the CO~WD. Instead, the\nhelium detonation burns through the accretion stream to also burn the helium\nshell of the donor hybrid HeCO-WD. The detonation of its massive helium shell\nthen compresses its CO core, and triggers its detonation and full destruction.\nThe explosion gives rise to a faint, likely highly reddened transient,\npotentially observable by the Vera Rubin survey, and the high-velocity ($\\sim\n1000\\,\\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$) ejection of the heated surviving CO~WD companion.\nPending on uncertainties in stellar evolution we estimate the rate of such\ntransient to be up to $\\sim10\\%$ of the rate of type Ia SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

LOFAR has opened a new window on the discovery and\ninvestigation of GRGs and, despite the hundreds that are today known, their\nmain growth catalyst is still debated. One natural explanation for the\nexceptional size of GRGs is their old age. In this context, hard X-ray selected\nGRGs show evidence of restarting activity, with the giant radio lobes being\nmostly disconnected from the nuclear source, if any. In this paper, we present\nthe serendipitous discovery of a distant ($z=0.629$), medium X-ray selected GRG\nin the Bo\\\"otes field. High-quality, deep Chandra and LOFAR data allow a robust\nstudy of the connection between the nucleus and the lobes, at a larger redshift\nso far inaccessible to coded-mask hard X-ray instruments.

With a sample of 220\nsoftware professionals, we observed that very few professionals are keen to\ntake up testing careers. Some aspects of software testing, such as the learning\nopportunities, appear to be a common motivator across the four countries;\nwhereas the treatment meted out to testers as second-class citizens and the\ncomplexity of the job appeared to be the most important de-motivators.

The leader has specialized\ncapabilities or mission-critical information (e.g. goal location) that the\nfollowers lack, and this makes the leader crucial for the mission's success.\nHowever, this also makes the leader a vulnerability - an external adversary who\nwishes to sabotage the robot team's mission can simply harm the leader and the\nwhole robot team's mission would be compromised. Since robot motion generated\nby traditional leader-follower navigation algorithms can reveal the identity of\nthe leader, we propose a defense mechanism of hiding the leader's identity by\nensuring the leader moves in a way that behaviorally camouflages it with the\nfollowers, making it difficult for an adversary to identify the leader. To\nachieve this, we combine Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural\nNetworks and adversarial training. Our approach enables the multi-robot team to\noptimize the primary task performance with leader motion similar to follower\nmotion, behaviorally camouflaging it with the followers. Our algorithm\noutperforms existing work that tries to hide the leader's identity in a\nmulti-robot team by tuning traditional leader-follower control parameters with\nClassical Genetic Algorithms. We also evaluated human performance in inferring\nthe leader's identity and found that humans had lower accuracy when the robot\nteam used our proposed navigation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 22:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Compared to the\nconventional terrestrial RIS (TRIS), the aerial RIS (ARIS) enjoys higher\ndeployment flexibility, reliable air-to-ground links, and panoramic full-angle\nreflection. However, due to UAV's limited payload and battery capacity, it is\ndifficult for a UAV to carry a RIS with a large number of reflecting elements.\nThus, the scalability of the aperture gain could not be guaranteed. In\npractice, multiple UAVs can form a UAV swarm to enable the ARIS cooperatively.\nIn this article, we first present an overview of the UAV swarm-enabled ARIS\n(SARIS), including its motivations and competitive advantages compared to TRIS\nand ARIS, as well as its new transformative applications in wireless networks.\nWe then address the critical challenges of designing the SARIS by focusing on\nthe beamforming design, SARIS channel estimation, and SARIS's deployment and\nmovement.

In particular, by independently tuning the applied\ngate-to-source and drain-to-source biases, we observe that the phase of the\nsignal, in the super-high frequency band, can be varied nearly 200 degrees with\na constant gain of 2.5 dB. Additionally, if only the gate bias is used as\ncontrol signal, and the drain is biased linearly dependent on the former (i.e.,\nin a completely analogue operation), a phase shift of 85 degrees can be\nachieved making use of just one transistor and keeping a gain of 0 dB with a\nmaximum variation of 1.3 dB. The latter design can be improved by applying a\nbalanced branch-line configuration showing to be competitive against other\nstate-of-the-art phase shifters. This work paves the way towards the\nexploitation of graphene technology to become the core of active analogue phase\nshifters for high-frequency operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 22:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 10:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

The key idea of the Fog computing paradigm is to\nuse idle computation resources of various handheld, mobile, stationery and\nnetwork devices around us, to serve the application requests in the Fog-IoT\nenvironment. The devices in the Fog environment are autonomous and not\nexclusively dedicated to Fog application processing. Due to that, the\nprobability of device failure in the Fog environment is high compared with\nother distributed computing paradigms. Solving failure issues in Fog is crucial\nbecause successful application execution can only be ensured if failure can be\nhandled carefully. To handle failure, there are several techniques available in\nthe literature, such as checkpointing and task migration, each of which works\nwell in cloud based enterprise applications that mostly deals with static or\ntransactional data. These failure handling methods are not applicable to highly\ndynamic Fog environment. In contrast, this work focuses on solving the problem\nof managing application failure in the Fog environment by proposing a composite\nsolution (combining fuzzy logic-based task checkpointing and task migration\ntechniques with task replication) for failure handling and generating a robust\nschedule.

On the other hand, if we rerun the application in other devices after\nthe failure it will not comply with time-sensitiveness.

These conditions\nrequire the consideration of complex fluid behaviors that pose challenges for\nnumerical simulations, casting doubts on the validity of existing subgrid-scale\n(SGS) models in large-eddy simulations of these systems. While data-driven\nmethods have shown high accuracy as closure models in simulations of turbulent\nflames, these models are often criticized for lack of physical\ninterpretability, wherein they provide answers but no insight into their\nunderlying rationale. The objective of this study is to assess SGS stress\nmodels from conventional physics-driven approaches and an interpretable machine\nlearning algorithm, i.e., the random forest regressor, in a turbulent\ntranscritical non-premixed flame. To this end, direct numerical simulations\n(DNS) of transcritical liquid-oxygen/gaseous-methane (LOX/GCH4) inert and\nreacting flows are performed. Using this data, a priori analysis is performed\non the Favre-filtered DNS data to examine the accuracy of physics-based and\nrandom forest SGS-models under these conditions. SGS stresses calculated with\nthe gradient model show good agreement with the exact terms extracted from\nfiltered DNS. The accuracy of the random-forest regressor decreased when\nphysics-based constraints are applied to the feature set. Results demonstrate\nthat random forests can perform as effectively as algebraic models when\nmodeling subgrid stresses, only when trained on a sufficiently representative\ndatabase. The employment of random forest feature importance score is shown to\nprovide insight into discovering subgrid-scale stresses through sparse\nregression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

RL\nagents in high-dimensional states have two main learning burdens: (1) to learn\nan action-selection policy and (2) to learn to discern between useful and\nnon-useful information in a given state. By learning a latent representation of\nthese high-dimensional states with an auxiliary model, the latter burden is\neffectively removed, thereby leading to accelerated training progress. We\nexamine this phenomenon across tasks in the PyBullet Kuka environment, where an\nagent must learn to control a robotic gripper to pick up an object. Our\nanalysis reveals how neural network policies learn to organize their internal\nrepresentation of the state space throughout training. The results from this\nanalysis provide three main insights into how deep RL agents learn. First, a\nwell-organized internal representation within the policy network is a\nprerequisite to learning good action-selection. Second, a poor initial\nrepresentation can cause an unrecoverable collapse within a policy network.\nThird, a good initial representation allows an agent's policy network to\norganize its internal representation even before any training begins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

Since the wireless channels may be unreliable\ndue to the impurities of the propagation environments, such as deep fading,\nblockages, etc., we integrate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to the\nwireless system in order to mitigate the propagation-induced impairments,\nenhance the quality of the wireless links, and ensure that the required\nfreshness of information is achieved for these real-time applications.

Second, in\nthe case of sample-wise partitioned data, the proposed algorithm and a variant\nof it are analyzed, and their convergence to the true subspace at linear rates\nis established. Third, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndata are carried out to validate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms.

We show that the $(\\pi,0)$ magnetic ordering at\nhalf-filling, with ferromagnetic rungs and antiferromagnetic legs, becomes\nincommensurate upon hole doping. Moreover, depending on the strength of the\nHubbard $U$ coupling, other magnetic patterns, such as $(0,\\pi)$, are also\nstabilized. We found that the binding energy for two holes becomes negative for\nintermediate Hubbard interaction strength, indicating hole pairing. Due to the\ncrystal-field split among orbitals, the holes primarily reside in one orbital,\nwith the other one remaining half-filled. This resembles orbital selective Mott\nstates. The formation of tight hole pairs continues with increasing hole\ndensity, as long as the magnetic order remains antiferromagnetic in one\ndirection. The study of pair-pair correlations indicates the dominance of the\nintra-orbital spin-singlet channel, as opposed to other pairing channels.\nAlthough in a range of hole doping pairing correlations decay slowly, our\nresults can also be interpreted as corresponding to a charge-density-wave made\nof pairs, a precursor of eventual superconductivity after interladder couplings\nare included.

To learn the FairFil, we introduce a contrastive\nlearning framework that not only minimizes the correlation between filtered\nembeddings and bias words but also preserves rich semantic information of the\noriginal sentences. On real-world datasets, our FairFil effectively reduces the\nbias degree of pretrained text encoders, while continuously showing desirable\nperformance on downstream tasks. Moreover, our post-hoc method does not require\nany retraining of the text encoders, further enlarging FairFil's application\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 02:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

Handling this constraint requires solving\nseveral large dimensional systems that scale by the number of grid points in\nthe flow domain even though the nonlinear constraints scale only by the small\nnumber of points used to represent the fluid-structure interface. These costly\nlarge scale operations for determining only a small number of unknowns at the\ninterface creates a bottleneck to efficiently time-advancing strongly coupled\nIB methods. In this manuscript, we present a remedy for this bottleneck that is\nmotivated by the efficient strategy employed in stationary-body IB methods\nwhile preserving the favorable stability properties of strongly coupled\nalgorithms -- we precompute a matrix that encapsulates the large dimensional\nsystem so that the prohibitive large scale operations need not be performed at\nevery time step.

We also present a parallel\nimplementation that scales favorably across multiple processors.

First, to deal with\nmulti-view data scarcity, we propose a part-assisted novel view synthesis\nalgorithm for data augmentation. We train a part-based texture inpainting\nnetwork in a self-supervised manner. Then we render the textured model into the\nbackground image with the target 6-DoF pose. Second, to handle various camera\nparameters, we present a new method that produces dense mappings between image\npixels and 3D points to perform robust 2D/3D vehicle parsing. Third, we build\nthe first CVIS dataset for benchmarking, which annotates more than 1540 images\n(14017 instances) from real-world traffic scenarios. We combine these novel\nalgorithms and datasets to develop a robust approach for 2D/3D vehicle parsing\nfor CVIS.

Nonetheless, distress\ndetection surveys are still done via manual inspection for developing countries\nsuch as the Philippines. This study proposed the use of deep learning for two\nways of recording pavement distresses from 2D RGB images - detection and\nsegmentation. YOLOv4 is used for pavement distress detection while DeepLabv3 is\nemployed for pavement distress segmentation on a small dataset of pavement\nimages in the Philippines. This study aims to provide a basis to potentially\nspark solutions in building a cheap, scalable, and automated end-to-end\nsolution for PD detection in the country.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 05:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

Despite being only asymptotically valid,\nthey are ubiquitous because they permit statistical inference under very weak\nassumptions, and can often be applied to problems even when nonasymptotic\ninference is impossible. This paper introduces time-uniform analogues of such\nasymptotic confidence intervals. To elaborate, our methods take the form of\nconfidence sequences (CS) -- sequences of confidence intervals that are\nuniformly valid over time. CSs provide valid inference at arbitrary stopping\ntimes, incurring no penalties for \"peeking\" at the data, unlike classical\nconfidence intervals which require the sample size to be fixed in advance.\nExisting CSs in the literature are nonasymptotic, and hence do not enjoy the\naforementioned broad applicability of asymptotic confidence intervals. Our work\nbridges the gap by giving a definition for \"asymptotic CSs\", and deriving a\nuniversal asymptotic CS that requires only weak CLT-like assumptions. While the\nCLT approximates the distribution of a sample average by that of a Gaussian at\na fixed sample size, we use strong invariance principles (stemming from the\nseminal 1960s work of Strassen and improvements by Koml\\'os, Major, and\nTusn\\'ady) to uniformly approximate the entire sample average process by an\nimplicit Gaussian process. We demonstrate their utility by deriving\nnonparametric asymptotic CSs for the average treatment effect based on doubly\nrobust estimators in observational studies, for which no nonasymptotic methods\ncan exist even in the fixed-time regime.

Since then, many methods are proposed to defend against adversaries\nin inputs, but they are either attack-dependent or shown to be ineffective with\nnew attacks. And most of existing techniques have complicated structures or\nmechanisms that cause prohibitively high overhead or latency, impractical to\napply on real software.\n  We propose DAFAR, a feedback framework that allows deep learning models to\ndetect/purify adversarial examples in high effectiveness and universality, with\nlow area and time overhead. DAFAR has a simple structure, containing a victim\nmodel, a plug-in feedback network, and a detector. The key idea is to import\nthe high-level features from the victim model's feature extraction layers into\nthe feedback network to reconstruct the input. This data stream forms a\nfeedback autoencoder. For strong attacks, it transforms the imperceptible\nattack on the victim model into the obvious reconstruction-error attack on the\nfeedback autoencoder directly, which is much easier to detect; for weak\nattacks, the reformation process destroys the structure of adversarial\nexamples. Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data-sets, showing\nthat DAFAR is effective against popular and arguably most advanced attacks\nwithout losing performance on legitimate samples, with high effectiveness and\nuniversality across attack methods and parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 06:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

However,\nhow to effectively model linguistic rules in end-to-end deep networks remains a\nresearch challenge. In this paper, we argue that the limited capacity of\nlanguage models comes from: 1) implicitly language modeling; 2) unidirectional\nfeature representation; and 3) language model with noise input.\nCorrespondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and iterative ABINet\nfor scene text recognition. Firstly, the autonomous suggests to block gradient\nflow between vision and language models to enforce explicitly language\nmodeling. Secondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language\nmodel is proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we\npropose an execution manner of iterative correction for language model which\ncan effectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Additionally, based on the\nensemble of iterative predictions, we propose a self-training method which can\nlearn from unlabeled images effectively. Extensive experiments indicate that\nABINet has superiority on low-quality images and achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on several mainstream benchmarks.

Existing deep learning methods for this task\nrely on high-resolution input, which however, is not always available in many\nscenarios such as video surveillance and sports broadcasting. Two common\napproaches to deal with low-resolution images are applying super-resolution\ntechniques to the input, which may result in unpleasant artifacts, or simply\ntraining one model for each resolution, which is impractical in many realistic\napplications.\n  To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called\nRSC-Net, which consists of a Resolution-aware network, a Self-supervision loss,\nand a Contrastive learning scheme. The proposed method is able to learn 3D body\npose and shape across different resolutions with one single model. The\nself-supervision loss enforces scale-consistency of the output, and the\ncontrastive learning scheme enforces scale-consistency of the deep features.

Hence, in this study, we collected daily PA\ndata (including the data corresponding to the number of steps taken and the\ndata associated with six types of activities) by employing smartphones and\nthereby analyzed the changes in the PA of university students. The PA data were\ncollected over a period of ten weeks from 305 first-year university students\nwho were attending a mandatory class of physical education at the university.\nThe obtained results indicate that compared to the average number of steps\ntaken before the COVID-19 pandemic (6474.87 steps), the average number of steps\ntaken after the COVID-19 pandemic (3522.5 steps) has decreased by 45.6%.\nFurthermore, the decrease in commuting time (7 AM to 10 AM), classroom time,\nand extracurricular activity time (11 AM to 12 AM) has led to a decrease in PA\non weekdays owing to reduced unplanned exercise opportunities and has caused an\nincrease in the duration of being in the stationary state in the course of\ndaily life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

All the frames are annotated with a high-quality\npixel-level shadow mask. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nlearning-oriented dataset for video shadow detection. Furthermore, we develop a\nnew baseline model, named triple-cooperative video shadow detection network\n(TVSD-Net). It utilizes triple parallel networks in a cooperative manner to\nlearn discriminative representations at intra-video and inter-video levels.\nWithin the network, a dual gated co-attention module is proposed to constrain\nfeatures from neighboring frames in the same video, while an auxiliary\nsimilarity loss is introduced to mine semantic information between different\nvideos.

Secondly, the EPM-based RDO method is\npresented to project the existing distortion model on the plane normal and is\nsimplified to estimate the average normal vectors of coding units (CUs).\nFinally, we propose the OM-based merge prediction approach, in which the\nprediction pixels of merge modes are refined based on the occupancy map.\nExperiments tested on the standard point clouds show that the proposed method\nachieves an average 9.84\\% bitrate saving for geometry compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 09:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

This paper introduces an unsupervised medical\nimage denoising technique that learns noise characteristics from the available\nimages and constructs denoised images. It comprises of two blocks of data\nprocessing, viz., patch-based dictionaries that indirectly learn the noise and\nresidual learning (RL) that directly learns the noise. The model is generalized\nto account for both 2D and 3D images considering different medical imaging\ninstruments. The images are considered one-by-one from the stack of MRI/CT\nimages as well as the entire stack is considered, and decomposed into\noverlapping image/volume patches. These patches are given to the patch-based\ndictionary learning to learn noise characteristics via sparse representation\nwhile given to the RL part to directly learn the noise properties. K-singular\nvalue decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm for sparse representation is used for\ntraining patch-based dictionaries. On the other hand, residue in the patches is\ntrained using the proposed deep residue network. Iterating on these two parts,\nan optimum noise characterization for each image/volume patch is captured and\nin turn it is subtracted from the available respective image/volume patch. The\nobtained denoised image/volume patches are finally assembled to a denoised\nimage or 3D stack. We provide an analysis of the proposed approach with other\napproaches.

As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug\ndevelopments, Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here,\nusing molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding\nenergetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to\nfind the key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2\nRBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding\naffinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses\nidentified three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues\n(Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to\nbe the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces are from van\nder Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. It is also worth\nmention that we found seven mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476,\nGlu484, Gln498 and Val503) on SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the\nRBD-ACE2 binding.

Unfolding HeII-emitting, metal-poor starbursts at z\n~ 0 can yield insight into the powerful ionization processes occurring in the\nprimordial universe. Here we present a new study on the effects that X-ray\nsources have on the HeII ionization in the extremely metal-poor galaxy IZw18 (Z\n~ 3 % Zsolar), whose X-ray emission is dominated by a single high-mass X-ray\nbinary (HMXB).

Optical vortices\nwhich convey orbital angular momentum (OAM) possess a chirality associated with\nthe clockwise or anti-clockwise twisting of their wavefront. Here it is\nhighlighted that both oriented and randomly oriented chiral particles absorb\nphotons from twisted beams at different rates depending on whether the vortex\ntwists to the right or the left through a dipole coupling scheme. This is in\ncontrast to previous studies that investigated dipole couplings with vortex\nmodes in the paraxial approximation and showed no such chiral sensitivity to\nthe vortex handedness: only in oriented media where electric quadrupole\ncoupling contributes to optical activity effects due to absorption does such a\nmechanism exist for paraxial vortices. The distinct difference in the scheme\nhighlighted in this work is that longitudinal fields are taken account of and\nthese allow for OAM transfer even during dipole interactions.

We compared the structures by the fraction of galaxies in filaments\nand the volume filled by filaments, and we analysed the similarities between\nthe results from different cuts based on the overlap between detected\nfilamentary structures.

Multiple samples show that galaxies in filaments have preferentially\nhigher luminosity. We found that when a galaxy is in a filament there is a 97%\nchance that the same galaxy would be in a filament with even more complete\ninput data and about 85% of filaments are persistent when detecting the\nfilamentary network with higher-density input data.

It has become a global\nissue and concern in this digital era when virtually all business transactions,\nlearning, communication and many other activities are performed online. Virus\nattack, poor authentication technique, improper file backups and the use of\ndifferent social engineering approaches by cyber-attackers to deceive internet\nusers into divulging their confidential information with the intention to\nattack them have serious negative implications on the industries and\norganisations, including educational institutions. Moreover, risks associated\nwith these ugly phenomena are likely to be more in developing countries such as\nNigeria. Thus, authors of this paper undertook an online pilot study among\nstudents and employees of University of Nigeria, Nsukka and a total of 145\nresponses were received and used for the study. The survey seeks to find out\nthe effect of age and level of education on the cyber hygiene knowledge and\nbehaviour of the respondents, and in addition, the type of devices used and\nactivities they engage in while on the internet. Our findings show wide\nadoption of internet in institution of higher learning, whereas, significant\nnumber of the internet users do not have good cyber hygiene knowledge and\nbehaviour. Hence, our findings can instigate an organised training for students\nand employees of higher institutions in Nigeria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 11:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

However, bound propagation cannot\nfully handle the neuron split constraints introduced by BaB commonly handled by\nexpensive linear programming (LP) solvers, leading to loose bounds and hurting\nverification efficiency. In this work, we develop $\\beta$-CROWN, a new bound\npropagation based method that can fully encode neuron splits via optimizable\nparameters $\\beta$ constructed from either primal or dual space. When jointly\noptimized in intermediate layers, $\\beta$-CROWN generally produces better\nbounds than typical LP verifiers with neuron split constraints, while being as\nefficient and parallelizable as CROWN on GPUs. Applied to complete robustness\nverification benchmarks, $\\beta$-CROWN with BaB is up to three orders of\nmagnitude faster than LP-based BaB methods, and is notably faster than all\nexisting approaches while producing lower timeout rates. By terminating BaB\nearly, our method can also be used for efficient incomplete verification. We\nconsistently achieve higher verified accuracy in many settings compared to\npowerful incomplete verifiers, including those based on convex barrier breaking\ntechniques. Compared to the typically tightest but very costly semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) based incomplete verifiers, we obtain higher verified\naccuracy with three orders of magnitudes less verification time.

Recent works predict that, in the overwhelming majority of\ncases, the unperturbed dynamics is just damped by a simple function, e.g.,\nexponentially as expected from Fermi's golden rule. While these predictions\nrely on random-matrix arguments and typicality, they can only be verified for a\nspecific physical situation by comparing to the actual solution or measurement.\nCrucially, it also remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions\ncounterexamples to the typical behavior occur. In this work, we discuss this\nquestion from the perspective of projection-operator techniques, where\nexponential damping of a density matrix occurs in the interaction picture but\nnot necessarily in the Schr\\\"odinger picture. We show that a nontrivial damping\nin the Schr\\\"odinger picture can emerge if the dynamics in the unperturbed\nsystem possesses rich features, for instance due to the presence of strong\ninteractions. This suggestion has consequences for the time dependence of\ncorrelation functions.

Originally suggested on purely dimensional grounds, this roughness\nlength does not directly correspond to a measurable physical quantity of the\nwind-and-wave system. Here, to go beyond this representation, we formalize\nideas underlying the Beaufort scale by quantifying the velocity of breaking\nshort waves that are the most coupled to near-surface wind. This velocity\nincreases with wind speed, reflecting the fact that stronger winds can be\nvisually identified by longer (and faster) breakers becoming predominant on the\nsea surface. A phenomenological turbulence model further shows that this\nvelocity is associated with breaking waves that impede the most the formation\nof turbulent eddies.

The mode-group (MG) superposed by specific single mode plane spiral OAM\n(PSOAM) waves has been proved to be a flexible beamforming method to achieve\nthe azimuthal pattern diversity, which inherits the spiral phase distribution\nof conventional OAM wave. Thus, it possesses both the beam directionality and\nvorticity. In this paper, it's the first time to show and verify novel PSOAM MG\nbased multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) communication link (MG-MIMO)\nexperimentally in a line-of-sight (LoS) scenario. A compact multi-mode PSOAM\nantenna is demonstrated experimentally to generate multiple independent\ncontrollable PSOAM waves, which can be used for constructing MGs. After several\nproof-of-principle tests, it has been verified that the beam directionality\ngain of MG can improve the receiving signal-to-noise (SNR) level in an actual\nsystem, meanwhile, the vorticity can provide another degree of freedom (DoF) to\nreduce the spatial correlation of MIMO system. Furthermore, a tentative\nlong-distance transmission experiment operated at 10.2 GHz has been performed\nsuccessfully at a distance of 50 m with a single-way spectrum efficiency of 3.7\nbits/s/Hz/stream. The proposed MG-MIMO may have potential in the long-distance\nLoS back-haul scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 14:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

However, traditional constitutive models\nbased on partial differential equations (PDEs) often lack robustness and are\ntoo rigid to accommodate diverse calibration datasets.

Such nonlocal\ninformation is represented by a group of points, each having a feature vector\nattached to it, and thus the input is referred to as vector cloud. The cloud is\nmapped to the closure variable through a frame-independent neural network,\ninvariant both to coordinate translation and rotation and to the ordering of\npoints in the cloud. As such, the network can deal with any number of\narbitrarily arranged grid points and thus is suitable for unstructured meshes\nin fluid simulations.

We estimate the ages of the\ncataloged stars, model the distributions of their periods, mass ratios,\ntemperatures and other quantities, and compare them with the data from CRTS,\nLAMOST and Gaia archives. As only a small fraction of the sample has radial\nvelocity curves, we examine the reliability of the photometric mass ratios in\ntotally and partially eclipsing systems and find that totally eclipsing W UMa\nstars with photometric mass ratios have the same parameter distributions as\nthose with spectroscopic mass ratios. Most of the stars with reliable\nparameters have mass ratios below 0.5 and orbital periods shorter than 0.5\ndays.

At any stage S: for any sets found before S, we find a set whose\nmembers are exactly those sets. We find nothing else at S.' Surprisingly, this\nstory already guarantees that the sets are arranged in well-ordered levels, and\nsuffices for quasi-categoricity. I show this by presenting Level Theory, a\nsimplifiation of set theories due to Scott, Montague, Derrick, and Potter.\n  PART 2. Potentialists think that the concept of set is importantly modal.\nUsing tensed language as an heuristic, the following bare-bones story\nintroduces the idea of a potential hierarchy of sets: 'Always: for any sets\nthat existed, there is a set whose members are exactly those sets; there are no\nother sets.' Surprisingly, this story already guarantees well-foundedness and\npersistence. Moreover, if we assume that time is linear, the ensuing modal set\ntheory is almost definitionally equivalent with non-modal set theories;\nspecifically, with Level Theory, as developed in Part 1.\n  PART 3. On a very natural conception of sets, every set has an absolute\ncomplement. The ordinary cumulative hierarchy dismisses this idea outright. But\nwe can rectify this, whilst retaining classical logic. Indeed, we can develop a\nboolean algebra of sets arranged in well-ordered levels. I show this by\npresenting Boolean Level Theory, which fuses ordinary Level Theory (from Part\n1) with ideas due to Thomas Forster, Alonzo Church, and Urs Oswald.

Since polyps vary in their shape, size, color,\nand texture, accurate polyp segmentation is very challenging. One promising way\nto mitigate the diversity of polyps is to model the contextual relation for\neach pixel such as using attention mechanism. However, previous methods only\nfocus on learning the dependencies between the position within an individual\nimage and ignore the contextual relation across different images. In this\npaper, we propose Duplex Contextual Relation Network (DCRNet) to capture both\nwithin-image and cross-image contextual relations. Specifically, we first\ndesign Interior Contextual-Relation Module to estimate the similarity between\neach position and all the positions within the same image. Then Exterior\nContextual-Relation Module is incorporated to estimate the similarity between\neach position and the positions across different images. Based on the above two\ntypes of similarity, the feature at one position can be further enhanced by the\ncontextual region embedding within and across images. To store the\ncharacteristic region embedding from all the images, a memory bank is designed\nand operates as a queue. Therefore, the proposed method can relate similar\nfeatures even though they come from different images. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on the EndoScene, Kvasir-SEG and the recently released large-scale\nPICCOLO dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed DCRNet outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods in terms of the widely-used evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 15:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 03:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 13:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Martian geology is characterized by past evidence for\nepisodic surface liquid water, and geochemistry indicating a slow and\nintermittent transition from wetter to drier and more oxidizing surface\nconditions. Here we present a new model incorporating randomized injection of\nreducing greenhouse gases and oxidation due to hydrogen escape, to investigate\nthe conditions responsible for these diverse observations. We find that Mars\ncould have transitioned repeatedly from reducing (H2-rich) to oxidizing\n(O2-rich) atmospheric conditions in its early history. Our model predicts a\ngenerally cold early Mars, with mean annual temperatures below 240 K. If peak\nreducing gas release rates and background CO2 levels are high enough, it\nnonetheless exhibits episodic warm intervals sufficient to degrade crater\nwalls, form valley networks and create other fluvial/lacustrine features. Our\nmodel also predicts transient buildup of atmospheric O2, which can help explain\nthe occurrence of oxidized mineral species such as manganese oxides at Gale\nCrater. We suggest that the apparent Noachian--Hesperian transition from\nphyllosilicate deposition to sulfate deposition around 3.5 billion years ago\ncan be explained as a combined outcome of increasing planetary oxidation,\ndecreasing groundwater availability and a waning bolide impactor flux, which\ndramatically slowed the remobilization and thermochemical destruction of\nsurface sulfates. Ultimately, rapid and repeated variations in Mars' early\nclimate and surface chemistry would have presented both challenges and\nopportunities for any emergent microbial life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 15:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

The\nphysical mechanism underlying this acceleration is the fact that polaritons,\nespecially the lower polariton, can be transiently excited during the\nnonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy\ntransfer. The VSC effects on these rates (i) resonantly depend on the cavity\nmode detuning, (ii) cooperatively depend on molecular concentration or Rabi\nsplitting, and (iii) collectively scale with the number of hot molecules, which\nis similar to Dicke's superradiance.

Traditional biometric\nsystems like face, fingerprint, and iris recognition, keystroke dynamics, etc.\nare prone to cyber-attacks and suffer from different disadvantages.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) based authentication has shown promise in\novercoming these limitations. However, EEG-based authentication is less\naccurate due to signal variability at different psychological and physiological\nconditions. On the other hand, keystroke dynamics-based identification offers\nhigh accuracy but suffers from different spoofing attacks. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a novel multimodal biometric system combining EEG and\nkeystroke dynamics. Firstly, a dataset was created by acquiring both keystroke\ndynamics and EEG signals from 10 users with 500 trials per user at 10 different\nsessions. Different statistical, time, and frequency domain features were\nextracted and ranked from the EEG signals and key features were extracted from\nthe keystroke dynamics. Different classifiers were trained, validated, and\ntested for both individual and combined modalities for two different\nclassification strategies - personalized and generalized. Results show that\nvery high accuracy can be achieved both in generalized and personalized cases\nfor the combination of EEG and keystroke dynamics.

A\ncombination of a deep ResNet architecture and residual adapters is transferred\nfrom the field of multi-domain visual recognition to multi-corpus SER on\nEmoSet. Compared against two suitable baselines and more traditional training\nand transfer settings for the ResNet, the residual adapter approach enables\nparameter efficient training of a multi-domain SER model on all 26 corpora.

Methods for early failure\nprediction are essential for engineering, military, and civil applications. In\naddition to the prediction of time to failure (TtF), uncertainty quantification\n(UQ) is of major importance for real-time decision-making purposes. Usually,\ntime domain or frequency domain methods are used for fatigue prediction, such\nas rainflow counting and Miner's rule or Dirlik's method. However, those\nmethods suffer from over-simplistic modeling and inaccurate failure predictions\nunder stochastic loadings. During the last years, several data-driven models\nwere suggested for offline fatigue failure. However, most of them are not\ncapable of both accurate real-time fatigue prediction and UQ. In the current\nwork, a probabilistic data-driven model is introduced. A hybrid architecture of\na fully-connected artificial neural network (FC-ANN) and Gaussian process\nregression (GPR) is proposed to ensure enhanced predictive abilities and\nsimultaneous UQ of the predicted TtF.

A major policy question is whether\ne-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left\nby them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal\npatterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing\non their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results\nfrom an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both\ncompeting and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The\nsupply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit\nand bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes\nto transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals\nthat when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and\nsave some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19\npandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that\npublic health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main\ndriver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we\nfind that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services\nto underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of\ne-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services.

Further, we show that the benefits of\nmachine-learning-based optimal targeting even materialize when the charity only\nexploits publicly available geospatial information or applies the estimated\noptimal targeting rule to later fundraising campaigns conducted in similar\nsamples. We conclude that charities not engaging in optimal targeting waste\nsignificant resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 23:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 14:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 10:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

In particular, by taking different kernel and\nnormalization functions, this framework can deduce some other new fractional\ngrey models. To further improve the prediction performance, the four popular\nintelligent algorithms are employed to determine the emerging coefficients for\nthe UFGM(1,1) model. Two published cases are then utilized to verify the\nvalidity of the UFGM(1,1) model and explore the effects of fractional\naccumulation order and initial value on the prediction accuracy, respectively.\nFinally, this model is also applied to dealing with two real examples so as to\nfurther explain its efficacy and equally show how to use the unified framework\nin practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 13:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 03:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

The model is\ndeveloped within a consistent variational framework in the context of\nfinite-deformation kinematics. A novel coalescence dissipation introduces a new\ncoupling mechanism between plasticity and fracture by degrading the fracture\ntoughness as the equivalent plastic strain increases. The proposed model is\ncompared with a recent alternative where plasticity and fracture are strongly\ncoupled. Several representative numerical examples motivate specific modeling\nchoices. In particular, a linear crack geometric function provides an\n\"unperturbed\" ductile response prior to crack initiation, and Lorentz-type\ndegradation functions ensure that the critical fracture strength remains\nindependent of the phase-field regularization length. In addition, the response\nof the model is demonstrated to converge with a vanishing phase-field\nregularization length. The model is then applied to calibrate and simulate a\nthree-point bending experiment of an aluminum specimen with a complex geometry.\nThe effect of the proposed coalescence dissipation coupling on simulations of\nthe experiment is first investigated in a two-dimensional plane strain setting.\nThe calibrated model is then applied to a three-dimensional calculation, where\nthe calculated load-deflection curves and the crack trajectory show excellent\nagreement with experimental observations. Finally, the model is applied to\nsimulate crack nucleation and growth in a specimen from a recent Sandia\nFracture Challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 01:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

GANs help to learn the true data representation through a two-player\nmin-max game. However, training an E2E ASR model using a large ASR corpus with\na GAN framework has never been explored, because it might take excessively long\ntime due to high-variance gradient updates and face convergence issues. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel framework for fine-tuning a pre-trained ASR model\nusing the GAN objective where the ASR model acts as a generator and a\ndiscriminator tries to distinguish the ASR output from the real data. Since the\nASR model is pre-trained, we hypothesize that the ASR model output (soft\ndistribution vectors) helps to get higher scores from the discriminator and\nmakes the task of the discriminator harder within our GAN framework, which in\nturn improves the performance of the ASR model in the fine-tuning stage. Here,\nthe pre-trained ASR model is fine-tuned adversarially against the discriminator\nusing an additional adversarial loss.
