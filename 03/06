In economics, the\nterm matching theory is coined for pairing two agents in a specific market to\nreach a stable or optimal state. In computer science, all branches of matching\nproblems have emerged, such as the question-answer matching in information\nretrieval, user-item matching in a recommender system, and entity-relation\nmatching in the knowledge graph. A preference list is the core element during a\nmatching process, which can either be obtained directly from the agents or\ngenerated indirectly by prediction. Based on the preference list access,\nmatching problems are divided into two categories, i.e., explicit matching and\nimplicit matching. In this paper, we first introduce the matching theory's\nbasic models and algorithms in explicit matching. The existing methods for\ncoping with various matching problems in implicit matching are reviewed, such\nas retrieval matching, user-item matching, entity-relation matching, and image\nmatching. Furthermore, we look into representative applications in these areas,\nincluding marriage and labor markets in explicit matching and several\nsimilarity-based matching problems in implicit matching.

We use a comprehensive set\nof extreme ultraviolet scatterometry measurements of non-diffusive transport\nfrom transiently heated nanolines and nanodots to validate and generalize our\nab initio model, that does not need any geometry-dependent fitting parameters.\nThis allows us to uncover the existence of two distinct timescales and heat\ntransport mechanisms: an interface resistance regime that dominates on short\ntime scales, and a hydrodynamic-like phonon transport regime that dominates on\nlonger timescales. Moreover, our model can predict the full thermomechanical\nresponse on nanometer length scales and picosecond time scales for arbitrary\ngeometries, providing an advanced practical tool for thermal management of\nnanoscale technologies. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the\ntransport timescales, valid for a subset of geometries, supplying a route for\noptimizing heat dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 16:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

In the case of successful\ncompact object formation, we subsequently follow the secular dynamical\nevolution of the quadruple system.

A\nsmall subset shows imprints of secular evolution through residual eccentricity\nin the LIGO band, and retrograde spin-orbit orientations. Second-generation\nmergers are ~10^7 times less common than first-generation mergers, and can be\nstrongly affected by scattering (i.e., three-body interactions) induced by the\nfirst-generation merger.

The main idea of our paper is to\nexecute the computed motion only if a collision-free and torque-limited way to\ncontinue the trajectory is known. In practice, the motion computed for the\ncurrent time interval is extended by a braking trajectory and simulated using a\nphysics engine. If the simulated trajectory complies with all safety\nconstraints, the computed motion is carried out. Otherwise, the braking\ntrajectory calculated in the previous time interval serves as an alternative\nsafe behavior. Given a task-specific reward function, the neural network is\ntrained using reinforcement learning.

Suppose that the measurements are such\nthat the algorithm does not guarantee perfect support recovery and that true\nfeatures may be missed. Can they efficiently be retrieved? This paper addresses\nthis question through a simple error-correction module referred to as LiRE.\nLiRE takes as input an estimate $s_{in}$ of the true support $s^*$, and outputs\na refined support estimate $s_{out}$. In the noiseless measurement setup,\nsufficient conditions are established under which LiRE is guaranteed to recover\nthe entire support, that is $s_{out}$ contains $s^*$. These conditions imply,\nfor instance, that in the high-dimensional regime LiRE can correct a sublinear\nin $m$ number of errors made by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The\ncomputational complexity of LiRE is $O(mnd)$. Experimental results with random\nGaussian design matrices show that LiRE substantially reduces the number of\nmeasurements needed for perfect support recovery via Compressive Sampling\nMatching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit (BP), and OMP. Interestingly, adding LiRE to\nOMP yields a support recovery procedure that is more accurate and significantly\nfaster than BP. This observation carries over in the noisy measurement setup.\nFinally, as a standalone support recovery algorithm with a random\ninitialization, experiments show that LiRE's reconstruction performance lies\nbetween OMP and BP. These results suggest that LiRE may be used generically, on\ntop of any suboptimal baseline support recovery algorithm, to improve support\nrecovery or to operate with a smaller number of measurements, at the cost of a\nrelatively small computational overhead. Alternatively, LiRE may be used as a\nstandalone support recovery algorithm that is competitive with respect to OMP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 17:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

The six strongest hyperfine components of the\n2,0,2-1,0,1 rotational transition, lying at 37.46~GHz, were detected with\nsignal-to-noise ratios in the range 4.6-12.3 sigma. We derive a column density\nof 8.7e13 cm-2 for CH2CCH, which translates to a fractional abundance relative\nto H2 of 8.7e-9. This radical has a similar abundance to methyl acetylene, with\nan abundance ratio CH2CCH/CH3CCH close to one. The propargyl radical is thus\none of the most abundant radicals detected in TMC-1, and it is probably the\nmost abundant organic radical with a certain chemical complexity ever found in\na cold dark cloud.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the promising\napproaches that enable model-free redesign of optimal controllers for nonlinear\ndynamical systems based only on the measurement of the closed-loop system.\nHowever, the learning process of RL usually requires a considerable number of\ntrial-and-error experiments using the poorly controlled system that may\naccumulate wear on the plant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nmodel-free two-step design approach that improves the transient learning\nperformance of RL in an optimal regulator redesign problem for unknown\nnonlinear systems.

A fully-discrete entropy-stable scheme\nis obtained by adopting the relaxation Runge-Kutta version of the midpoint\nmethod. In addition, DGD matrix operators for the first derivative are shown to\nbe dense-norm SBP operators. Numerical results are presented to verify the\naccuracy and entropy-stability of the DGD discretization in the context of the\nEuler equations. The results suggest that DGD and SBP solution errors are\nsimilar for the same number of degrees of freedom. Finally, an investigation of\nthe DGD spectra shows that spectral radius is relatively insensitive to\ndiscretization order; however, the high-order methods do suffer from the linear\ninstability reported for other entropy-stable discretizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 17:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

This problem exacerbates for Software\nProduct Lines (SPLs), where their size and variability combine to make\nonboarding even more challenging, even more so for developers that are\ntransferred from the Application Engineering team into the Domain Engineering\nteam, who will be our target newcomers. This work presents concept maps on the\nrole of sensemaking scaffolds to help to introduce these newcomers into the SPL\ndomain. Concept maps, used as knowledge visualisation tools, have been proven\nto be helpful for meaningful learning. Our main insight is to capture concepts\nof the SPL domain and their interrelationships in a concept map, and then,\npresent them incrementally, helping newcomers grasp the SPL and aiding them in\nexploring it in a guided manner while avoiding information overload.

After a\nmajor merger, the MA-shock radius is larger than $r_{\\rm sp}$ by a factor of up\nto $\\sim1.7$ for $\\Gamma_{\\rm s}\\lesssim1$ and is $\\sim r_{\\rm sp}$ for\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm s}\\gtrsim3$. This implies that (1) mergers could easily generate\nthe MA-shock-splashback offset measured in cosmological simulations, and (2)\nthe smooth MAR is small in regions away from filaments where MA-shocks reside.\nWe further discuss various shocks and contact discontinuities formed at\ndifferent epochs of the merger, the ram pressure stripping in cluster\noutskirts, and the dependence of member galaxies' splashback feature on their\norbital parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 18:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, little is known about the accretion\nproperties of young stellar objects (YSOs) in younger regions and early stages\nof star formation, such as in the Class0/I phases. We present new NIR spectra\nof 17 ClassI/Flat and 35 ClassII sources located in the young (<1Myr) NGC1333\ncluster, acquired with the KMOS instrument at the VLT. Our goal is to study\nwhether the mass accretion rate evolves with age, as suggested by the widely\nadopted viscous evolution model, by comparing the properties of the NGC1333\nmembers with samples of older regions. We measured the stellar parameters and\naccretion rates of our sample, finding a correlation between accretion and\nstellar luminosity, and between mass accretion rate and stellar mass. Both\ncorrelations are compatible within the errors with the older Lupus star-forming\nregion, while only the latter is consistent with results from ChamaeleonI. The\nClassI sample shows larger accretion luminosities with respect to the ClassII\nstars of the same cloud. However, the derived accretion rates are not\nsufficiently high to build up the inferred stellar masses, assuming steady\naccretion during the ClassI lifetime. This suggests that the sources are not in\ntheir main accretion phase and that most of their mass has already been\naccumulated during a previous stage and/or that the accretion is an episodic\nphenomenon. We show that some of the targets originally classified as Class I\nthrough Spitzer photometry are in fact evolved or low accreting objects. This\nevidence can have implications for the estimated protostellar phase lifetimes.\nFurther observations are needed to determine if this is a general result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 18:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

We implement our model into the Gasoline2 code and perform a\nseries of cosmological simulations varying a number of key parameters, foremost\nevaluating different stellar yield sets for massive stars from the literature.\nWe find that total metallicity, total iron abundance and gas phase oxygen\nabundance are robust predictions from different yield sets and in agreement\nwith observational relations. On the other hand, individual element abundances,\nespecially $\\alpha$-elements show significant differences across different\nyield sets and none of our models can simultaneously match constraints on the\ndwarf and MW mass scale. This offers a unique way of observationally\nconstraining model parameters. For MW mass galaxies we find for most yield\ntables tested in this work a bimodality in the $[\\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane\nof rather low intrinsic scatter potentially in tension with the observed\nabundance scatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Through the first\npart of this paper, we demonstrate how the RNN-based direct policy search RL\nagents can perform delta hedging better than the classic Black-Scholes model in\nQ-world based on parametrically generated underlying scenarios, particularly\nminimizing tail exposures at higher values of the risk aversion parameter.

However sufficiently\nnearby massive stars can heat the outer disc to substantially higher\ntemperatures. In this paper we study the radiative equilibrium temperature of\ndiscs in the presence of massive external sources and gauge the effect that it\nhas on millimetre dust mass estimates. Since millimetre grains are not\nentrained in any wind we focus on geometrically simple 2D-axisymmetric disc\nmodels using radiative transfer calculations with both the host star and an\nexternal source. Recent surveys have searched for evidence of massive stars\ninfluencing disc evolution using disc properties as a function of projected\nseparation. In assuming a disc temperature of $20$K for a disc a distance $D$\nfrom a strong radiation source, disc masses are overestimated by a factor that\nscales with $D^{-1/2}$ interior to the separation that external heating becomes\nimportant. This could significantly alter dust mass estimates of discs in close\nproximity to $\\theta^1$C in the Orion Nebular Cluster. We also make an initial\nassessment of the effect upon snow lines.

In\nthis method the voters give (weak) ordinal preference ballots which are used to\ndefine the weighted majority graph (WMG) of direct comparisons between pairs of\ncandidates. The choice of the winner comes from indirect comparisons in the\ngraph, and more specifically from considering directed paths instead of direct\ncomparisons between candidates.\n  When the input is the WMG, to our knowledge, the fastest algorithm for\ncomputing all winners in the Schulze method uses a folklore reduction to the\nAll-Pairs Bottleneck Paths problem and runs in $O(m^{2.69})$ time, where $m$ is\nthe number of candidates. It is an interesting open question whether this can\nbe improved. Our first result is a combinatorial algorithm with a nearly\nquadratic running time for computing all winners. This running time is\nessentially optimal. If the input to the Schulze winners problem is not the WMG\nbut the preference profile, then constructing the WMG is a bottleneck that\nincreases the running time significantly; in the special case when there are\n$m$ candidates and $n=O(m)$ voters, the running time is $O(m^{2.69})$, or\n$O(m^{2.5})$ if there is a nearly-linear time algorithm for multiplying dense\nsquare matrices. To address this bottleneck, we prove a formal equivalence\nbetween the well-studied Dominance Product problem and the problem of computing\nthe WMG. We prove a similar connection between the so called Dominating Pairs\nproblem and the problem of finding a winner in the Schulze method.\n  Our paper is the first to bring fine-grained complexity into the field of\ncomputational social choice. Using it we can identify voting protocols that are\nunlikely to be practical for large numbers of candidates and/or voters, as\ntheir complexity is likely, say at least cubic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 22:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

In this regard, most of the recent\nstudies have focused on iterative reconstruction algorithms, and little\nattention has been paid to restoration of the projection measurements, i.e.,\nthe sinogram. In this paper, we propose a novel sinogram interpolation\nalgorithm. The proposed algorithm exploits the self-similarity and smoothness\nof the sinogram. Sinogram self-similarity is modeled in terms of the similarity\nof small blocks extracted from stacked projections. The smoothness is modeled\nvia second-order total variation. Experiments with simulated and real CT data\nshow that sinogram interpolation with the proposed algorithm leads to a\nsubstantial improvement in the quality of the reconstructed image, especially\non low-dose scans. The proposed method can result in a significant reduction in\nthe number of projection measurements. This will reduce the radiation dose and\nalso the amount of data that need to be stored or transmitted, if the\nreconstruction is to be performed in a remote site.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 22:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

To\ntackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of\nthe stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation method. This technique\nrigorously describes the full thermodyamics of crystals accounting for nuclear\nquantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the\nevaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with\nrespect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in\nsupercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles\ndensity-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry\nrelaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy\nwith respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used\nto determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables\nthe calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase\ntransitions from the Hessian of the free energy.

In the context\nof the Hamiltonian description, the helicity is a Casimir invariant\ncharacterizing a foliation of the associated Poisson manifold. Casimir\ninvariants are special invariants that depend on the Poisson bracket, not on\nthe particular choice of the Hamiltonian. The total mass (or particle number)\nis another Casimir invariant, whose invariance guarantees the mass (particle)\nconservation (independent of any specific choice of the Hamiltonian). In a\nkinetic description (e.g. that of the Vlasov equation), the helicity is no\nlonger an invariant (although the total mass remains a Casimir of the Vlasov's\nPoisson algebra). The implication is that some \"kinetic effect\" can violate the\nconstancy of the helicity. To elucidate how the helicity constraint emerges or\nsubmerges, we examine the fluid reduction of the Vlasov system; the fluid\n(macroscopic) system is a \"sub-algebra\" of the kinetic (microscopic) Vlasov\nsystem. In the Vlasov system, the helicity can be conserved, if a special\nhelicity symmetry condition holds. To put it another way, breaking helicity\nsymmetry induces a change in the helicity. We delineate the geometrical meaning\nof helicity symmetry, and show that, for a special class of flows (so-called\nepi-2 dimensional flows), the helicity symmetry is written as $\\partial_\\gamma\n=0$ for a coordinate $\\gamma$ of the configuration space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 00:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 12:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 00:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

We\nconsider the locomotion of an untethered robot, in the granular medium,\ncomprised of multiple flexible flagella that rotate about an axis by a motor.\nDrag from the grains causes the flagella to deform and the deformed shape\ngenerates a net forward propulsion. This external drag force depends on the\nshape of the flagella, while the change in flagellar shape is the result of the\ncompetition between the external loading and elastic forces. We introduce a\nnumerical tool that couples discrete differential geometry based simulation of\nelastic rods - our model for flagella - and a resistive force theory based\nmodel for the drag. In parallel with simulations, we conduct experiments to\nquantify the propulsive speed of this class of robots. We find reasonable\nquantitative agreement between experiments and simulations.

Over a range of +-15 meV energy transfer there is good agreement\nbetween the measurements of PMMA and Tempax at low temperature, and room\ntemperature powder diffraction from aluminum so we consider this to be a good\nindication of the true resolution of our ~1.3 meV spectrometer.

Common strategies for camouflage include background matching,\nimitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration,\ndisguising body outlines [35]. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to\nsegment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models\nare built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without\nillustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and\nargue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects\nagainst their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better\nunderstanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide\nguidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we\nobserve that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make\nthem detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged\nobjects, we present the first ranking based COD network (Rank-Net) to\nsimultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization\nmodel is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged\nobject obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the\ncamouflaged objects. And, the ranking model infers the detectability of\ndifferent camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set\nto evaluate the generalization ability of COD models.

Due to the battery limitations, the drones\nare best suited for last-mile delivery, i.e., the delivery from the package\ndistribution centers (PDCs) to the customers. Since a typical delivery system\nconsists of multiple PDCs, each having random and time-varying demands, the\ndynamic drone-to-PDC allocation would be of great importance in meeting the\ndemand in an efficient manner. In this paper, we study the dynamic UAV\nassignment problem for a drone delivery system with the goal of providing\nmeasurable Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.

However, we still have an incomplete theoretical and\nexperimental understanding of how these particles and their dynamics give rise\nto the quantum bound state of the proton and its physical properties, such as\nfor example its spin. The two up and the single down quarks that comprise the\nproton in the simplest picture account only for a few percent of the proton\nmass, the bulk of which is in the form of quark kinetic and potential energy\nand gluon energy from the strong force. An essential feature of this force, as\ndescribed by quantum chromodynamics, is its ability to create matter-antimatter\nquark pairs inside the proton that exist only for a very short time. Their\nfleeting existence makes the antimatter quarks within protons difficult to\nstudy, but their existence is discernible in reactions where a\nmatter-antimatter quark pair annihilates. In this picture of quark-antiquark\ncreation by the strong force, the probability distributions as a function of\nmomentum for the presence of up and down antimatter quarks should be nearly\nidentical, since their masses are quite similar and small compared to the mass\nof the proton. In the present manuscript, we show evidence from muon pair\nproduction measurements that these distributions are significantly different,\nwith more abundant down antimatter quarks than up antimatter quarks over a wide\nrange of momentum. These results revive interest in several proposed mechanisms\nas the origin of this antimatter asymmetry in the proton that had been\ndisfavored by the previous results and point to the future measurements that\ncan distinguish between these mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 04:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

The large images are usually decomposed into small sub-images in\npractical usages. Based on this processing, we found that different image\nregions have different restoration difficulties and can be processed by\nnetworks with different capacities. Intuitively, smooth areas are easier to\nsuper-solve than complex textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt\nappropriate SR networks to process different sub-images after the\ndecomposition. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- ClassSR\nthat combines classification and SR in a unified framework. In particular, it\nfirst uses a Class-Module to classify the sub-images into different classes\naccording to restoration difficulties, then applies an SR-Module to perform SR\nfor different classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classification\nnetwork, while the SR-Module is a network container that consists of the\nto-be-accelerated SR network and its simplified versions. We further introduce\na new classification method with two losses -- Class-Loss and Average-Loss to\nproduce the classification results. After joint training, a majority of\nsub-images will pass through smaller networks, thus the computational cost can\nbe significantly reduced.

In this paper, we propose a new\ntraining module called Non-Volatile Unbiased Memory (NVUM), which\nnon-volatility stores running average of model logits for a new regularization\nloss on noisy multi-label problem. We further unbias the classification\nprediction in NVUM update for imbalanced learning problem.

The successful application of PCS to Y in\nDAC environments demonstrates its utility for future research on other\npressure-induced high-$T_c$ superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 08:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 08:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 01:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

We investigate the rheological\nbehavior of sheared sediment beds composed of polydisperse spherical particles\nin a laminar Couette-type shear flow. The sediment beds consist of particles\nwith a diameter size ratio of up to ten, which corresponds to grains ranging\nfrom fine to coarse sand.

The research questions are centred on the problems that motivate\nthe use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering\naspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges. The search\nresulted in 6709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection.\nAnalysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for\nupdating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and\nmanaging resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems\nare primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with\nclassification, regression and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods.\nSurprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only\napplied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include\nthe performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with\nmore complex types of goals.

Despite this, such systems\npossess zero net magnetization unless additional symmetries are broken, since\nthe contributions from both valleys cancel. A nonzero net magnetization can be\ninduced through applying both uniaxial strain to break the rotational symmetry\nof the lattice and an in-plane electric field to break time-reversal symmetry\nowing to the resulting current. This creates a magnetoelectric effect whose\nstrength is characterized by a magnetoelectric susceptibility, which describes\nthe induced magnetization per unit applied in-plane electric field.

Remarkably, this inverse MCE is apparent not only with MFIMT, but\nalso in the magnetic-field-induced austenite phase. Specific heat measurements\nunder steady high magnetic fields revealed that the magnetic field variation of\nthe electronic entropy plays a dominant role in the unconventional\nmagnetocaloric properties of these materials. First-principles based\ncalculations performed for Ni41Co9Mn31.5Ga18.5 and Ni45Co5Mn36.7In13.3 revealed\nthat the magnetic-field-induced austenite phase of Ni41Co9Mn31.5Ga18.5 is more\nunstable than that of Ni45Co5Mn36.7In13.3 and that it is sensitive to slight\ntetragonal distortion.

This supports the\npossibility of exploiting the entanglement structure as a guide to design the\nmachine learning algorithm suitable for given tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 02:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

In the current review, we focus on recent progress in an important\npart of nonlinear heat transfer, i.e., tailoring nonlinear thermal devices and\nmetamaterials under the Fourier's law, especially with temperature-dependent\nthermal conductivities. We will present the basic designing techniques\nincluding solving the equation directly and the transformation theory. Tuning\nnonlinearity coming from multi-physical effects, and how to calculate effective\nproperties of nonlinear conductive composites using the effective medium theory\nare also included. Based on these theories, researchers have successfully\ndesigned various functional materials and devices such as the thermal diodes,\nthermal transistors, thermal memory elements, energy-free thermostats, and\nintelligent thermal materials, and some of them have also been realized in\nexperiments. Further, these phenomenological works can provide a feasible route\nfor the development of nonlinear thermotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 04:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Several\ncriticisms have emerged concerning probabilistic measurement of life-permitting\nintervals. Herein, a Bayesian statistical approach is used to assign an upper\nbound for the probability of tuning, which is invariant with respect to change\nof physical units, and under certain assumptions it is small whenever the\nlife-permitting interval is small on a relative scale. The computation of the\nupper bound of the tuning probability is achieved by first assuming that the\nprior is chosen by the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). The unknown\nparameters of this MaxEnt distribution are then handled in such a way that the\nweak anthropic principle is not violated. The MaxEnt assumption is \"maximally\nnoncommittal with regard to missing information.\" This approach is sufficiently\ngeneral to be applied to constants of current cosmological models, or to other\nconstants possibly under different models. Application of the MaxEnt model\nreveals, for example, that the ratio of the universal gravitational constant to\nthe square of the Hubble constant is finely tuned in some cases, whereas the\namplitude of primordial fluctuations is not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 20:29:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 20:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}
