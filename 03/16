Surprisingly, past research has\ndiscovered that some extraneous visual detail remains in the logit vector. This\nfinding is based on inversion techniques that map deep embeddings back to\nimages. We explore this phenomenon further using a novel synthesis of methods,\nyielding a feedforward inversion model that produces remarkably high fidelity\nreconstructions, qualitatively superior to those of past efforts. When applied\nto an adversarially robust classifier model, the reconstructions contain\nsufficient local detail and global structure that they might be confused with\nthe original image in a quick glance, and the object category can clearly be\ngleaned from the reconstruction. Our approach is based on BigGAN (Brock, 2019),\nwith conditioning on logits instead of one-hot class labels. We use our\nreconstruction model as a tool for exploring the nature of representations,\nincluding: the influence of model architecture and training objectives\n(specifically robust losses), the forms of invariance that networks achieve,\nrepresentational differences between correctly and incorrectly classified\nimages, and the effects of manipulating logits and images.

To that end, public health authorities\nintervened aggressively to institute social distancing, lock-down policies, and\nother Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Given the high social,\neducational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them,\nalternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect,\na relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer in\nparts of the United States, daily infection numbers dropped to a plateau. This\npaper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from a\nsimple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemics\nmodel. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes a\nQuasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated by\nadaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it is\nglobally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for social\ndistancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller.

To mitigate the effect of any\nredshift bias, we created control samples of appearing and disappearing BAL\nquasars that have similar redshift distribution. We find that the appearing BAL\nquasars are relatively brighter and have shallower and wider BAL troughs\ncompared to the disappearing BAL sample. The distribution of quasar continuum\nvariability parameters between the two samples is clearly separated, with the\nappearance of the BAL troughs being accompanied by the dimming of the continuum\nand vice versa. Spectral index variations in the two samples also point to the\nanti-correlation between the BAL trough and continuum variations consistent\nwith the \"bluer when brighter\" trend in quasars. We show that the intrinsic\ndust model is less likely to be a favorable scenario in explaining BAL\nappearance/disappearance. Our analysis suggests that the extreme variations of\nBAL troughs like BAL appearance/disappearance are mainly driven by changes in\nthe ionization conditions of the absorbing gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Designing a\ncomputer-aided tool for automatic motion detection and elimination can improve\nthe diagnosis, however, it needs a deep understanding of motion\ncharacteristics. Motion artifacts in MRI have a complex nature and it is\ndirectly related to the k-space sampling scheme. In this study we investigate\nthe effect of three conventional k-space samplers, including Cartesian, Uniform\nSpiral and Radial on motion induced image distortion. In this regard, various\nsynthetic motions with different trajectories of displacement and rotation are\napplied to T1 and T2-weighted MRI images, and a convolutional neural network is\ntrained to show the difficulty of motion classification. The results show that\nthe spiral k-space sampling method get less effect of motion artifact in image\nspace as compared to radial k-space sampled images, and radial k-space sampled\nimages are more robust than Cartesian ones. Cartesian samplers, on the other\nhand, are the best in terms of deep learning motion detection because they can\nbetter reflect motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

In studying the real-time\nbehavior following a quench from an unentangled spin-ancilla state, we find\nthat the ancilla entanglement entropy $S_{vN;\\mathcal{A}}$ tracks the dynamical\nphase transition in the underlying spin system. In this composite setting,\npurely spin-spin entanglement metrics such as mutual information and quantum\nFisher information (QFI) decay as the ancilla entanglement entropy grows. We\ndefine multipartite entanglement loss (MEL) as the difference between\ncollective magnetic fluctuations and QFI, which is zero in the pure spin chain\nlimit. MEL directly quantifies the ancilla's effect on the development of\nspin-spin entanglement. One of our central results is that $MEL(t) \\propto\ne^{S_{vN;\\mathcal{A}}(t)}$. Our results provide a platform for exploring\ncomposite system entanglement dynamics and suggest that MEL serves as a\nquantitative estimate of information entropy shared between collective spins\nand the ancilla qudit. Our results present a new framework that connects\nphysical spin-fluctuations, QFI, and bipartite entanglement entropy between\ncollective quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 15:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

However, in order to boost their\nadoption, the availability of numerical tools and physically-based models able\nto support the experimental activities and to provide them with useful\nguidelines becomes essential. In this context, we propose a theoretical\napproach that combines numerical simulations and small-signal modeling to\nanalyze 2DM-based FETs for radio-frequency applications. This multi-scale\nscheme takes into account non-idealities, such as interface traps, carrier\nvelocity saturation, or short channel effects, by means of self-consistent\nphysics-based numerical calculations that later feed the circuit level via a\nsmall-signal model based on the dynamic intrinsic capacitances of the device.\nAt the circuit stage, the possibilities range from the evaluation of the\nperformance of a single device to the design of complex circuits combining\nmultiple transistors. In this work, we validate our scheme against experimental\nresults and exemplify its use and capability assessing the impact of the\nchannel scaling on the performance of MoS2-based FETs targeting RF\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 12:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

A popular approach to address\nnonsmooth terms in convex optimization is to approximate them with their\nrespective Moreau envelopes. In this work, we study the use of Lasry-Lions\ndouble envelopes to approximate nonsmooth terms that are also not convex. These\nenvelopes are an extension of the Moreau ones but exhibit an additional\nsmoothness property that makes them amenable to fast optimization algorithms.\nLasry-Lions envelopes can also be seen as an \"intermediate\" between a given\nfunction and its convex envelope, and we make use of this property to develop a\nmethod that builds a sequence of approximate subproblems that are easier to\nsolve than the original problem. We discuss convergence properties of this\nmethod when used to address composite minimization problems; additionally,\nbased on a number of experiments, we discuss settings where it may be more\nuseful than classical alternatives in two domains: signal decoding and spectral\nunmixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:55:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 09:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Our main\ncontributions can be summarised as follows.\n  1. We build on techniques developed to prove hierarchy theorems for\nprobabilistic time with advice (Fortnow and Santhanam, FOCS 2004) to construct\nthe first unconditional pseudorandom generator of polynomial stretch computable\nin pseudodeterministic polynomial time (with one bit of advice) that is secure\ninfinitely often against polynomial-time computations. As an application of\nthis construction, we obtain new results about the complexity of generating and\nrepresenting prime numbers.\n  2. Oliveira and Santhanam (STOC 2017) established unconditionally that there\nis a pseudodeterministic algorithm for the Circuit Acceptance Probability\nProblem ($\\mathsf{CAPP}$) that runs in sub-exponential time and is correct with\nhigh probability over any samplable distribution on circuits on infinitely many\ninput lengths. We show that improving this running time or obtaining a result\nthat holds for every large input length would imply new time hierarchy theorems\nfor probabilistic time. In addition, we prove that a worst-case polynomial-time\npseudodeterministic algorithm for $\\mathsf{CAPP}$ would imply that\n$\\mathsf{BPP}$ has complete problems.\n  3. We establish an equivalence between pseudodeterministic construction of\nstrings of large $\\mathsf{rKt}$ complexity (Oliveira, ICALP 2019) and the\nexistence of strong hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time.\n  More generally, these results suggest new approaches for designing\npseudodeterministic algorithms for search problems and for unveiling the\nstructure of probabilistic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

To quantify the help that a non-signaling resource\nprovides to a noiseless classical channel, one might ask how many extra letters\nshould be added to the alphabet of the channel in order to perform equally well\nwithout the specified non-signaling resource. As was observed by Cubitt, Leung,\nMatthews, and Winter, there is no upper bound on the number of extra letters\nrequired for substituting the assistance of a general non-signaling resource to\na noiseless one-bit classical channel.

Due to the privacy of channel\nbalances, senders cannot reliably choose sufficiently liquid payment paths and\nresort to a trial-and-error approach, trying multiple paths until one succeeds.\nThis leaks private information and decreases payment reliability, which harms\nthe user experience. This work focuses on the reliability and privacy of LN\npayments. We create a probabilistic model of the payment process in the LN,\naccounting for the uncertainty of the channel balances. This enables us to\nexpress payment success probabilities for a given payment amount and a path.\nApplying negative Bernoulli trials for single- and multi-part payments allows\nus to compute the expected number of payment attempts for a given amount,\nsender, and receiver. As a consequence, we analytically derive the optimal\nnumber of parts into which one should split a payment to minimize the expected\nnumber of attempts. This methodology allows us to define service level\nobjectives and quantify how much private information leaks to the sender as a\nside effect of payment attempts. We propose an optimized path selection\nalgorithm that does not require a protocol upgrade. Namely, we suggest that\nnodes prioritize paths that are most likely to succeed while making payment\nattempts. A simulation based on the real-world LN topology shows that this\nmethod reduces the average number of payment attempts by 20% compared to a\nbaseline algorithm similar to the ones used in practice. This improvement will\nincrease to 48% if the LN protocol is upgraded to implement the channel\nrebalancing proposal described in BOLT14.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

These locally accelerated CRs offer an\nattractive explanation for the high levels of non-thermal emission and\nionisation rate, $\\zeta$, observed close to these sources. The high $\\zeta$\nobserved in some protostellar sources is generally attributed to\nshock-generated UV photons. The aim of this article is to show that when\nsynchrotron emission and a high $\\zeta$ are measured in the same spatial\nregion, a locally shock-accelerated CR flux is sufficient to explain both\nphenomena. We assume that relativistic particles are accelerated according to\nthe first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism and compute $\\zeta$ and the\nnon-thermal emission at cm wavelengths. We then apply our model to the\nstar-forming region OMC-2 FIR 3/FIR 4. Using a Bayesian analysis, we constrain\nthe parameters of the model and estimate the spectral indices of the\nnon-thermal radio emission.

We demonstrate that the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon manifests itself\nin both samples, suggesting that the uniformity of planetary properties within\na system is not restricted to direct neighbors and likely already exists at\nbirth. The radius uniformity is significantly elevated in overdensities,\nsuggesting that it can be enhanced by evolutionary effects that either have a\nsimilar impact on the entire planetary system or favour the retention of\nsimilar planets. The mass uniformity may exhibit a similar, but weaker\ndependence. Finally, we find ordering in both samples, with the planet radius\nand mass increasing outwards. Despite its prevalence, the ordering is somewhat\nweaker in overdensities, suggesting that it may be disrupted by external\nperturbations arising from stellar clustering.

Quantum computers are often designed as arrays of static\nqubits executing gates and measurements. Photonic qubits require a different\napproach. In photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), the main hardware\ncomponents are resource-state generators (RSGs) and fusion devices connected\nvia waveguides and switches. RSGs produce small entangled states of a few\nphotonic qubits, whereas fusion devices perform entangling measurements between\ndifferent resource states, thereby executing computations. In addition,\nlow-loss photonic delays such as optical fiber can be used as fixed-time\nquantum memories simultaneously storing thousands of photonic qubits. Here, we\npresent a modular architecture for FBQC in which these components are combined\nto form \"interleaving modules\" consisting of one RSG with its associated fusion\ndevices and a few fiber delays. Exploiting the multiplicative power of delays,\neach module can add thousands of physical qubits to the computational Hilbert\nspace. Networks of modules are universal fault-tolerant quantum computers,\nwhich we demonstrate using surface codes and lattice surgery as a guiding\nexample. Our numerical analysis shows that in a network of modules containing\n1-km-long fiber delays, each RSG can generate four logical distance-35\nsurface-code qubits while tolerating photon loss rates above 2% in addition to\nthe fiber-delay loss. We illustrate how the combination of interleaving with\nfurther uses of non-local fiber connections can reduce the cost of logical\noperations and facilitate the implementation of unconventional geometries such\nas periodic boundaries or stellated surface codes.

In\nthis paper, we develop a complete formalism for weak and strong diffractive\nlensing, which can be used to probe such subhalos with chirping gravitational\nwaves (GWs). Also, we show that Navarro-Frenk-White(NFW) subhalos in this mass\nrange can indeed be detected individually, albeit at a rate of ${\\cal O}(10)$\nor less per year at BBO and others limited by small merger rates and large\nrequired SNR $\\gtrsim 1/\\gamma(r_0) \\sim 10^3$. It becomes possible as NFW\nscale radii $r_0$ are of the right size comparable to the GW Fresnel length\n$r_F$, and unlike all existing probes, their lensing is more sensitive to\nlighter subhalos. Remarkably, our formalism further reveals that the frequency\ndependence of weak lensing (which is actually the detectable effect) is due to\nshear $\\gamma$ at $r_F$. Not only is it consistent with an approximate scaling\ninvariance, but it also offers a new way to measure the mass profile at a\nsuccessively smaller scale of chirping $r_F \\propto f^{-1/2}$.

Plasmonic structures can confine electromagnetic energy\nat the nanoscale, resulting in local, inhomogeneous, controllable heating. But\nreading out the temperature with nanoscale precision using optical techniques\nposes a difficult challenge. Here we report on the optical thermometry of\nindividual gold nanorod trimers that exhibit multiple wavelength-dependent\nplasmon modes resulting in measurably different local temperature\ndistributions. Specifically, we demonstrate how photothermal microscopy encodes\ndifferent wavelength-dependent temperature profiles in the asymmetry of the\nphotothermal image point spread function. These point spread function\nasymmetries are interpreted through companion numerical simulations of the\nphotothermal images to reveal how differing thermal gradients within the\nnanorod trimer can be controlled by exciting its hybridized plasmonic modes. We\nalso find that hybrid plasmon modes that are optically dark can be excited by\nour focused laser beam illumination geometry at certain beam positions, thereby\nproviding an additional route to modify thermal profiles at the nanoscale\nbeyond wide-field illumination.

Since the only\nobservables are the future values of correlators and not their time evolution,\nthis brings about a large degeneracy: a vast number of different models are\nmapped to the same minute number of observables. Furthermore, due to the lack\nof time-translation invariance, even tree-level calculations require an\nincreasing number of nested integrals that quickly become intractable. Here we\nask how much of the final observables can be \"bootstrapped\" directly from\nlocality, unitarity and symmetries.\n  To this end, we introduce two new bootstrap tools to efficiently compute\ncosmological correlators/wavefunctions. The first is a Manifestly Local Test\n(MLT) that any $n$-point (wave)function of massless scalars or gravitons must\nsatisfy if it is to arise from a manifestly local theory. When combined with a\nsub-set of the recently proposed Bootstrap Rules, this allows us to compute\nexplicitly all bispectra to all orders in derivatives for a single scalar.\nSince we don't invoke soft theorems, this can also be extended to multi-field\ninflation. The second is a partial energy recursion relation that allows us to\ncompute exchange correlators. Combining a bespoke complex shift of the partial\nenergies with Cauchy's integral theorem and the Cosmological Optical Theorem,\nwe fix exchange correlators up to a boundary term. The latter can be determined\nup to contact interactions using unitarity and manifest locality. As an\nillustration, we use these tools to bootstrap scalar inflationary trispectra\ndue to graviton exchange and inflaton self-interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 18:55:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, the reliability and robustness of HDC\nmodels have not been explored yet. In this paper, we design, implement, and\nevaluate HDTest to test HDC model by automatically exposing unexpected or\nincorrect behaviors under rare inputs. The core idea of HDTest is based on\nguided differential fuzz testing. Guided by the distance between query\nhypervector and reference hypervector in HDC, HDTest continuously mutates\noriginal inputs to generate new inputs that can trigger incorrect behaviors of\nHDC model. Compared to traditional ML testing methods, HDTest does not need to\nmanually label the original input.

On average,\nHDTest can generate around 400 adversarial inputs within one minute running on\na commodity computer. Finally, by using the HDTest-generated inputs to retrain\nHDC models, we can strengthen the robustness of HDC models.

Thermal conductivities of sulfide\nand halide solid electrolytes are in the range 0.45-0.70 W m-1 K-1; thermal\nconductivities of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 are 1.4 W m-1\nK-1 and 2.2 W m-1 K-1, respectively. For most of the solid electrolytes studied\nin this work, the thermal conductivity increases with increasing temperature;\ni.e., the thermal conductivity has a glass-like temperature dependence. The\nmeasured room-temperature thermal conductivities agree well with the calculated\nminimum thermal conductivities indicating the phonon mean-free-paths in these\nsolid electrolytes are close to an atomic spacing. We attribute the low,\nglass-like thermal conductivity of the solid electrolytes investigated to the\ncombination of their complex crystal structures and the atomic-scale disorder\ninduced by the materials processing methods that are typically needed to\nproduce high ionic conductivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 21:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The\ninstability can already develop around the sonic point if it is initiated close\nto the photosphere due to stochastic turbulent motions. In such cases, it may\nleave its imprint on the light curve as a result of wind blanketing. We study\nthe photometric signatures of the line-driven wind instability. We used\nline-driven wind instability simulations to determine the wind variability\nclose to the star. We applied two types of boundary perturbations: a sinusoidal\none that enables us to study in detail the development of the instability and a\nstochastic one given by a Langevin process that provides a more realistic\nboundary perturbation. We estimated the photometric variability from the\nresulting mass-flux variations. The variability was simulated assuming that the\nwind consists of a large number of independent conical wind sectors.

We find two typical signatures of line-driven wind\ninstability in photometric data: a knee in the power spectrum of magnitude\nfluctuations, which appears due to engulfment of small-scale structure by\nlarger structures, and a negative skewness of the distribution of fluctuations,\nwhich is the result of spatial dominance of rarefied regions. These features\nendure even when combining the light curves from independent wind sectors. The\nstochastic photometric variability of OB stars bears certain signatures of the\nline-driven wind instability. The distribution function of observed photometric\ndata shows negative skewness and the power spectra of a fraction of light\ncurves exhibit a knee. This can be explained as a result of the line-driven\nwind instability triggered by stochastic base perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 23:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Many complex systems can be represented as multilayer networks whose\nresponse and control can be studied in the framework of network control theory.\nIt remains unknown how a system's layered architecture dictates its control\nproperties, particularly when control signals can only access the system\nthrough a single input layer. Here, we use the framework of linear control\ntheory to probe the control properties of a duplex network with directed\ninterlayer links. We determine the manner in which the structural properties of\nlayers and relative interlayer arrangement together dictate the system's\nresponse. For this purpose, we calculate the exact expression of optimal\ncontrol energy in terms of layer spectra and the relative alignment between the\neigenmodes of the input layer and the deeper target layer. For a range of\nnumerically constructed duplex networks, we then calculate the control\nproperties of the two layers as a function of target-layer densities and layer\ntopology. The alignment of layer eigenmodes emerges as an important parameter\nthat sets the cost and routing of the optimal energy for control. We understand\nthese results in a simplified limit of a single-mode approximation, and we\nbuild metrics to characterize the routing of optimal control energy through the\neigenmodes of each layer. Our analytical and numerical results together provide\ninsights into the relationships between structure and control in duplex\nnetworks. More generally, they serve as a platform for future work designing\noptimal \\emph{interlayer} control strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 23:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

For the better part of $40$ years these clusters have been known to\npossess unique chemical signatures called abundance anomalies. Recent\nobservations have found these abundance anomalies to be the result of distinct\nstellar populations with the youngest population undergoing an unknown\nenrichment process. Understanding these chemical signatures requires a precise\nunderstanding of the thermonuclear reaction rates at relatively low\ntemperatures. At these low temperatures reaction rates suffer from large\nuncertainties arising from poorly understood resonances in several key\nreactions. Transfer reactions provide key constrains on nuclear inputs for\nthese resonances. This thesis presents an updated understanding of the sodium\nand potassium destroying reactions $^{23}$Na$(p, \\gamma)$ and $^{39}$K$(p,\n\\gamma)$, respectively. A reevaluated rate for $^{39}$K$(p, \\gamma)$ indicates\nthat it is less precisely known than previously thought, and future\nexperimental study is needed to reduce its impact on globular cluster\nnucleosynthesis. Novel Bayesian techniques assess the uncertainties arising\nfrom transfer measurements. These techniques are applied to the transfer\nreaction $^{23}$Na$(^3\\text{He}, d)$, which was carried out at Triangle\nUniversities Nuclear Laboratory. Results of this experiment indicate that the\nenergy of an important resonance in $^{23}$Na$(p, \\gamma)$ is much lower than\npreviously thought at $E_r =132(3)$ keV. The transfer measurement also\nindicates tension between previous direct studies of the resonance strength and\nthe current transfer measurement. The impact of these uncertainties on the\n$^{23}$Na$(p, \\gamma)$ reaction rate is investigated, and it is shown that this\nrate requires more intensive study to provide the precision needed to constrain\nnucleosynthesis in globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 03:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance of node\nclassification. However, existing GNNs address the problem where node samples\nfor different classes are balanced; while for many real-world scenarios, some\nclasses may have much fewer instances than others. Directly training a GNN\nclassifier in this case would under-represent samples from those minority\nclasses and result in sub-optimal performance. Therefore, it is very important\nto develop GNNs for imbalanced node classification. However, the work on this\nis rather limited. Hence, we seek to extend previous imbalanced learning\ntechniques for i.i.d data to the imbalanced node classification task to\nfacilitate GNN classifiers. In particular, we choose to adopt synthetic\nminority over-sampling algorithms, as they are found to be the most effective\nand stable. This task is non-trivial, as previous synthetic minority\nover-sampling algorithms fail to provide relation information for newly\nsynthesized samples, which is vital for learning on graphs. Moreover, node\nattributes are high-dimensional. Directly over-sampling in the original input\ndomain could generates out-of-domain samples, which may impair the accuracy of\nthe classifier. We propose a novel framework, GraphSMOTE, in which an embedding\nspace is constructed to encode the similarity among the nodes. New samples are\nsynthesize in this space to assure genuineness. In addition, an edge generator\nis trained simultaneously to model the relation information, and provide it for\nthose new samples.

Graph is a natural structure for\nrepresenting relationship and interactions, and its translation can encode the\nintrinsic semantic changes of relationships in different scenarios.

For example, we can easily build graphs representing peoples' shared\nmusic tastes and those representing co-purchase behavior, but a well paired\ndataset is much more expensive to obtain. Therefore, in this work, we seek to\nprovide a graph translation model in the semi-supervised scenario. This task is\nnon-trivial, because graph translation involves changing the semantics in the\nform of link topology and node attributes, which is difficult to capture due to\nthe combinatory nature and inter-dependencies.

Since patch attacks change\nthe pixels in a restricted area on objects, they are easy to implement in the\nphysical world, especially for attacking human detection systems. The existing\ndefenses against patch attacks are mostly applied for image classification\nproblems and have difficulty resisting human detection attacks. Towards this\ncritical issue, we propose an efficient and effective plug-in defense component\non the YOLO detection system, which we name Ad-YOLO. The main idea is to add a\npatch class on the YOLO architecture, which has a negligible inference\nincrement. Thus, Ad-YOLO is expected to directly detect both the objects of\ninterest and adversarial patches. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is\nthe first defense strategy against human detection attacks.\n  We investigate Ad-YOLO's performance on the YOLOv2 baseline. To improve the\nability of Ad-YOLO to detect variety patches, we first use an adversarial\ntraining process to develop a patch dataset based on the Inria dataset, which\nwe name Inria-Patch. Then, we train Ad-YOLO by a combination of Pascal VOC,\nInria, and Inria-Patch datasets. With a slight drop of $0.70\\%$ mAP on VOC 2007\ntest set, Ad-YOLO achieves $80.31\\%$ AP of persons, which highly outperforms\n$33.93\\%$ AP for YOLOv2 when facing white-box patch attacks.

Due to\ndifferent lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between\ntraining and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios.\nNeglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR)\nperformance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain\nefficiently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem,\nwe develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network, named\nDAP-FSR network. Our DAP-FSR is the first attempt to super-resolve LR faces\nfrom a target domain by exploiting only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR\nexemplar in the target domain. To be specific, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its\nencoder to extract the multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face.\nConsidering only one target domain example is available, we propose to augment\nthe target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target\ndomain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representations to\nthe decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images\nresembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are\nused to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating\nthe latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the\ntarget domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces.\nExtensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness and superior performance of our DAP-FSR compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 05:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 11:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

To answer these\nquestions, we need an accelerated observer having a vortex structure in the\ntransverse dimensions and carrying well-defined OAM. Here we consider the\nangular momentum characteristics of Unruh effect in the theory of scalar field\nand electromagnetic field for the first time. We find that the rotation and\nvortex structure of a uniformly accelerated observer lead to the definite\nangular momentum correlation between Rindler particles and their counterparts\nin Minkowski vacuum.

The IoT operator identifies\nthe white-space in the licensed band at regular intervals and opportunistically\nexploits them to serve the IoT nodes under its coverage. IoT nodes are\nbattery-operated devices that require periodical energy replenishment. We\nemploy the Microwave Power Transfer (MPT) technique for its superior energy\ntransfer efficiency over long-distance. The white-space detection process is\nnot always perfect and the IoT operator may jeopardize the PNP's transmissions\ndue to misdetection. To reduce the possibility of such interferences, some of\nthe spectrum holes must remain unutilized, even when the IoT nodes have data to\ntransmit. The IoT operator needs to decide what percentage of the white-space\nto keep unutilized and how to judiciously use the rest for data transmission\nand energy-replenishment to maintain an optimal balance between the average\ninterference inflicted on PNP's users and the Quality-of-Service (QoS)\nexperienced by IoT nodes. Due to the periodic nature of the spectrum-sensing\nprocess, Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) method can realistically model this\nframework. In literature, activities of the PNP and IoT operator are assumed to\nbe mutually exclusive, for ease of analysis. Our model incorporates possible\noverlaps between these activities, making the analysis more realistic. Using\nour model, the sustainability region of the CR-IoT network can be obtained. The\naccuracy of our analysis is demonstrated via extensive simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 06:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

An ion trap with a lower heating rate and improved cooling\nlasers were also introduced. This allows cooling the ion temperature to the\nDoppler cooling limit during the clock operation, and the systematic\nuncertainty due to the ion's secular (thermal) motion is reduced to < 1*10^-18.\nThe uncertainty due to the probe laser light shift and the servo error are also\nreduced to < 1*10^-19 and 4*10^-19 with the hyper-Ramsey method and the\nhigher-order servo algorithm, respectively.

The complex photophysics of\nSWCNTs and overall goal of polariton condensation pose the question of how\nexciton-polaritons are populated and how it might be optimized.

Consequently, the limitation of\npolariton population due to the low photoluminescence quantum yield of\nnanotubes, can be overcome by luminescent sp$^{3}$ defects. Without changing\nthe polariton branch structure, radiative pumping through these emissive\ndefects leads to an up to 10-fold increase of the polariton population for\ndetunings with a large photon fraction.

In the present\nwork, we supplement the model with an important ingredient, namely the\ncharge-bond interaction, also known as correlated or assisted hopping.\nCorrelated hopping enters the second-quantised Hamiltonian, written in the\nWannier representation, as an off-diagonal many-body term. Using the equation\nof motion technique, we study the effect of the correlated hopping on the\nspectral and transport characteristics of a two-terminal quantum dot. Two\ndifferent Green functions (GFs) appear: one of them describes the spectral\nproperties of the quantum dot, the other the transport properties of the\nsystem. The calculation of the transport GF requires the knowledge of the\nspectral one. We use decoupling procedures similar to those which properly\ndescribe the standard Anderson model within the Kondo regime and outside of it.\nFor an arbitrary ratio $x$ between the amplitudes of correlated and\nsingle-particle hopping terms, the transport GF fulfils the $x \\leftrightarrow\n2-x$ symmetry of the model. The average occupation of the dot also obeys this\nsymmetry, albeit the spectral function of the quantum dot, calculated within an\nanalogous decoupling scheme as for the transport GF, does not. We identify the\nphysical reason for this behavior, and propose a way to cure it. Since the\ncorrelated-hopping term breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the model and\nmodifies all transport characteristics of the system, the detailed knowledge of\nits influence on measurable characteristics is a prerequisite for its\nexperimental detection.

When applications\nshare critical resources, however, contention on shared resources may lead to\nreduced application performance.\n  In this paper, we show that server efficiency can be improved by first\nmodeling the expected performance degradation of colocated applications based\non measured hardware performance counters, and then exploiting the model to\ndetermine an optimized mix of colocated applications. This paper presents a new\nintelligent resource manager and makes the following contributions: (1) a new\nmachine learning model to predict the performance degradation of colocated\napplications based on hardware counters and (2) an intelligent scheduling\nscheme deployed on an existing resource manager to enable application\nco-scheduling with minimum performance degradation.

Memory is increasingly often the\nbottleneck when training 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Recently,\ninvertible neural networks have been applied to significantly reduce activation\nmemory footprint when training neural networks with backpropagation thanks to\nthe invertible functions that allow retrieving its input from its output\nwithout storing intermediate activations in memory to perform the\nbackpropagation.\n  Among many successful network architectures, 3D Unet has been established as\na standard architecture for volumetric medical segmentation. Thus, we choose 3D\nUnet as a baseline for a non-invertible network and we then extend it with the\ninvertible residual network. In this paper, we proposed two versions of the\ninvertible Residual Network, namely Partially Invertible Residual Network\n(Partially-InvRes) and Fully Invertible Residual Network (Fully-InvRes). In\nPartially-InvRes, the invertible residual layer is defined by a technique\ncalled additive coupling whereas in Fully-InvRes, both invertible upsampling\nand downsampling operations are learned based on squeezing (known as pixel\nshuffle). Furthermore, to avoid the overfitting problem because of less\ntraining data, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) branch is added to reconstruct\nthe input volumetric data itself. Our results indicate that by using\npartially/fully invertible networks as the central workhorse in volumetric\nsegmentation, we not only reduce memory overhead but also achieve compatible\nsegmentation performance compared against the non-invertible 3D Unet.

The magnetic data from low-Earth orbit satellites of\ndedicated magnetic survey missions such as CHAMP and Swarm play a key role in\nthe construction of such models. Unfortunately, there are no magnetic data from\nsuch satellites after the end of CHAMP in 2010 and before the launch of Swarm\nin late 2013. This limits our ability to recover signals on timescales of 3\nyears and less during this gap period. The magnetic data from platform\nmagnetometers carried by satellites for navigational purposes may help address\nthis data gap provided that they are carefully calibrated. Earlier studies have\ndemonstrated that platform magnetometer data can be calibrated using a fixed\nreference field model. However, this approach can lead to biased calibration\nparameters. An alternative has been developed in the form of a co-estimation\nscheme which consists of simultaneously estimating both the calibration\nparameters and a model of the internal geomagnetic field. Here, we develop a\nscheme, based on the CHAOS framework, that involves the co-estimation of a\ngeomagnetic field model along with calibration parameters of platform\nmagnetometers. Using our implementation, we are able to derive a geomagnetic\nfield model from 2008 to 2018 with satellite magnetic data from CHAMP, Swarm,\nsecular variation data from ground observatories, and platform magnetometer\ndata from CryoSat-2 and GRACE. Through experiments, we explore correlations\nbetween the estimates of the geomagnetic field and the calibration parameters,\nand suggest how these may be avoided.

Though recent\nworks have reached sound achievements, there are still unignorable problems: a)\nlearned features supervised by softmax loss are separable but not\ndiscriminative enough, since softmax loss does not explicitly encourage\nintra-class compactness and interclass separability; and b) fixed filter banks\nand hand-crafted features are insufficient to capture forgery patterns of\nfrequency from diverse inputs. To compensate for such limitations, a novel\nfrequency-aware discriminative feature learning framework is proposed in this\npaper. Specifically, we design a novel single-center loss (SCL) that only\ncompresses intra-class variations of natural faces while boosting inter-class\ndifferences in the embedding space. In such a case, the network can learn more\ndiscriminative features with less optimization difficulty.

Although deep learning based\nmethods achieve impressive results in A/V classification, their performances\nusually degrade severely when being directly applied to another database, due\nto the domain shift, e.g., caused by the variations in imaging protocols. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel vessel-mixing based consistency regularization\nframework, for cross-domain learning in retinal A/V classification. Specially,\nto alleviate the severe bias to source domain, based on the label smooth prior,\nthe model is regularized to give consistent predictions for unlabeled\ntarget-domain inputs that are under perturbation. This consistency\nregularization implicitly introduces a mechanism where the model and the\nperturbation is opponent to each other, where the model is pushed to be robust\nenough to cope with the perturbation. Thus, we investigate a more difficult\nopponent to further inspire the robustness of model, in the scenario of retinal\nA/V, called vessel-mixing perturbation. Specially, it effectively disturbs the\nfundus images especially the vessel structures by mixing two images regionally.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on cross-domain A/V classification using four\npublic datasets, which are collected by diverse institutions and imaging\ndevices. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\ncross-domain performance, which is also close to the upper bound obtained by\nfully supervised learning on target domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 14:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 12:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

To this end, a parallel explicit solver\nexploiting the advantages of balanced octree meshes is introduced. To avoid the\nhanging nodes problem encountered in standard finite element analysis (FEA),\nthe scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is deployed as a spatial\ndiscretization scheme. Consequently, arbitrarily shaped star-convex polyhedral\nelements are straightforwardly generated. Considering the scaling and\ntransformation of octree cells, the stiffness and mass matrices of a limited\nnumber of unique cell patterns are pre-computed.

A time-frequency analysis of the transitional\nvelocity signals has been performed which shows that as the Reynolds number\ndecreases, the character of the time traces evolves continuously from a\n\"spotty\" behaviour (exhibiting distinct turbulent spots) for the attached case\nto a \"non-spotty\" behaviour (involving more \"uniform\" distribution of turbulent\nfluctuations in time) for the large separation case, encompassing the entire\nspectrum of transition scenarios.

Here we conduct an in-depth analysis of the\nfragmentation properties of a sample of 10 IRDCs, which have been highlighted\nas some of the best candidates to study HMSF within the Milky Way. To do so, we\nhave obtained a set of large mosaics covering these IRDCs with ALMA at band 3\n(or 3mm). These observations have a high angular resolution (~3arcsec or\n~0.05pc), and high continuum and spectral line sensitivity (~0.15mJy/beam and\n~0.2K per 0.1km/s channel at the N2H+(1-0) transition). From the dust continuum\nemission, we identify 96 cores ranging from low- to high-mass (M = 3.4 to\n50.9Msun) that are gravitationally bound (alpha_vir = 0.3 to 1.3) and which\nwould require magnetic field strengths of B = 0.3 to 1.0mG to be in virial\nequilibrium. We combine these results with a homogenised catalogue of\nliterature cores to recover the hierarchical structure within these clouds over\nfour orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.01pc to 10pc). Using supplementary\nobservations at an even higher angular resolution, we find that the smallest\nfragments (<0.02pc) within this hierarchy do not currently have the mass and/or\nthe density required to form high-mass stars. Nonetheless, the new ALMA\nobservations presented in this paper have facilitated the identification of 19\n(6 quiescent and 13 star-forming) cores that retain >16Msun without further\nfragmentation. These high-mass cores contain trans-sonic non-thermal motions,\nare kinematically sub-virial, and require moderate magnetic field strengths for\nsupport against collapse. The identification of these potential sites of\nhigh-mass star formation represents a key step in allowing us to test the\npredictions from high-mass star and cluster formation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 15:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The spread of values is narrower than that found in\nany previous single-dish survey of high-mass star-forming regions, and than\nthat obtained using the total power data only.

In\nquantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has\nbecome ubiquitous, using the functional form of the ansatz as a degree of\nfreedom, whose parameters are found variationally in a feedback loop between\nthe quantum processor and its conventional counterpart. Alternatively, a\npromising new avenue has been unraveled by the quantum variants of techniques\ngrounded on expansions of the moments of the Hamiltonian, among which two stand\nout: the connected moments expansion (CMX) [Phys.

As an example we will show that constructing sphere models\nassociated to specific fluxes related by an action of the Weyl group of\n$\\text{E}_8$ leads to the S-confinement duality of the $\\text{USp}(2Q)$ gauge\ntheory with six fundamentals and a traceless antisymmetric field. Finally, we\nshow that the theories we discuss possess an $\\text{SU}(2)_{\\text{ISO}}$\nsymmetry in four dimensions that can be naturally identified with the isometry\nof the two-sphere. We give evidence in favor of this identification by\ncomputing the `t Hooft anomalies of the $\\text{SU}(2)_{\\text{ISO}}$ in 4d and\ncomparing them with the predicted anomalies from 6d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 15:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 23:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

Guided by the maximum entropy principle, we\nformulate an inverse statistical mechanical method to infer the distribution of\nparticle numbers from the data of protein abundance as chemical potentials for\na grand canonical multi-component mixture. Using grand canonical Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we captured a distribution of high-order clusters in a protein\ncomplex of Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) with four known subunits. The\ncomplexity of hierarchical clusters varies with the relative protein abundance\nof each subunit in distinctive cell types such as lung, heart, and brain. When\nthe crowding content increases, we observed that crowding stabilizes emergent\nclusters that do not exist in dilute conditions.

To\ndemonstrate the usefulness of CNNs, we concentrate in this paper on the\ninversion of LTE Stokes profiles. We use observations taken with the\nspectropolarimeter onboard the Hinode spacecraft as a test benchmark. First, we\ncarefully analyze the data with the SIR inversion code using a given initial\natmospheric model. The code provides a set of atmospheric models that reproduce\nthe observations. These models are then used to train a CNN. Afterwards, the\nsame data are again inverted with SIR but using the trained CNN to provide the\ninitial guess atmospheric models for SIR. The CNNs allow us to significantly\nreduce the number of inversion cycles when used to compute initial guess model\natmospheres, decreasing the computational time for LTE inversions by a factor\nof two to four. CNN's alone are much faster than assisted inversions, but the\nlatter are more robust and accurate. The advantages and limitations of machine\nlearning techniques for estimating optimum initial atmospheric models for\nspectral line inversions are discussed. Finally, we describe a python wrapper\nfor the SIR and DeSIRe codes that allows for the easy setup of parallel\ninversions. The assisted inversions can speed up the inversion process, but the\nefficiency and accuracy of the inversion results depend strongly on the solar\nscene and the data used for the CNN training. This method (assisted inversions)\nwill not obviate the need for analyzing individual events with the utmost care\nbut will provide solar scientists with a much better opportunity to sample\nlarge amounts of inverted data, which will undoubtedly broaden the physical\ndiscovery space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 00:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Weakly supervised methods can\naccept image-wise annotations which can help reduce the cost for pixel-level\nlabelling. Inevitable performance gap, however, exists between weakly and fully\nsupervised methods in mapping accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a\npseudo supervised deep convolutional network with label correction strategy\n(PS-CNNLC) for solar panels mapping.

First, a\nconvolutional neural network is trained with positive and negative samples with\nimage-level labels.

This last challenge is addressed in this study. Here we look at a\nnovel method for ensuring AI fairness with respect to protected or sensitive\nfactors. This method uses domain adaptation via training set enhancement to\ntackle bias-causing training data imbalance. More specifically, it uses\ngenerative models that allow the generation of more synthetic training samples\nfor underrepresented populations. This paper applies this method to the use\ncase of detection of age related macular degeneration (AMD).

FEO states that everyone\nwith the same talent and willingness to use it should have the same chance of\nachieving advantageous social positions (e.g., employment), regardless of their\nbackground circumstances (e.g., socioeconomic status). Satisfying FEO requires\nalterations to social structures such as school assignments. Our paper\ndescribes RAWLSNET, a method which takes as input a BN representation of an FEO\napplication and alters the BN's parameters so as to satisfy FEO when possible,\nand minimize deviation from FEO otherwise. We also offer guidance for applying\nRAWLSNET, including on recognizing proper applications of FEO. We demonstrate\nthe use of our system with publicly available data sets. RAWLSNET's altered BNs\noffer the novel capability of generating aspirational data for FEO-relevant\ntasks. Aspirational data are free from the biases of real-world data, and thus\nare useful for recognizing and detecting sources of unfairness in machine\nlearning algorithms besides biased data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 03:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

Such an architecture comes with two\nmain limitations: (1) difficulty to achieve full resource utilization and (2)\ncoarse granularity for hardware maintenance. Recently, many works investigated\na resource-centric approach called disaggregated architecture where the\ndatacenter is composed of self-content resource boards interconnected using\nfast interconnection technologies, each resource board including instances of\none resource type. The resource-centric architecture allows each resource to be\nmanaged (maintenance, allocation) independently. LegoOS is the first work which\nstudied the implications of disaggregation on the operating system, proposing\nto disaggregate the operating system itself. They demonstrated the suitability\nof this approach, considering mainly CPU and RAM resources. However, they\ndidn't study the implication of disaggregation on network resources. We\nreproduced a LegoOS infrastructure and extended it to support disaggregated\nnetworking. We show that networking can be disaggregated following the same\nprinciples, and that classical networking optimizations such as DMA, DDIO or\nloopback can be reproduced in such an environment. Our evaluations show the\nviability of the approach and the potential of future disaggregated\ninfrastructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 23:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}
