We\nthen compute the difference between the energy loss of a fermion with the two\nopposite helicities, to assess whether this could be used to quantify the\nchiral imbalance in the plasma. We find that the leading contribution to these\nhelicity-dependent energy loss contributions comes from the exchange of hard\nphotons (or gluons for QCD) with the medium constituents, and in some scenarios\ncan become comparable to the leading-order result for a plasma without any\nchiral imbalance. We also evaluate the contribution arising from soft photon\nexchange, which is a subleading effect, and requires regularization.

In practice,\ntraveling-wave modulation is achieved by applying a staggered time-modulation\nsignal to a spatially-discrete array of unit cells. Therefore, the capability\nto accurately simulate spatially-discrete traveling-wave modulated structures\nis critical to design. However, simulating these structures is challenging due\nto the complex space-time dependence of the constituent unit cells. In this\npaper, a field relation (referred to as the interpath relation) is derived for\nspatially-discrete traveling-wave modulated structures. The interpath relation\nreveals that the field within a single time-modulated unit cell (rather than an\nentire spatial period) is sufficient to determine the field solution throughout\nspace. It will be shown that the interpath relation can be incorporated into\nexisting periodic method of moments solvers simply by modifying the source\nbasis functions. As a result, the computational domain is reduced from an\nentire spatial period to a single time-modulated unit cell, dramatically\nreducing the number of unknowns. In the context of traveling-wave modulation,\nthis enables researchers to efficiently simulate both complex structures with\npatterned unit cells in addition to continuous structures with infinitesimal\nunit cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 16:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Here we\nshow from detailed estimates of the full year data that the global reduction\nwas only 5.4% (-1,901 MtCO$_2$, ). This decrease is 5 times larger than the\nannual emission drop at the peak of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However,\nglobal CO$_2$ emissions gradually recovered towards 2019 levels from late April\nwith global partial re-opening. More importantly, global CO$_2$ emissions even\nincreased slightly by +0.9% in December 2020 compared with 2019, indicating the\ntrends of rebound of global emissions. Later waves of COVID-19 infections in\nlate 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused further CO$_2$ emissions\nreductions particularly in western countries, but to a much smaller extent than\nthe declines in the first wave. That even substantial world-wide lockdowns of\nactivity led to a one-time decline in global CO$_2$ emissions of only 5.4% in\none year highlights the significant challenges for climate change mitigation\nthat we face in the post-COVID era. These declines are significant, but will be\nquickly overtaken with new emissions unless the COVID-19 crisis is utilized as\na break-point with our fossil-fuel trajectory, notably through policies that\nmake the COVID-19 recovery an opportunity to green national energy and\ndevelopment plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 16:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The supervision signal is thus\nderived from whether or not the system can recover an exact match of this\nground-truth answer span from the retrieved passages. This method is referred\nto as span-match weak supervision. However, information-seeking conversations\nare challenging for this span-match method since long answers, especially\nfreeform answers, are not necessarily strict spans of any passage. Therefore,\nwe introduce a learned weak supervision approach that can identify a\nparaphrased span of the known answer in a passage. Our experiments on QuAC and\nCoQA datasets show that the span-match weak supervisor can only handle\nconversations with span answers, and has less satisfactory results for freeform\nanswers generated by people. Our method is more flexible as it can handle both\nspan answers and freeform answers.

This basis expansion represents a library of\nMAPS signatures for distinct constitutive models that are contained within the\ngeneralized nonlinear Maxwell model. We describe a framework for quantitative\nmodel identification using this basis expansion, and discuss its limitations in\ndistinguishing distinct nonlinear features of the underlying constitutive\nmodels from medium amplitude shear stress data. The leading order contributions\nto the normal stress differences are also considered, revealing that only the\nsecond normal stress difference provides distinct information about the weakly\nnonlinear response space of the model. After briefly considering the conditions\nfor time-strain separability within the generalized nonlinear Maxwell model, we\napply the basis expansion of the third order complex viscosity to derive the\nmedium amplitude signatures of the model in specific shear deformation\nprotocols. Finally, we use these signatures for estimation of model parameters\nfrom rheological data obtained by these different deformation protocols,\nrevealing that three-tone oscillatory shear deformations produce data that is\nreadily able to distinguish all features of the medium amplitude, simple shear\nresponse space of this generalized class of constitutive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 17:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

Four different films are compared:\nFAMAPbSnI3, FAPbI3, FAMAPbI3, and FAPbBr3. The low temperature results\nhighlight the changes that occur especially, underlying ones that are easily\nmasked at room temperature. The overall Stokes shift is of similar magnitude at\nroom temperature for the 3 Pb only based samples. This is governed by the\ninteraction strength GammaLO, phonon energy ELO, and the exciton binding energy\nEex. One exception to this behavior is the Sn-based FAMAPbSnI3 film which shows\na lack of Stokes shift between the absorption and photoluminescence.\nHowever,the strong absorption (more than 100 meV) below the band gap is\nindicative of an excitonic feature that has a large density of states.\nTransient absorption measurements confirm the trends observed in continuous\nwave (CW) measurements, the 3 Pb only films all show the convolution of an\nexcitonic feature within 20 meV of the band gap as a contributing factor to the\nphotobleach along with a region of high energy PIA. However, the behavior for\nthe Sn-based film is notably different (just as in the CW measurements) with an\nunusual low energy PIA and a lack of high energy PIA. The large low energy PIA\nis attributed to the large sub band gap absorption observed in the CW\ntransmission/absorption measurements. Notably regardless of interchanging\ncomponents, the slow cooling of carriers in metal-halide perovsites shows\nlittle effect of GammaLO, ELO, and Eex. As such, here it is proposed: while the\ninitial cooling of carriers is attributed to LO phonons, the overall cooling of\ncarriers is dominated by the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of all\nmetal-halide perovskites which limits the dissipation of acoustic phonons in\nthese systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 18:12:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 01:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

In this work, we demonstrate that the photoinduced lattice changes\nin the system are due to a specific polaronic distortion, associated with the\nactivation of a longitudinal optical phonon mode at 18 meV by electron-phonon\ncoupling, and we quantify the associated structural changes with atomic-level\nprecision.

To tackle the problem, we combine a road network\ngraph with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to construct a structural RNN\n(SRNN). The SRNN employs a spatio-temporal graph to infer the interaction\nbetween adjacent road segments as well as the temporal dynamics of the time\nseries data. The model is scalable thanks to two key aspects. First, the\nproposed SRNN architecture is built by using the semantic similarity of the\nspatio-temporal dynamic interactions of all segments.

The interactions between the SMC and LMC created the Magellanic\nBridge, a stream of gas and stars pulled out of the SMC towards the LMC about\n150 Myr ago. The tidal counterpart of this structure, which should include a\ntrailing arm, has been predicted by models but no compelling observational\nevidence has confirmed the Counter-Bridge so far. Aims. The main goal of this\nwork is to find the stellar counterpart of the Magellanic Bridge and\nCounter-Bridge. We use star clusters in the SMC outskirts as they provide 6D\nphase-space vector, age and metallicity that help characterise the outskirts of\nthe SMC. Methods. Distances, ages and photometric metallicities are derived\nfrom fitting isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams from the VISCACHA\nsurvey. Radial velocities and spectroscopic metallicities are derived from the\nspectroscopic follow-up using GMOS in the CaII triplet region. Results. Among\nthe seven clusters analysed in this work, five belong to the Magellanic Bridge\nand one belongs to the Counter-Bridge and the other to the transition region.\nConclusions. The existence of the tidal counterpart of the Magellanic Bridge is\nevidenced by star clusters. The stellar component of the Magellanic Bridge and\nCounter-Bridge are confirmed in the SMC outskirts. These results are an\nimportant constraint for models that seek to reconstruct the history of the\norbit and interactions between LMC-SMC and constrain their future interaction\nincluding with the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 18:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In reviewing various independent age estimates of Wd1\nin the literature, we firstly show that those based on stellar diversity are\nunreliable. Secondly, we re-analyse Wd1's pre-MS stars employing the Damineli\nextinction law, finding an age of $7.2^{+1.1}_{-2.3}$Myr; older than that of\nprevious studies, but which is vulnerable to systematic errors that could push\nthe age close to 10Myr. However, there remains significant tension between the\nCSG age and that inferred from the eclipsing binary W13.

To elucidate their nature, we exploited a rich compilation of\nphotometry and spectroscopic data to model their spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) from the UV to the FIR and characterise their emission-line properties.\nFollowing a systematic comparison approach, we infer the AGN accretion,\nobscuration, and host galaxy properties in a sample of ~1800 QSOs at 0.2<z<2.5,\nclassified into red and control QSOs and matched in redshift and luminosity. We\nfind no differences in the average SEDs of red and control QSOs, other than the\nreddening of the accretion disk expected by the selection. Moreover, no clear\nlink can be recognised between the QSO reddening and the interstellar medium or\nthe star formation properties of their host galaxies. We find that the torus\nproperties in red and control QSOs are strikingly similar, suggesting that the\nreddening is not related to the torus and orientation effects. Interestingly,\nwe detect a significant excess of infrared emission at rest-frame 2-5 um, which\nshows a direct correlation with optical reddening. To explain its origin, we\ninvestigated the presence of outflow signatures in the QSO spectra, discovering\na higher incidence of broad [OIII] wings and high CIV velocity shifts (>1000\nkm/s) in red QSOs. We find that red QSOs that exhibit evidence for\nhigh-velocity winds present a stronger signature of the infrared excess,\nsuggesting a causal connection between reddening and the presence of hot dust\nin QSO winds. We propose that dusty winds at nuclear scales are potentially the\nphysical ingredient responsible for the colours in red QSOs, as well as a key\nparameter for the regulation of accretion material in the nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

These\nsolutions rely on the inverse scattering method, which reduces these seemingly\nunrelated problems to identifying reflectionless potentials of an auxiliary\none-dimensional quantum scattering problem. There are several ways of\nconstructing these potentials, one of which is quantum mechanical supersymmetry\n(SUSY). In this paper, motivated by recent experimental platforms, we\ngeneralize this framework to develop a theory of solitons in lattice versions\nof interacting field theories. Our analysis hinges on the use of trace\nidentities, which are relations connecting the potential of an equation of\nmotion to the scattering data. For a discrete Schr\\\"odinger operator, such\ntrace identities are well known, and we derive a new set of identities for the\ndiscrete Dirac operator. We then use these in a lattice Gross-Neveu and chiral\nGross-Neveu (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) model to show that lattice solitons correspond\nto reflectionless potentials associated with the discrete scattering problem.\nThese models are of significance as they are equivalent to a mean-field theory\nof a lattice superconductor. To explicitly construct these solitons, we\ngeneralize supersymmetric quantum mechanics to tight-binding models. We show\nthat a matrix transformation exists that maps a tight-binding model to an\nisospectral one which shares the same structure and scattering properties. The\ncorresponding soliton solutions have both modulated hopping and onsite\npotential; we explicitly compute both topological and non-topological soliton\nsolutions as well as bound state spectra in the aforementioned models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Two predominant mechanisms are orbital\nmigration, which brings them close to their star, and atmospheric escape under\nthe resulting increased irradiation. Yet, their relative roles remain unclear\nbecause we lack models that couple the two mechanisms with high precision on\nsecular timescales. To address this need, we developed the JADE code, which\nsimulates the secular atmospheric and dynamical evolution of a planet around\nits star, and can include the perturbation induced by a distant third body. On\nthe dynamical side, the 3D evolution of the orbit is modeled under stellar and\nplanetary tidal forces, a relativistic correction, and the action of the\ndistant perturber. On the atmospheric side, the vertical structure of the\natmosphere is integrated over time based on its thermodynamical properties,\ninner heating, and the evolving stellar irradiation, which results, in\nparticular, in photo-evaporation. The JADE code is benchmarked on GJ436 b,\nprototype of evaporating giants on eccentric, misaligned orbits at the edge of\nthe hot Neptunes desert. We confirm that its orbital architecture is well\nexplained by Kozai migration and unveil a strong interplay between its\natmospheric and orbital evolution. During the resonance phase, the atmosphere\npulsates in tune with the Kozai cycles, which leads to stronger tides and an\nearlier migration. This triggers a strong evaporation several Gyr after the\nplanet formed, refining the paradigm that mass loss is dominant in the early\nage of close-in planets. This suggests that the edge of the desert could be\nformed of warm Neptunes whose evaporation was delayed by migration. It\nstrengthens the importance of coupling atmospheric and dynamical evolution over\nsecular timescales, which the JADE code will allow simulating for a wide range\nof systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 19:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Additionally, split forms have recently seen a\nresurgence in research activity due to their resultant nonlinear (entropy)\nstability proofs. This paper derives for the first time nonlinearly stable ESFR\nschemes in split form that enable nonlinear stability proofs for, uncollocated,\nmodal, ESFR split forms with different volume and surface cubature nodes. The\ncritical enabling technology is applying the splitting to the discrete\nstiffness operator.

When these\nschemes are recast in strong form, they differ from schemes found in the ESFR\nliterature as the ESFR correction functions are incorporated on the volume\nintegral. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted verifying that the\nnew class of proposed ESFR split forms is nonlinearly stable in contrast to the\nstandard split form ESFR approach.

They also form a natural bridge\nbetween model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make\npredictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient\nprediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style\nrepresentations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we\nmaintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by\nrepresentation learning or GPI. Successor-style representations also typically\nmake no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent\nvariables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from\npredictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor\nfeatures, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style\nrepresentation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources\nof information within this representation, including different latent states,\npolicies, and reward functions.

As\na by-product, the iteratively reweighted $\\ell_1$ solution is precisely\ncharacterized in terms of the chosen initialization. We also give the explicit\nform of the proximity operator for the composition of the log-sum penalty with\nthe singular value function, as seen in low-rank applications. These results\nshould be useful in the development of efficient and accurate algorithms for\noptimization problems involving the log-sum penalty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 21:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 16:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

In\nthis letter, we look at the process $pp \\to WWH$, in particular through the\nfusion of bottom quarks. Due to the non-negligible coupling of the Higgs boson\nwith the bottom quarks, there is a dependence on the $WWHH$ coupling in this\nprocess. This sub-process receives largest contribution when the $W$ bosons are\nlongitudinally polarized. We compute one-loop QCD corrections to various final\nstates with polarized $W$ bosons. We find that the corrections to the final\nstate with the longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons are large.

Such an\nequation shows that, assuming the detector is in the transverse-traceless\nframe, which has a local shearing relative motion due to the gravitational wave\nperturbations, the electric field does not propagate as in an inertial\nreference frame in Minkowski spacetime. We present the electric field at the\nend of the interferometric process, for arbitrary arm configurations with\nrespect to the plane gravitational wave packet propagation direction. Then, for\nnormal incidence, we compute the interference pattern and, in addition to the\nusual term associated with the difference in path traveled by light in the\narms, we deduce two new contributions to the final intensity, arising from: (i)\nthe round-trip electromagnetic frequency shift and (ii) the divergence of the\nlight beam.

The amplifier was core-pumped with 1040 nm light to create\nanti-Stokes fluorescence (ASF) cooling and gain in the core at 1064 nm. Using a\ncustom slow-light FBG sensor with mK resolution, temperature measurements were\nperformed at multiple locations along the amplifier fiber.

ReCom tends to produce plans\nwith more compact districts than some other methods, and we sought to better\nunderstand this phenomenon. We adopted a discrete analog of district perimeter\ncalled \"cut edges\" as a quantitative measure for district compactness; this\nmeasure was proposed by Duchin and Tenner, and it avoids some of the\ndifficulties associated with compactness measures based on geographic\nperimeter, such as the Polsby-Popper score.\n  To model the basic ReCom step, we constructed ensembles of 2-district plans\nfor two grid graphs and for the precinct graph of Boulder County, CO. We found\nthat the probability of sampling any particular plan -- which is roughly\nproportional to the product of the numbers of spanning trees for each of the\ntwo districts -- is also approximately proportional to an exponentially\ndecaying function of the number of cut edges in the plan.

Several taxonomies of uncertainty have been\nproposed, and a substantial body of work exists on methods to tame uncertainty.\nYet, these taxonomies and methods do not fully convey the research community's\nperception on what constitutes uncertainty in self-adaptive systems and how to\ntackle it. To understand this perception and learn from it, we conducted a\nsurvey comprising two complementary stages. In the first stage, we focused on\ncurrent research and development. In the second stage, we focused on directions\nfor future research. The key findings of the first stage are: a) an overview of\nuncertainty sources considered in self-adaptive systems, b) an overview of\nexisting methods used to tackle uncertainty in concrete applications, c)\ninsights into the impact of uncertainty on non-functional requirements, d)\ninsights into different opinions in the perception of uncertainty within the\ncommunity, and the need for standardised uncertainty-handling processes to\nfacilitate uncertainty management in self-adaptive systems. The key findings of\nthe second stage are: a) the insight that over 70% of the participants believe\nthat self-adaptive systems can be engineered to cope with unanticipated change,\nb) a set of potential approaches for dealing with unanticipated change, c) a\nset of open challenges in mitigating uncertainty in self-adaptive systems, in\nparticular in those with safety-critical requirements.

Existing algorithms have focused on learning reward\nfunctions that are linear in a set of trajectory features. The features are\ntypically hand-coded, and preference-based learning is used to determine a\nparticular user's relative weighting for each feature. Designing a\nrepresentative set of features to encode reward is challenging and can result\nin inaccurate models that fail to model the users' preferences or perform the\ntask properly.

We introduce\nseveral corrections to the Hamiltonian designed to enforce certain exact\nproperties, such as the values of certain two-electron integrals. We also\nintroduce a simple universal energy correction which compensates for the\nincompleteness of the basis stemming from the electron-electron cusps, based on\nthe measured double occupancy of each basis function. We perform a number of\nHartree Fock and full configuration interaction (full-CI) test calculations on\ntwo electron systems, and Hartree Fock on a ten-atom hydrogen chain, to\nbenchmark these techniques. The inclusion of the cusp correction allows us to\nobtain complete basis set full-CI results, for the two electron cases, at the\nlevel of several microHartrees, and we see similar apparent accuracy for\nHartree Fock on the ten-atom hydrogen chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 22:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

Peaks in SF clearly correlate with the satellite pericentric passage\naround its host and, in one case, with a satellite-satellite interaction. We\nidentify two key ingredients that result in enhanced SF after infall: galaxies\nmust enter the host's virial radius with a reservoir of cold gas $M_{\\rm\ngas,inf}/M_{\\rm vir,inf}\\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ and with a minimum pericentric\ndistance $\\gtrsim$10 kpc (mean distance $\\sim$50 kpc for the full sample), in\norder to form new stars due to compression of cold gas at pericentric passage.\nOn the other hand, satellites that infall with little gas or whose pericentric\ndistance is too small, have their gas ram-pressure stripped and subsequent SF\nquenched. The pericentric passage of satellites likewise correlates with SF\npeaks in their hosts, suggesting that this mechanism induces bursts of SF in\nsatellites and central galaxies alike, in agreement with recent studies of our\nGalaxy's SFH.

Each sensor adapts its transmit symbol power, such\nthat the larger its stored energy and its quantized channel gain are, the\nhigher its transmit symbol power is. To strike a balance between energy\nharvesting and energy consumption, we formulate two constrained optimization\nproblems (P1) and (P2), where in both problems we seek the jointly optimal\nlocal decision thresholds and channel gain quantization thresholds.

In CEP events, the state X is\nproduced at central rapidities, and the scattered protons do not leave the beam\npipe. The kinematics of X can be fully reconstructed from that of the protons,\nwhich gives access to final states otherwise not visible. CEP allows unique\nsensitivity to physics beyond the standard model, e.g. in the search for\nanomalous quartic gauge couplings, axion-like particles, and in general new\nresonances. CMS has been successfully operating the Precision Proton\nSpectrometer (PPS), initially a joint CMS and TOTEM project, since 2016. The\npresent document outlines the physics interest of a new PPS at the HL-LHC, and\nexplores its feasibility and expected performance. Discussions with the machine\ngroups led to the identification of four locations suitable for the\ninstallation of movable proton detectors: at 196, 220, 234, and 420 m from the\ninteraction point, on both sides. Acceptance studies indicate that having the\nbeams cross in the vertical plane at the interaction point, as implemented\nafter Long Shutdown 3, is preferable over the present horizontal crossing. This\ngives access to states X in the mass range 133 GeV$-$2.7 TeV with the stations\nat 196, 220, and 234 m. The lower mass limit becomes 43 GeV if the 420 m\nstation is included, which makes it possible to study central exclusive\nproduction of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. This is a major improvement with respect\nto the current mass range of 350 GeV$-$2 TeV. The project and its costs can\neasily be staged; the 420 m station can be addressed in a second step. In\nsummary, a new near-beam proton spectrometer for operation at the HL-LHC\nappears feasible. It would greatly extend the CMS physics reach with a limited\ninvestment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 23:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

However, development of robust autonomous\nvehicle subsystems requires repeatable, controlled testing - while real weather\nis unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. Real-world testing in adverse\nconditions is an expensive and time-consuming task, often requiring access to\nspecialist facilities. Simulation is commonly relied upon as a substitute, with\nincreasingly visually realistic representations of the real-world being\ndeveloped. In the context of the complete autonomous vehicle control pipeline,\nsubsystems downstream of perception need to be tested with accurate recreations\nof the perception system output, rather than focusing on subjective visual\nrealism of the input - whether in simulation or the real world.

Two of the main challenges of\nthis methodology are: 1) over-fitting as a result of limited data duration, and\n2) correlated process noise as a confounding factor, both leading to errors in\nidentifying the causal influences. Sparse estimation via the LASSO has\nsuccessfully addressed these challenges for parameter estimation. However, the\nclassical statistical tests for Granger causality resort to asymptotic analysis\nof ordinary least squares, which require long data durations to be useful and\nare not immune to confounding effects. In this work, we close this gap by\nintroducing a LASSO-based statistic and studying its non-asymptotic properties\nunder the assumption that the true models admit sparse autoregressive\nrepresentations. We establish that the sufficient conditions of LASSO also\nsuffice for robust identification of Granger causal influences.

Recent\nworks based on convolutional neural networks utilize the feature maps taken\nfrom the last convolutional layer to mine discriminative regions. However, the\nlast convolutional layer tends to focus on the whole object due to the large\nreceptive field, which leads to a reduced ability to spot the differences. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel Granularity-Aware Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (GA-CNN) that progressively explores discriminative features.\nSpecifically, GA-CNN utilizes the differences of the receptive fields at\ndifferent layers to learn multi-granularity features, and it exploits larger\ngranularity information based on the smaller granularity information found at\nthe previous stages. To further boost the performance, we introduce an\nobject-attentive module that can effectively localize the object given a raw\nimage. GA-CNN does not need bounding boxes/part annotations and can be trained\nend-to-end.

The key\nidea of the proposed scheme, namely the Hybrid Interference Mitigation using\nAnalog Prewhitening (HIMAP), is to insert an M-input M-output analog phase\nshifter network (PSN) between the receive antennas and the ADCs to spatially\nprewhiten the interferences, which requires no signal information but only an\nestimate of the covariance matrix. After interference mitigation by the PSN\nprewhitener, the preamble can be synchronized, the signal channel response can\nbe estimated, and thus a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamformer can be\napplied in the digital domain to further mitigate the residual interferences.\nThe simulation results verify that the HIMAP scheme can suppress interferences\n80dB stronger than the signal by using off-the-shelf phase shifters (PS) of\n6-bit resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 02:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

The transverse flow produces a maximum drag reduction of 25\\%, due\nto lower pressure and skin-friction drag forces. The pressure drag reduction\nreaches a maximum of 22\\% and is due to a decrease of the positive high\npressure in front of the bars and an increase of the low negative pressure\nbehind the bars. The skin-friction drag reduction is caused by a lower\nwall-shear stress along the cavity between the bars where the flow is fully\nattached, while the wall-shear stress on the crest of the bars and in the\nseparated region behind the bars is unaffected. The spanwise laminar flow\nobtained by neglecting the nonlinear terms involving the turbulent velocity\nfluctuations is used to compute the power spent for oscillating the fluid along\nthe spanwise direction and an excellent agreement is found with the power spent\nobtained by the averaged turbulent flow.

The reduced profitability of peak/off-peak arbitrage\nforces hydropower producers to recover part of their original profitability on\nthe reserve markets. We propose a bi-layer stochastic programming framework for\nthe optimal operation of a fleet of interconnected hydropower plants that sells\nenergy on both the spot and the reserve markets. The outer layer (the planner's\nproblem) optimizes end-of-day reservoir filling levels over one year, whereas\nthe inner layer (the trader's problem) selects optimal hourly market bids\nwithin each day. Using an information restriction whereby the planner\nprescribes the end-of-day reservoir targets one day in advance, we prove that\nthe trader's problem simplifies from an infinite-dimensional stochastic program\nwith 25 stages to a finite two-stage stochastic program with only two\nscenarios. Substituting this reformulation back into the outer layer and\napproximating the reservoir targets by affine decision rules allows us to\nsimplify the planner's problem from an infinite-dimensional stochastic program\nwith 365 stages to a two-stage stochastic program that can conveniently be\nsolved via the sample average approximation.

For example, when a logistic growth term is added to the\ngoverning partial differential equation in a Stefan problem, one arrives at the\nFisher-Stefan model, a generalisation of the well-known Fisher-KPP model,\ncharacterised by a leakage coefficient $\\kappa$ which relates the speed of the\nmoving boundary to the flux of population there. This Fisher-Stefan model\novercomes one of the well-known limitations of the Fisher-KPP model, since\ntime-dependent solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model involve a well-defined\nfront with compact support which is more natural in terms of mathematical\nmodelling.

One useful structure for modeling a\ntree is a skeleton: a 1D, lightweight representation of the geometry and the\ntopology of a tree. This skeletonization problem is an important one within the\nfield of computer graphics, and a number of algorithms have been specifically\ndeveloped for the task of modeling trees. These skeletonization algorithms have\nlargely addressed the problem as a geometric one. In agricultural contexts,\nhowever, the parts of the tree have distinct labels, such as the trunk,\nsupporting branches, etc. This labeled structure is important for understanding\nwhere to prune. We introduce an algorithm which produces such a labeled\nskeleton, using the topological and geometric priors associated with these\nlabels to improve our skeletons.

First, joint landmarks and\nsilhouette are extracted from a single input image to provide 2D cues for the\n3D tasks.

Monte Carlo simulations are carried out using three codes widely\nused in the low-energy domain: PENELOPE-2018, EGSnrc, and MCNP. Mass\nenergy-absorption coefficients for water, air, graphite, and their respective\nratios; absorbed dose; and photon-fluence spectra are considered. Benchmark\nsimulations using similar cross-sections have been performed. The differences\nobserved between these quantities when different cross-sections are considered\nare taken to be a good estimator for the corresponding Type B uncertainties. A\nconservative Type B uncertainty for the absorbed dose (k=2) of 1.2%-1.7% (<50\nkeV), 0.6%-1.2% (50-100 keV), and 0.3% (100-200 keV) is estimated. The\nphoton-fluence spectrum does not present clinically relevant differences that\nmerit considering additional Type B uncertainties except for energies below 25\nkeV, where a Type B uncertainty of 0.5% is obtained. Below 30 keV, mass\nenergy-absorption coefficients show Type B uncertainties (k=2) of about 1.5%\n(water and air), and 2% (graphite), reaching values about 1% (40-50 keV) and\n0.5% (50-75 keV). Type B uncertainties for the water-to-graphite ratios are\nobserved for energies below 30 keV, about 0.7% (k=2). In contrast with the\nintermediate (about 500 keV) or high (about 1 MeV) energy domains, Type B\nuncertainties due to the different cross-sections implementation cannot be\nconsidered subdominant with respect to Type A uncertainties or even to other\nsources of Type B uncertainties. Therefore, the values reported here should be\naccommodated within the uncertainty budget in low-energy photon dosimetry\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 07:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Generally, deep image compression is based on an autoencoder\nframework, which transforms the original image to latents at the encoder and\nrecovers the reconstructed image from the quantized latents at the decoder. The\ntransform is usually combined with an entropy model, which estimates the\nprobability distribution of the quantized latents for arithmetic coding.\nCurrently, joint autoregressive and hierarchical prior entropy models are\nwidely adopted to capture both the global contexts from the hyper latents and\nthe local contexts from the quantized latent elements. For the local contexts,\nthe widely adopted 2D mask convolution can only capture the spatial context.\nHowever, we observe that there are strong correlations between different\nchannels in the latents. To utilize the cross channel correlations, we propose\nto divide the latents into several groups according to channel index and code\nthe groups one by one, where previously coded groups are utilized to provide\ncross channel context for the current group. The proposed cross channel context\nmodel is combined with the joint autoregressive and hierarchical prior entropy\nmodel.

In recent years, state-of-the-art classification methods based\non graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown their superiority over traditional\nones such as label propagation. However, the sophisticated architectures of\nthese neural models will lead to a complex prediction mechanism, which could\nnot make full use of valuable prior knowledge lying in the data, e.g.,\nstructurally correlated nodes tend to have the same class. In this paper, we\npropose a framework based on knowledge distillation to address the above\nissues. Our framework extracts the knowledge of an arbitrary learned GNN model\n(teacher model), and injects it into a well-designed student model. The student\nmodel is built with two simple prediction mechanisms, i.e., label propagation\nand feature transformation, which naturally preserves structure-based and\nfeature-based prior knowledge, respectively. In specific, we design the student\nmodel as a trainable combination of parameterized label propagation and feature\ntransformation modules. As a result, the learned student can benefit from both\nprior knowledge and the knowledge in GNN teachers for more effective\npredictions. Moreover, the learned student model has a more interpretable\nprediction process than GNNs. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark\ndatasets and employ seven GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP, SAGE, SGC,\nGCNII and GLP as the teacher models.

In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks\nby embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call\n\"coordinate attention\". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature\ntensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate\nattention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes\nthat aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this\nway, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and\nmeanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other\nspatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into\na pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be\ncomplementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations\nof the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be\nflexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt,\nand EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet\nclassification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks,\nsuch as object detection and semantic segmentation.

However, most of existing methods underestimate the importance of\nchallenging regions (e.g. small branches or blurred edges) during training. We\nbelieve that these unlabeled regions may contain more crucial information to\nminimize the uncertainty prediction for the model and should be emphasized in\nthe training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Mutual\nConsistency Network (MC-Net) for semi-supervised left atrium segmentation from\n3D MR images. Particularly, our MC-Net consists of one encoder and two slightly\ndifferent decoders, and the prediction discrepancies of two decoders are\ntransformed as an unsupervised loss by our designed cycled pseudo label scheme\nto encourage mutual consistency. Such mutual consistency encourages the two\ndecoders to have consistent and low-entropy predictions and enables the model\nto gradually capture generalized features from these unlabeled challenging\nregions. We evaluate our MC-Net on the public Left Atrium (LA) database and it\nobtains impressive performance gains by exploiting the unlabeled data\neffectively. Our MC-Net outperforms six recent semi-supervised methods for left\natrium segmentation, and sets the new state-of-the-art performance on the LA\ndatabase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 09:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 07:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

The analysis of football matches relies on the annotation\nof both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athletic\nperformance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at a\nfine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task.

The time- and energy-dependent polarization can\ndeliver important physical information on the emission region and can be used\nto test models. Polarization predictions for the GRB prompt phase with the\nmagnetized IS model should be investigated carefully. The magnetic field of the\nmagnetized IS model is very likely to be mixed and decays with radius. The\nsynchrotron emission in the presence of such a decaying magnetic field can\nrecover the Band-like spectrum of the GRB prompt phase. We investigate the\ndependence of the polarization of GRB prompt emission on both time and energy\nin the framework of the magnetized IS model. Due to the large range of\nparameters, it is hard to distinguish the magnetized IS model and the\nmagnetic-reconnection model through polarization degree (PD) curves. The\nenergy-dependent PD could increase toward the high-energy band for the\nmagnetized IS model, while it decreases to zero above the megaelectronvolt band\nfor the dissipative photosphere model. Therefore, we conclude that the energy\ndependence of PD can be used to distinguish these two models for the GRB prompt\nemission. Finally, we find that, independent of the observational energy band,\nthe profiles of the $\\xi_B-PD$ curve for the time-integrated and time-resolved\nPDs are very similar, where $\\xi_B$ is the magnetic field strength ratio of the\nordered component to the random component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 11:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

This is called Bing shrinkability criterion. It is applied in major\n4-dimensional results: in the disk embedding theorem and in the proof of the\n4-dimensional topological Poincare conjecture. It is extensively applied in\nconstructing approximations of manifold embeddings in dimension at least 5, see\nfor example Edwards's cell-like approximation theorem. We prove for example\nthat every cell-like subset in a 2-dimensional manifold is cellular, that\nAntoine's necklace is a wild Cantor set, that in a complete metric space a usc\ndecomposition is shrinkable if and only if the decomposition map is a\nnear-homeomorphism and that every manifold has collared boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 11:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

One key element of\nisogeometric analysis is that it allows high order smoothness within one patch.\nHowever, for representing complex geometries, a multi-patch construction is\nneeded. In this case, a $C^0$-smooth basis is easy to obtain, whereas\n$C^1$-smooth isogeometric functions require a special construction. Such spaces\nare of interest when solving numerically fourth-order PDE problems, such as the\nbiharmonic equation and the Kirchhoff-Love plate or shell formulation, using an\nisogeometric Galerkin method.\n  With the construction of so-called analysis-suitable $G^1$ (in short,\nAS-$G^1$) parametrizations, as introduced in (Collin, Sangalli, Takacs; CAGD,\n2016), it is possible to construct $C^1$ isogeometric spaces which possess\noptimal approximation properties. These geometries need to satisfy certain\nconstraints along the interfaces and additionally require that the regularity\n$r$ and degree $p$ of the underlying spline space satisfy $1 \\leq r \\leq p-2$.\nThe problem is that most complex geometries are not AS-$G^1$ geometries.\nTherefore, we define basis functions for isogeometric spaces by enforcing\napproximate $C^1$ conditions following the basis construction from (Kapl,\nSangalli, Takacs; CAGD, 2017). For this reason, the defined function spaces are\nnot exactly $C^1$ but only approximately.\n  We study the convergence behavior and define function spaces that converge\noptimally under $h$-refinement, by locally introducing functions of higher\npolynomial degree and lower regularity. The convergence rate is optimal in\nseveral numerical tests performed on domains with non-trivial interfaces. While\nan extension to more general multi-patch domains is possible, we restrict\nourselves to the two-patch case and focus on the construction over a single\ninterface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 11:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

This issue can be more severe for methods\nthat use long bandwidths (i.e., fixed-b HAR tests).

To address this issue, we explore a\nfully end-to-end (E2E) neural model for MDD, which processes learners' speech\ndirectly based on raw waveforms. Compared to conventional hand-crafted acoustic\nfeatures, raw waveforms retain more acoustic phenomena and potentially can help\nneural networks discover better and more customized representations. To this\nend, our MDD model adopts a co-called SincNet module to take input a raw\nwaveform and covert it to a suitable vector representation sequence. SincNet\nemploys the cardinal sine (sinc) function to implement learnable bandpass\nfilters, drawing inspiration from the convolutional neural network (CNN).

The convolutional operations used in\nthese networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range\ndependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. Although\nTransformer was born to address this issue, it suffers from extreme\ncomputational and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature\nmaps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a\n{\\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\\bf Tr}ansformer {\\bf (CoTr)} for\naccurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is\nconstructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable\nTransformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the\nextracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all\nimage positions equally, our DeTrans pays attention only to a small set of key\npositions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the\ncomputational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced,\nmaking it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps,\nwhich are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation.

However, several studies showed that\nit is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a\nclassifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully\nmodifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized\nsmoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image\nclassifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized\nsmoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points.\n  In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable\nrobustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted\npoints. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud\nclassifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each\nof which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud;\nthen our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the\nmajority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the\npoint cloud classifier.

Our\nsecond major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our\nderived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made.\nMoreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness\nguarantees.

We found (1) the diffusion\ncoefficient has a weak energy-dependent, and the Kolmogorov type is favored;\n(2) the magnetic field strength could vary linearly or nonlinearly with radius\nfor different surrounding environments because of possible turbulence in shock\ndownstream region, and a compressional amplification is likely to exist at the\nshock front; (3) the non-thermal photons from radio to X-ray bands are\ndominated by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons, if the GeV-TeV\ngamma-rays are produced by inverse Compton scattering from these electrons\ninteracting with the background photons, then the X-ray and gamma-ray radial\nprofiles can be reproduced except for the more extended $\\gamma$-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 14:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

All of the aligned sequences, which\nwere corrected from the satellite motions and tracked with the differential\nrotation, were used to detect the long-lasting downflows in the quiet-Sun at\nthe disc centre. To learn about the structure of the flows below the solar\nsurface, the time-distance local helioseismology was used.\n  The inspection of the 3D data cube (x, y, t) of the 24-hour Doppler sequence\nallowed us to detect 13 persistent downflows. Their lifetimes lie in the range\nbetween 3.5 and 20 hours with sizes between 2\" and 3\" and speeds between -0.25\nand -0.72 km/s. These persistent downflows are always filled with the magnetic\nfield with an amplitude of up to 600 G. The helioseismic inversion allows us to\ndescribe the persistent downflows and compare them to the other\n(non-persistent) downflows in the field of view. The persistent downflows seem\nto penetrate much deeper and, in the case of a well-formed vortex, the\nvorticity keeps its integrity to the depth of about 5 Mm. In the MHD\nsimulation, only sub-arcsecond downflows are detected with no evidence of a\nvortex comparable in size to observations at the surface of the Sun.\n  The long temporal sequences from the space-borne allow us to show the\nexistence of long-persistent downflows together with the magnetic field.

Sulfur is an abundant but\npeculiar element in the sense that, despite being less volatile than other\nelements (e.g., carbon), it is not a major constituent of dust grains in\ndiffuse interstellar clouds. Here, we determine the gas-phase carbon-to-sulfur\nabundance ratio, [C]/[S], and the sulfur abundance [S] in a dense star-forming\ncloud from new radio recombination lines (RRLs) detected with the Yebes 40m\ntelescope - at relatively high frequencies (~40 GHz ~7 mm) and angular\nresolutions (down to 36'') - in the Orion Bar, a rim of the Orion Molecular\nCloud (OMC). We detect nine Cn\\alpha RRLs (with n=51 to 59) as well as nine\nnarrow line features separated from the Cn\\alpha lines by delta v=-8.4+/-0.3 km\ns^-1. Based on this velocity separation, we assign these features to sulfur\nRRLs, with little contribution of RRLs from the more condensable elements Mg,\nSi, or Fe. Sulfur RRLs lines trace the photodissociation region (PDR) of the\nOMC. In these predominantly neutral gas layers, up to A_V~4, the ions C+ and S+\nlock in most of the C and S gas-phase reservoir. We determine a relative\nabundance of [C]_Ori/[S]_Ori=10.4+/-0.6 and, adopting the same [C]_Ori measured\nin the translucent gas toward star theta^1 Ori B, an absolute abundance of\n[S]_Ori=(1.4+/-0.4)x10^-5. This value is consistent with emission models of the\nobserved sulfur RRLs if N(S+)~7x10^17 cm^-2 (beam-averaged). The [S]_Ori is the\n''initial'' sulfur abundance in the OMC, before an undetermined fraction of the\n[S]_Ori goes into molecules and ice mantles in the cloud interior. The inferred\nabundance [S]_Ori matches the solar abundance, thus implying that there is\nlittle depletion of sulfur onto rocky dust grains, with D(S)=0.0+/-0.2 dex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 15:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Our first contribution is to formulate geometric perception\nas an optimization problem that jointly optimizes the feature descriptor and\nthe geometric models given a large corpus of visual measurements (e.g., images,\npoint clouds). Under this optimization formulation, we show that two important\nstreams of research in vision, namely robust model fitting and deep feature\nlearning, correspond to optimizing one block of the unknown variables while\nfixing the other block. This analysis naturally leads to our second\ncontribution -- the SGP algorithm that performs alternating minimization to\nsolve the joint optimization. SGP iteratively executes two meta-algorithms: a\nteacher that performs robust model fitting given learned features to generate\ngeometric pseudo-labels, and a student that performs deep feature learning\nunder noisy supervision of the pseudo-labels. As a third contribution, we apply\nSGP to two perception problems on large-scale real datasets, namely relative\ncamera pose estimation on MegaDepth and point cloud registration on 3DMatch. We\ndemonstrate that SGP achieves state-of-the-art performance that is on-par or\nsuperior to the supervised oracles trained using ground-truth labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 15:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

Numerical diffusion occurs\nwhen local flow direction is not aligned with the mesh lines and when there is\na non-zero gradient of the dependent variable in the direction normal to the\nstreamline direction. It has been observed that typical numerical\ndiscretization schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations such as first order\nupwinding produce very accurate solutions without numerical diffusion when the\nmesh is aligned with the streamline directions. On the other hand, numerical\ndiffusion is maximized when the streamline direction is at an angle of 45{\\deg}\nrelative to the mesh line. The amount of numerical diffusion can be reduced by\nmesh refinements such as aligning mesh lines along the local flow direction or\nby introducing higher order numerical schemes which may introduce potential\nnumerical instability or additional computational cost. Couple test cases of a\nsimple steady-state incompressible and inviscid air flow convection problem\nwere used to investigate whether numerical diffusion occurs when using Physics\nInformed Neural Networks (PINNs) that rely on automatic differentiation as\nopposed to numerical techniques used in traditional Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) solvers.

Advanced textile for personal thermal management shapes\nbody microclimates by merely regulating heat transfer between the skin and\nlocal ambient without wasting excess energy. Therefore, numerous efforts have\nrecently been devoted to the development of advanced thermoregulatory textiles.\nIn this review, we provide a unified perspective on those state-of-the-art\nefforts by emphasizing the design of diverse heat transfer pathways.

Tuning those heat transfer pathways can achieve different\nfunctionalities for personal thermal management, such as passive cooling,\nwarming, or even dual-mode (cooling-warming), either static switching or\ndynamic adapting.

The success of DL largely lies on data representation because different\nrepresentations can indicate to a degree the different explanatory factors of\nvariation behind the data. In the last few year, the most successful story in\nDL is supervised learning. However, to apply supervised learning, one challenge\nis that data labels are expensive to get, noisy, or only partially available.\nWith consideration that we human beings learn in an unsupervised way;\nself-supervised learning methods have garnered a lot of attention recently. A\ndominant force in self-supervised learning is the autoencoder, which has\nmultiple uses (e.g., data representation, anomaly detection, denoise). This\nresearch explored the application of an autoencoder to learn effective data\nrepresentation of helicopter flight track data, and then to support helicopter\ntrack identification. Our testing results are promising. For example, at\nPhoenix Deer Valley (DVT) airport, where 70% of recorded flight tracks have\nmissing aircraft types, the autoencoder can help to identify twenty-two times\nmore helicopters than otherwise detectable using rule-based methods; for Grand\nCanyon West Airport (1G4) airport, the autoencoder can identify thirteen times\nmore helicopters than a current rule-based approach. Our approach can also\nidentify mislabeled aircraft types in the flight track data and find true types\nfor records with pseudo aircraft type labels such as HELO.

The resolution is that the parallel universes must be embedded\nwithin a mathematical structure, the multiverse, which allows universes to be\nidentical within themselves, but nevertheless distinct, as determined by their\nposition in the structure. The multiverse needs more emergent parameters than\nour universe and so it can be considered to be a superstructure.\nCorrespondingly, its reality can be called a super-reality.

An explicit\ngeneralized form of the Gamow penetrability factor is given for the predictions\nof the laser-induced effects for some other similar nuclear processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 06:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}
