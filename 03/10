In order to achieve better image quality and avoid\nmanual parameter tuning, we propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach to\nrecover $R_2^*$ map and phase images for quantitative susceptibility mapping\n(QSM), while allowing automatic parameter estimation from undersampled data.\n  Theory: Sparse prior on the wavelet coefficients of images is interpreted\nfrom a Bayesian perspective as sparsity-promoting distribution. A novel\nnonlinear approximate message passing (AMP) framework that incorporates a\nmono-exponential decay model is proposed. The parameters are treated as unknown\nvariables and jointly estimated with image wavelet coefficients.\n  Results: The proposed AMP with parameter estimation (AMP-PE) approach\nsuccessfully recovers $R_2^*$ maps and phase images for QSM across various\nundersampling rates. It is more computationally efficient, and performs better\nthan the state-of-the-art $l_1$-norm regularization (L1) approach in general,\nexcept a few cases where the L1 approach performs as well as AMP-PE.\n  Conclusion: AMP-PE achieves better performance by drawing information from\nboth the sparse prior and the mono-exponential decay model. It does not require\nparameter tuning, and works with a clinical, prospective undersampling scheme\nwhere parameter tuning is often impossible or difficult due to the lack of\nground-truth image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 16:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 02:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 17:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Moreover, there is\ntension between determinations of $V_{us}$ obtained from leptonic $K\\mu2$ and\nsemileptonic $K\\ell3$ kaon decays. These discrepancies can be explained if\nthere exist extra vector-like quarks at the TeV scale, which have large enough\nmixings with the lighter quarks. In particular, extra vector-like weak singlets\nquarks can be thought as a solution to the CKM unitarity problem and an extra\nvector-like weak doublet can in principle resolve all tensions. The\nimplications of this kind of mixings are examined against the flavour changing\nphenomena and SM precision tests.

Heavy quark transport\ncoefficients play a significant role in understanding the properties of QGP.\nExperimental measurements of nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow can\nconstrain the heavy quark transport coefficients, which are key ingredients for\nphenomenological studies, and they help to disentangle different energy loss\nmechanisms. We give a general perspective of the heavy quark drag and diffusion\ncoefficients in QGP and discuss their potentials as probes to disentangle\ndifferent hadronization mechanisms, as well as to probe the initial\nelectromagnetic fields produced in non-central heavy-ion collisions.\nExperimental perspectives on future measurements are discussed with special\nemphasis on heavy-flavors as next-generation probes in view of new\ntechnological developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 16:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 18:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Coupled\nwith the potential for entropy stabilization of high symmetry phases at high\ntemperatures, this system represents a promising class of materials for\nstructural applications in extreme environments. Yet, transformation-induced\nplasticity mechanisms are notably sensitive to microstructure parameters and\nthe literature offers examples of deleterious decomposition of high entropy\nalloys under heat treatment, which raises concerns of resiliency in mechanical\nperformance. Here, we evaluate the evolution of microstructure and mechanical\nproperties of a FeMnCoCr high entropy alloy after prolonged heat treatment at\nhigh temperature. Microstructures are found to retain their characteristic\naustenite/martensite features, with parent face-centered cubic grains\npartitioned by hexagonal close-packed laths after heat treatment at 1200 C for\nup to 48 hours. Results of mechanical testing reveal an unusual insensitivity\nof this alloy to grain growth-induced weakening effects. Namely, the yield\nstrengths of FeMnCoCr samples are observed to remain constant across all heat\ntreatment conditions, despite a near four-fold increase in the grain size.\nClose examination of post-heat treatment microstructures reveals a dramatic\ndecrease in the inter-lath spacing at longer durations, which segments parent\naustenite grains. This crystal partitioning counteracts conventional grain\ngrowth-induced weakening by introducing additional barriers for dislocation\npile-up.

Unfortunately, enforcing\nserializability has a high-performance cost, especially on geographically\ndistributed database clusters. Consequently, many databases allow programmers\nto choose when a transaction must be executed under serializability, with the\nexpectation that transactions would only be so marked when necessary to avoid\nserious concurrency bugs. However, this is a significant burden to impose on\ndevelopers, requiring them to (a) reason about subtle concurrent interactions\namong potentially interfering transactions, (b) determine when such\ninteractions would violate desired invariants, and (c) then identify the\nminimum number of transactions whose executions should be serialized to prevent\nthese violations. To mitigate this burden, in this paper we present a sound and\nfully automated schema refactoring procedure that transforms a program's data\nlayout -- rather than its concurrency control logic -- to eliminate statically\nidentified concurrency bugs, allowing more transactions to be safely executed\nunder weaker and more performant database guarantees.

While these modes\nstill carry primordial information, their theoretical modeling requires\nknowledge of the CMB lensing convergence power spectrum, $C_L^{\\kappa\\kappa}$,\nincluding on small scales where it is affected by nonlinear gravitational\nevolution and baryonic feedback processes. Thus, the high-$\\ell$ primary CMB is\nsensitive to these late-time, nonlinear effects.

Our photometry shows a\nlightcurve having a very small amplitude (maximum $\\sim 0.05$ mag) and a\nperiodicity of $ 2.55 \\pm 0.10$ hours. The new observations are consistent with\na model in which Gault is rotating near breakup, with centrifugal forces\nresponsible for its episodic mass loss. Approximated as a strengthless (fluid)\nspherical body, the implied density is $\\rho$ = 1700 kg m$^{-3}$. We use the\nFroude number $Fr$, defined here as the ratio between centrifugal force and\ngravitational force, as a way to investigate mass loss regimes in fast spinning\nasteroids and find that mass shedding starts at $Fr \\sim 0.5$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 18:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 00:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

By the\ncelebrated result of Erd\\H{o}s from 1947, the random graph on $N$ vertices with\nedge probability $1/2$, contains no clique or independent set larger than\n$2\\log_2 N$, with high probability. Finding explicit constructions of graphs\nwith similar Ramsey-type properties is a famous open problem. A natural\napproach is to construct such graphs using algebraic tools. Say that an\n$r$-uniform hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$ is \\emph{algebraic of complexity\n$(n,d,m)$} if the vertices of $\\mathcal{H}$ are elements of $\\mathbb{F}^{n}$\nfor some field $\\mathbb{F}$, and there exist $m$ polynomials\n$f_1,\\dots,f_m:(\\mathbb{F}^{n})^{r}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}$ of degree at most\n$d$ such that the edges of $\\mathcal{H}$ are determined by the zero-patterns of\n$f_1,\\dots,f_m$. The aim of this paper is to show that if an algebraic graph\n(or hypergraph) of complexity $(n,d,m)$ has good Ramsey properties, then at\nleast one of the parameters $n,d,m$ must be large. In 2001, R\\'onyai, Babai and\nGanapathy considered the bipartite variant of the Ramsey problem and proved\nthat if $G$ is an algebraic graph of complexity $(n,d,m)$ on $N$ vertices, then\neither $G$ or its complement contains a complete balanced bipartite graph of\nsize $\\Omega_{n,d,m}(N^{1/(n+1)})$. We extend this result by showing that such\n$G$ contains either a clique or an independent set of size $N^{\\Omega(1/ndm)}$\nand prove similar results for algebraic hypergraphs of constant complexity. We\nalso obtain a polynomial regularity lemma for $r$-uniform algebraic hypergraphs\nthat are defined by a single polynomial, that might be of independent interest.\nOur proofs combine algebraic, geometric and combinatorial tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 18:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 13:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

The goal of this article is to provide a novel connection between total\npositivity and optimization/game theory.

To capture the genuine nonequilibrium phase transition of the\nSLLM (i.e., a single-mode laser without a saturable absorber), here we employ a\nquantum theory of dissipative phase transitions. Our results confirm that the\n$U(1)$ SSB can occur at the lasing threshold but, in contrast to the Landau\ntheory and semiclassical approximation, they signal that the SLLM \"fundamental\"\ntransition is a different phenomenon, which we call Liouvillian spectral\ncollapse; that is, the emergence of diabolic points of infinite degeneracy. By\nconsidering a generalized SLLM with additional dephasing, we witness a\nsecond-order phase transition, with a Liouvillian spectral collapse, but in the\nabsence of symmetry breaking. Most surprisingly, the phase transition\ncorresponds to the emergence of dynamical multistability even without SSB.\nNormally, bistability is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, while in this\ncase, the very presence of quantum fluctuations enables bistability.

Once the model's final parameters are released, there is\ncurrently no mechanism for the entity which trained the model to prove that\nthese parameters were indeed the result of this optimization procedure.

It would also facilitate the distributed\ntraining across untrusted workers where Byzantine workers might otherwise mount\na denial-of-service by returning incorrect model updates.\n  In this paper, we remediate this problem by introducing the concept of\nproof-of-learning in ML. Inspired by research on both proof-of-work and\nverified computations, we observe how a seminal training algorithm, stochastic\ngradient descent, accumulates secret information due to its stochasticity. This\nproduces a natural construction for a proof-of-learning which demonstrates that\na party has expended the compute require to obtain a set of model parameters\ncorrectly. In particular, our analyses and experiments show that an adversary\nseeking to illegitimately manufacture a proof-of-learning needs to perform *at\nleast* as much work than is needed for gradient descent itself.\n  We also instantiate a concrete proof-of-learning mechanism in both of the\nscenarios described above. In model ownership resolution, it protects the\nintellectual property of models released publicly. In distributed training, it\npreserves availability of the training procedure. Our empirical evaluation\nvalidates that our proof-of-learning mechanism is robust to variance induced by\nthe hardware (ML accelerators) and software stacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 18:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

When the container is full\nof fluid particles and the flow is stopped, a Delaunay triangulation algorithm\nis employed to link the fluid particles together to generate an unstructured\nmesh (which is then optimized using a combination of automated mesh smoothing\nand element removal in 3D).

Observations show a correlation between dust\nmass and the stellar accretion rate, as expected from viscous theory. However,\nthe gas mass inferred from 13CO and C18O line fluxes, which should be a more\ndirect measure, shows no such correlation. Using thermochemical DALI models, we\ninvestigate how 13CO and C18O J=3-2 line fluxes change over time in a viscously\nevolving disk. We also investigate if the chemical conversion of CO through\ngrain-surface chemistry combined with viscous evolution can explain the\nobservations of disks in Lupus. The 13CO and C18O 3-2 line fluxes increase over\ntime due to their optically thick emitting regions growing in size as the disk\nexpands viscously. The C18O 3-2 emission is optically thin throughout the disk\nfor only a subset of our models (Mdisk (t = 1 Myr) < 1e-3 Msun). For these\ndisks the integrated C18O flux decreases with time, similar to the disk mass.\nThe C18O 3-2 fluxes for the bulk of the disks in Lupus (with Mdust < 5e-5 Msun)\ncan be reproduced to within a factor of ~2 with viscously evolving disks in\nwhich CO is converted into other species through grain-surface chemistry driven\nby a cosmic-ray ionization rate zeta_cr ~ 5e-17 - 1e-16 s^-1. However,\nexplaining the stacked C18O upper limits requires a lower average abundance\nthan our models can produce and they cannot explain the observed 13CO fluxes,\nwhich, for most disks, are more than an order of magnitude fainter than what\nour models predict. Reconciling the 13CO fluxes of viscously evolving disks\nwith the observations requires either a combination of efficient vertical\nmixing and a high zeta_cr or low mass disks (Mdust < 3e-5 Msun) being much\nthinner and/or smaller than their more massive counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 19:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Contrary to the traditional\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying, IDF and ISDF strategies utilize the relay\nonly if the direct link ceases to attain a certain information rate, thereby\nimproving the spectral efficiency. The path gain through the power line is\nassumed to be log-normally distributed with high distance-dependent attenuation\nand the additive noise is from a Bernoulli-Gaussian process. Closed-form\nexpressions for the outage probability, and approximate closed-form expressions\nfor the end-to-end average channel capacity and the average bit error rate for\nbinary phase-shift keying are derived.

In short order, four university\naccelerators were disassembled and reassembled at Los Alamos, and methods were\nestablished to make measurements on extremely small samples owing to the\ninitial lack of availability of enriched 235 U and plutonium. I trace the\nprogram that measured fission cross sections, fission emitted neutron\nmultiplicities and their energy spectra, and transport cross sections,\ncomparing the measurements with our best understanding today as embodied in the\nEvaluated Nuclear Data File ENDF/B-VIII.0.

This process is called multilayer network\naggregation. In this work, we propose a maximum a posteriori estimation-based\nalgorithm for multilayer network aggregation. The method allows to aggregate a\nweighted multilayer network while conserving the core information of the\nlayers. We evaluate the method through an unweighted friendship network and a\nmultilayer gene co-expression network. We compare the aggregated gene\nco-expression network with a network obtained from conflated datasets and a\nnetwork obtained from averaged weights. The Von Neumann entropy is adopted to\ncompare the mixedness of the three networks, and, together with other network\nmeasurements, shows the effectiveness of the proposes method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 23:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

By exploiting the inherent sparse structure of the\nBS-IRS-user cascade channel, the beam training problem is formulated as a joint\nsparse sensing and phaseless estimation problem, which involves devising a\nsparse sensing matrix and developing an efficient estimation algorithm to\nidentify the best beam alignment from compressive phaseless measurements.\nTheoretical analysis reveals that the proposed method can identify the best\nalignment with only a modest amount of training overhead. Simulation results\nshow that, for both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS scenarios, the proposed method\nobtains a significant performance improvement over existing state-of-art\nmethods. Notably, it can achieve performance close to that of the exhaustive\nbeam search scheme, while reducing the training overhead by 95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 01:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 03:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Most of them concentrate on improving network architectures or putting\nforward novel algorithms, assuming that there are adequate profiling traces\navailable to train an appropriate neural network. However, in practical\nscenarios, profiling traces are probably insufficient, which makes the network\nlearn deficiently and compromises attack performance.\n  In this paper, we investigate a kind of data augmentation technique, called\nmixup, and first propose to exploit it in deep-learning based side channel\nattacks, for the purpose of expanding the profiling set and facilitating the\nchances of mounting a successful attack. We perform Correlation Power Analysis\nfor generated traces and original traces, and discover that there exists\nconsistency between them regarding leakage information. Our experiments show\nthat mixup is truly capable of enhancing attack performance especially for\ninsufficient profiling traces. Specifically, when the size of the training set\nis decreased to 30% of the original set, mixup can significantly reduce\nacquired attacking traces. We test three mixup parameter values and conclude\nthat generally all of them can bring about improvements. Besides, we compare\nthree leakage models and unexpectedly find that least significant bit model,\nwhich is less frequently used in previous works, actually surpasses prevalent\nidentity model and hamming weight model in terms of attack results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 02:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The quark and gluon parton\ndensities, $q(x)$ and $g(x)$, are necessarily interrelated since any gluon\nemission and absorption process, especially dressing of a quark, contributes to\n$g(x)$ and modifies $q(x)$. Guided by long-established results for the\nparton-in-parton distributions from a strict 1-loop perturbative analysis of a\nquark target, we extend the non-perturbative QCD approach based on the\nRainbow-Ladder truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations to describe the\ninterrelated valence $q_{\\rm v}(x)$ and the dressing-gluon $g(x)$ for a hadron\nat its intrinsic model scale.

In this study, we develop a\ntwo-stage framework, in which reinforcement learning (RL) and traditional\noperations research (OR) algorithms are combined together to efficiently deal\nwith complex scheduling problems. The scheduling problem is solved in two\nstages, including a finite Markov decision process (MDP) and a mixed-integer\nprogramming process, respectively. This offers a novel and general paradigm\nthat combines RL with OR approaches to solving scheduling problems, which\nleverages the respective strengths of RL and OR: The MDP narrows down the\nsearch space of the original problem through an RL method, while the\nmixed-integer programming process is settled by an OR algorithm. These two\nstages are performed iteratively and interactively until the termination\ncriterion has been met. Under this idea, two implementation versions of the\ncombination methods of RL and OR are put forward. The agile Earth observation\nsatellite scheduling problem is selected as an example to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheduling framework and methods. The convergence\nand generalization capability of the methods are verified by the performance of\ntraining scenarios, while the efficiency and accuracy are tested in 50\nuntrained scenarios. The results show that the proposed algorithms could stably\nand efficiently obtain satisfactory scheduling schemes for agile Earth\nobservation satellite scheduling problems. In addition, it can be found that\nRL-based optimization algorithms have stronger scalability than non-learning\nalgorithms. This work reveals the advantage of combining reinforcement learning\nmethods with heuristic methods or mathematical programming methods for solving\ncomplex combinatorial optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 03:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Due to the large onsite Coulomb\nrepulsion of 4f electrons, the bandwidth-control Mott-type delocalization,\ncommonly observed in d-electron systems, is difficult in 4f-electron systems\nand remains elusive in spectroscopic experiments. Here we demonstrate that the\nbandwidth-control orbital-selective delocalization of 4f electrons can be\nrealized in epitaxial Ce films by thermal annealing, which results in a\nmetastable surface phase with a reduced layer spacing. The resulting\nquasiparticle bands exhibit large dispersion with exclusive 4f character near\nE_F and extend reasonably far below the Fermi energy, which can be explained\nfrom the Mott physics. The experimental quasiparticle dispersion agrees\nsurprisingly well with density-functional theory calculation and also exhibits\nunusual temperature dependence, which could be a direct consequence of the\ndelicate interplay between the bandwidth-control Mott physics and the\ncoexisting Kondo hybridization.

The skew arises because the\nvariability of family sizes is either inherently strong or amplified by\npopulation expansions, leading to so-called `jackpot' events. The resulting\nallele frequency fluctuations are large and, therefore, challenge standard\nmodels of population genetics, which assume sufficiently narrow offspring\ndistributions. While the neutral dynamics backward in time can be readily\nanalyzed using coalescent approaches, we still know little about the effect of\nbroad offspring distributions on the dynamics forward in time, especially with\nselection. Here, we employ an exact asymptotic analysis combined with a scaling\nhypothesis to demonstrate that over-dispersed frequency trajectories emerge\nfrom the competition of conventional forces, such as selection or mutations,\nwith an emerging time-dependent sampling bias against the minor allele. The\nsampling bias arises from the characteristic time-dependence of the largest\nsampled family size within each allelic type. Using this insight, we establish\nsimple scaling relations for allele frequency fluctuations, fixation\nprobabilities, extinction times, and the site frequency spectra that arise when\noffspring numbers are distributed according to a power law $~n^{-(1+\\alpha)}$.\nTo demonstrate that this coarse-grained model captures a wide variety of\nnon-equilibrium dynamics, we validate our results in traveling waves, where the\nphenomenon of 'gene surfing' can produce any exponent $1<\\alpha <2$. We argue\nthat the concept of a dynamic sampling bias is useful generally to develop both\nintuition and statistical tests for the unusual dynamics of populations with\nskewed offspring distributions, which can confound commonly used tests for\nselection or demographic history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 03:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 19:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Among its applications, importance weights are central to domain\nadaptation, anomaly detection, and estimations of various divergences such as\nthe KL divergence. We consider the common setting where $R$ and $P$ are only\ngiven through samples from each distribution. The vast literature on estimating\nimportance weights is either heuristic, or makes strong assumptions about $R$\nand $P$ or on the importance weights themselves.\n  In this paper, we explore a computational perspective to the estimation of\nimportance weights, which factors in the limitations and possibilities\nobtainable with bounded computational resources. We significantly strengthen\nprevious work that use the MaxEntropy approach, that define the importance\nweights based on a distribution $Q$ closest to $P$, that looks the same as $R$\non every set $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$, where $\\mathcal{C}$ may be a huge collection\nof sets. We show that the MaxEntropy approach may fail to assign high average\nscores to sets $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$, even when the average of ground truth\nweights for the set is evidently large. We similarly show that it may\noverestimate the average scores to sets $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. We therefore\nformulate Sandwiching bounds as a notion of set-wise accuracy for importance\nweights. We study these bounds to show that they capture natural completeness\nand soundness requirements from the weights. We present an efficient algorithm\nthat under standard learnability assumptions computes weights which satisfy\nthese bounds. Our techniques rely on a new notion of multicalibrated partitions\nof the domain of the distributions, which appear to be useful objects in their\nown right.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 03:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Yet, nearly a decade later, no work to date\nhas sought consensus on these matters. Here, I offer a rapid review on the\nstate of the art and what is known about the impact of removing gamification. A\nsmall corpus of 8 papers published between 2012 and 2020 were found. Findings\nsuggest a mix of positive and negative effects related to removing\ngamification. Significantly, insufficient reporting, methodological weaknesses,\nlimited measures, and superficial interpretations of \"negative\" results prevent\nfirm conclusions.

It is partly because estimation of\neither covariance or precision matrix of asset returns tends to be unstable or\neven infeasible when the number of assets $p$ exceeds the number of\nobservations $n$. For this reason, most of the previous studies on portfolio\nmanagement have focused on the case of$ p < n$. To deal with the case of $p >\nn$, we propose to use a new Bayesian framework based on adaptive graphical\nLASSO for estimating the precision matrix of asset returns in a large-scale\nportfolio. Unlike the previous studies on graphical LASSO in the literature,\nour approach utilizes a Bayesian estimation method for the precision matrix\nproposed by Oya and Nakatsuma (2022) so that the positive definiteness of the\nprecision matrix should be always guaranteed. As an empirical application, we\nconstruct the global minimum variance portfolio of $p = 100$ for various values\nof n with the proposed approach as well as the non-Bayesian graphical LASSO\napproach, and compare their out-of-sample performance with the equal weight\nportfolio as the benchmark. In this comparison, the proposed approach produces\nmore stable results than the non-Bayesian approach in terms of Sharpe ratio,\nportfolio composition and turnover. Furthermore, the proposed approach succeeds\nin estimating the precision matrix even if $n$ is much smaller than $p$ and the\nnon-Bayesian approach fails to do so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 05:52:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 03:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 12:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 07:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

In this work, we propose a novel streaming algorithm, SGD with\nReverse Experience Replay ($\\mathsf{SGD}-\\mathsf{RER}$), that is inspired by\nthe experience replay (ER) technique popular in the RL literature.\n$\\mathsf{SGD}-\\mathsf{RER}$ divides data into small buffers and runs SGD\nbackwards on the data stored in the individual buffers. We show that this\nalgorithm exactly deconstructs the dependency structure and obtains information\ntheoretically optimal guarantees for both parameter error and prediction error.\nThus, we provide the first -- to the best of our knowledge -- optimal SGD-style\nalgorithm for the classical problem of linear system identification with a\nfirst order oracle. Furthermore, $\\mathsf{SGD}-\\mathsf{RER}$ can be applied to\nmore general settings like sparse LTI identification with known sparsity\npattern, and non-linear dynamical systems. Our work demonstrates that the\nknowledge of data dependency structure can aid us in designing statistically\nand computationally efficient algorithms which can \"decorrelate\" streaming\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 06:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 15:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 23:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

While the nominal\nmotion trajectory can be easily obtained from human demonstrations through\nkinesthetic teaching, teleoperation, simulation, among other methods, the force\nprofile is harder to obtain especially when a real robot is unavailable. It is\ndifficult to obtain a realistic force profile in simulation even with physics\nengines. Such simulated force profiles tend to be unsuitable for the actual\nrobotic assembly due to the reality gap and uncertainty in the assembly\nprocess. To address this problem, we present a combined learning-based\nframework to imitate human assembly skills through hybrid trajectory learning\nand force learning. The main contribution of this work is the development of a\nframework that combines hierarchical imitation learning, to learn the nominal\nmotion trajectory, with a reinforcement learning-based force control scheme to\nlearn an optimal force control policy, that can satisfy the nominal trajectory\nwhile adapting to the force requirement of the assembly task.

CNN has great\nadvantages in extracting local features of images. However, due to the locality\nof convolution operation, it can not deal with long-range relationships well.\nRecently, transformers have been applied to computer vision and achieved\nremarkable success in large-scale datasets. Compared with natural images,\nmulti-modal medical images have explicit and important long-range dependencies,\nand effective multi-modal fusion strategies can greatly improve the performance\nof deep models. This prompts us to study transformer-based structures and apply\nthem to multi-modal medical images. Existing transformer-based network\narchitectures require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance.\nHowever, medical imaging datasets are relatively small, which makes it\ndifficult to apply pure transformers to medical image analysis.

This new method allows using the distinguished\nproperties of the quantum mechanical systems -- superposition, entanglement and\nprobability calculations. Implementation of an algorithm based on this method\nrequires the creation of a new quantum logic gate, which creates entangled\nstate between two qubits. This is a two-qubit logic gate and it must perform a\npredefined rotation over the X-axis for the qubit that acts as a target, where\nthe rotation accurately represents the transient probabilities for a given\nMarkov process. This gate fires only when the control qubit is in state |1>. It\nis necessary to develop an algorithm, which uses the distribution for the\ntransient probabilities of the process in a simple and intuitive way and then\ntransform those into X-axis offsets. The creation of a quantum controlled n-th\nroot of X gate using only the existing basic quantum logic gates at the\navailable cloud platforms is possible, although the hardware devices are still\ntoo noisy, which results in a significant measurement error increase.

Recently, many generative model-based methods have been\nproposed for remote sensing image change detection on such unlabeled data.\nHowever, the high diversities in the learned features weaken the discrimination\nof the relevant change indicators in unsupervised change detection tasks.\nMoreover, these methods lack research on massive archived images. In this work,\na self-supervised change detection approach based on an unlabeled multi-view\nsetting is proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by the use of\na multi-view contrastive loss and an implicit contrastive strategy in the\nfeature alignment between multi-view images. In this approach, a pseudo-Siamese\nnetwork is trained to regress the output between its two branches pre-trained\nin a contrastive way on a large dataset of multi-temporal homogeneous or\nheterogeneous image patches. Finally, the feature distance between the outputs\nof the two branches is used to define a change measure, which can be analyzed\nby thresholding to get the final binary change map.

Recently, it was\npredicted that in the thermodynamic ($N\\rightarrow\\infty$) limit of large\nquantum many-body systems canonical density matrices emerge for small\nsubsystems from almost all pure states. This notion of canonical typicality is\nassumed to originate from the entanglement between subsystem and environment\nand the resulting intrinsic quantum complexity of the many-body state. For\nindividual eigenstates it has been shown that local observables show thermal\nproperties provided the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis holds, which\nrequires the system to be quantum chaotic. In the present paper, we study the\nemergence of thermal states in the regime of a quantum analog of a mixed phase\nspace. Specifically, we study the emergence of the canonical density matrix of\nan impurity upon reduction from isolated energy eigenstates of a large but\nfinite quantum system the impurity is embedded in. Our system can be tuned by\nmeans of a single parameter from quantum integrability to quantum chaos and\ncorresponds in between to a system with mixed quantum phase space. We show that\nthe probability for finding a canonical density matrix when reducing the\nensemble of energy eigenstates of the finite many-body system can be\nquantitatively controlled and tuned by the degree of quantum chaos present. For\nthe transition from quantum integrability to quantum chaos we find a continuous\nand universal (i.e. size independent) relation between the fraction of\ncanonical eigenstates and the degree of chaoticity as measured by the Brody\nparameter or the Shannon entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 10:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 19:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

For\nthis purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the intrinsic property and\nthe recognizability of the face image. Most previous works aim to estimate the\nsample-wise embedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score,\nwhich only considers the information from partial intra-class. However, these\nmethods ignore the valuable information from the inter-class, which is for\nestimating to the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a\nhigh-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and\ndissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised\nFIQA method that incorporates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image\nQuality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates quality pseudo-labels by\ncalculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class similarity\ndistributions and inter-class similarity distributions. With these quality\npseudo-labels, we are capable of training a regression network for quality\nprediction.

Existing studies rarely exploit\nauxiliary information from large amount of unlabeled data. Self-supervised\nlearning is emerged as an efficient method to utilize unlabeled data. Existing\nself-supervised learning methods always rely on the combination of geometric\ntransformations for the single sample by augmentation, while seriously neglect\nthe endogenous correlation information among different samples that is the same\nimportant for the task. In this work, we propose a Graph-driven Clustering\n(GC), a novel augmentation-free method for self-supervised learning, which does\nnot rely on any auxiliary sample and utilizes the endogenous correlation\ninformation among input samples. Besides, we propose Multi-pretext Attention\nNetwork (MAN), which exploits a specific attention mechanism to combine the\ntraditional augmentation-relied methods and our GC, adaptively learning their\noptimized weights to improve the performance and enabling the feature extractor\nto obtain more universal representations. We evaluate our MAN extensively on\nminiImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets and the results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) relevant methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 10:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

At last, we consider the applications of reduced Sombor index\nto octane isomers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 03:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

In addition, the Quality-Aware Module (QAM) is proposed to\nfuse the different quality information, the purpose of which is to estimate the\nquality of human parsing results. We combine QAM with a concise and effective\nnetwork design to propose Quality-Aware Network (QANet) for human parsing.\nBenefiting from the superiority of QAM and QANet, we achieve the best\nperformance on three multiple and one single human parsing benchmarks,\nincluding CIHP, MHP-v2, Pascal-Person-Part and LIP. Without increasing the\ntraining and inference time, QAM improves the AP$^\\text{r}$ criterion by more\nthan 10 points in the multiple human parsing task. QAM can be extended to other\ntasks with good quality estimation, e.g. instance segmentation. Specifically,\nQAM improves Mask R-CNN by ~1% mAP on COCO and LVISv1.0 datasets.

In these cases, standard cameras are being\npushed to their limits in terms of low light and high dynamic range\nperformance. To address these challenges, we propose, DSEC, a new dataset that\ncontains such demanding illumination conditions and provides a rich set of\nsensory data. DSEC offers data from a wide-baseline stereo setup of two color\nframe cameras and two high-resolution monochrome event cameras. In addition, we\ncollect lidar data and RTK GPS measurements, both hardware synchronized with\nall camera data. One of the distinctive features of this dataset is the\ninclusion of high-resolution event cameras.

In\nthis study, three robust feature extraction methods, Time-domain (TD) feature,\nFrequency Division Technique (FDT), and Autoregressive (AR) feature, and their\ncombinations were investigated while the number of channels varying from one to\neight. For these system parameters, the performance of sixteen static wrist and\nhand gestures was systematically investigated in two authentication modes:\nverification and identification. The results from 24 participants showed that\nthe TD features significantly (p<0.05) and consistently outperformed FDT and AR\nfeatures for all channel numbers. The results also showed that the performance\nof a four-channel setup was not significantly different from those with higher\nnumber of channels.

Most of the early algorithms are unsupervised methods, which\nuse hand-crafted features to divide the image into many regions. Recently,\nowing to the great success of deep learning technology, CNNs based methods show\nsuperior performance in image segmentation. However, these methods rely on a\nlarge number of human annotations, which are expensive to collect. In this\npaper, we propose a deep unsupervised method for image segmentation, which\ncontains the following two stages. First, a Superpixelwise Autoencoder\n(SuperAE) is designed to learn the deep embedding and reconstruct a smoothed\nimage, then the smoothed image is passed to generate superpixels. Second, we\npresent a novel clustering algorithm called Deep Superpixel Cut (DSC), which\nmeasures the deep similarity between superpixels and formulates image\nsegmentation as a soft partitioning problem. Via backpropagation, DSC\nadaptively partitions the superpixels into perceptual regions.

Prior work usually uses a three-stage\nstrategy to tackle this task: 1) extract the features of the inputs; 2) fuse\nthe feature of the source image and its modified text to obtain fusion feature;\n3) learn a similarity metric between the desired image and the source image +\nmodified text by using deep metric learning. Since classical image/text\nencoders can learn the useful representation and common pair-based loss\nfunctions of distance metric learning are enough for cross-modal retrieval,\npeople usually improve retrieval accuracy by designing new fusion networks.\nHowever, these methods do not successfully handle the modality gap caused by\nthe inconsistent distribution and representation of the features of different\nmodalities, which greatly influences the feature fusion and similarity\nlearning. To alleviate this problem, we adopt the contrastive self-supervised\nlearning method Deep InforMax (DIM) to our approach to bridge this gap by\nenhancing the dependence between the text, the image, and their fusion.\nSpecifically, our method narrows the modality gap between the text modality and\nthe image modality by maximizing mutual information between their not exactly\nsemantically identical representation. Moreover, we seek an effective common\nsubspace for the semantically same fusion feature and desired image's feature\nby utilizing Deep InforMax between the low-level layer of the image encoder and\nthe high-level layer of the fusion network.

Different from existing time-triggered communication schemes,\nan event-triggered asynchronous scheme is investigated in order to reduce\ncommunication while preserving estimation convergence. A distributed estimation\nalgorithm with a single step size is first proposed based on an event-triggered\ncommunication scheme with a time-dependent decaying threshold. With the\nevent-triggered scheme, each sensor sends its estimate to neighbor sensors only\nwhen the difference between the current estimate and the last sent-out estimate\nis larger than the triggering threshold. We prove that the proposed algorithm\nhas mean-square and almost-sure convergence respectively, under an integrated\ncondition of sensor network topology and sensor measurement matrices.

We show that given the step size, adjusting\nthe decay speed of the triggering threshold can lead to a tradeoff between the\nconvergence rate of the estimation error and the decay speed of the\ncommunication rate.

In turn, dust coagulation,\nfragmentation, and drift through the gas disk can contribute to the\nredistribution of volatiles between the ice and gas phases. Here we present the\nhydrodynamic model FEOSAD for protoplanetary disks with two dust populations\nand volatile dynamics. We compute the spatial distributions of major volatile\nmolecules (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO) in the gas, on small and grown dust,\nand analyze the composition of icy mantles over the initial 0.5 Myr of disk\nevolution. We show that most of ice arrives to the grown dust through\ncoagulation with small grains. Spiral structures and dust rings forming in the\ndisk, as well as photodissociation in the outer regions, lead to the formation\nof complex snowline shapes and multiple snowlines for each volatile species.\nDuring the considered disk evolution, the snowlines shift closer to the star,\nwith their final position being a factor $4-5$ smaller than that at the disk\nformation epoch. We demonstrate that volatiles tend to collect in the vicinity\nof their snowlines, both in the ice and gas phases, leading to the formation of\nthick icy mantles potentially important for dust dynamics. The dust size is\naffected by a lower fragmentation velocity of bare grains in the model with a\nhigher turbulent viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 13:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The detection of an extremely luminous radio burst from the Galactic\nmagnetar SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 added credence to this hypothesis. We\nreport on simultaneous and non-simultaneous observing campaigns using the\nArecibo, Effelsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2 and Northern Cross radio telescopes\nand the MeerLICHT optical telescope in the days and months after the April 28\nevent. We did not detect any significant single radio pulses down to fluence\nlimits between 25 mJy ms and 18 Jy ms. Some observing epochs overlapped with\ntimes when X-ray bursts were detected. Radio images made on four days using the\nMeerKAT telescope revealed no point-like persistent or transient emission at\nthe location of the magnetar. No transient or persistent optical emission was\ndetected over seven days. Using the multi-colour MeerLICHT images combined with\nrelations between DM, NH and reddening we constrain the distance to SGR\nJ1935+2154, to be between 1.5 and 6.5 kpc. The upper limit is consistent with\nsome other distance indicators and suggests that the April 28 burst is closer\nto two orders of magnitude less energetic than the least energetic FRBs. The\nlack of single-pulse radio detections shows that the single pulses detected\nover a range of fluences are either rare, or highly clustered, or both. It may\nalso indicate that the magnetar lies somewhere between being radio-quiet and\nradio-loud in terms of its ability to produce radio emission efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 13:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

In open shell transition\nelements chemistry and physics, 3d4, 3d9, and 3d7(low-spin) configurations in\noctahedral complexes serve as particular illustrative and firm examples, where\na striking change (distortion) in local geometry is associated to a substantial\nreduction of electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate, about\nthe fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate, (at least for eg\nelectrons). Against this background, the title compound displays two marked\nfeatures, (1) the octahedron of oxygen atoms around Os6+ (d2) is drastically\ncompressed, in contrast to the standard JT expectations, and (2) the splitting\nof the t2g set induced by this compression is extreme, such that a diamagnetic\nground state results. What we see is obviously a Jahn-Teller distortion\nresulting in a compression of the respective octahedron and acting on the t2g\nset of orbitals. Both these issues are unprecedented. Noteworthy, the splitting\ninto a lower dxy (hosting two d electrons with opposite spin) and two higher\ndxz and dyz orbitals is so large that for the first time ever the Hund's\ncoupling for t2g electrons is overcome. We show that these effects are not\nforced by structural frustration, the structure offers sufficient space for Os\nto shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. Local electronic\neffects appear to be responsible, instead. The relevance of these findings is\nfar reaching, since they provide insights in the hierarchy of perturbations\ndefining ground states of open shell electronic systems. The system studied\nhere, offers substantially more structural and compositional degrees of\nfreedom, such that a configuration could form that enables Os6+ to adopt its\napparently genuine diamagnetic ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

In these representations, data\nare encoded with various visual attributes depending on the needs of the\nrepresentation itself. To make coherent design choices about visual attributes,\nthe visual search field proposes guidelines based on the human brain perception\nof features. However, information visualization representations frequently need\nto depict more data than the amount these guidelines have been validated on.\nSince, the information visualization community has extended these guidelines to\na wider parameter space.\n  This paper contributes to this theme by extending visual search theories to\nan information visualization context. We consider a visual search task where\nsubjects are asked to find an unknown outlier in a grid of randomly laid out\ndistractor. Stimuli are defined by color and shape features for the purpose of\nvisually encoding categorical data. The experimental protocol is made of a\nparameters space reduction step (i.e., sub-sampling) based on a machine\nlearning model, and a user evaluation to measure capacity limits and validate\nhypotheses. The results show that the major difficulty factor is the number of\nvisual attributes that are used to encode the outlier. When redundantly\nencoded, the display heterogeneity has no effect on the task. When encoded with\none attribute, the difficulty depends on that attribute heterogeneity until its\ncapacity limit (7 for color, 5 for shape) is reached. Finally, when encoded\nwith two attributes simultaneously, performances drop drastically even with\nminor heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

We study the effect APIs with\nblindspots have on developers in two languages by replicating an 109-developer,\n24-Java-API controlled experiment. Our replication applies to Python and\ninvolves 129 new developers and 22 new APIs. We find that using APIs with\nblindspots statistically significantly reduces the developers' ability to\ncorrectly reason about the APIs in both languages, but that the effect is more\npronounced for Python. Interestingly, for Java, the effect increased with\ncomplexity of the code relying on the API, whereas for Python, the opposite was\ntrue. Whether the developers considered API uses to be more difficult, less\nclear, and less familiar did not have an effect on their ability to correctly\nreason about them. Developers with better long-term memory recall were more\nlikely to correctly reason about APIs with blindspots, but short-term memory,\nprocessing speed, episodic memory, and memory span had no effect. Surprisingly,\nprofessional experience and expertice did not improve the developers' ability\nto reason about APIs with blindspots across both languages, with long-term\nprofessionals with many years of experience making mistakes as often as\nrelative novices. Finally, personality traits did not significantly affect the\nPython developers' ability to reason about APIs with blindspots, but less\nextraverted and more open developers were better at reasoning about Java APIs\nwith blindspots. Overall, our findings suggest that blindspots in APIs are a\nserious problem across languages, and that experience and education alone do\nnot overcome that problem, suggesting that tools are needed to help developers\nrecognize blindspots in APIs as they write code that uses those APIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Your goal is to minimize the\nnumber of vertices needing this expensive paint. This paper address the issues\nsurrounding your choices. In particular, a graph is said to be\n$d$-distinguishable if there exists a coloring with $d$ colors so that only the\ntrivial automorphism preserves the color classes. The distinguishing number of\n$G$, denoted ${\\rm Dist}(G)$, is the smallest $d$ for which $G$ is\n$d$-distinguishable. We define the -paint cost of $d$-distinguishing, denoted\n$\\rho^d(G)$, to be the minimum number of vertices that need to be painted to\n$d$-distinguish $G$. This cost varies with $d$. The maximum paint cost for $G$\nis called the upper paint cost, denoted $\\rho^u(G)$, and occurs when $d={\\rm\nDist}(G)$; the minimum paint cost is called the lower paint cost, denoted\n$\\rho^\\ell(G)$. Further, we define the smallest $d$ for which the paint cost is\n$\\rho^\\ell(G)$, to be the frugal distinguishing number, ${\\rm Fdist}(G)$.

In this case, a user and item\nmatch better if they have higher similarity in that common space. Matching\nfunction learning tries to directly learn the complex matching function that\nmaps user-item pairs to matching scores. Although both methods are well\ndeveloped, they suffer from two fundamental flaws, i.e., the representation\nlearning resorts to applying a dot product which has limited expressiveness on\nthe latent features of users and items, while the matching function learning\nhas weakness in capturing low-rank relations.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a spatial\nattention-based perceptual quality prediction network for non-reference quality\nassessment on ODIs (SAP-net). To drive our SAP-net, we establish a large-scale\nIQA dataset of ODIs (IQA-ODI), which is composed of subjective scores of 200\nsubjects on 1,080 ODIs. In IQA-ODI, there are 120 high quality ODIs as\nreference, and 960 ODIs with impairments in both JPEG compression and map\nprojection. Without any human saliency labels, our network can adaptively\nestimate human perceptual quality on impaired ODIs through a self-attention\nmanner, which significantly promotes the prediction performance of quality\nscores.

Disease transmission is also\nforecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over\nspace and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such\nas wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage\nstochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic\nindividuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as\nventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and\ndeceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into\nthe multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted\nexpected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with\nexperiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios.

Our Meta-learning\nstrategy operates by finding optimal parameters for the BCI decoder so that it\ncan quickly generalise between different users and recording sessions --\nthereby also generalising to new users or new sessions quickly. We tested our\nalgorithm on the Physionet EEG motor imagery dataset. Our approach increased\nmotor imagery classification accuracy between 60% to 80%, outperforming other\nalgorithms under the little-data condition. We believe that establishing the\nmeta-learning or learning-to-learn approach will help neural engineering and\nhuman interfacing with the challenges of quickly setting up decoders of neural\nsignals to make them more suitable for daily-life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 01:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

To this end, recent efforts in AI fairness and inclusion have advocated\nfor creating AI data sets that are well-balanced across race, gender,\nsocioeconomic status, and disability status. In this paper, we contribute to\nthis line of work by focusing on the representation of age by asking whether\nolder adults are represented proportionally to the population at large in AI\ndata sets. We examine publicly-available information about 92 face data sets to\nunderstand how they codify age as a case study to investigate how the subjects'\nages are recorded and whether older generations are represented. We find that\nolder adults are very under-represented; five data sets in the study that\nexplicitly documented the closed age intervals of their subjects included older\nadults (defined as older than 65 years), while only one included oldest-old\nadults (defined as older than 85 years). Additionally, we find that only 24 of\nthe data sets include any age-related information in their documentation or\nmetadata, and that there is no consistent method followed across these data\nsets to collect and record the subjects' ages. We recognize the unique\ndifficulties in creating representative data sets in terms of age, but raise it\nas an important dimension that researchers and engineers interested in\ninclusive AI should consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 12:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 04:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

But the standard TCP's performance is very poor in High Speed\nNetworks (HSN) and hence the core gigabytes links are usually underutilization.\nThis problem has roots in conservative nature of TCP, especially in its\nAdditive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) phase. In other words, since\nTCP can't figure out precisely the congestion status of the network, it follows\na conservative strategy to keep the network from overwhelming. We believe that\nprecisely congestion estimation in the network can solve this problem by\navoiding unnecessary conservation. To this end, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm which considers packet loss and delay information jointly and employs\na probabilistic approach to accurately estimation of congestion status in the\nnetwork. To examine the proposed scheme performance, extensive simulations have\nbeen performed in the NS-2 environment. Simulation results reveal that the\nproposed algorithm has better performance than existing algorithms in terms of\nbottleneck utilization, stability, throughput and fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 20:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

However, it is difficult to use graphs to\ncapture non-binary relations such as communities of nodes. These kinds of\ncomplex relations are expressed more naturally as hypergraphs. While\nhypergraphs are a generalization of graphs, state-of-the-art graph embedding\ntechniques are not adequate for solving prediction and classification tasks on\nlarge hypergraphs accurately in reasonable time. In this paper, we introduce\nHyperNetVec, a novel hierarchical framework for scalable unsupervised\nhypergraph embedding. HyperNetVec exploits shared-memory parallelism and is\ncapable of generating high quality embeddings for real-world hypergraphs with\nmillions of nodes and hyperedges in only a couple of minutes while existing\nhypergraph systems either fail for such large hypergraphs or may take days to\nproduce the embeddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 18:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 20:41:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 18:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 04:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 21:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

The algorithm overcomes a limitation of\nexisting multi-spike learning methods: it solves the problem of interference\nbetween interacting output spikes during a learning trial. This problem of\nlearning interference causes learning performance in existing approaches to\ndecrease as the number of output spikes increases, and represents an important\nlimitation in existing multi-spike learning approaches. We address learning\ninterference by introducing a novel mechanism to balance the magnitudes of\nweight adjustments during learning, which in theory allows every spike to\nsimultaneously converge to their desired timings. Our results indicate that our\nmethod achieves significantly higher memory capacity and faster convergence\ncompared to existing approaches for multi-spike classification.
