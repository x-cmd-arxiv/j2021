To this\nend, computer-aided techniques have been proposed to delineate relevant regions\nin scanned histology slides. However, the techniques necessitate task-specific\nlarge datasets of annotated pixels, which is tedious, time-consuming,\nexpensive, and infeasible to acquire for many histology tasks. Thus,\nweakly-supervised semantic segmentation techniques are proposed to utilize weak\nsupervision that is cheaper and quicker to acquire. In this paper, we propose\nSegGini, a weakly supervised segmentation method using graphs, that can utilize\nweak multiplex annotations, i.e. inexact and incomplete annotations, to segment\narbitrary and large images, scaling from tissue microarray (TMA) to whole slide\nimage (WSI). Formally, SegGini constructs a tissue-graph representation for an\ninput histology image, where the graph nodes depict tissue regions. Then, it\nperforms weakly-supervised segmentation via node classification by using\ninexact image-level labels, incomplete scribbles, or both. We evaluated SegGini\non two public prostate cancer datasets containing TMAs and WSIs. Our method\nachieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance on both datasets for various\nannotation settings while being comparable to a pathologist baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 16:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

Recent\nadvances in transfer and contrastive learning have provided effective solutions\nto tackle such issues from different perspectives. The state-of-the-art\ntransfer learning (e.g., Big Transfer (BiT)) and contrastive learning (e.g.,\nSimple Siamese Contrastive Learning (SimSiam)) approaches have been\ninvestigated independently, without considering the complementary nature of\nsuch techniques. It would be appealing to accelerate contrastive learning with\ntransfer learning, given that slow convergence speed is a critical limitation\nof modern contrastive learning approaches. In this paper, we investigate the\nfeasibility of aligning BiT with SimSiam. From empirical analyses, different\nnormalization techniques (Group Norm in BiT vs. Batch Norm in SimSiam) are the\nkey hurdle of adapting BiT to SimSiam. When combining BiT with SimSiam, we\nevaluated the performance of using BiT, SimSiam, and BiT+SimSiam on CIFAR-10\nand HAM10000 datasets. The results suggest that the BiT models accelerate the\nconvergence speed of SimSiam. When used together, the model gives superior\nperformance over both of its counterparts. We hope this study will motivate\nresearchers to revisit the task of aggregating big pre-trained models with\ncontrastive learning models for image analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 17:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

This process is mainly governed by the communication\ntopology of the underlying parallel code. This paper makes significant\ncontributions to the understanding of idle wave dynamics. We study the\npropagation mechanisms of idle waves across the ranks of MPI-parallel programs.\nWe present a validated analytic model for their propagation velocity with\nrespect to communication parameters and topology, with a special emphasis on\nsparse communication patterns. We study the interaction of idle waves with MPI\ncollectives and show that, depending on the implementation, a collective may be\ntransparent to the wave. Finally we analyze two mechanisms of idle wave decay:\ntopological decay, which is rooted in differences in communication\ncharacteristics among parts of the system, and noise-induced decay, which is\ncaused by system or application noise. We show that noise-induced decay is\nlargely independent of noise characteristics but depends only on the overall\nnoise power. An analytic expression for idle wave decay rate with respect to\nnoise power is derived. For model validation we use microbenchmarks and stencil\nalgorithms on three different supercomputing platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 17:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

This paper presents a probabilistic deep learning\nordinal classification method that can estimate the GS from a prostate WSI.\nApproaching the problem as an ordinal regression task using a differentiable\nprobabilistic model not only improves the interpretability of the results, but\nalso improves the accuracy of the model when compared to conventional deep\nclassification and regression architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 17:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

Every ECTFF is a type of\noptimal Grassmannian code, being a way to arrange a given number of members of\na Grassmannian so that the minimal chordal distance between any pair of them is\nas large as possible. Any nontrivial ECTFF has both a Naimark complement and\nspatial complement which themselves are ECTFFs. It turns out that whenever the\nnumber of subspaces is at least five, taking iterated alternating Naimark and\nspatial complements of one ECTFF yields an infinite family of them with\ndistinct parameters. This makes it challenging to certify the novelty of any\nrecently discovered ECTFF: how can one guarantee that it does not arise from\nany previously known construction in such a Naimark-spatial way? In this paper,\nwe propose a solution to this problem, showing that any ECTFF is a member of a\nNaimark-spatial family originating from either a trivial ECTFF or one with\nunique \"minimal\" parameters. In the latter case, if its minimal parameters do\nnot match those of any previously known ECTFF, it is certifiably new. As a\nproof of concept, we then use these ideas to certify the novelty of some ECTFFs\narising from a new method for constructing them from difference families for\nfinite abelian groups.

Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate\nand challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other\nareas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to\nrigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an\nalgorithm. Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job.\nThe lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal\nstatutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages,\nmakes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a\ngiven text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software,\nthe use of informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce\nCatala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a\nstraightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable\nimplementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a\nshared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a\ngap that often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We\nhave implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its\ncore compilation steps using the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on\nseveral legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the\nUS federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we\nuncover a bug in the official implementation.

We\nshow that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong,\nspecialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images,\npoint clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance\ncomparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly\nattending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in\nAudioSet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 18:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Despite a surge of\ninterest in lifelong RL in recent years, the lack of a realistic testbed makes\nrobust evaluation of LLL algorithms difficult. Multi-agent RL (MARL), on the\nother hand, can be seen as a natural scenario for lifelong RL due to its\ninherent non-stationarity, since the agents' policies change over time. In this\nwork, we introduce a multi-agent lifelong learning testbed that supports both\nzero-shot and few-shot settings. Our setup is based on Hanabi -- a\npartially-observable, fully cooperative multi-agent game that has been shown to\nbe challenging for zero-shot coordination. Its large strategy space makes it a\ndesirable environment for lifelong RL tasks. We evaluate several recent MARL\nmethods, and benchmark state-of-the-art LLL algorithms in limited memory and\ncomputation regimes to shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. This\ncontinual learning paradigm also provides us with a pragmatic way of going\nbeyond centralized training which is the most commonly used training protocol\nin MARL.

The\nastrophysical motivation for choosing such a field is the possibility to\nconstitute a reasonable model for an actual situation occurring in the objects'\nvicinity. To test the role of large-scale magnetic fields in accretion\nprocesses, we start by analyzing different bound orbits of timelike orbits\nunder the influence of the system's different parameters. This leads to\nexamining their stability concerning radial and/or vertical oscillations. The\nmain focus is to discuss the effect of magnetic field on the oscillation modes'\nresonant phenomena using different resonant models for disc-oscillation modes.\nIn the present contribution, we further explore the possibility of relating\noscillatory frequencies of charged particles to the frequencies of the\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the microquasars GRS\n1915+105, XTE 1550-564 and GRO 1655-40 via assuming the relevance of resonant\nphenomena of the radial and vertical oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 18:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 12:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

In this work, we bring compact neural\nrepresentations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time\napplications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of\nsamples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples\nare placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To\nthis end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations\nfor each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a\nclassification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically\nwarped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than\ndirectly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,\nour compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step\nand a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we\nreduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on\navailable ground truth depth information.

We show that breaking an overlooked local-in-momentum space\n$\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of a Fermi liquid does precisely this. As a result,\nwhile the Mott transition from a Fermi liquid is correctly believed to obtain\nwithout the breaking of any continuous symmetry, a discrete symmetry is broken.\nThis symmetry breaking serves as an organizing principle for Mott physics\nwhether it arises from the tractable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model or the\nintractable Hubbard model. That both are controlled by the same fixed point we\nestablish through a renormalization group analysis. An experimental\nmanifestation of this fixed point is the onset of particle-hole asymmetry, a\nwidely observed phenomenon in strongly correlated systems. Theoretically, the\nsingly-occupied region of the spectrum gives rise to a surface of zeros of the\nsingle-particle Green function, denoted as the Luttinger surface. Using\nK-homology, we show that the Bott topological invariant guarantees the\nstability of this surface to local perturbations. Our proof demonstrates that\nthe strongly coupled fixed point only corresponds to those Luttinger surfaces\nwith co-dimension $p+1$ with $p$ odd.

This area of research is encountered in many\napplications such as passive radar, sonar, mining, and communication problems,\nin which an increasing attention has been devoted to improving the estimation\naccuracy and robustness to noise. By the development of super-resolution\nalgorithms, narrowband direction of arrival estimation based on gridless sparse\nalgorithms and atomic norm minimization has already been addressed. In this\npaper, a superresolution based method is proposed for coherent direction of\narrival estimation of multiple wideband sources.

Then, we introduce an\natomic norm problem by defining a new set of atoms and exploiting the signal\njoint sparsity of different frequency subbands in a continuous spatial domain.\nThis problem is then cast as a semidefinite program, which leads to\nimplementing a new coherent direction of arrival estimation method with higher\nresolution and more robustness to noise.

We confirm the\npresence of a stellar kinematically distinct core with a diameter of 2.8 kpc,\ncounter-rotating with respect to the main stellar body of the galaxy. We find\nthat the counter-rotating core consists of an old stellar population, not\nsignificantly different from the rest of the galaxy. The ionised gas is\nstrongly warped and extends out to 6.5 kpc in the polar direction and in a\nfilamentary structure. The gas dynamics is complex, with significant changes in\nthe position angle as a function of radius. The ionised gas line ratios are\nconsistent with LINER excitation by the AGN both in the nucleus and at\nkiloparsec scales. We discover a nuclear outflow with projected velocity V ~\n400 km/s, consistent with a hollow outflow cone intersecting the plan of the\nsky. The properties of the misaligned gas match predictions from numerical\nsimulations of misaligned gas infall after a gas-rich merger. The warp and\nchange in the gas orientation as a function of radius are consistent with gas\nrelaxation due to stellar torques, that are stronger at small radii where the\ngas aligns faster than in the outer regions, driving gas to the nucleus. The\nstellar and gas dynamics indicate that NGC 5077 has had at least two external\ninteractions, one that resulted in the formation of the counter-rotating core\nfollowed by late time external gas accretion.

Credit networks arise naturally in many\nfinancial systems, including the recent construct of payment channel networks\nin blockchain systems. An important performance metric for these networks is\ntheir transaction throughput. However, predicting the throughput of a credit\nnetwork is nontrivial. Unlike traditional communication channels, credit\nchannels can become imbalanced; they are unable to support more transactions in\na given direction once the credit limit has been reached. This potential for\nimbalance creates a complex dependency between a network's throughput and its\ntopology, path choices, and the credit balances (state) on every channel.

The number of astronomical objects identified at\nz>6 has increased dramatically over the last few years, but previously only\nthree radio-loud (R2500>10) sources had been reported at z>6, with the most\ndistant being a quasar at z=6.18. Here we present the discovery and\ncharacterization of P172+18, a radio-loud quasar at z=6.823. This source has an\nMgII-based black hole mass of ~3x10^8 Msun and is one of the fastest accreting\nquasars, consistent with super-Eddington accretion. The ionized region around\nthe quasar is among the largest measured at these redshifts, implying an active\nphase longer than the average lifetime of the z>6 quasar population. From\narchival data, there is evidence that its 1.4 GHz emission has decreased by a\nfactor of two over the last two decades. The quasar's radio spectrum between\n1.4 and 3.0 GHz is steep (alpha=-1.31) and has a radio-loudness parameter\nR2500~90. A second steep radio source (alpha=-0.83) of comparable brightness to\nthe quasar is only 23.1\" away (~120 kpc at z=6.82; projection probability <2%),\nbut shows no optical or near-infrared counterpart. Further follow-up is\nrequired to establish whether these two sources are physically associated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 20:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

We\nintroduce a new approach for solving computationally-demanding stochastic\noptimal stopping problems with known probability distributions. The approach\nuses simulation to construct a robust optimization problem that approximates\nthe stochastic optimal stopping problem to any arbitrary accuracy; we then\nsolve the robust optimization problem to obtain near-optimal Markovian stopping\nrules for the stochastic optimal stopping problem.\n  In this paper, we focus on designing algorithms for solving the robust\noptimization problems that approximate the stochastic optimal stopping\nproblems. These robust optimization problems are challenging to solve because\nthey require optimizing over the infinite-dimensional space of all Markovian\nstopping rules. We overcome this challenge by characterizing the structure of\noptimal Markovian stopping rules for the robust optimization problems. In\nparticular, we show that optimal Markovian stopping rules for the robust\noptimization problems have a structure that is surprisingly simple and\nfinite-dimensional. We leverage this structure to develop an exact\nreformulation of the robust optimization problem as a zero-one bilinear program\nover totally unimodular constraints. We show that the bilinear program can be\nsolved in polynomial time in special cases, establish computational complexity\nresults for general cases, and develop polynomial-time heuristics by relating\nthe bilinear program to the maximal closure problem from graph theory.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms for solving the robust\noptimization problems are practical and can outperform state-of-the-art\nsimulation-based algorithms in the context of widely-studied stochastic optimal\nstopping problems from high-dimensional option pricing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 20:16:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 01:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 13:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The GHP\nis then used as a tool to analyze the fine asymptotic behavior for large times.\nFor initial data that satisfy the same integral condition, we prove that the\ncorresponding solutions behave like the Barenblatt with the same mass,\nuniformly in relative error.\n  When the integral tail condition is not satisfied we show that both the GHP\nand the uniform convergence in relative error, do not hold anymore, and we\nprovide also explicit counterexamples. We then prove a \"generalized GHP\", that\nis, pointwise upper and lower bounds in terms of explicit profiles with a tail\ndifferent from $\\mathcal{B}$. Finally, we derive sharp global quantitative\nupper bounds of the modulus of the gradient of the solution, and, when data are\nradially decreasing, we show uniform convergence in relative error for the\ngradients.\n  To the best of our knowledge, analogous issues for the linear heat equation\n$p=2$, do not possess such clear answers, only partial results are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 20:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

It relies on a space-filling curve to create\nequally sized subproblems and to determine a certain overlap based on the\none-dimensional ordering of the space-filling curve. Furthermore we employ\nagglomeration and a purely algebraic Galerkin discretization in the\nconstruction of the coarse problem. This way, the use of $d$-dimensional\ngeometric information is avoided. The subproblems are dealt with in an\nadditive, parallel way, which gives rise to a subspace correction type linear\niteration and a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method. To make the\nalgorithm fault-tolerant we store on each processor, besides the data of the\nassociated subproblem, a copy of the coarse problem and also the data of a\nfixed amount of neighboring subproblems with respect to the one-dimensional\nordering of the subproblems induced by the space-filling curve. This redundancy\nthen allows to restore the necessary data if processors fail during the\ncomputation. Theory supports that the convergence rate of such a linear\niteration method stays the same in expectation, and only its order constant\ndeteriorates slightly due to the faults. We observe this in numerical\nexperiments for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method in slightly weaker\nform as well. Altogether, we obtain a fault-tolerant, parallel and efficient\ndomain decomposition method based on space-filling curves which is especially\nsuited for higher-dimensional elliptic problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 20:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

Training GCN requires the minibatch generator\ntraversing graphs and sampling the sparsely located neighboring nodes to obtain\ntheir features. Since real-world graphs often exceed the capacity of GPU\nmemory, current GCN training systems keep the feature table in host memory and\nrely on the CPU to collect sparse features before sending them to the GPUs.\nThis approach, however, puts tremendous pressure on host memory bandwidth and\nthe CPU. This is because the CPU needs to (1) read sparse features from memory,\n(2) write features into memory as a dense format, and (3) transfer the features\nfrom memory to the GPUs. In this work, we propose a novel GPU-oriented data\ncommunication approach for GCN training, where GPU threads directly access\nsparse features in host memory through zero-copy accesses without much CPU\nhelp. By removing the CPU gathering stage, our method significantly reduces the\nconsumption of the host resources and data access latency. We further present\ntwo important techniques to achieve high host memory access efficiency by the\nGPU: (1) automatic data access address alignment to maximize PCIe packet\nefficiency, and (2) asynchronous zero-copy access and kernel execution to fully\noverlap data transfer with training. We incorporate our method into PyTorch and\nevaluate its effectiveness using several graphs with sizes up to 111 million\nnodes and 1.6 billion edges.

Previous work has shown that DNNs have bugs. Unfortunately, existing\ndebugging techniques do not support localizing DNN bugs because of the lack of\nunderstanding of model behaviors. The entire DNN model appears as a black box.\nTo address these problems, we propose an approach that automatically determines\nwhether the model is buggy or not, and identifies the root causes. Our key\ninsight is that historic trends in values propagated between layers can be\nanalyzed to identify faults, and localize faults. To that end, we first enable\ndynamic analysis of deep learning applications: by converting it into an\nimperative representation and alternatively using a callback mechanism. Both\nmechanisms allows us to insert probes that enable dynamic analysis over the\ntraces produced by the DNN while it is being trained on the training data. We\nthen conduct dynamic analysis over the traces to identify the faulty layer that\ncauses the error. We propose an algorithm for identifying root causes by\ncapturing any numerical error and monitoring the model during training and\nfinding the relevance of every layer on the DNN outcome. We have collected a\nbenchmark containing 40 buggy models and patches that contain real errors in\ndeep learning applications from Stack Overflow and GitHub. Our benchmark can be\nused to evaluate automated debugging tools and repair techniques. We have\nevaluated our approach using this DNN bug-and-patch benchmark, and the results\nshowed that our approach is much more effective than the existing debugging\napproach used in the state of the practice Keras library. For 34 out of 40\ncases, our approach was able to detect faults whereas the best debugging\napproach provided by Keras detected 32 out of 40 faults. Our approach was able\nto localize 21 out of 40 bugs whereas Keras did not localize any faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 23:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

In a\nregression setting, we showcase the ability of our method to make accurate\npredictions of DFT calculated bandgaps of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite\nmaterials. We further demonstrate the benefits that Gemini provides to\nautonomous workflows by augmenting the Bayesian optimizer Phoenics to yeild a\nscalable optimization framework leveraging multiple sources of measurement.\nFinally, we simulate an autonomous materials discovery platform for optimizing\nthe activity of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Realizing\nautonomous workflows with Gemini, we show that the number of measurements of a\ncomposition space comprising expensive and rare metals needed to achieve a\ntarget overpotential is significantly reduced when measurements from a proxy\ncomposition system with less expensive metals are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 00:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

However, in practice, buyers may be limited by their\ncomputational capabilities or a lack of information, and may not be able to\nperfectly optimize. This has motivated the introduction of approximate\nincentive compatibility (IC) as an appealing solution concept for practical\nmechanism design. While most of the literature focuses on the analysis of\nparticular approximate IC mechanisms, this paper is the first to study the\ndesign of optimal mechanisms in the space of approximate IC mechanisms and to\nexplore how much revenue can be garnered by moving from exact to approximate\nincentive constraints. We study the problem of a seller facing one buyer with\nprivate values and analyze optimal selling mechanisms under\n$\\varepsilon$-incentive compatibility. We establish that the gains that can be\ngarnered depend on the local curvature of the seller's revenue function around\nthe optimal posted price when the buyer is a perfect optimizer. If the revenue\nfunction behaves locally like an $\\alpha$-power for $\\alpha \\in (1,\\infty)$,\nthen no mechanism can garner gains higher than order\n$\\varepsilon^{\\alpha/(2\\alpha-1)}$. This improves upon state-of-the-art results\nwhich imply maximum gains of $\\varepsilon^{1/2}$ by providing the first\nparametric bounds that capture the impact of revenue function's curvature on\nrevenue gains. Furthermore, we establish that an optimal mechanism needs to\nrandomize as soon as $\\varepsilon>0$ and construct a randomized mechanism that\nis guaranteed to achieve order $\\varepsilon^{\\alpha/(2\\alpha-1)}$ additional\nrevenues, leading to a tight characterization of the revenue implications of\napproximate IC constraints.

The vast majority of existing works assume that\ngenuine node labels are always provided for training. However, there has been\nvery little research effort on how to improve the robustness of GNNs in the\npresence of label noise. Learning with label noise has been primarily studied\nin the context of image classification, but these techniques cannot be directly\napplied to graph-structured data, due to two major challenges -- label sparsity\nand label dependency -- faced by learning on graphs. In this paper, we propose\na new framework, UnionNET, for learning with noisy labels on graphs under a\nsemi-supervised setting. Our approach provides a unified solution for robustly\ntraining GNNs and performing label correction simultaneously. The key idea is\nto perform label aggregation to estimate node-level class probability\ndistributions, which are used to guide sample reweighting and label correction.\nCompared with existing works, UnionNET has two appealing advantages. First, it\nrequires no extra clean supervision, or explicit estimation of the noise\ntransition matrix. Second, a unified learning framework is proposed to robustly\ntrain GNNs in an end-to-end manner.

Interestingly, when recognizing unseen images,\nhuman would also automatically gaze at regions with certain semantic clue.\nTherefore, we introduce a novel goal-oriented gaze estimation module (GEM) to\nimprove the discriminative attribute localization based on the class-level\nattributes for ZSL.

The effects of sector-coupling\nare significant, boosting VRE generation by 12-55% with both increased\ncapacities and reduced curtailments and reducing the total system cost (or\nlevelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization scenarios. Both\nthe cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with\nH$_2$ demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization\nscenario as H$_2$ demand quadraples. Moreover, we found that the deployment of\ncarbon capture and storage is more cost-effective in the H$_2$ sector because\nof the lower cost and higher utilization rate. These findings highlight the\nimportance of using an integrated multi-sector energy system framework with\nmultiple energy vectors in planning energy system decarbonization pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 02:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

To deal with this issue, we propose a progressive\nself-supervised attention learning approach for attentional ABSA models. In\nthis approach, we iteratively perform sentiment prediction on all training\ninstances, and continually learn useful attention supervision information in\nthe meantime.

To promote categorical domain adaptation (CatDA), based on a joint\ncategory-domain classifier, we propose novel losses of adversarial training at\nboth domain and category levels. Since the joint classifier can be regarded as\na concatenation of individual task classifiers respectively for the two\ndomains, our design principle is to enforce consistency of category predictions\nbetween the two task classifiers. Moreover, we propose a concept of vicinal\ndomains whose instances are produced by a convex combination of pairs of\ninstances respectively from the two domains.

With\nthe advent of high throughput experiments and in the age of big data,\ndata-driven methods are on the rise to overcome these challenges. To directly\nuncover the underlying physical principles, we present a data-driven method for\nobtaining the phase-space density such that the solution to the stochastic\ndynamic equation for active matter readily emerges, from which time and space\ndependence of physical order parameters can be readily extracted. If the system\nis near a steady state, we illuminate how to construct a field theory to\nsubsequently make physical predictions about the system. The method is first\ndeveloped analytically and subsequently calibrated using simulated data. The\nmethod is then applied to an experimental system of particles actively driven\nby a {\\it Serratia marcescens} bacterial swarm and in the presence of spatially\nlocalized UV light. The analysis demonstrates that the particles are in the\nsteady-state before and sometime after the UV light and obey a Gaussian field\ntheory with a spatially-varying \"mass\" in those regimes. This novel, yet\nsimple, finding is surprising given the complex dynamics of the bacterial\nswarm. In response to the UV light, we demonstrate that there is a net flow of\nthe particles away from the UV light and that the entropy of the particles\nincreases away from the light. We conclude with a discussion of additional\npotential applications of our data-driven method such as when the internal\nstructure of the individual constituents dynamically changes to result in a\nmodified stochastic dynamic equation governing the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 03:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 21:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Standard practice divides the brain into regions of interest (ROIs)\nand represents the connectome as an adjacency matrix having cells measuring\nconnectivity between pairs of ROIs. Statistical analyses are then heavily\ndriven by the (largely arbitrary) choice of ROIs. In this article, we propose a\nnovel tractography-based representation of brain connectomes, which clusters\nfiber endpoints to define a data adaptive parcellation targeted to explain\nvariation among individuals and predict human traits. This representation leads\nto Principal Parcellation Analysis (PPA), representing individual brain\nconnectomes by compositional vectors building on a basis system of fiber\nbundles that captures the connectivity at the population level. PPA reduces\nsubjectivity and facilitates statistical analyses. We illustrate the proposed\napproach through applications to data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP)\nand show that PPA connectomes improve power in predicting human traits over\nstate-of-the-art methods based on classical connectomes, while dramatically\nimproving parsimony and maintaining interpretability.

Whereas the classification of such compounds can be illustrated by\ndifferent spin-splitting prototypes (SSTs) from symmetry analysis and density\nfunctional theory calculations, the significant variation in bonding and\nstructure of these diverse compounds representing different SSTs clouds the\nissue of how much of the variation in spin splitting can be traced back to the\nsymmetry-defined characteristics, rather to the underlining chemical and\nstructural diversity. The alternative model Hamiltonian approaches do not\nconfront the issues of chemical and structural complexity, but often consider\nonly the magnetic sublattice, dealing with the all-important effects of the\nnon-magnetic ligands via renormalizing the interactions between the magnetic\nsites. To this end we constructed a 'DFT model Hamiltonian' that allows us to\nstudy SSTs at approximate 'constant chemistry', while retaining the realistic\natomic scale structure including ligands. This is accomplished by using a\nsingle, universal magnetic skeletal lattice (Ni2+ ions in Rocksalt NiO) and\ndesigning small displacements of the non-magnetic (oxygen) sublattice which\nproduce, by design, the different SSTs magnetic symmetries. We show that (i)\neven similar crystal structures having very similar band structures can lead to\ncontrasting behavior of spin splitting vs. momentum, and (ii) even subtle\ndeformations of the non-magnetic ligand sublattice could cause a giant spin\nsplitting in AFM-induced SST.

This effect causes harmful bias that misleads the attention module to\nfocus on the spurious correlations in training data, damaging the model\ngeneralization. As the confounder is unobserved in general, we use the\nfront-door adjustment to realize the causal intervention, which does not\nrequire any knowledge on the confounder. Specifically, CATT is implemented as a\ncombination of 1) In-Sample Attention (IS-ATT) and 2) Cross-Sample Attention\n(CS-ATT), where the latter forcibly brings other samples into every IS-ATT,\nmimicking the causal intervention. CATT abides by the Q-K-V convention and\nhence can replace any attention module such as top-down attention and\nself-attention in Transformers. CATT improves various popular attention-based\nvision-language models by considerable margins.

Here, we\nstudy evolutionary games on populations that are structured beyond pairwise\ninteractions. Specifically, we introduce a general evolutionary approach that\nallows studying situations in which indirect interactions via a neighbor other\nthan the direct pairwise connection (or via a group of neighbors), impact the\nstrategy of the focal player. To this end, we consider simplicial graphs that\nencode two- and three-body interactions, which enables to study competition\nbetween all possible pairs of social dilemmas and to scrutinize the role of\nthree-body interactions in all the observed phenomenology. We simultaneously\ninvestigate how social dilemma with different Nash equilibria compete in\nsimplicial structures and how such a competition is modulated by the unbalance\nof 2- and 1-simplices, which in its turn reflects the relative prevalence of\npairwise or group interactions among the players.

The data integrity in NVM is possibly\ncompromised by integrity attacks, which can be defended against by integrity\nverification via integrity trees. After NVM system failures and reboots, the\nintegrity tree root is responsible for providing a trusted execution\nenvironment. However, the root often becomes a performance bottleneck, since\nupdating the root requires high latency on the write critical path to propagate\nthe modifications from leaf nodes to the root. The root and leaf nodes have to\nensure the crash consistency between each other to avoid any update failures\nthat potentially result in misreporting the attacks after system reboots. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient and low-latency scheme, called SCUE, to\ndirectly update the root on the SGX integrity tree (SIT) by overlooking the\nupdates upon the intermediate tree nodes. The idea behind SCUE explores and\nexploits the observation that only the persistent leaf nodes and root are\nuseful to ensure the integrity after system failures and reboots, due to the\nloss of the cached intermediate tree nodes. To achieve the crash consistency\nbetween root and leaf nodes, we accurately predict the updates upon the root\nand pre-update the root before the leaf nodes are modified. Moreover, the SIT\nroot is difficult to be reconstructed from the leaf nodes since updating one\ntree node needs its parent node as input. We use a counter-summing approach to\nreconstructing the SIT from leaf nodes. Our evaluation results show that\ncompared with the state-of-the-art integrity tree update schemes, our SCUE\nscheme delivers high performance while ensuring the system integrity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 07:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

A comprehensive understanding of the\nelastic properties of metallic TMDCs is needed to complement the semiconducting\nTMDCs in flexible optoelectronics. Thus, mechanical testing of metallic TMDCs\nis pertinent to the realization of the applications. Here, we report on the\natomic force microscopy-based nano-indentation measurements on ultra-thin\n2H-TaS2 crystals to elucidate the stretching and breaking of the metallic\nTMDCs. We explored the elastic properties of 2H-TaS2 at different thicknesses\nranging from 3.5 nm to 12.6 nm and find that the Young's modulus is independent\nof the thickness at a value of 85.9 +- 10.6 GPa, which is lower than the\nsemiconducting TMDCs reported so far. We determined the breaking strength as\n5.07 4- 0.10 GPa which is 6% of the Young's modulus. This value is comparable\nto that of other TMDCs.

For these systems,\nit is essential to understand, and eventually control, the cooling dynamics of\nthe photoinduced hot-carrier distribution. There is, however, still an active\ndebate on the different mechanisms that contribute to hot-carrier cooling. In\nparticular, the intrinsic cooling mechanism that ultimately limits the cooling\ndynamics remains an open question. Here, we address this question by studying\ntwo technologically relevant systems, consisting of high-quality graphene with\na mobility >10,000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and environments that do not\nefficiently take up electronic heat from graphene: WSe$_2$-encapsulated\ngraphene and suspended graphene. We study the cooling dynamics of these two\nhigh-quality graphene systems using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy at room\ntemperature. Cooling via disorder-assisted acoustic phonon scattering and\nout-of-plane heat transfer to the environment is relatively inefficient in\nthese systems, predicting a cooling time of tens of picoseconds. However, we\nobserve much faster cooling, on a timescale of a few picoseconds. We attribute\nthis to an intrinsic cooling mechanism, where carriers in the hot-carrier\ndistribution with enough kinetic energy emit optical phonons. During phonon\nemission, the electronic system continuously re-thermalizes, re-creating\ncarriers with enough energy to emit optical phonons. We develop an analytical\nmodel that explains the observed dynamics, where cooling is eventually limited\nby optical-to-acoustic phonon coupling. These fundamental insights into the\nintrinsic cooling mechanism of hot carriers in graphene will play a key role in\nguiding the development of graphene-based optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 08:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

Marvel is enabled by three new\ndesigns, a backscatter-based pose sensing module, an online initialization and\ncalibration module, and a backscatter-inertial super-accuracy state estimation\nalgorithm. We demonstrate our design by programming a commercial MAV to\nautonomously fly in different trajectories. The results show that Marvel\nsupports navigation within a range of 50 m or through three concrete walls,\nwith an accuracy of 34 cm for localization and 4.99 degrees for orientation\nestimation. We further demonstrate our online initialization and calibration by\ncomparing to the perfect initial parameter measurements from burdensome manual\noperations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 08:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

It is still an open\nquestion to leverage various types of information under the BERT framework.\nNonetheless, it is intuitively appealing to utilize other side information,\nsuch as item category or tag, for more comprehensive depictions and better\nrecommendations. In our pilot experiments, we found naive approaches, which\ndirectly fuse types of side information into the item embeddings, usually bring\nvery little or even negative effects. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nNOninVasive self-attention mechanism (NOVA) to leverage side information\neffectively under the BERT framework. NOVA makes use of side information to\ngenerate better attention distribution, rather than directly altering the item\nembedding, which may cause information overwhelming. We validate the NOVA-BERT\nmodel on both public and commercial datasets, and our method can stably\noutperform the state-of-the-art models with negligible computational overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 10:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

However, they\nencounter two main limitations: (1) Correlations between answers in the same\nquestion are often overlooked. (2) Question and respondent representations are\nbuilt independently of specific answers before affecting answer\nrepresentations. To address the limitations, we devise a novel graph-based\ntri-attention network, namely GTAN, which has two innovations. First, GTAN\nproposes to construct a graph for each question and learn answer correlations\nfrom each graph through graph neural networks (GNNs). Second, based on the\nrepresentations learned from GNNs, an alternating tri-attention method is\ndeveloped to alternatively build target-aware respondent representations,\nanswer-specific question representations, and context-aware answer\nrepresentations by attention computation.

The result is based on a mathematical\nreformulation of the M\\\"uller-Achenbach-Seelecke (MAS) model, which provides an\naccurate and interconnection-oriented description of the SMA hysteretic\nresponse. The strong nonlinearity and high numerical stiffness of the MAS\nmodel, however, hinder its practical use for simulation and control of complex\nSMA-driven systems. The main idea behind the hybrid reformulation is based on\ndividing the mechanical hysteresis of the SMA into five operating modes, each\none representing a different physical state of the material. By properly\nderiving the switching conditions among those modes in a physically-consistent\nway, the MAS model is effectively reformulated within a hybrid dynamical\nsetting. The main advantage of the hybrid reformulation is the possibility of\ndescribing the material dynamics with a simplified set of state equations while\nmaintaining all benefits of the physics-based description offered by the MAS\nmodel After describing the novel approach, simulation studies are conducted on\na flexible robotic module actuated by protagonist-antagonist SMA wires. Through\ncomparative numerical analysis, it is shown how the hybrid model provides the\nsame accuracy as the MAS model while saving up to 80% of the simulation time.\nMoreover, the new modeling framework opens up the possibility of addressing SMA\ncontrol from a hybrid systems perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 10:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

However, there are concerns regarding dimensional fidelity, shape\nconformity and surface quality, and therefore the printing quality and printer\nlimitations must be benchmarked.

As the mobile devices have\nbecome an essential carrier for video services nowadays, the mentioned\noptimization efforts are not only implemented for the x86 platform, but more\nimportantly utilized to highly optimize the decoding performance on the ARM\nplatform in this work.

Often in practice, there are\nnevertheless endless debates about the choice of the right loss function to be\nused to train the machine learning model, as well as about the appropriate\nmetric to assess the performances of competing models. Also, the sum of fitted\nvalues can depart from the observed totals to a large extent and this often\nconfuses actuarial analysts. The lack of balance inherent to training models by\nminimizing deviance outside the familiar GLM with canonical link setting has\nbeen empirically documented in W\\\"uthrich (2019, 2020) who attributes it to the\nearly stopping rule in gradient descent methods for model fitting. The present\npaper aims to further study this phenomenon when learning proceeds by\nminimizing Tweedie deviance. It is shown that minimizing deviance involves a\ntrade-off between the integral of weighted differences of lower partial moments\nand the bias measured on a specific scale. Autocalibration is then proposed as\na remedy. This new method to correct for bias adds an extra local GLM step to\nthe analysis. Theoretically, it is shown that it implements the autocalibration\nconcept in pure premium calculation and ensures that balance also holds on a\nlocal scale, not only at portfolio level as with existing bias-correction\ntechniques. The convex order appears to be the natural tool to compare\ncompeting models, putting a new light on the diagnostic graphs and associated\nmetrics proposed by Denuit et al.

Magnetic helicity is a physical quantity of great importance in the\nstudy of astrophysical and natural plasmas. Although a density for helicity\ncannot be defined, a good proxy for it is field line helicity. The appropriate\nquantity for use in solar conditions is relative field line helicity (RFLH).\nAims. This work aims to study in detail the behaviour of RFLH, for the first\ntime, in a solar active region (AR). Methods. The target active region is the\nlarge, eruptive AR 11158. In order to compute RFLH and all other quantities of\ninterest we use a non-linear force-free reconstruction of the AR coronal\nmagnetic field of excelent quality. Results. We find that the photospheric\nmorphology of RFLH is quite different than that of the magnetic field or of the\nelectrical current, and this is not sensitive to the chosen gauge in the\ncomputation of RFLH. The value of helicity experiences a large decrease, 25% of\nits pre-flare value, during an X-class flare of the AR, a change that is also\ndepicted in the photospheric morphology of RFLH. Moreover, the area of this\nchange coincides with the area that encompasses the flux rope, the magnetic\nstructure that later erupted. Conclusions.

This is in\ncontrast to the previously considered CP-conserving processes in models of\nleptogenesis in different see-saw mechanisms, in which the CP-conserving\nscatterings typically have lower rates compared to the CP-violating decays, due\nto a Boltzmann suppression.

Image\ncompression represents a post-processing which is frequently applied in diverse\nbiometric application scenarios. Severe compression might erase digital traces\nof face image manipulation and hence hamper a reliable detection thereof. In\nthis work, the effects of image compression on face image manipulation\ndetection are analyzed. In particular, a case study on facial retouching\ndetection under the influence of image compression is presented. To this end,\nICAO-compliant subsets of two public face databases are used to automatically\ncreate a database containing more than 9,000 retouched reference images\ntogether with unconstrained probe images.

However, this geometrical construction is not\nenough for the framing of problems in data-based SHM, as it leaves undefined\nthe notion of feature spaces. Interpreting the feature values on a\nstructure-by-structure basis as a type of field over the space of structures,\nit seems sensible to borrow an idea from modern theoretical physics, and define\nfeature assignments as sections in a vector bundle over the structure space.\nWith this idea in place, one can interpret the effect of environmental and\noperational variations as gauge degrees of freedom, as in modern gauge field\ntheories. This paper will discuss the various geometrical structures required\nfor an abstract theory of feature spaces in SHM, and will draw analogies with\nhow these structures have shown their power in modern physics. In the second\npart of the paper, the problem of determining the normal condition cross\nsection of a feature bundle is addressed. The solution is provided by the\napplication of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a versatile non-Euclidean machine\nlearning algorithm which is not restricted to inputs and outputs from vector\nspaces. In particular, the algorithm is well suited to operating directly on\nthe sort of graph structures which are an important part of the proposed\nframework for PBSHM.

The recent\nimprovement in automated cancer classification using deep learning methods has\nreached a human-level performance requiring a large amount of annotated data\nassembled in one location, yet, finding such conditions usually is not\nfeasible. Recently, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train\ndecentralized models in a privacy-preserved fashion depending on labeled data\nat the client-side, which is usually not available and costly. To address this,\nwe propose \\verb!FedPerl!, a semi-supervised federated learning method.

Then it encourages communities members to learn from each other\nto generate more accurate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We also\nproposed the peer anonymization (PA) technique to anonymize clients. As a core\ncomponent of our method, PA is orthogonal to other methods without additional\ncomplexity and reduces the communication cost while enhancing performance.\nFinally, we propose a dynamic peer-learning policy that controls the learning\nstream to avoid any degradation in the performance, especially for individual\nclients. Our experimental setup consists of 71,000 skin lesion images collected\nfrom 5 publicly available datasets. We test our method in four different\nscenarios in SSFL. With few annotated data, FedPerl is on par with a\nstate-of-the-art method in skin lesion classification in the standard setup\nwhile outperforming SSFLs and the baselines by 1.8% and 15.8%, respectively.\nAlso, it generalizes better to unseen clients while being less sensitive to\nnoisy ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 14:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 10:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 13:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 08:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Federated learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a\nML model without exchanging local data.

On the other hand, backpropagation (BP) is commonly regarded to be the\nmost successful learning method in modern machine learning. Thus, it is\nexciting that recent work formulates inference learning (IL) that trains PCNs\nto approximate BP. However, there are several remaining critical issues: (i) IL\nis an approximation to BP with unrealistic/non-trivial requirements, (ii) IL\napproximates BP in single-step weight updates; whether it leads to the same\npoint as BP after the weight updates are conducted for more steps is unknown,\nand (iii) IL is computationally significantly more costly than BP. To solve\nthese issues, a variant of IL that is strictly equivalent to BP in fully\nconnected networks has been proposed.

Here we study some potential\nformation mechanisms of magnetic switchbacks in the lower solar atmosphere,\nusing three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations.

In all scenarios\nconsidered, we witness the formation of magnetic switchbacks in regions\ncorresponding to chromospheric heights. Therefore, photospheric plasma flows\naround the foot-points of intense flux tubes appear to be suitable drivers for\nthe formation of magnetic switchbacks in the lower solar atmosphere.\nNevertheless, these switchbacks do not appear to be able to enter the coronal\nheights of the simulation in the present model. In conclusion, based on the\npresented simulations, switchbacks measured in the solar wind are unlikely to\noriginate from photospheric or chromospheric dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 14:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Within this framework, predicting their\namplitudes is essential to guide future observational strategies and seismic\nstudies. In this work, we predict the amplitude of low-frequency asymptotic\ngravity modes generated by penetrative convection at the top of the radiative\nzone. The result is found to depend critically on the time evolution of the\nplumes inside the generation region. Using a solar model, we compute the GOLF\napparent surface radial velocity of low-degree gravity modes in the frequency\nrange $10~\\mu H_z\\le \\nu \\le 100~\\mu H_z$. In case of a Gaussian plume time\nevolution, gravity modes turn out to be undetectable because of too small\nsurface amplitudes. This holds true despite a wide range of values considered\nfor the parameters of the model. In the other limiting case of an exponential\ntime evolution, plumes are expected to drive gravity modes in a much more\nefficient way because of a much higher temporal coupling between the plumes and\nthe modes than in the Gaussian case. Using reasonable values for the plume\nparameters based on semi-analytical models, the apparent surface velocities in\nthis case turn out to be one order of magnitude smaller than the 22-years GOLF\ndetection threshold and than the previous estimates considering turbulent\npressure as the driving mechanism, with a maximum value of $0.05$ cm s${}^{-1}$\nfor $\\ell =1$ and $\\nu\\approx 100~\\mu H_z$.

Implicit gradient techniques suppress this problem\nintroducing some inelastic non-local fields and solving an enriched formulation\nwhere the classical balance of linear momentum is fully coupled with a\nHelmholtz-type equation for each of the non-local variable. Such Helmholtz-type\nequations determine the distribution of the non-local fields in bands whose\nwidth is controlled by a characteristic length, independently on the spatial\ndiscretization. The numerical resolution of this coupled problem using the\nFinite Element method is computationally very expensive and its use to simulate\nthe damage process in 3D multi-phase microstructures becomes prohibitive. In\nthis work, we propose a novel FFT-based iterative algorithm for simulating\ngradient ductile damage in computational homogenization problems. In\nparticular, the Helmholtz-type equation of the implicit gradient approach is\nproperly generalized to model the regularization of damage in multi-phase\nmedia, where multiple damage variables and different characteristic lengths may\ncome into play. In the proposed iterative algorithm, two distinct problems are\nsolved in a staggered fashion: (i) a conventional mechanical problem via a\nFFT-Galerkin solver with mixed macroscopic loading control and (ii) the\ngeneralized Helmholtz-type equation using a Krylov-based algorithm combined\nwith an efficient pre-conditioner.

Finally, the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm is\ndemonstrated in the simulation of failure of complex 3D particle reinforced\ncomposites characterized by millions of degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 18:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The power system has been\nthe precursor to the greatest period of innovation in our history and has meant\nthat visionaries with revolutionary ideas can compete with those with capital,\npolitical power, and means. Electricity, therefore, has been the great\nequalising force of the last 150 years, enhancing the productivity of the\nmasses and granting prosperity to whole swathes of our nation. Whilst\nelectricity has been one of the single largest innovations in enhancing the\npower of free markets, it is somewhat ironic that the way power is sold to\nconsumers is largely unfree. The market is highly regulated, centralised, and\nis often used for political football by cynical politicians on both sides of\nthe political spectrum. Introducing Locational Marginal Pricing into the UK\ngrid system will increase economic freedom in the consumer markets for power,\nreduce prices for the poorest in the UK, decrease transmission losses, increase\nthe permeation of low carbon generation in the grid, and incentivise investment\nin the UK's Northern Powerhouse initiative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 09:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

In this context, permutation complexity\nrefers to the characterization of time series by means of ordinal patterns\n(permutations), entropic measures, decay rates of missing ordinal patterns, and\nmore. Since the inception of this \\textquotedblleft ordinal\\textquotedblright\\\nmethodology, its practical application to any type of scalar time series and\nreal-valued processes have proven to be simple and useful. However, the\ntheoretical aspects have remained limited to noiseless deterministic series and\ndynamical systems, the main obstacle being the super-exponential growth of\nvisible permutations with length when randomness (also in form of observational\nnoise) is present in the data. To overcome this difficulty, we take a new\napproach through complexity classes, which are precisely defined by the growth\nof visible permutations with length, regardless of the deterministic or noisy\nnature of the data. We consider three major classes: exponential, sub-factorial\nand factorial. The next step is to adapt the concept of Z-entropy to each of\nthose classes, which we call permutation entropy because it coincides with the\nconventional permutation entropy on the exponential class. Z-entropies are a\nfamily of group entropies, each of them extensive on a given complexity class.\nThe result is a unified approach to the ordinal analysis of deterministic and\nrandom processes, from dynamical systems to white noise, with new concepts and\ntools. Numerical simulations show that permutation entropy discriminates time\nseries from all complexity classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 11:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 09:06:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 10:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Substantial changes in network structure may influence policy--makers\ndirectly or may influence models built upon the network data, and these in turn\ncould impact policy--makers and their assessment of risk. Four general network\nmeasures are used (total number of nodes with movements, movements, births and\ndeaths), in conjunction with network metrics to describe each monthly network.\nTwo updates of the database were examined to determine by how much the movement\ndata stored for a particular time period had been cleansed between updates.\nStatistical models show that there is a statistically significant effect of the\ntime period (2004--2006 vs 2015--2017) in the values of all network measures\nand six of nine network metrics.

Estimation of\nthe switching loss under different operating conditions at an early design\nstage is essential for optimising the thermal design. Analytical switching loss\nmodels available in literature are generally used for estimating the switching\nlosses, due to its accuracy and simplicity.
