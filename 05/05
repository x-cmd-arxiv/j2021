For example,\nbinary pulsar and gravitational wave observations have placed stringent bounds\non certain scalar-tensor theories in which a massless scalar field is coupled\nto the metric through matter. A remarkable phenomenon of neutron stars in such\nscalar-tensor theories is spontaneous scalarization, where a normalized scalar\ncharge remains order unity even if the matter-scalar coupling vanishes\nasymptotically far from the neutron star. While most works on scalarization of\nneutron stars focus on numerical analysis, this paper aims to derive accurate\nscalar charges analytically. To achieve this, we consider a simple energy\ndensity profile of the Tolman VII form and work in a weak-field expansion. We\nsolve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations order by order and\napply Pad\\'e resummation to account for higher-order effects.

In this contribution, we\nutilise a large dataset of YouTube review videos which includes ca. 600 hours\nof dimensional arousal, valence and trustworthiness annotations. We investigate\nfeatures extracted from these signals against various user engagement\nindicators including views, like/dislike ratio, as well as the sentiment of\ncomments. In doing so, we identify the positive and negative influences which\nsingle features have, as well as interpretable patterns in each dimension which\nrelate to user engagement. Our results demonstrate that smaller boundary ranges\nand fluctuations for arousal lead to an increase in user engagement.\nFurthermore, the extracted time-series features reveal significant (p<0.05)\ncorrelations for each dimension, such as, count below signal mean (arousal),\nnumber of peaks (valence), and absolute energy (trustworthiness). From this, an\neffective combination of features is outlined for approaches aiming to\nautomatically predict several user engagement indicators. In a user engagement\nprediction paradigm we compare all features against semi-automatic\n(cross-task), and automatic (task-specific) feature selection methods.

Gait\nanalysis can therefore be used to detect impairments and help diagnose\nillnesses and assess patient recovery. Using vision-based systems, diagnoses\ncould be done at home or in a clinic, with the needed computation being done\nremotely. State-of-the-art vision-based gait analysis systems use deep\nlearning, requiring large datasets for training. However, to our best\nknowledge, the biggest publicly available pathological gait dataset contains\nonly 10 subjects, simulating 4 gait pathologies. This paper presents a new\ndataset called GAIT-IT, captured from 21 subjects simulating 4 gait\npathologies, with 2 severity levels, besides normal gait, being considerably\nlarger than publicly available gait pathology datasets, allowing to train a\ndeep learning model for gait pathology classification. Moreover, it was\nrecorded in a professional studio, making it possible to obtain nearly perfect\nsilhouettes, free of segmentation errors. Recognizing the importance of remote\nhealthcare, this paper proposes a prototype of a web application allowing to\nupload a walking person's video, possibly acquired using a smartphone camera,\nand execute a web service that classifies the person's gait as normal or across\ndifferent pathologies. The web application has a user friendly interface and\ncould be used by healthcare professionals or other end users. An automatic gait\nanalysis system is also developed and integrated with the web application for\npathology classification.

By leveraging the time delay estimation\n(TDE) technique, we first exploit sensory data to reduce the requirement of a\ncomplete dynamics, where measured data are adopted to construct an incremental\ndynamics that reflects the system evolution in an incremental form. Then, the\nresulting incremental dynamics serves to design the approximate optimal\nincremental control strategy based on adaptive dynamic programming, which is\nimplemented as a simplified single critic structure to get the approximate\nsolution to the value function of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.\nFurthermore, for the critic artificial neural network, experience data are used\nto design an off-policy weight update law with guaranteed weight convergence.\nRather importantly, to address the unintentionally introduced TDE error, we\nincorporate a TDE error bound related term into the cost function, whereby the\nTDE error is attenuated during the optimization process.

Stylised outputs are then obtained by computing similarities between\nboth feature representations in order to transfer the style of the reference to\nthe content of the target input.

Modern ML methods can be characterized as highly resistant to some\nexperimental errors. However, small changes on the data over long distances or\nlong periods of time, which cannot be easily detected by statistical methods,\ncan be harmful to these methods. We develop a new strategy to cope with this\nproblem, also using ML methods in an innovative way, to identify these\npotentially harmful features. We introduce and discuss the notion of Drifting\nFeatures, related with small changes in the properties as measured in the data\nfeatures. We use the identification of RRLs in VVV based on an earlier work and\nintroduce a method for detecting Drifting Features. Our method forces a\nclassifier to learn the tile of origin of diverse sources (mostly stellar\n'point sources'), and select the features more relevant to the task of finding\ncandidates to Drifting Features. We show that this method can efficiently\nidentify a reduced set of features that contains useful information about the\ntile of origin of the sources. For our particular example of detecting RRLs in\nVVV, we find that Drifting Features are mostly related to color indices. On the\nother hand, we show that, even if we have a clear set of Drifting Features in\nour problem, they are mostly insensitive to the identification of RRLs.\nDrifting Features can be efficiently identified using ML methods. However, in\nour example, removing Drifting Features does not improve the identification of\nRRLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 19:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 00:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 03:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Existing\nlearning systems for this task often treat tables as plain text based on the\nassumption that tables are structured as dataframes. However, tables can have\ncomplex layouts which indicate diverse dependencies between subtable\nstructures, such as nested headers. As a result, queries may refer to different\nspans of relevant content that is distributed across these structures.\nMoreover, such systems fail to generalize to novel scenarios beyond those seen\nin the training set. Prior methods are still distant from a generalizable\nsolution to the NLTR problem, as they fall short in handling complex table\nlayouts or queries over multiple granularities. To address these issues, we\npropose Graph-based Table Retrieval (GTR), a generalizable NLTR framework with\nmulti-granular graph representation learning. In our framework, a table is\nfirst converted into a tabular graph, with cell nodes, row nodes and column\nnodes to capture content at different granularities. Then the tabular graph is\ninput to a Graph Transformer model that can capture both table cell content and\nthe layout structures. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of the\nmodel, we further incorporate a self-supervised pre-training task based on\ngraph-context matching. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that our\nmethod leads to significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art\nsystems. Further experiments demonstrate promising performance of our method on\ncross-dataset generalization, and enhanced capability of handling complex\ntables and fulfilling diverse query intents.

We exploit circuit slack for\nsingle-qubit gates that occur in idle windows, scheduling the gates such that\ntheir timing can counteract some errors.\n  Spin-echo corrections that mitigate decoherence on idling qubits act as\ninspiration for this work.

We present an automated method to transform\nan image to a set of binary textures that represent not only the intensities,\nbut also the colors of the original. The foundation of our method is\ninformation preservation: creating a set of textures that allows for the\nreconstruction of the original image's colors solely from the binarized\nrepresentation. We present techniques to ensure that the textures created are\nnot visually distracting, preserve the intensity profile of the images, and are\nnatural in that they map sets of colors that are perceptually similar to\npatterns that are similar.

Moreover, with the recent\nadvances in deep neural networks, there is an urgent need to facilitate the\ndevelopment and benchmarking of such learning-based planning algorithms. This\npaper presents PathBench, a platform for developing, visualizing, training,\ntesting, and benchmarking of existing and future, classical and learned 2D and\n3D path planning algorithms, while offering support for Robot Oper-ating System\n(ROS). Many existing path planning algorithms are supported; e.g. A*,\nwavefront, rapidly-exploring random tree, value iteration networks, gated path\nplanning networks; and integrating new algorithms is easy and clearly\nspecified. We demonstrate the benchmarking capability of PathBench by comparing\nimplemented classical and learned algorithms for metrics, such as path length,\nsuccess rate, computational time and path deviation. These evaluations are done\non built-in PathBench maps and external path planning environments from video\ngames and real world databases.

Trace regression is a widely used method to model\neffects of matrix predictors and has shown great success in matrix learning.\nHowever, nearly all existing trace regression solutions rely on two\nassumptions: (i) a known functional form of the conditional mean, and (ii) a\nglobal low-rank structure in the entire range of the regression function, both\nof which may be violated in practice. In this article, we relax these\nassumptions by developing a general framework for nonparametric trace\nregression models via structured sign series representations of high\ndimensional functions. The new model embraces both linear and nonlinear trace\neffects, and enjoys rank invariance to order-preserving transformations of the\nresponse. In the context of matrix completion, our framework leads to a\nsubstantially richer model based on what we coin as the \"sign rank\" of a\nmatrix. We show that the sign series can be statistically characterized by\nweighted classification tasks. Based on this connection, we propose a learning\nreduction approach to learn the regression model via a series of classifiers,\nand develop a parallelable computation algorithm to implement sign series\naggregations. We establish the excess risk bounds, estimation error rates, and\nsample complexities. Our proposal provides a broad nonparametric paradigm to\nmany important matrix learning problems, including matrix regression, matrix\ncompletion, multi-task learning, and compressed sensing.

Intensity in\nparticular can be very different between scans, even in areas that are\noverlapping. Harmonizing the intensity between scans to remove these\ndiscrepancies is expensive and time consuming.

In contrast to previous work, our\ncontrollable 3D character displays dynamics, e.g., the swing of the skirt,\ndependent on skeletal body motion in an efficient data-driven way, without\nrequiring complex physics simulation. Our character model also features a\nlearned dynamic texture model that accounts for photo-realistic\nmotion-dependent appearance details, as well as view-dependent lighting\neffects. During training, we do not need to resort to difficult dynamic 3D\ncapture of the human; instead we can train our model entirely from multi-view\nvideo in a weakly supervised manner. To this end, we propose a parametric and\ndifferentiable character representation which allows us to model coarse and\nfine dynamic deformations, e.g., garment wrinkles, as explicit space-time\ncoherent mesh geometry that is augmented with high-quality dynamic textures\ndependent on motion and view point. As input to the model, only an arbitrary 3D\nskeleton motion is required, making it directly compatible with the established\n3D animation pipeline. We use a novel graph convolutional network architecture\nto enable motion-dependent deformation learning of body and clothing, including\ndynamics, and a neural generative dynamic texture model creates corresponding\ndynamic texture maps. We show that by merely providing new skeletal motions,\nour model creates motion-dependent surface deformations, physically plausible\ndynamic clothing deformations, as well as video-realistic surface textures at a\nmuch higher level of detail than previous state of the art approaches, and even\nin real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 23:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 07:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

However, one drawback of MRI is its comparatively slow\nscanning and reconstruction compared to other image modalities, limiting its\nusage in some clinical applications when imaging time is critical. Traditional\ncompressive sensing based MRI (CS-MRI) reconstruction can speed up MRI\nacquisition, but suffers from a long iterative process and noise-induced\nartefacts. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used in sparse MRI\nreconstruction models to recreate relatively high-quality images from heavily\nundersampled k-space data, allowing for much faster MRI scanning. However,\nthere are still some hurdles to tackle. For example, directly training DNNs\nbased on L1/L2 distance to the target fully sampled images could result in\nblurry reconstruction because L1/L2 loss can only enforce overall image or\npatch similarity and does not take into account local information such as\nanatomical sharpness. It is also hard to preserve fine image details while\nmaintaining a natural appearance. More recently, Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GAN) based methods are proposed to solve fast MRI with enhanced image\nperceptual quality. The encoder obtains a latent space for the undersampling\nimage, and the image is reconstructed by the decoder using the GAN loss. In\nthis chapter, we review the GAN powered fast MRI methods with a comparative\nstudy on various anatomical datasets to demonstrate the generalisability and\nrobustness of this kind of fast MRI while providing future perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 23:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

With indivisible goods, such fair\nallocations are unfortunately not guaranteed to exist. Classical works have\navoided this issue by introducing an additional divisible resource, i.e.,\nmoney, to subsidize envious agents. In this paper, we aim to design a truthful\nallocation mechanism of indivisible goods to achieve both fairness and\nefficiency criteria with a limited amount of subsidy. Following the work of\nHalpern and Shah, our central question is as follows: to what extent do we need\nto rely on the power of money to accomplish these objectives? For general\nvaluations, the impossibility theorem of combinatorial auction translates to\nour setting: even if an arbitrarily large amount of money is available for use,\nno mechanism can achieve truthfulness, envy-freeness, and utilitarian\noptimality simultaneously when agents have general monotone submodular\nvaluations. By contrast, we show that, when agents have matroidal valuations,\nthere is a truthful allocation mechanism that achieves envy-freeness and\nutilitarian optimality by subsidizing each agent with at most $1$, the maximum\nmarginal contribution of each item for each agent. The design of the mechanism\nrests crucially on the underlying matroidal M-convexity of the Lorenz\ndominating allocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 00:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Leveraging a recently\nproposed computational framework for smart vehicles in a smart world using\nmulti-agent based simulation and optimization, we first recapitulate how the\nforward problem of driving decision-making is modeled as a state space model.\nWe then show how the model can be inverted to estimate driver preferences from\nnaturalistic traffic data using the standard Kalman filter technique.

However, privacy-preserved computation is still\nexpensive. Our investigation has found that the most time-consuming component\nof the HE-based linear computation is a series of Permutation (Perm) operations\nthat are imperative for dot product and convolution in privacy-preserved MLaaS.\nTo this end, we propose GALA: Greedy computAtion for Linear Algebra in\nprivacy-preserved neural networks, which views the HE-based linear computation\nas a series of Homomorphic Add, Mult and Perm operations and chooses the least\nexpensive operation in each linear computation step to reduce the overall cost.\nGALA makes the following contributions: (1) It introduces a row-wise weight\nmatrix encoding and combines the share generation that is needed for the\nGC-based nonlinear computation, to reduce the Perm operations for the dot\nproduct; (2) It designs a first-Add-second-Perm approach (named kernel\ngrouping) to reduce Perm operations for convolution. As such, GALA efficiently\nreduces the cost for the HE-based linear computation, which is a critical\nbuilding block in almost all of the recent frameworks for privacy-preserved\nneural networks, including GAZELLE (Usenix Security'18), DELPHI (Usenix\nSecurity'20), and CrypTFlow2 (CCS'20). With its deep optimization of the\nHE-based linear computation, GALA can be a plug-and-play module integrated into\nthese systems to further boost their efficiency.

Although bulk metallic\ndelafossites are known to be the most conducting oxides, the high conductivity\nis yet to be realized in thin film forms. Suppressed conductivity found in thin\nfilms is mainly caused by the formation of twin domains, and their boundaries\ncan be a source of scattering centers for charge carriers.

However, it is challenging to characterize, much less\nguarantee, the global stability (i.e., long-time boundedness) of these models.\nThe seminal work of Schlegel and Noack (JFM, 2015) provided a theorem outlining\nnecessary and sufficient conditions to ensure global stability in systems with\nenergy-preserving, quadratic nonlinearities, with the goal of evaluating the\nstability of projection-based models. In this work, we incorporate this theorem\ninto modern data-driven models obtained via machine learning. First, we propose\nthat this theorem should be a standard diagnostic for the stability of\nprojection-based and data-driven models, examining the conditions under which\nit holds. Second, we illustrate how to modify the objective function in machine\nlearning algorithms to promote globally stable models, with implications for\nthe modeling of fluid and plasma flows. Specifically, we introduce a modified\n\"trapping SINDy\" algorithm based on the sparse identification of nonlinear\ndynamics (SINDy) method. This method enables the identification of models that,\nby construction, only produce bounded trajectories. The effectiveness and\naccuracy of this approach are demonstrated on a broad set of examples of\nvarying model complexity and physical origin, including the vortex shedding in\nthe wake of a circular cylinder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 02:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this\ncontext, the bias between the acquired histogram, consisting of low values or\nzeros, and the expected histogram, obtained from the forward projector, is\npropagated to the image, resulting in a biased reconstruction. This situation\ncould be exacerbated with finer resolution of the TOF information, which\nfurther sparsifies the acquired histogram.

Although\nseveral spoofing detection techniques exist, they are incapable of mitigation\nand recovery from stealthy attackers. In this work, we present SemperFi, a\nsingle antenna GPS receiver capable of tracking legitimate GPS satellite\nsignals and estimating the true location even during a spoofing attack. The\nmain challenge in building SemperFi is, unlike most wireless systems where\n\\emph{the data} contained in the wireless signals is important, GPS relies on\nthe time of arrival (ToA) of satellite signals. SemperFi is capable of\ndistinguishing spoofing signals and recovering legitimate GPS signals that are\neven completely overshadowed by a strong adversary. We exploit the short-term\nstability of inertial sensors to identify the spoofing signal and extend the\nsuccessive interference cancellation algorithm to preserve the legitimate\nsignal's ToA. We implement SemperFi in GNSS-SDR, an open-source\nsoftware-defined GNSS receiver, and evaluate its performance using UAV\nsimulators, real drones, a variety of real-world GPS datasets, and various\nembedded platforms. Our evaluation results indicate that in many scenarios,\nSemperFi can identify adversarial peaks by executing flight patterns that are\nless than 50 m long and recover the true location within 10 seconds (Jetson\nXavier). We show that our receiver is secure against stealthy attackers who\nexploit inertial sensor errors and execute seamless takeover attacks. We design\nSemperFi as a pluggable module capable of generating a spoofer-free GPS signal\nfor processing on any commercial-off-the-shelf GPS receiver available today.\nFinally, we release our implementation to the community for usage and further\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 04:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Our phase-field method\nis built on top of a direct numerical simulation solver, named AFiD\n(www.afid.eu) and open-sourced by our research group.

Existing\ntechniques in statistical learning require computation of capacity measures,\nsuch as VC dimension, to provably bound this error. It is however unclear how\nto extend these measures to DNNs and therefore the existing analyses are\napplicable to simple neural networks, which are not used in practice, e.g.,\nlinear or shallow ones or otherwise multi-layer perceptrons. Moreover, many\ntheoretical error bounds are not empirically verifiable. We derive estimates of\nthe generalization error that hold for deep networks and do not rely on\nunattainable capacity measures. The enabling technique in our approach hinges\non two major assumptions: i) the network achieves zero training error, ii) the\nprobability of making an error on a test point is proportional to the distance\nbetween this point and its nearest training point in the feature space and at a\ncertain maximal distance (that we call radius) it saturates. Based on these\nassumptions we estimate the generalization error of DNNs.

A more clinically\nrelevant task is to identify medication changes.\n  In this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual network, named MICRON, for\nmedication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health\nrecords as input and learns to update a hidden medication vector and the\nmedication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector\nis like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications.\nUnlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for\nprediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential\nupdating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent\nvisit) more efficiently.\n  We evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets.

Although the previous prefix-to-prefix framework is considered\nsuitable for simultaneous translation and achieves good performance, it still\nhas two inevitable drawbacks: the high computational resource costs caused by\nthe need to train a separate model for each latency $k$ and the insufficient\nability to encode information because each target token can only attend to a\nspecific source prefix. We propose a novel framework that adopts a simple but\neffective decoding strategy which is designed for full-sentence models. Within\nthis framework, training a single full-sentence model can achieve arbitrary\ngiven latency and save computational resources. Besides, with the competence of\nthe full-sentence model to encode the whole sentence, our decoding strategy can\nenhance the information maintained in the decoded states in real time.\nExperimental results show that our method achieves better translation quality\nthan baselines on 4 directions: Zh$\\rightarrow$En, En$\\rightarrow$Ro and\nEn$\\leftrightarrow$De.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 07:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 03:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

We study their interaction with\na classical macroscopic object, like Earth or a satellite in Earth's orbit. We\nset up an action that includes the interaction term between the massive\nclassical object and the scalar field that the domain wall is made of. We use\nnumerical calculations to solve the coupled equations of motion which describe\nthe crossing between the domain wall and the classical object. Depending on the\nstrength of the interaction, relative velocity and size, the object can be\neither stopped by the wall, or it can pass through it inducing deformations in\nthe wall that cost energy. At the same time, the coupling to the scalar filed\nmight change the object's mass during the crossover. The fact that satellites\nin Earth's orbit (or planets in Sun's orbit) can change their mass and/or lose\nenergy interacting with walls can be used as a new domain wall detection probe.\nFor example, a typical velocity precision of a satellite is about $0.5$ mm/s,\nwhich directly puts an upper limit on its mass change to $\\Delta M/M\n\\lessapprox 5\\times 10^{-17} $. Alternatively, a known satellite flyby anomaly\ncan easily be explained as an interaction with a closed domain wall. We also\nshow that the presence of matter modifies the scalar filed potential and can\nlocally create a bubble of the true vacuum, and thus trigger the decay of the\nfalse vacuum. For a critical bubble which is able to expand, such an\ninteraction with the domain wall must be strong enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 07:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 09:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Linking\nungrouped meteorites to their parent bodies is thus crucial to significantly\nincrease our knowledge of asteroids.

LEADOR starts with typical PD to\nco-design the interaction specifications and state and action space of the\nrobot. It then replaces traditional offline programming or WoZ by an in-situ,\nonline teaching phase where the domain expert can live-program or teach the\nrobot how to behave while being embedded in the interaction context. We believe\nthat this live teaching can be best achieved by adding a learning component to\na WoZ setup, to capture experts' implicit knowledge, as they intuitively\nrespond to the dynamics of the situation. The robot progressively learns an\nappropriate, expert-approved policy, ultimately leading to full autonomy, even\nin sensitive and/or ill-defined environments. However, LEADOR is agnostic to\nthe exact technical approach used to facilitate this learning process. The\nextensive inclusion of the domain expert(s) in robot design represents\nestablished responsible innovation practice, lending credibility to the system\nboth during the teaching phase and when operating autonomously. The combination\nof this expert inclusion with the focus on in-situ development also means\nLEADOR supports a mutual shaping approach to social robotics. We draw on two\npreviously published, foundational works from which this (generalisable)\nmethodology has been derived in order to demonstrate the feasibility and worth\nof this approach, provide concrete examples in its application and identify\nlimitations and opportunities when applying this framework in new environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 07:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 16:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

The formation and nature of the\nprimordial crust generated during the early stages of melting is poorly\nunderstood, due in part to the scarcity of available samples. The newly\ndiscovered meteorite Erg Chech 002 (EC 002) originates from one such primitive\nigneous crust and has an andesite bulk composition. It derives from the partial\nmelting of a noncarbonaceous chondritic reservoir, with no depletion in alkalis\nrelative to the Sun photosphere and at a high degree of melting of around 25\npercents. Moreover, EC 002 is, to date, the oldest known piece of an igneous\ncrust with a 26Al-26Mg crystallization age of 4,565.0 million years (My).\nPartial melting took place at 1,220 C up to several hundred kyr before,\nimplying an accretion of the EC 002 parent body ca. 4,566 My ago. Protoplanets\ncovered by andesitic crusts were probably frequent. However, no asteroid shares\nthe spectral features of EC 002, indicating that almost all of these bodies\nhave disappeared, either because they went on to form the building blocks of\nlarger bodies or planets or were simply destroyed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 07:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Members of this C-cluster are in fair agreement with\nthe color boundaries of B and C-type defined in DeMeo and Carry (2013). We then\ncompare colors of C-cluster asteroids to those of carbonaceous chondrites\npowders, while taking into account the effect of phase angle.

Also, CM chondrites powders are on\naverage slightly redder than the average C-cluster. The colors of C-cluster\nmembers are further investigated by looking at color variations as a function\nof asteroid diameter. We observe that the visible slope becomes bluer with\ndecreasing asteroids diameter, and a transition seems to be present around 20\nkm. We discuss the origin of this variation and, if not related to a bias in\nthe dataset - analysis, we conclude that it is related to the surface texture\nof the objects, smaller objects being covered by rocks, while larger objects\nare covered by a particulate surface. The blueing is interpreted by an\nincreased contribution of the first reflection in the case of rock-dominated\nsurfaces, which can scatter light in a Rayleigh-like manner. We do not have\nunambiguous evidence of space weathering within the C-cluster based on this\nanalysis, however the generally bluer nature of C-cluster objects compared to\nCM chondrites could be to some extent related to space weathering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 07:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

The sign of the\ncorrelations appears to vary as a function of stellar spectral type, and the\ntransition in sign signals a noteworthy change in the stellar activity\nproperties where earlier type stars appear more plage dominated. These\ntransitions become more clearly defined when considered as a function of the\nconvective zone depth. Therefore, it is the convective zone depth (which can be\naltered by stellar metallicity) that appears to be the underlying fundamental\nparameter driving the observed activity correlations. In addition, for most of\nthe stars, we find that the RVs become increasingly red-shifted as activity\nlevels increase, which can be explained by the increase in the suppression of\nconvective blue-shift. However, we also find a minority of stars where the RVs\nbecome increasingly blue-shifted as activity levels increase.

However, how to\nfully leverage such frameworks to perform instance segmentation remains an open\nproblem. In this paper, we present QueryInst (Instances as Queries), a query\nbased instance segmentation method driven by parallel supervision on dynamic\nmask heads. The key insight of QueryInst is to leverage the intrinsic\none-to-one correspondence in object queries across different stages, as well as\none-to-one correspondence between mask RoI features and object queries in the\nsame stage. This approach eliminates the explicit multi-stage mask head\nconnection and the proposal distribution inconsistency issues inherent in\nnon-query based multi-stage instance segmentation methods. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., COCO, CityScapes, and\nYouTube-VIS to evaluate the effectiveness of QueryInst in instance segmentation\nand video instance segmentation (VIS) task. Specifically, using ResNet-101-FPN\nbackbone, QueryInst obtains 48.1 box AP and 42.8 mask AP on COCO test-dev,\nwhich is 2 points higher than HTC in terms of both box AP and mask AP, while\nruns 2.4 times faster.

In particular, the absence of\nlower frequency lines and the generation lines shift when changing the pH are\ndue to ion friction appearing in the ionic solution environment.

In\nthe random oracle model, the parties and the eavesdropper have access to a\nshared random function (an \"oracle\"), but the parties are limited in the number\nof queries they can make to the oracle. The random oracle serves as an\nabstraction for black-box access to a symmetric cryptographic primitive, such\nas a collision resistant hash. Unfortunately, as shown by Impagliazzo and\nRudich [STOC '89] and Barak and Mahmoody [Crypto '09], such protocols can only\nguarantee limited secrecy: the key of any $\\ell$-query protocol can be revealed\nby an $O(\\ell^2)$-query adversary. This quadratic gap between the query\ncomplexity of the honest parties and the eavesdropper matches the gap obtained\nby the Merkle's Puzzles protocol of Merkle [CACM '78].\n  In this work we tackle a new aspect of key-agreement protocols in the random\noracle model: their communication complexity. In Merkle's Puzzles, to obtain\nsecrecy against an eavesdropper that makes roughly $\\ell^2$ queries, the honest\nparties need to exchange $\\Omega(\\ell)$ bits. We show that for protocols with\ncertain natural properties, ones that Merkle's Puzzle has, such high\ncommunication is unavoidable. Specifically, this is the case if the honest\nparties' queries are uniformly random, or alternatively if the protocol uses\nnon-adaptive queries and has only two rounds. Our proof for the first setting\nuses a novel reduction from the set-disjointness problem in two-party\ncommunication complexity. For the second setting we prove the lower bound\ndirectly, using information-theoretic arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 09:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 07:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

Some efforts have\nbeen devoted to overcoming this issue with delicate models. However, there is\nno research to address it from the angle of the answer feature space learning,\ndespite of the fact that existing VQA methods all cast VQA as a classification\ntask. Inspired by this, in this work, we attempt to tackle the language prior\nproblem from the viewpoint of the feature space learning. To this end, an\nadapted margin cosine loss is designed to discriminate the frequent and the\nsparse answer feature space under each question type properly. As a result, the\nlimited patterns within the language modality are largely reduced, thereby less\nlanguage priors would be introduced by our method. We apply this loss function\nto several baseline models and evaluate its effectiveness on two VQA-CP\nbenchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our adapted margin cosine\nloss can greatly enhance the baseline models with an absolute performance gain\nof 15\\% on average, strongly verifying the potential of tackling the language\nprior problem in VQA from the angle of the answer feature space learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 11:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Energy(-like) landscapes can\nexplain some biomolecular processes, including gene expression and, as\nFrauenfelder showed, protein folding. But energy-like landscapes and existing\nframeworks like statistical mechanics seem impractical for describing many\nliving systems. Difficulties stem from living systems being high dimensional,\nnonlinear, and governed by many, tightly coupled constituents that are noisy.\nThe predominant modeling approach is devising differential equations that are\ntailored to each living system. This ad hoc approach faces the notorious\n\"parameter problem\": models have numerous nonlinear, mathematical functions\nwith unknown parameter values, even for describing just a few intracellular\nprocesses. One cannot measure many intracellular parameters or can only measure\nthem as snapshots in time. Another modeling approach uses cellular automata to\nrepresent living systems as discrete dynamical systems with binary variables.\nQuantitative (Hamiltonian-based) rules can dictate cellular automata (e.g.,\nCellular Potts Model). But numerous biological features, in current practice,\nare qualitatively described rather than quantitatively (e.g., gene is (highly)\nexpressed or not (highly) expressed).

Nevertheless, even modern\narchitectures lack the ability to generalize well to a test dataset that\noriginates from a different domain. To avoid the costly annotation of training\ndata for unseen domains, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to\nprovide efficient knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an\nunlabeled target domain. Previous work has mainly focused on minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the two domains by using adversarial training or\nself-training. While adversarial training may fail to align the correct\nsemantic categories as it minimizes the discrepancy between the global\ndistributions, self-training raises the question of how to provide reliable\npseudo-labels. To align the correct semantic categories across domains, we\npropose a contrastive learning approach that adapts category-wise centroids\nacross domains. Furthermore, we extend our method with self-training, where we\nuse a memory-efficient temporal ensemble to generate consistent and reliable\npseudo-labels. Although both contrastive learning and self-training (CLST)\nthrough temporal ensembling enable knowledge transfer between two domains, it\nis their combination that leads to a symbiotic structure.

The feasibility of the presented model\nis demonstrated by numerical simulation of the adiabatic evolution of a system\nof quantum bits towards the optimal solution encoded in the model Hamiltonian.\nOver all, the described method is not limited to the context of weapon\nmanagement but is, with slight modifications to the model Hamiltonian,\napplicable to worker-task allocation optimization in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 12:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Deep generative neural networks can\nefficiently encode such complex spatial priors, thereby, allowing for a strong\nmodel dimensionality reduction that comes at the price of enhanced\nnon-linearity. In this setting, we explore a recent adaptive sequential Monte\nCarlo (ASMC) approach that builds on Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS); a\nmethod that provides both the posterior probability density function (PDF) and\nthe evidence (a central quantity for Bayesian model selection) through a\nparticle approximation. Both techniques are well suited to parallel computation\nand rely on importance sampling over a sequence of intermediate distributions,\nlinking the prior and the posterior PDF. Each subsequent distribution is\napproximated by updating the particle weights and states, compared with the\nprevious approximation, using a small pre-defined number of Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) proposal steps. Compared with AIS, the ASMC method adaptively\ntunes the tempering between neighboring distributions and performs resampling\nof particles when the variance of the particle weights becomes too large. We\nevaluate ASMC using two different conceptual models and associated synthetic\ncross-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography data. For the most\nchallenging test case, we find that the ASMC method is faster and more reliable\nin locating the posterior PDF than state-of-the-art adaptive MCMC. The evidence\nestimates are found to be robust with respect to the choice of ASMC algorithmic\nvariables and much less sensitive to the model proposal type than MCMC.[...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 12:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

In particular, the problem is a building block in applications\nthat require parallel processing. While the amount of available cores in\nparallel architectures has significantly increased in recent years,\nstate-of-the-art graph partitioning algorithms do not work well if the input\nneeds to be partitioned into a large number of blocks. Often currently\navailable algorithms compute highly imbalanced solutions, solutions of low\nquality, or have excessive running time for this case. This is because most\nhigh-quality general-purpose graph partitioners are multilevel algorithms which\nperform graph coarsening to build a hierarchy of graphs, initial partitioning\nto compute an initial solution, and local improvement to improve the solution\nthroughout the hierarchy. However, for large number of blocks, the smallest\ngraph in the hierarchy that is used for initial partitioning still has to be\nlarge.\n  In this work, we substantially mitigate these problems by introducing deep\nmultilevel graph partitioning and a shared-memory implementation thereof. Our\nscheme continues the multilevel approach deep into initial partitioning --\nintegrating it into a framework where recursive bipartitioning and direct k-way\npartitioning are combined such that they can operate with high performance and\nquality. Our approach is stronger, more flexible, arguably more elegant, and\nreduces bottlenecks for parallelization compared to other multilevel\napproaches. For example, for large number of blocks our algorithm is on average\nan order of magnitude faster than competing algorithms while computing balanced\npartitions with comparable solution quality.

This procedure is a\ngeneric method that is straightforward to apply, in general. Here we consider\nthe application of the method to time to event data and consider the special\ncase when a time-varying covariate is not known or cannot be approximated after\nevent time. In this case, simulations cannot be conducted beyond the end of the\nfollow-up time (event or censoring time) in the original study. Thus, the\nsimulations must be censored at the end of the follow-up time.

Elevated voltages and currents\nneeded to operate NVMs cause aging of CMOS-based transistors in each neuron and\nsynapse circuit in the hardware, drifting the transistor's parameters from\ntheir nominal values. Aggressive device scaling increases power density and\ntemperature, which accelerates the aging, challenging the reliable operation of\nneuromorphic systems. Existing reliability-oriented techniques periodically\nde-stress all neuron and synapse circuits in the hardware at fixed intervals,\nassuming worst-case operating conditions, without actually tracking their aging\nat run time. To de-stress these circuits, normal operation must be interrupted,\nwhich introduces latency in spike generation and propagation, impacting the\ninter-spike interval and hence, performance, e.g., accuracy. We propose a new\narchitectural technique to mitigate the aging-related reliability problems in\nneuromorphic systems, by designing an intelligent run-time manager (NCRTM),\nwhich dynamically destresses neuron and synapse circuits in response to the\nshort-term aging in their CMOS transistors during the execution of machine\nlearning workloads, with the objective of meeting a reliability target.

Fully exploring the information of each view is significant for\nmaking data more representative. However, due to various limitations and\nfailures in data collection and pre-processing, it is inevitable for real data\nto suffer from view missing and data scarcity. The coexistence of these two\nissues makes it more challenging to achieve the pattern classification task.\nCurrently, to our best knowledge, few appropriate methods can well-handle these\ntwo issues simultaneously.

Previous approaches directly estimate shape parameters from a 2D\nor 3D input, and are only able to reproduce simple objects, yet unable to\naccurately parse more complex 3D scenes. In contrast, we propose a robust\nestimator for primitive fitting, which can meaningfully abstract real-world\nenvironments using cuboids. A RANSAC estimator guided by a neural network fits\nthese primitives to 3D features, such as a depth map.

In this study, we argue that SGN is neither Gaussian nor Levy\nstable.

Accordingly, the different convergence\nbehavior of SGD dynamics is well-grounded. Moreover, the first passage time of\nan SDE driven by FBM is approximately derived.

Such topological Wannier\ncycles emerge only if the Wannier centers are enclosed by the flux-carrying\nplaquette. Exploiting acoustic metamaterials and versatile pump-probe\nmeasurements, we observe the topological Wannier cycles by detecting the TBSs\nin various ways and confirm the single-plaquette gauge flux insertion by\nmeasuring the gauge phase accumulation on the plaquette. Our work unveils an\nunprecedented regime for lattice gauge systems and a fundamental topological\nresponse which could empower future studies on artificial gauge fields and\ntopological materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 14:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

To\nimprove those local measures, it is important to be able to compute such\nsparsifiers {locally}.\n  We initiate the study of local algorithms for bounded degree sparsifiers in\nunweighted sparse graphs, focusing on the problems of vertex cover, matching,\nand independent set. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be a slack parameter and $\\alpha \\ge 1$\nbe a density parameter.

Softmax-based approach,\ncurrently the state-of-the-art in face recognition, in its usual \"full softmax\"\nform is not suitable for datasets with millions of persons. Several methods,\nbased on the \"sampled softmax\" approach, were proposed to remove this\nlimitation. These methods, however, have a set of disadvantages. One of them is\na problem of \"prototype obsolescence\": classifier weights (prototypes) of the\nrarely sampled classes receive too scarce gradients and become outdated and\ndetached from the current encoder state, resulting in incorrect training\nsignals. This problem is especially serious in ultra-large-scale datasets. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel face representation learning model called\nPrototype Memory, which alleviates this problem and allows training on a\ndataset of any size. Prototype Memory consists of the limited-size memory\nmodule for storing recent class prototypes and employs a set of algorithms to\nupdate it in appropriate way. New class prototypes are generated on the fly\nusing exemplar embeddings in the current mini-batch. These prototypes are\nenqueued to the memory and used in a role of classifier weights for softmax\nclassification-based training. To prevent obsolescence and keep the memory in\nclose connection with the encoder, prototypes are regularly refreshed, and\noldest ones are dequeued and disposed of. Prototype Memory is computationally\nefficient and independent of dataset size. It can be used with various loss\nfunctions, hard example mining algorithms and encoder architectures. We prove\nthe effectiveness of the proposed model by extensive experiments on popular\nface recognition benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 15:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 17:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

However, the applications are still restricted to\nsimple geometries with Cartesian or curvilinear meshes. In this work, a new\nclass of high-order shock-capturing TENO schemes for unstructured meshes are\nproposed. Similar to the standard TENO schemes and some variants of WENO\nschemes, the candidate stencils include one large stencil and several small\nthird-order stencils. Following a strong scale-separation procedure, a tailored\nnovel ENO-like stencil selection strategy is proposed such that the high-order\naccuracy is restored in smooth regions by selecting the candidate\nreconstruction on the large stencil while the ENO property is enforced near\ndiscontinuities by adopting the candidate reconstruction from smooth small\nstencils. The nonsmooth stencils containing genuine discontinuities are\nexplicitly excluded from the final reconstruction, leading to excellent\nnumerical stability. Different from the WENO concept, such unique sharp stencil\nselection retains the low numerical dissipation without sacrificing the\nshock-capturing capability. The newly proposed framework enables arbitrarily\nhigh-order TENO reconstructions on unstructured meshes. For conceptual\nverification, the TENO schemes with third- to sixth-order accuracy are\nconstructed. Without parameter tuning case by case, the performance of the\nproposed TENO schemes is demonstrated by examining a set of benchmark cases\nwith broadband flow length scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 15:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 07:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

We build upon our earlier analysis, where projections\nwere made from November 2020 onwards. We use our simulator to conduct an\nextensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through\nvarying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance,\ninfectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and\ninfection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain\nthe second wave fatality numbers. We observe and highlight that timings of peak\nand valley of the fatalities in the second wave are robust to many plausible\nscenarios, suggesting that they are likely to be accurate projections for\nMumbai. During the second wave, the observed fatalities were low in February\nand mid-March and saw a phase change or a steep increase in the growth rate\nafter around late March. We conduct extensive experiments to replicate this\nobserved sharp convexity.

The main result of\nthe paper shows that the colliding two particle classical Hamiltonian energy\ncan be represented in four weighted individual particle in symmetric and\nanti-symmetric (osmotic) terms similar to the quadratic Nelson measure used in\nthe derivation of the Schrodinger wave function. Following Nelson, if the\nsecond particle behavior can be captured in a potential and the ingoing and\noutgoing velocities of the main particle are modelled using stochastic\ndifferential equations the motion of the main particle satisfies the\nSchrodinger's equation. The diffusion variance of this equation is replaced by\na related ratio of masses and the assumed variance. The first example attempts\nto reconcile this result with quantum mechanics by considering the Schrodinger\nequation in the presence of only one type of incident particle. The main\nparticle energy levels become multiples of the incident particle and the energy\nexpression for the entire system agrees with quantum mechanics but there are\ndifferences with the stochastic equation. The Schrodinger equation can also be\nused to represent corrections for Newton's equation and suggests a user profile\nto be used in the search for Dark Matter. An alternative solution to the\ncollision model also shows relativistic properties as the interactions suggest\ncorrections to the Minkowski equation in Einstein's Special Relativity.

Some\nof these choices are small, like what route to take to work, or what music to\nlisten to. Others are big, like what treatment to administer for a disease or\nhow long to sentence someone for a crime. If AI can assist with these big\ndecisions, we might think it can also help with hard choices, cases where\nalternatives are neither better, worse nor equal but on a par. The aim of this\npaper, however, is to show that this view is mistaken: the fact of parity shows\nthat there are hard limits on AI in decision making and choices that AI cannot,\nand should not, resolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 22:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}
