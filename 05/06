A major challenge in battery fault detection arises from the effect of\nuncertainties originating from sensor inaccuracies, nominal aging, or\nunmodelled dynamics. Inspired by physics-based learning, we explore a detection\nparadigm that combines physics-based models, model-based detection observers,\nand data-driven learning techniques to address this challenge. Specifically, we\nconstruct the {detection} observers based on an experimentally identified\nelectrochemical-thermal model, and subsequently design the observer tuning\nparameters following Lyapunov's stability theory. Furthermore, we utilize\nGaussian Process Regression technique to learn the model and measurement\nuncertainties which in turn aid the {detection} observers in distinguishing\nfaults and uncertainties.

This work addresses this issue by introducing an\nanchor-box free and single-shot instance segmentation framework, termed\nPolarMask, which reformulates the instance segmentation problem as predicting\nthe contours of objects in the polar coordinate, with several appealing\nbenefits. (1) The polar representation unifies instance segmentation (masks)\nand object detection (bounding boxes) into a single framework, reducing the\ndesign and computational complexity. (2) Two modules are carefully designed\n(i.e. soft polar centerness and polar IoU loss) to sample high-quality center\nexamples and optimize polar contour regression, making the performance of\nPolarMask does not depend on the bounding box prediction results and thus\nbecomes more efficient in training. (3) PolarMask is fully convolutional and\ncan be easily embedded into most off-the-shelf detection methods.

Gathering sufficient high quality ground-truth data is\ndifficult, especially when targets are of irregular shape or difficult to\ndistinguish from background or neighboring objects. Tree crown delineation\nprovides key information from remote sensing images for forestry, ecology, and\nmanagement. However, tree crowns in remote sensing imagery are often difficult\nto label and annotate due to irregular shape, overlapping canopies, shadowing,\nand indistinct edges. There are also multiple approaches to annotation in this\nfield (e.g., rectangular boxes vs. convex polygons) that further contribute to\nannotation imprecision. However, current evaluation methods do not account for\nthis uncertainty in annotations, and quantitative metrics for evaluation can\nvary across multiple annotators. In this paper, we address these limitations by\ndeveloping an adaptation of the Rand index for weakly-labeled crown delineation\nthat we call RandCrowns. Our new RandCrowns evaluation metric provides a method\nto appropriately evaluate delineated tree crowns while taking into account\nimprecision in the ground-truth delineations. The RandCrowns metric\nreformulates the Rand index by adjusting the areas over which each term of the\nindex is computed to account for uncertain and imprecise object delineation\nlabels. Quantitative comparisons to the commonly used intersection over union\nmethod shows a decrease in the variance generated by differences among multiple\nannotators. Combined with qualitative examples, our results suggest that the\nRandCrowns metric is more robust for scoring target delineations in the\npresence of uncertainty and imprecision in annotations that are inherent to\ntree crown delineation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 16:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 17:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 17:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

One\nof the most important such tests are constraints on the post-Newtonian (PN)\ncorrections to the phase of the gravitational wave signal. The values of these\nPN coefficients can be calculated within standard general relativity, and these\nvalues are different in many alternate theories of gravity. It is clearly of\ngreat interest to constrain these deviations based on gravitational wave\nobservations. In the majority of such tests which have been carried out, and\nwhich yield by far the most stringent constraints, it is common to vary these\nPN coefficients individually. While this might in principle be useful for\ndetecting certain deviations from standard general relativity, it is a serious\nlimitation.

We build on the idea of view synthesis, which uses classical\ncamera geometry to re-render a source image from a different point-of-view,\nspecified by a predicted relative pose and depth map. By minimizing the error\nbetween the synthetic image and the corresponding real image in a video, the\ndeep network that predicts pose and depth can be trained completely\nunsupervised. However, the view synthesis equations rely on a strong\nassumption: that objects do not move. This rigid-world assumption limits the\npredictive power, and rules out learning about objects automatically. We\npropose a simple solution: minimize the error on small regions of the image\ninstead. While the scene as a whole may be non-rigid, it is always possible to\nfind small regions that are approximately rigid, such as inside a moving\nobject. Our network can then predict different poses for each region, in a\nsliding window from a learned dense pose map. This represents a significantly\nricher model, including 6D object motions, with little additional complexity.\nWe achieve very competitive performance on unsupervised odometry and depth\nprediction on KITTI.

In this manuscript, we employ a non-Hermitian\nshortcut by way of a tailored gain and loss to violate the adiabatic limit and,\ntherefore, to achieve superfast modal transformations. A quantitative condition\nfor adiabaticity is firstly derived and numerically verified for a pair of\nweakly coupled time-dependent mechanical oscillators, which can be interpreted\nin the light of modal interaction between crossing states. It is shown that for\nsufficiently slow time-modulation, the elastic energy can be transferred from\none oscillator to the other.

Our PD-GAN is built upon a\nvanilla GAN which generates images based on random noise. During image\ngeneration, we modulate deep features of input random noise from coarse-to-fine\nby injecting an initially restored image and the hole regions in multiple\nscales. We argue that during hole filling, the pixels near the hole boundary\nshould be more deterministic (i.e., with higher probability trusting the\ncontext and initially restored image to create natural inpainting boundary),\nwhile those pixels lie in the center of the hole should enjoy more degrees of\nfreedom (i.e., more likely to depend on the random noise for enhancing\ndiversity).

SPDNorm dynamically\nbalances the realism and diversity inside the hole region, making the generated\ncontent more diverse towards the hole center and resemble neighboring image\ncontent more towards the hole boundary.

Likewise, decreasing $\\chi$ or\nincreasing the NP size can result in a more elongated NP. However, when the\nsolvent has a preference towards the A or B blocks, the NP shape changes from\nstriped ellipsoid to onion-like sphere by increasing the A/B preference\nparameter strength. The critical condition of the transition from an L$_\\perp$\nto C$_\\parallel$ phase has been identified. Our results are in good agreement\nwith previous experiments, and some of our predictions could be tested in\nfuture experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 17:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Especially\nfor the brighter ACV variables, continuous observations over about a century\nare available, which are important to study long-term effects such as period\nchanges or magnetic cycles in these objects. The present work presents an\nanalysis of 165 Ap/CP2 and He-weak/CP4 stars using light curves obtained by the\nSolar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) between the years 2003 and 2011. These data\nfill an important gap in observations for bright ACV variables between the\nHipparcos and TESS satellite missions. Using specifically tailored data\ntreatment and period search approaches, we find variability in the accuracy\nlimit of the employed data in 84 objects. The derived periods are in excellent\nagreement with the literature; for one star, the here presented solution\nrepresents the first published period. We discuss the apparently constant stars\nand the corresponding level of non-variability. From an investigation of our\ntarget star sample in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we deduce ages between\n100 Myr and 1 Gyr for the majority of our sample stars. Our results support\nthat the variable CP2/4 stars are in a more advanced evolutionary state and\nthat He and Si peculiarities, preferentially found in the hotter, and thus more\nmassive, CP stars, produce larger spots or spots of higher contrast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 17:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Physics-based traditional methods,\nas well as black box deep learning models, have been developed. The existing\ndeep networks have exploited training to achieve a new state of the art;\nhowever, they may perform poorly when training is limited or does not represent\nproblem phenomenology, such as the addition or removal of dense shadows. We\npropose a model which enriches neural networks with physical insight. More\nprecisely, our method generates the relighted image with new illumination\nsettings via two different strategies and subsequently fuses them using a\nweight map (w). In the first strategy, our model predicts the material\nreflectance parameters (albedo) and illumination/geometry parameters of the\nscene (shading) for the relit image (we refer to this strategy as intrinsic\nimage decomposition (IID)). The second strategy is solely based on the black\nbox approach, where the model optimizes its weights based on the ground-truth\nimages and the loss terms in the training stage and generates the relit output\ndirectly (we refer to this strategy as direct). While our proposed method\napplies to both one-to-one and any-to-any relighting problems, for each case we\nintroduce problem-specific components that enrich the model performance: 1) For\none-to-one relighting we incorporate normal vectors of the surfaces in the\nscene to adjust gloss and shadows accordingly in the image. 2) For any-to-any\nrelighting, we propose an additional multiscale block to the architecture to\nenhance feature extraction.

Infrared spectroscopy of star and planet forming regions is at the\ndawn of a new age with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

This study aims to provide reference spectra to firmly detect icy\nmethyl formate in the different stages of star and planet forming regions.\nMethyl formate is mixed in astronomically relevant matrices, and the peak\npositions, FWHMs, and relative band intensities are characterized for different\ntemperatures to provide an analytical tool for astronomers.\n  Methods. Methyl formate is deposited at 15 K under high-vacuum conditions.\nSpecifically, methyl formate is deposited pure and mixed with CO, H$_2$CO,\nCH$_3$OH, H$_2$O, and CO:H$_2$CO:CH$_3$OH combined.

Following this stage, the CE is\nthought to be ejected, leaving behind a compact binary (or a merger product).\nAlthough extensively studied, the CEE process is still little understood, and\nalthough most binaries have non-negligible eccentricity, the effect of initial\neccentricity on the CEE has been little explored. Moreover, most studies assume\na complete circularization of the orbit by the CE onset, while observationally\nsuch eccentricities are detected in many post-CE binaries. Here we use smoothed\nparticle hydro-dynamical simulations (SPH) to study the evolution of initially\neccentric ($0\\le e\\le0.95$) CE-systems. We find that initially eccentric\nbinaries only partially circularize. In addition, higher initial eccentricity\nleads to a higher eccentricity following the end of the inspiral phase, with\neccentricities as high as 0.18 in the most eccentric cases, and even higher if\nthe initial peri-center of the orbit is located inside the star (e.g. following\na kick into an eccentric orbit, rather than a smooth transition). CEE of more\neccentric binaries leads to enhanced dynamical mass-loss of the CE compared\nwith more circular binaries, and depends on the initial closest approach of the\nbinary. We show that our results and the observed eccentricities of post-CE\nbinaries suggest that the typical assumptions of circular orbits following CEE\nmight potentially be revised.

A primary motivation is the observed\nBaryonic Tully-Fisher Relation in which the mass of galaxies increases as the\nquartic power of rotation speed. This scaling is not obviously accounted for by\nstandard cold dark matter. This has prompted the development of dark matter\nmodels that exhibit some form of so-called MONDian phenomenology to account for\nthis galactic scaling, while also recovering the success of cold dark matter on\nlarge scales. A beautiful example of this are the so-called superfluid dark\nmatter models, in which a complex bosonic field undergoes spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking on galactic scales, entering a superfluid phase with a 3/2 kinetic\nscaling in the low energy effective theory, that mediates a long-ranged MONDian\nforce. In this work we examine the causality and locality properties of these\nand other related models. We show that the Lorentz invariant completions of the\nsuperfluid models exhibit high energy perturbations that violate global\nhyperbolicity of the equations of motion in the MOND regime and can be\nsuperluminal in other parts of phase space. We also examine a range of\nalternate models, finding that they also exhibit forms of non-locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 19:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

An\nimportant related question concerns the stability of spin liquids in the\npresence of small perturbations in the Hamiltonian. In this respect, the\nmagnetoelastic interaction between spins and phonons represents a relevant and\nphysically motivated perturbation, which has been scarcely investigated so far.\nIn this work, we study the effect of the spin-phonon coupling on prototypical\nmodels of frustrated magnetism.

In this\npaper, we aim to generalize the impact of horizontal and vertical mixing on the\nchemistry of exoplanet atmospheres over a large parameter space. We do this by\napplying a sequence of post-processed forward models for a large grid of\nsynchronously rotating gaseous exoplanets, where we vary the effective\ntemperature (between 400 K and 2600 K), surface gravity, and rotation rate. We\nfind that there is a dichotomy in the horizontal homogeneity of the chemical\nabundances.

Furthermore, we find that the planet's rotation\nrate impacts the planetary climate, and thus also the molecular abundances and\ntransmission spectrum. By employing a hierarchical modelling approach, we\nassess the relative importance of disequilibrium chemistry on the exoplanet\ntransmission spectrum, and conclude that the temperature has the most profound\nimpact.

Recent developments\nof Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivate endeavors to design GNN-based social\nrecommendation frameworks to aggregate both social and user-item interaction\ninformation simultaneously. However, most existing methods neglect the social\ninconsistency problem, which intuitively suggests that social links are not\nnecessarily consistent with the rating prediction process. Social inconsistency\ncan be observed from both context-level and relation-level. Therefore, we\nintend to empower the GNN model with the ability to tackle the social\ninconsistency problem. We propose to sample consistent neighbors by relating\nsampling probability with consistency scores between neighbors. Besides, we\nemploy the relation attention mechanism to assign consistent relations with\nhigh importance factors for aggregation.

Existing computer models (Boltzmann codes) such\nas CLASS can provide it at the expense of immoderate computational cost. In\nthis paper, we propose a fast Bayesian method to generate the 3D matter power\nspectrum, for a given set of wavenumbers, $k$ and redshifts, $z$. Our code\nallows one to calculate the following quantities: the linear matter power\nspectrum at a given redshift (the default is set to 0); the non-linear 3D\nmatter power spectrum with/without baryon feedback; the weak lensing power\nspectrum. The gradient of the 3D matter power spectrum with respect to the\ninput cosmological parameters is also returned and this is useful for\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers. The derivatives are also useful for Fisher\nmatrix calculations. In our application, the emulator is accurate when\nevaluated at a set of cosmological parameters, drawn from the prior, with the\nfractional uncertainty, $\\Delta P_{\\delta}/P_{\\delta}$ centred on 0. It is also\n$\\sim 300$ times faster compared to CLASS, hence making the emulator amenable\nto sampling cosmological and nuisance parameters in a Monte Carlo routine. In\naddition, once the 3D matter power spectrum is calculated, it can be used with\na specific redshift distribution, $n(z)$ to calculate the weak lensing and\nintrinsic alignment power spectra, which can then be used to derive constraints\non cosmological parameters in a weak lensing data analysis problem.

Arianna+ provides a flexible interface between the\ninputs and outputs of procedures and statements, which are atomic\nrepresentations of ontological knowledge. Arianna+ schedules procedures on the\nbasis of events by employing logic-based reasoning, i.e., by checking the\nclassification of certain statements in the ontologies.

Here we consider the problem of finding a short quantum circuit\nimplementing a given Clifford group element. Our methods aim to minimize the\nentangling gate count assuming all-to-all qubit connectivity. First, we\nconsider circuit optimization based on template matching and design\nClifford-specific templates that leverage the ability to factor out Pauli and\nSWAP gates. Second, we introduce a symbolic peephole optimization method. It\nworks by projecting the full circuit onto a small subset of qubits and\noptimally recompiling the projected subcircuit via dynamic programming. CNOT\ngates coupling the chosen subset of qubits with the remaining qubits are\nexpressed using symbolic Pauli gates.

We describe each afterglow spectrum by a\nthree-parameter model. First, L characterizes the size of the ionized region\n(the \"bubble size\") around a GRB host halo. Second, $\\langle{x_{\\rm\nHI}\\rangle}$ is the volume-averaged neutral fraction outside of the ionized\nbubble around the GRB, which is approximated as spatially uniform. Finally,\n$N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ denotes the column-density of a local damped Lyman-alpha\nabsorber (DLA) associated with the GRB host galaxy. The size distribution of\nionized regions is extracted from a numerical simulation of reionization, and\nevolves strongly across the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The model DLA column\ndensities follow the empirical distribution determined from current GRB\nafterglow spectra. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the\n$\\langle{x_{\\rm HI}(z)\\rangle}$ constraints that can be obtained from follow-up\nspectroscopy of afterglows with SNR = 20 per R=3,000 resolution element at the\ncontinuum.

It is also important that models are built\nfrom waveforms in the same BMS frame. Up until now, however, the BMS frame of\nnumerical waveforms has not been thoroughly examined, largely because the\nnecessary tools have not existed. In this paper, we show how to analyze and map\nto a suitable BMS frame for numerical waveforms calculated with the Spectral\nEinstein Code (SpEC). However, the methods and tools that we present are\ngeneral and can be applied to any numerical waveforms. We present an extensive\nstudy of 13 binary black hole systems that broadly span parameter space. From\nthese simulations, we extract the strain and also the Weyl scalars using both\nSpECTRE's Cauchy-characteristic extraction module and also the standard\nextrapolation procedure with a displacement memory correction applied during\npostprocessing. First, we show that the current center-of-mass correction used\nto map these waveforms to the center-of-mass frame is not as effective as\npreviously thought. Consequently, we also develop an improved correction that\nutilizes asymptotic Poincar\\'e charges instead of a Newtonian center-of-mass\ntrajectory. Next, we map our waveforms to the post-Newtonian (PN) BMS frame\nusing a PN strain waveform. This helps us find the unique BMS transformation\nthat minimizes the $L^{2}$ norm of the difference between the numerical and PN\nstrain waveforms during the early inspiral phase. We find that once the\nwaveforms are mapped to the PN BMS frame, they can be hybridized with a PN\nstrain waveform much more effectively than if one used any of the previous\nalignment schemes, which only utilize the Poincar\\'e transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 19:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 17:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 17:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

The large\nsolubility range of carbon in boron, between $\\approx$ 9% and 20%, stems from\nthe thermodynamical stability of three icosahedral phases at low temperature,\nwith respective carbon atomic concentrations: 8.7% (B$_{10.5}$C, named\nOPO$_1$), 13.0 \\% (B$_{6.7}$C, named OPO$_2$), whose theoretical Raman spectra\nare still unknown, and 20% (B$_4$C), from which the nature of some of the Raman\npeaks are still debated. We report theoretical and experimental results of the\nfirst order, non-resonant, Raman spectrum of boron carbide. Density functional\nperturbation theory enables us to obtain the Raman spectra of the OPO$_1$ and\nOPO$_2$ phases, which are perfectly ordered structures with a complex\ncrystalline motif of 414 atoms, due to charge compensation effects. Moreover,\nfor the carbon-rich B$_4$C, with a simpler 15-atom unit cell, we study the\ninfluence of the low energy point defects and of their concentrations on the\nRaman spectrum, in connection with experiments, thus providing insights into\nthe sensitivity of experime ntal spectra to sample preparation, experimental\nconditions and setup.

We apply our model to the case of a circumbinary planet and use a\nKepler-38 like binary system as a working example. We find that, in this low\nplanetary eccentricity case, the most likely final stationary rotation state is\nthe 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, considering an arbitrary planetary viscosity\ninside the estimated range for the solar system planets. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the mean rotational stationary state, based on high-order power\nseries of the semimajor axes ratio a1 /a2 and low-order expansions of the\neccentricities. These are found to reproduce very accurately the mean behaviour\nof the low-eccentric numerical integrations for arbitrary planetary relaxation\nfactors, and up to a1/a2 \\sim 0.4.

A mixed multigraph $G$\ncan be oriented to a strongly connected digraph if and only if $G$ is\nbridgeless and strongly connected [Boesch and Tindell, Am. Math.

We improve the current best\nupper bound of $4r^2+4r$ on $f(r)$ [Chung, Garey and Tarjan, Networks, 1985] to\n$1.5 r^2 + r + 1$.

The key concept is to (1)\nleverage splines to interpolate locally the dynamics, perform analytical\ndifferentiation and build the library of candidate terms, (2) employ sparse\nrepresentation of the governing equations, and (3) use the physics residual in\nturn to inform the spline learning.

The resulting joint\ndynamical system gives rise to a weakly-coupled partially observable Markov\ndecision process driven by recommender actions and user feedback to providers.\nWe then build a REINFORCE recommender agent, coined EcoAgent, to optimize a\njoint objective of user utility and the counterfactual utility lift of the\nprovider associated with the recommended content, which we show to be\nequivalent to maximizing overall user utility and the utilities of all\nproviders on the platform under some mild assumptions. To evaluate our\napproach, we introduce a simulation environment capturing the key interactions\namong users, providers, and the recommender. We offer a number of simulated\nexperiments that shed light on both the benefits and the limitations of our\napproach. These results help understand how and when a provider-aware\nrecommender agent is of benefit in building multi-stakeholder recommender\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 00:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

For this, we follow recent statistical\ndevelopments on health outcomes research and conceptualize the task of quality\nmeasurement as a causal inference problem, helping to target flexible covariate\nprofiles that can represent specific populations of interest. To our knowledge,\nsuch covariate profiles have not been used in the quality measurement\nliterature. We use different clinically relevant covariate profiles and\nevaluate methods for layered case-mix adjustments that combine weighting and\nregression modeling approaches in a sequential manner in order to reduce model\nextrapolation and allow for provider effect modification. We appraise these\nmethods in an extensive simulation study and highlight the practical utility of\nweighting methods that warn the investigator when case-mix adjustments are\ninfeasible without some form of extrapolation that goes beyond the support of\nthe data.

To benefit from such library evolution, the programmers of\nclient projects have to repetitively upgrade their library usages and adapt\ntheir codebases to any library API breaking changes (e.g., API renaming). Such\nadaptive changes can be tedious and error-prone. Existing tools provide limited\nsupport to help programmers migrate client projects from old library versions\nto new ones. For instance, some tools extract API mappings be-tween library\nversions and only suggest simple adaptive changes (i.e., statement updates);\nother tools suggest or automate more complicated edits (e.g., statement\ninsertions) based on user-provided exemplar code migrations. However, when new\nlibrary versions are available, it is usually cumbersome and time-consuming for\nusers to provide sufficient human-crafted samples in order to guide automatic\nmigration.

However, due to the different\nsensors' locations, characteristics and acquisition time, PAN and MS image\npairs often tend to have various amounts of misalignment. Conventional\ndeep-learning-based methods that were trained with such misaligned PAN-MS image\npairs suffer from diverse artifacts such as double-edge and blur artifacts in\nthe resultant PAN-sharpened images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\ncalled shift-invariant pan-sharpening with moving object alignment (SIPSA-Net)\nwhich is the first method to take into account such large misalignment of\nmoving object regions for PAN sharpening. The SISPA-Net has a feature alignment\nmodule (FAM) that can adjust one feature to be aligned to another feature, even\nbetween the two different PAN and MS domains. For better alignment in\npan-sharpened images, a shift-invariant spectral loss is newly designed, which\nignores the inherent misalignment in the original MS input, thereby having the\nsame effect as optimizing the spectral loss with a well-aligned MS image.\nExtensive experimental results show that our SIPSA-Net can generate\npan-sharpened images with remarkable improvements in terms of visual quality\nand alignment, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 02:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

The VSI drives turbulence with strong vertical\nmotions, which could regulate the dust growth and settling. However, dust\ngrowth and settling can regulate the VSI because dust depletion makes gas\ncooling inefficient in outer disk regions that are optically thin to their own\nthermal emission. In this study, we quantify this potentially stabilizing\neffects of dust evolution on the VSI based on the linear analysis. We construct\na model for calculating the cooling timescale, taking into account dust growth\nbeyond micron sizes and size-dependent settling. Combining the model with the\nlinear stability analysis, we map the region where the VSI operates, which we\ncall the VSI zone, and estimate the maximum growth rate at each radial\nposition. We find that dust growth as well as settling makes the VSI zone more\nconfined around the midplane. This causes a decrease in the growth rate because\nthe vertical shear of the rotation velocity, which is the source of the\ninstability, is weaker at lower altitude. In our default disk model with 0.01\nsolar masses, dust growth from 10 micron to 1 mm causes a decrease in the\ngrowth rate by a factor of more than 10. The suppression of VSI-driven\nturbulence by dust evolution may promote further dust evolution in the outer\nregions and also explain a high degree of dust settling observed in the disk\naround HL Tau.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 02:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Most Siamese\ntrackers carry out similarity learning via cross correlation that originates\nfrom the image matching field. However, unlike 2-D image matching, the matching\nnetwork in object tracking requires 4-D information (height, width, channel and\ntime). Cross correlation neglects the information from channel and time\ndimensions, and thus produces ambiguous matching. This paper proposes a\nspatio-temporal matching process to thoroughly explore the capability of 4-D\nmatching in space (height, width and channel) and time. In spatial matching, we\nintroduce a space-variant channel-guided correlation (SVC-Corr) to recalibrate\nchannel-wise feature responses for each spatial location, which can guide the\ngeneration of the target-aware matching features. In temporal matching, we\ninvestigate the time-domain context relations of the target and the background\nand develop an aberrance repressed module (ARM). By restricting the abrupt\nalteration in the interframe response maps, our ARM can clearly suppress\naberrances and thus enables more robust and accurate object tracking.\nFurthermore, a novel anchor-free tracking framework is presented to accommodate\nthese innovations.

This\npaper studies a safe and reliable time-varying output formation tracking\nproblem of linear multi-agent systems, where an attacker adversely injects any\nunbounded time-varying signals (false data injection (FDI) attacks), while an\ninterruption of communication channels between the agents is caused by an\nunreliable network.

A horizontal resolution of 0.1o is adopted to resolve a range of\nmesoscale features. In order to parametrize the vertical mixing, K-Profile\nParametrization (KPP) scheme is implemented. The results show successful\nimplementation of OBC in a regional domain with exchange of mass and energy and\nconservation of mass at the boundaries. The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and\nSea Surface Salinity (SSS) are validated with SODA reanalysis, which are found\nto be in good agreement. The Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) pattern is very well\nrepresented, albeit the magnitude is slightly under-predicted in comparison\nwith SODA reanalysis. Additionally, analysis of flow energetics reveal regional\ndifferences in turbulent kinetic energy (K), production flux (P), buoyancy flux\n(B), and dissipation ({\\epsilon}). Our results clearly reveal the presence of\ninverse energy-cascade in the southern Bay of Bengal, wherein energy flows back\ninto mean flow structures from the turbulent eddies. The re-energization of\nmean flow structures is likely to allow the large-scale circulation to persist\nfor longer periods, thereby modifying the local dynamics.

Recently, both optimization-based and\nlearning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging\ndifferentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the\ndifferentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simplifies the\nrealistic mechanism of the illumination, reflection, \\etc, of the real world,\nthus cannot produce realistic images. This brings a lot of domain-shift noise\nto the optimization or training process. In this work, we introduce a novel\nGenerative Adversarial Renderer (GAR) and propose to tailor its inverted\nversion to the general fitting pipeline, to tackle the above problem.\nSpecifically, the carefully designed neural renderer takes a face normal map\nand a latent code representing other factors as inputs and renders a realistic\nface image. Since the GAR learns to model the complicated real-world image,\ninstead of relying on the simplified graphics rules, it is capable of producing\nrealistic images, which essentially inhibits the domain-shift noise in training\nand optimization. Equipped with the elaborated GAR, we further proposed a novel\napproach to predict 3D face parameters, in which we first obtain fine initial\nparameters via Renderer Inverting and then refine it with gradient-based\noptimizers. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed generative adversarial renderer and the novel\noptimization-based face reconstruction framework.

The weakly\nsupervised temporal localization problem investigates whether this task can be\nadequately solved with only video-level labels, significantly reducing the\namount of expensive and error-prone annotation that is required. A common\napproach is to train a frame-level classifier where frames with the highest\nclass probability are selected to make a video-level prediction. Frame level\nactivations are then used for localization. However, the absence of frame-level\nannotations cause the classifier to impart class bias on every frame.

Previous singing\nacoustic models adopt a simple loss (e.g., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from\nover-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the\nnaturalness of synthesized singing. In this work, we propose DiffSinger, an\nacoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger\nis a parameterized Markov chain that iteratively converts the noise into\nmel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing\nvariational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generate realistic\noutputs. To further improve the voice quality and speed up inference, we\nintroduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior\nknowledge learned by the simple loss. Specifically, DiffSinger starts\ngeneration at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps,\naccording to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth\nmel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder.\nBesides, we propose boundary prediction methods to locate the intersection and\ndetermine the shallow step adaptively. The evaluations conducted on a Chinese\nsinging dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS\nwork.

In this work, we develop a neural technique for\narticulating 3D characters using enveloping with a pre-defined skeletal\nstructure which produces high quality pose dependent deformations. Our\nframework learns to rig and skin characters with the same articulation\nstructure (e.g., bipeds or quadrupeds), and builds the desired skeleton\nhierarchy into the network architecture. Furthermore, we propose neural blend\nshapes--a set of corrective pose-dependent shapes which improve the deformation\nquality in the joint regions in order to address the notorious artifacts\nresulting from standard rigging and skinning. Our system estimates neural blend\nshapes for input meshes with arbitrary connectivity, as well as weighting\ncoefficients which are conditioned on the input joint rotations. Unlike recent\ndeep learning techniques which supervise the network with ground-truth rigging\nand skinning parameters, our approach does not assume that the training data\nhas a specific underlying deformation model. Instead, during training, the\nnetwork observes deformed shapes and learns to infer the corresponding rig,\nskin and blend shapes using indirect supervision.

Alloying different\nplasmonic metals can overcome this limitation, at the expense of using a high\ntemperature alloying process, which adversely destroys the nanostructure shape.\nHere, we develop a low temperature alloying process at only 300{\\deg}C and\nfabricate Au-Ag nanostructures with a broad diversity of shapes, aspect ratios\nand stoichiometries.

Varying the alloy stoichiometry tunes the optical\nresponse of the nanostructure and controls spectral features such as Fano\nresonances.

To address this problem, we present PoseAug, a new\nauto-augmentation framework that learns to augment the available training poses\ntowards a greater diversity and thus improve generalization of the trained\n2D-to-3D pose estimator. Specifically, PoseAug introduces a novel pose\naugmentor that learns to adjust various geometry factors (e.g., posture, body\nsize, view point and position) of a pose through differentiable operations.\nWith such differentiable capacity, the augmentor can be jointly optimized with\nthe 3D pose estimator and take the estimation error as feedback to generate\nmore diverse and harder poses in an online manner. Moreover, PoseAug introduces\na novel part-aware Kinematic Chain Space for evaluating local joint-angle\nplausibility and develops a discriminative module accordingly to ensure the\nplausibility of the augmented poses. These elaborate designs enable PoseAug to\ngenerate more diverse yet plausible poses than existing offline augmentation\nmethods, and thus yield better generalization of the pose estimator. PoseAug is\ngeneric and easy to be applied to various 3D pose estimators. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PoseAug brings clear improvements on both\nintra-scenario and cross-scenario datasets.

Specifically, we attack a tracker by adding a universal imperceptible\nperturbation to the template image and adding a fake target, i.e., a small\nuniversal adversarial patch, into the search images adhering to the predefined\ntrajectory, so that the tracker outputs the location and size of the fake\ntarget instead of the real target. Our approach allows perturbing a novel video\nto come at no additional cost except the mere addition operations -- and not\nrequire gradient optimization or network inference. Experimental results on\nseveral datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively fool the Siamese\ntrackers in a targeted attack manner.

Especially concerning the latter, the analysis of\nfacial expressions represents a very active research area due to its relevance\nto human-computer interaction applications. In such a context, Facial\nExpression Recognition (FER) is the task of recognizing expressions on human\nfaces. Typically, face images are acquired by cameras that have, by nature,\ndifferent characteristics, such as the output resolution. It has been already\nshown in the literature that Deep Learning models applied to face recognition\nexperience a degradation in their performance when tested against\nmulti-resolution scenarios. Since the FER task involves analyzing face images\nthat can be acquired with heterogeneous sources, thus involving images with\ndifferent quality, it is plausible to expect that resolution plays an important\nrole in such a case too. Stemming from such a hypothesis, we prove the benefits\nof multi-resolution training for models tasked with recognizing facial\nexpressions. Hence, we propose a two-step learning procedure, named MAFER, to\ntrain DCNNs to empower them to generate robust predictions across a wide range\nof resolutions. A relevant feature of MAFER is that it is task-agnostic, i.e.,\nit can be used complementarily to other objective-related techniques. To assess\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach, we performed an extensive\nexperimental campaign on publicly available datasets: \\fer{}, \\raf{}, and\n\\oulu{}. For a multi-resolution context, we observe that with our approach,\nlearning models improve upon the current SotA while reporting comparable\nresults in fix-resolution contexts.

The\nline-graph of $G$, denoted by $L(G)$, is defined by having its vertex-set equal\nto the edge-set of $G$ and two vertices of $L(G)$ are adjacent if the\ncorresponding edges are adjacent in $G$. For a positive integer $k$, the\niterated line-graph $L^k(G)$ is defined recursively by $L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$.\nWe consider fifteen graph parameters and study their behaviour when the\noperation of taking the line-graph is iterated. We shall first show that all of\nthese parameters are unbounded. This idea is motivated by a well-known result\nof van Rooij and Wilf that says that the number of vertices is unbounded if and\nonly if the graph is prolific. We then study of the value of $k(P,{\\mathcal\nF})$, which is the index of a family of prolific graphs with regards to a given\ngraph parameter $P(G)$. For a given parameter $P(G)$, the index of $G$ is\ndenoted by $ind(P,G) = \\min \\{ r : P(G) < P(L^r(G) \\}$.

The problem of determining the index of\na parameter over the family of prolific graphs is motivated by a result of\nChartrand who showed that it could require $k=|V(G)|-3$ iterations for $L^k(G)$\nto have a hamiltonian cycle. For twelve of the parameters considered, we\nexactly determine $k(P,\\mathcal F)$ where $\\mathcal F$ is the family of all\nprolific graphs, and for some parameters we also characterize the class of\nprolific graphs realizing the extremal value $k(P,\\mathcal F$). Interesting\nopen problems remain, in particular completing the determination of\n$k(P,\\mathcal F)$ for the three parameters: the independence number,\nindependent domination number and domination number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 07:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 14:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 09:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

We\nfirst introduce tight-binding models on cubic lattice that belong to these five\nnonstandard symmetry classes respectively. Unlike the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nHamiltonian for superconductors, all the five models have finite areas of Fermi\nsurfaces in the momentum space in the clean limit. Thereby, the scaling theory\nof the Anderson transition guarantees the presence of the\ndelocalization-localization transitions at finite disorder strength in these\nmodels. Based on this expectation, we carry out extensive transfer matrix\ncalculations of the Lyapunov exponents for zero-energy eigenstates of the\ndisordered tight-binding models with quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Near the\nAnderson transition point, the correlation length diverges with a universal\ncritical exponent $\\nu$.

When various biological processes occur (survival, reproduction,\nmigration, etc.), the trait distribution may change with respect to time and\nspace. In the context of invasions, when considering the evolution of a\nheritable trait that encodes the dispersive ability of individuals, the trait\ndistribution develops a particular spatial structure that leads to the\nacceleration of the front propagation. That phenomenon is known as spatial\nsorting. Many biological examples can be cited like the bush cricket in\nBritain, the cane toad invasion in Australia or the common myna one in South\nAfrica. Adopting this framework, recent mathematical studies have led to\nhighlight the influence of the reproductive mode on the front propagation.\nAsexual populations have been shown to spread with an asymptotic rate of t 3/2\nin a minimal reactiondiffusion model, whereas the analogous rate for sexual\npopulations is of t 5/4 (where t denotes the time). However, the precise\ndescription of the behaviour of the front propagation in the sexual case is\nstill an open question. The aim of this paper is to give precise approximations\nfor large times of its position, as well as some features of the local trait\ndistribution at the front. To do so, we solve explicitly the asymptotic problem\nderived formally.

This system contains two active late-type\nstars, UV Psc A (G5V) and B (K3V). To obtain a complete picture, the properties\nof both global and local magnetic field structures are studied for both\ncomponents. High-resolution intensity and circular polarisation spectra,\ncollected in 2016 with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the CFHT, were used\nto analyse the magnetic field of UV Psc. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio,\nthe multi-line technique of least-squares deconvolution (LSD) was used to\nobtain average Stokes IV profiles. Then, a Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) code\nwas employed to obtain the large-scale magnetic field topology and brightness\ndistribution for both components of UV Psc. In addition, the small-scale\nmagnetic fields, not visible to ZDI, were studied using the Zeeman\nintensification of Fe I lines. Maps of the surface magnetic field for both\ncomponents of UV Psc were obtained, the large-scale magnetic fields feature\nstrong toroidal and non-axisymetric components. UV Psc A and B have average\nglobal field strengths of 137 G and 88 G, respectively. The small-scale fields\nare notably stronger, with average strengths of 2.5 and 2.2 kG, respectively.\nOur results are in agreement with previous studies of partly-convective stars.\nOverall, UV Psc A has a stronger magnetic field compared to UV Psc B. Due to\nthe eclipsing binary geometry, certain magnetic field features are not\ndetectable using circular polarisation only. An investigation into theoretical\nlinear polarisation profiles shows that they could be used to reveal\nantisymmetric components of the magnetic field. This result also has\nimplications for the study of exoplanetary transit hosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 09:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Recently,\nlocking experiments were performed in Josephson photonics devices, where\nmicrowave radiation is created by inelastic Cooper pair tunneling across a\ndc-biased Josephson junction connected in-series with a microwave resonator. An\nin-depth theory of locking for such devices, accounting for the Josephson\nnon-linearity and the specific engineered environments, is lacking.\n  Here, we study injection locking in a typical Josephson photonics device\nwhere the environment consists of a single mode cavity, operated in the\nclassical regime.

Much of DRL work has been focused on sequences of events\nwith discrete time steps and ignores the irregular time intervals between\nconsecutive events. Given that in many real-world domains, data often consists\nof temporal sequences with irregular time intervals, and it is important to\nconsider the time intervals between temporal events to capture latent\nprogressive patterns of states. In this work, we present a general Time-Aware\nRL framework: Time-aware Q-Networks (TQN), which takes into account physical\ntime intervals within a deep RL framework. TQN deals with time irregularity\nfrom two aspects: 1) elapsed time in the past and an expected next observation\ntime for time-aware state approximation, and 2) action time window for the\nfuture for time-aware discounting of rewards. Experimental results show that by\ncapturing the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities\nfrom both aspects, TQNs significantly outperform DQN in four types of contexts\nwith irregular time intervals. More specifically, our results show that in\nclassic RL tasks such as CartPole and MountainCar and Atari benchmark with\nrandomly segmented time intervals, time-aware discounting alone is more\nimportant while in the real-world tasks such as nuclear reactor operation and\nseptic patient treatment with intrinsic time intervals, both time-aware state\nand time-aware discounting are crucial.

However, understanding the\ndynamics of sequential contributions in online platforms for peer lending has\nbeen an open ended research question. The centralized investment mechanism in\nthese platforms makes it difficult to understand the implicit competition that\nborrowers face from a single lender at any point in time. Matching markets are\na model of pairing agents where the preferences of agents from both sides in\nterms of their preferred pairing for transactions can allow to decentralize the\nmarket. We study investment designs in two sided platforms using matching\nmarkets when the investors or lenders also face restrictions on the investments\nbased on borrower preferences. This situation creates an implicit competition\namong the lenders in addition to the existing borrower competition, especially\nwhen the lenders are uncertain about their standing in the market and thereby\nthe probability of their investments being accepted or the borrower loan\nrequests for projects reaching the reserve price. We devise a technique based\non sequential decision making that allows the lenders to adjust their choices\nbased on the dynamics of uncertainty from competition over time. We simulate\ntwo sided market matchings in a sequential decision framework and show the\ndynamics of the lender regret amassed compared to the optimal borrower-lender\nmatching and find that the lender regret depends on the initial preferences set\nby the lenders which could affect their learning over decision making steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 11:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

Cryptography, as the\ninseparable tool for providing security services, requires a robust key\nmanagement system. Alas, the absence of infrastructure in cooperative networks\nleads to the infeasibility of providing conventional key management systems.\nKey pre-distribution schemes have shown promising performance in different\ncooperative networks due to their lightweight nature. However, intermediate\ndecryption-encryption (DE) steps and the lack of key updates are the most\nconcerning issues they suffer from. In this paper, we propose a simple and\neffective key management algorithm inspired by the idea of key\npre-distribution, where it utilizes the highly dynamic UAV node movement in 3D\nspace to provide the key update feature and optimizes the number of\nintermediate DE steps. Although it is a general model for any mobile ad hoc\nnetwork, we have selected UAV network as an example domain to show the\nefficiency of the model given the high mobility. We define the communication\ndensity parameter to analytically show that using any highly dynamic random\nmovement pattern leads our algorithm to work effectively. To show the proposed\nalgorithm's effectiveness, we exhaustively analyze its security and performance\nin the UAV network using the ns-3 network simulator. Results validate our\nanalytical findings and show how the highly dynamic UAV network movement helps\nour algorithm to provide the key update feature and to optimize the number of\nDE steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 12:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

We also study HDness in visibly pushdown automata\n(VPA), which enjoy better closure properties than PDA, and for which we show\nthat deciding HDness is ExpTime-complete. HD-VPA can be exponentially more\nsuccinct than deterministic VPA, while VPA can be exponentially more succinct\nthan HD-VPA. Both of these lower bounds are tight. We then compare HD-PDA with\nPDA for which composition with games is well-behaved, i.e. good-for-games\nautomata. We show that these two notions coincide, but only if we consider\npotentially infinitely branching games. Finally, we study the complexity of\nresolving nondeterminism in HD-PDA. Every HDPDA has a positional resolver, a\nfunction that resolves nondeterminism and that is only dependant on the current\nconfiguration. Pushdown transducers are sufficient to implement the resolvers\nof HD-VPA, but not those of HD-PDA. HD-PDA with finite-state resolvers are\ndeterminisable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 12:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 06:14:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 12:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by\ndividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership\nfunction. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions\nand objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well\nas subjectively.

At the same time through excavation valuable resources can\nbe mined for through in situ resource utilization (ISRU). The idea is that a\nswarm of autonomous mobile robots excavate the ground in a sloped downwards\nspiral movement. The excavated regolith will be mixed with cement, which can be\nreproduced on Mars through ISRU, in order to create concrete. The concrete is\n3D printed/sprayed on the excavated tunnel to reinforce it.

Machine\nlearning algorithms are increasingly being used for warfarin dosing; usually,\nan initial dose is predicted with clinical and genotype factors, and this dose\nis revised after a few days based on previous doses and current INR. Since a\nsequence of prior doses and INR better capture the variability in individual\nwarfarin response, we hypothesized that longitudinal dose response data will\nimprove maintenance dose predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a\ndataset from the COAG warfarin dosing study, which includes clinical data,\nwarfarin doses and INR measurements over the study period, and maintenance dose\nwhen therapeutic INR was achieved. Various machine learning regression models\nto predict maintenance warfarin dose were trained with clinical factors and\ndosing history and INR data as features.

However, due to the inter-dependence of various phenomena and\nrandomness of training probe models, detecting how these representations encode\nthe rich information in these linguistic graphs remains a challenging problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a new information-theoretic probe, Bird's Eye, which\nis a fairly simple probe method for detecting if and how these representations\nencode the information in these linguistic graphs. Instead of using classifier\nperformance, our probe takes an information-theoretic view of probing and\nestimates the mutual information between the linguistic graph embedded in a\ncontinuous space and the contextualized word representations. Furthermore, we\nalso propose an approach to use our probe to investigate localized linguistic\ninformation in the linguistic graphs using perturbation analysis. We call this\nprobing setup Worm's Eye. Using these probes, we analyze BERT models on their\nability to encode a syntactic and a semantic graph structure, and find that\nthese models encode to some degree both syntactic as well as semantic\ninformation; albeit syntactic information to a greater extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 13:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 13:25:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 08:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 21:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

However, EMPC performance relies heavily on the\naccuracy of the process model used. As an alternative to model-based control\nstrategies, reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated as a model-free\ncontrol methodology, but issues regarding its safety and stability remain an\nopen research challenge. This work presents a novel framework for integrating\nEMPC and RL for online model parameter estimation of a class of nonlinear\nsystems. In this framework, EMPC optimally operates the closed loop system\nwhile maintaining closed loop stability and recursive feasibility. At the same\ntime, to optimize the process, the RL agent continuously compares the measured\nstate of the process with the model's predictions (nominal states), and\nmodifies model parameters accordingly.

Specifically, we considered a\nstring-inspired Cosmology with primordial gravitational waves (GW) and\ngravitational anomalies, which were argued to lead, via appropriate\ncondensation during the very-early-universe era, to dynamical inflation, of RVM\ntype, without the need for extra inflaton fields. A crucial role for the\nassociated slow-roll nature of the inflationary era was played by the\nfundamental axion field that exists in the gravitational multiplet of strings,\nviz. the Kalb-Ramond (KR) axion. In this paper, we study further this model and\ndemonstrate several novel facts, completing our previous studies. We clarify\nthe different roles played by the background KR axions, which constitute a form\nof stiff matter that dominates a pre-RVM-inflationary epoch of the Universe. We\nshow that the KR axion when combined with the gravitational Chern-Simons\ncontribution obey together a peculiar equation of state $p=-\\rho$, with\nnegative energy density $\\rho < 0$, which we call `phantom vacuum'. Eventually,\nthis state transmutes into the standard vacuum state thanks to the contribution\nfrom the gravitational Chern-Simons condensate, which makes the total\n$\\rho_{\\rm total} =-p_{\\rm total} >0$. At this point the RVM vacuum picture\nemerges naturally, with an overall equation of state of true vacuum type. We\nfind that our scenario is consistent with the trans-Planckian censorship\nhypothesis, given that the rate of change of the KR axion takes only\nsub-Planckian values. We also discuss some explicit scenarios on the creation\nof GWs within the context of supergravity models that could be embedded in our\nstring theory framework. {Finally, we argue how the RVM in our context can help\nto alleviate the current tensions of the $\\Lambda$CDM.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 13:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 20:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

Numerical experiments of Watanabe \\& Lin\n(2008) suggested that such disks, also called `passive disks', suffer from a\nthermal instability. Here, we use analytical and numerical tools to elucidate\nthe nature of this instability. We find that it is related to the flaring of\nthe optical surface, the layer at which starlight is intercepted by the disk.\nWhenever a disk annulus is perturbed thermally and acquires a larger scale\nheight, disk flaring becomes steeper in the inner part, and flatter in the\nouter part. Starlight now shines more overhead for the inner part and so can\npenetrate into deeper layers; conversely, it is absorbed more shallowly in the\nouter part. These geometric changes allow the annulus to intercept more\nstarlight, and the perturbation grows. We call this the irradiation\ninstability. It requires only ingredients that are known to exist in realistic\ndisks, and operates best in parts that are both optically thick and\ngeometrically thin (inside 30AU, but can extend to further reaches when, e.g.,\ndust settling is considered). An unstable disk develops travelling thermal\nwaves that reach order-unity in amplitude. In thermal radiation, such a disk\nshould appear as a series of bright rings interleaved with dark shadowed gaps,\nwhile in scattered light it resembles a moving staircase.

In particular, we propose to process multiple antennas\nusing either an analog beamforming network (ABN) of phase shifters, or an an\nantenna switching network (ASN) that periodically alternate between the\navailable antennas, to transmit periodic messages to receivers that have an\nanalog combining network (ACN) of phase shifters, which has been proposed in\nearlier work. To guarantee robustness, we aim to minimize the burst error\nprobability for the worst receiving vehicular user, in a scenario of bad\npropagation condition that is modeled by a single dominant path between the\ncommunicating vehicles. In absence of any form of channel knowledge, we\nanalytically derive the optimal parameters of both ABN and ASN. The ABN\nbeamforming vector is found to be optimal for all users and not only for the\nworst receiving user.

At last, we show that the derived parameters of the two proposed\ntransmission strategies are also optimal when hybrid ACN-maximal ratio\ncombining is used at the receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 14:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

The design of either an exact\nalgorithm or an approximate algorithm for these problems often requires\nsignificantly specialized knowledge. Recently, deep learning methods provide\nnew directions to solve such problems. In this paper, an end-to-end deep\nreinforcement learning framework is proposed to solve this type of\ncombinatorial optimization problems. This framework can be applied to different\nproblems with only slight changes of input (for example, for a traveling\nsalesman problem (TSP), the input is the two-dimensional coordinates of nodes;\nwhile for a capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the input is\nsimply changed to three-dimensional vectors including the two-dimensional\ncoordinates and the customer demands of nodes), masks and decoder context\nvectors. The proposed framework is aiming to improve the models in literacy in\nterms of the neural network model and the training algorithm. The solution\nquality of TSP and the CVRP up to 100 nodes are significantly improved via our\nframework. Specifically, the average optimality gap is reduced from 4.53\\%\n(reported best \\cite{R22}) to 3.67\\% for TSP with 100 nodes and from 7.34\\%\n(reported best \\cite{R22}) to 6.68\\% for CVRP with 100 nodes when using the\ngreedy decoding strategy.

Here, we explore spin-dependent\nelectronic structures of ultra-thin films of recently introduced 2D synthetic\nmaterials MSi$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mo or W and Z = N or As) using first-principles\nmodeling. Stacking of MSi$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers is found to generate dynamically\nstable bilayer and bulk materials with thickness-dependent properties. When\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) is included in the computations, MSi$_2$N$_4$\nmonolayers display indirect bandgaps and large spin-split states at the $K$ and\n$K'$ symmetry points at the corners of the Brillouin zone with nearly 100\\%\nspin polarization. The spins are locked in opposite directions along an\nout-of-the-plane direction at $K$ and $K'$, leading to spin-valley coupling\neffects. As expected, spin polarization is absent in the pristine bilayers due\nto the presence of inversion symmetry, but it can be induced via an external\nout-of-plane electric field much like the case of Mo(W)S$_2$ bilayers. A\ntransition from an indirect to a direct bandgap can be driven by replacing N by\nAs in MSi$_2$(N, As)$_4$ monolayers. Our study indicates that the MSi$_2$Z$_4$\nmaterials can provide a viable alternative to the MoS$_2$ class of 2D materials\nfor valleytronics and optoelectronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 14:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 07:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The inversion approach consists of two\nmain steps. In the first step the surface roughness is estimated.

The goal of the survey\nis to unveil the Galactic population of short-period variable stars, including\nshort period binaries and stellar pulsators with periods less than a few hours.\nBetween June 2018 and January 2019, we observed 64 ZTF fields resulting in 2990\ndeg$^2$ of high stellar density in ZTF-$r$ band along the Galactic Plane. Each\nfield was observed continuously for 1.5 to 6 hrs with a cadence of 40 sec. Most\nfields have between 200 and 400 observations obtained over 2-3 continuous\nnights. As part of this survey we extract a total of $\\approx$230 million\nindividual objects with at least 80 epochs obtained during the high-cadence\nGalactic Plane survey reaching an average depth of ZTF-$r$ $\\approx$20.5 mag.\nFor four selected fields with 2 million to 10 million individual objects per\nfield we calculate different variability statistics and find that $\\approx$1-2%\nof the objects are astrophysically variable over the observed period. We\npresent a progress report on recent discoveries, including a new class of\ncompact pulsators, the first members of a new class of Roche Lobe filling hot\nsubdwarf binaries as well as new ultracompact double white dwarfs and flaring\nstars. Finally we present a sample of 12 new single-mode hot subdwarf B-star\npulsators with pulsation amplitudes between ZTF-$r$ = 20-76 mmag and pulsation\nperiods between $P$ = 5.8-16 min with a strong cluster of systems with periods\n$\\approx$ 6 min.

However, post-operative\nbreast target delineation is challenging as the contrast between the tumor bed\nvolume (TBV) and normal breast tissue is relatively low in CT images. In this\nstudy, we propose to mimic the marker-guidance procedure in manual target\ndelineation. We developed a saliency-based deep learning segmentation (SDL-Seg)\nalgorithm for accurate TBV segmentation in post-operative breast irradiation.\nThe SDL-Seg algorithm incorporates saliency information in the form of markers'\nlocation cues into a U-Net model. The design forces the model to encode the\nlocation-related features, which underscores regions with high saliency levels\nand suppresses low saliency regions. The saliency maps were generated by\nidentifying markers on CT images. Markers' locations were then converted to\nprobability maps using a distance-transformation coupled with a Gaussian\nfilter. Subsequently, the CT images and the corresponding saliency maps formed\na multi-channel input for the SDL-Seg network. Our in-house dataset was\ncomprised of 145 prone CT images from 29 post-operative breast cancer patients,\nwho received 5-fraction partial breast irradiation (PBI) regimen on GammaPod.\nThe performance of the proposed method was compared against basic U-Net.

Hypothetical particles are considered as\nspatially confined oscillations (SCOs) and are constructed through the\nsuperposition of plane waves. The effect of a continuously changing refractive\nindex (speed of propagation field) on SCOs is calculated and the continuous\nIbn-Sahl--Snell law of refraction is derived. Refracted plane wave constituents\nof SCOs in an inhomogeneous medium cause the oscillation as a whole to\naccelerate as an entity. This acceleration is described by a geodesic equation,\nin much the same way as in general relativity. The proper time of an SCO can be\ndefined via its oscillation frequency. The proper time and its change along the\ntrajectory are equivalent to a particle in general relativity as described by\nthe 0th component of its geodesic equation. An SCO in an inhomogeneous\nrefractive index field exhibits general relativistic properties based on basic\nwave mechanics. Properties derived from direct calculations are length\ncontraction, gravitational red- and blueshift and Thomas precession. The\npresented theory is an approximation for oscillations which are small compared\nto changes in the refractive index field. SCOs in an inhomogeneous medium may\nthus yield a naturally emerging particle-field interaction with general\nrelativistic properties and may allow a useful vantage point on the nature of\ngravitation using classical-wave experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a bio-inspired\nRC model that mimics the cortical microcircuits and uses spiking neural\nnetworks (SNN) that can be directly realized on neuromorphic hardware. In this\npaper, we present a novel Parallelized LSM (PLSM) architecture that\nincorporates spatio-temporal read-out layer and semantic constraints on model\noutput. To the best of our knowledge, such a formulation has been done for the\nfirst time in literature, and it offers a computationally lighter alternative\nto traditional deep-learning models. Additionally, we also present a\ncomprehensive algorithm for the implementation of parallelizable SNNs and LSMs\nthat are GPU-compatible. We implement the PLSM model to classify\nunintentional/accidental video clips, using the Oops dataset. From the\nexperimental results on detecting unintentional action in video, it can be\nobserved that our proposed model outperforms a self-supervised model and a\nfully supervised traditional deep learning model.

Previous studies\non machine teaching focused on balancing the teaching risk and cost to find\nthose best teaching examples deriving the student model. This optimization\nsolver is in general ineffective when the student learner does not disclose any\ncue of the learning parameters. To supervise such a teaching scenario, this\npaper presents a distribution matching-based machine teaching strategy.\nSpecifically, this strategy backwardly and iteratively performs the halving\noperation on the teaching cost to find a desired teaching set. Technically, our\nstrategy can be expressed as a cost-controlled optimization process that finds\nthe optimal teaching examples without further exploring in the parameter\ndistribution of the student learner. Then, given any a limited teaching cost,\nthe training examples will be closed-form. Theoretical analysis and experiment\nresults demonstrate this strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 09:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

In contrast to traditional face-to-face classroom education, online\neducation enables us to record and research a large amount of learning data for\noffering intelligent educational services. Knowledge Tracing (KT), which aims\nto monitor students' evolving knowledge state in learning, is the fundamental\ntask to support these intelligent services. In recent years, an increasing\namount of research is focused on this emerging field and considerable progress\nhas been made. In this survey, we categorize existing KT models from a\ntechnical perspective and investigate these models in a systematic manner.\nSubsequently, we review abundant variants of KT models that consider more\nstrict learning assumptions from three phases: before, during, and after\nlearning. To better facilitate researchers and practitioners working on this\nfield, we open source two algorithm libraries: EduData for downloading and\npreprocessing KT-related datasets, and EduKTM with extensible and unified\nimplementation of existing mainstream KT models. Moreover, the development of\nKT cannot be separated from its applications, therefore we further present\ntypical KT applications in different scenarios. Finally, we discuss some\npotential directions for future research in this fast-growing field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 13:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 04:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 09:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

The introduction of\nautonomous vehicles can potentially reduce this congestion by increasing road\ncapacity via vehicle platooning and by creating an avenue for influencing\npeople's choice of routes. We consider a network of parallel roads with two\nmodes of transportation: (i) human drivers, who will choose the quickest route\navailable to them, and (ii) a ride hailing service, which provides an array of\nautonomous vehicle route options, each with different prices, to users. We\nformalize a model of vehicle flow in mixed autonomy and a model of how\nautonomous service users make choices between routes with different prices and\nlatencies. Developing an algorithm to learn the preferences of the users, we\nformulate a planning optimization that chooses prices to maximize a social\nobjective.
