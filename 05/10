Due to the\nconstant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and\ncaptures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic\nembeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many\nreal-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree\nnetworks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not\nubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To\naddress this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex\nhyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation\nlearning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically\nstructured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The\nunit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity\nto capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the\nhyperbolic embedding models significantly.

We find au-scale density fluctuations that\ntrace turbulence in the interstellar medium between episodes of previously\ndetected plasma oscillations. Possible mechanisms for the narrowband emission\ninclude thermally excited plasma oscillations and quasi-thermal noise, and\ncould be clarified by new findings from Voyager or a future interstellar\nmission. The persistence of the emission suggests that Voyager 1 may be able to\ncontinue tracking the interstellar plasma density in the absence of\nshock-generated plasma oscillation events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 19:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Since memory (specifically, dot-product operations) is a key\nenergy-spending component for DNNs, hardware approaches in the past have\nfocused on optimizing the memory. One such approach is approximate digital CMOS\nmemories with hybrid 6T-8T SRAM cells that enable supply voltage (Vdd) scaling\nyielding low-power operation, without significantly affecting the performance\ndue to read/write failures incurred in the 6T cells. In this paper, we show how\nthe bit-errors in the 6T cells of hybrid 6T-8T memories minimize the\nadversarial perturbations in a DNN. Essentially, we find that for different\nconfigurations of 8T-6T ratios and scaledVdd operation, noise incurred in the\nhybrid memory architectures is bound within specific limits. This hardware\nnoise can potentially interfere in the creation of adversarial attacks in DNNs\nyielding robustness. Another memory optimization approach involves using analog\nmemristive crossbars that perform Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVMs)\nefficiently with low energy and area requirements. However, crossbars generally\nsuffer from intrinsic non-idealities that cause errors in performing MVMs,\nleading to degradation in the accuracy of the DNNs.

Resampling the training\ndata is the standard approach to improving classification performance on\nimbalanced binary data. However, the state-of-the-art methods ignore the local\njoint distribution of the data or correct it as a post-processing step. This\ncan causes sub-optimal shifts in the training distribution, particularly when\nthe target data distribution is complex.

We\npropose a novel gradient-based approach to optimising both the shape and infill\nof lattice-skin structures to improve their efficiency further. The respective\ngradients are computed by fully considering the lattice-skin coupling while the\nlattice topology and shape optimisation problems are solved in a sequential\nmanner.

Due to the NP-Hardness of finding an optimal seed set, approximation\nalgorithms are frequently used for IM. In this work, we describe a fast,\nerror-adaptive approach that leverages Count-Distinct sketches and hash-based\nfused sampling. To estimate the number of influenced vertices throughout a\ndiffusion, we use per-vertex Flajolet-Martin sketches where each sketch\ncorresponds to a sampled subgraph. To efficiently simulate the diffusions, the\nreach-set cardinalities of a single vertex are stored in memory in a\nconsecutive fashion. This allows the proposed algorithm to estimate the number\nof influenced vertices in a single step for simulations at once. For a faster\nIM kernel, we rebuild the sketches in parallel only after observing estimation\nerrors above a given threshold. Our experimental results show that the proposed\nalgorithm yields high-quality seed sets while being up to 119x faster than a\nstate-of-the-art approximation algorithm. In addition, it is up to 62x faster\nthan a sketch-based approach while producing seed sets with 3%-12% better\ninfluence scores\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 21:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

The BL Lac OJ 287 is an interesting object for\nmulti-wavelength study due to its periodic outbursts. We have analyzed the\noptical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data of OJ 287 for the period of 2017-2020.

A detailed temporal and spectral analysis is performed to\nunderstand the nature of its flaring activities. Methods. To understand the\ntemporal variability in this source we have studied the intra-day, and\nfractional variability for all the various states, and along with that fast\nvariability time was also estimated to understand the nature of variability.\nFurther, the multi-wavelength SED modeling is performed to know more about the\nphysical processes responsible for the simultaneous broadband emission and the\nfast variability.

Results indicate that although\nGPP simulations from the TL-LUE model match well with the EC GPP, the RTL-LUE\nmodel can further improve the simulation, for half-hour, 8-day, and yearly time\nscales. The TL-LUE model tends to overestimate GPP under conditions of high\nincoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), because the\nradiation-independent LUE values for both sunlit and shaded leaves are only\nsuitable for low-medium (e.g. average) incoming PAR conditions.

This is astonishing in\nview of the excellent theoretical understanding of Maxwell's equations and the\nabundant experimental measurements of optical phenomena in dispersive media.\nThe challenge is related to the complexity of the interference patterns of\npartial waves and to the coupling of the field and medium dynamics by the\noptical force. In this work, we use the mass-polariton theory of light [Phys.\nRev. A 96, 063834 (2017)] to derive the stress-energy-momentum (SEM) tensors of\nthe field and the dispersive medium. Our starting point, the fundamental local\nconservation laws of energy and momentum, is close to that of a recent\ntheoretical work on light in dispersive media by Philbin [Phys. Rev. A 83,\n013823 (2011)], which however, excludes the power-conversion and force density\nsource terms describing the coupling between the field and the medium. In the\ngeneral inertial frame, we present the SEM tensors in terms of Lorentz scalars,\nfour-vectors, and field tensors that reflect in a transparent way the Lorentz\ncovariance of the theory. The SEM tensors of the field and the medium are\nsymmetric, form-invariant, and in full accordance with the covariance principle\nof the special theory of relativity. The SEM tensor of the coupled field-medium\nstate of light also has zero four-divergence. Therefore, light in a dispersive\nmedium has well-defined four-momentum and rest frame.

Under certain conditions, this iterative process converges to some\nequilibrium opinion vector. Previous works gave an efficient local search\nalgorithm to solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem, for which the goal is\nto modify the resistance of any number of agents (within some given range) such\nthat the sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. On the other hand, it\nwas proved that the $L_0$-budgeted variant is NP-hard, where the $L_0$-budget\nis a restriction given upfront on the number of agents whose resistance may be\nmodified.\n  Inspired by practical situations in which the effort to modify an agent's\nresistance increases with the magnitude of the change, we propose the\n$L_1$-budgeted variant, in which the $L_1$-budget is a restriction on the sum\nof the magnitudes of the changes over all agents' resistance parameters. In\nthis work, we show that the $L_1$-budgeted variant is NP-hard via a reduction\nfrom vertex cover. However, contrary to the $L_0$-budgeted variant, a very\ntechnical argument is needed to show that the optimal solution can be achieved\nby focusing the given $L_1$-budget on as small a number of agents as possible,\nas opposed to spreading the budget over a large number of agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 04:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

An RIS can be controlled to\nreflect incident waves from the transmitter towards the receiver; a feature\nthat is believed to fundamentally contribute to beyond 5G wireless technology.\nThe typical RIS consists of entirely passive elements, which requires the\nhigh-dimensional channel estimation to be done elsewhere. Therefore, in this\npaper, we present a semi-passive large-scale RIS architecture equipped with\nonly a small fraction of simplified receiver units with only 1-bit\nquantization. Based on this architecture, we first propose an alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM)-based approach to recover the training\nsignals at the passive RIS elements, We then obtain the global channel by\ncombining a channel sparsification step with the generalized approximate\nmessage passing (GAMP) algorithm. Our proposed scheme exploits both the\nsparsity and low-rankness properties of the channel in the joint\nspatial-frequency domain of a wideband mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output\n(MIMO) communication system.

This formalization centers around the\ndevelopment of a reasoning logic that can express the sorts of properties which\narise in reasoning about such specifications. In this logic, type inhabitation\njudgements in LF serve as atomic formulas, and quantification is permitted over\nboth contexts and terms in these judgements. The logic permits arbitrary\nrelations over derivations of LF judgements to be expressed using a collection\nof logical connectives, in contrast to other systems for reasoning about LF\nspecifications. Defining a semantics for these formulas raises issues which we\nmust address, such as how to interpret both term and context quantification as\nwell as the relation between atomic formulas and the LF judgements they are\nmeant to encode.\n  This thesis also develops a proof system which captures informal reasoning\nsteps as sound inference rules for the logic. To achieve this we develop a\ncollection of proof rules including mechanisms for both case analysis and\ninductive reasoning over the derivations of judgements in LF. The proof system\nalso supports applying LF meta-theorems through proof rules that enforce\nrequirements of the LF meta-theorem that cannot be expressed in the logic.\n  We also implement a proof assistant called Adelfa that provides a means for\nmechanizing this approach to reasoning about specifications written in LF. A\ncharacteristic of this proof assistant is that it uses the proof rules that\ncomplement the logic to describe a collection of tactics that are used to\ndevelop proofs in goal-driven fashion. The Adelfa system is used to develop a\ncollection of examples which demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and\nshowcase how informal reasoning about specifications written in LF can be\nformalized using the logic and associated proof system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 04:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

However, unlike the existing public\nface datasets, in many real-world scenarios of face recognition, the depth of\ntraining dataset is shallow, which means only two face images are available for\neach ID. With the non-uniform increase of samples, such issue is converted to a\nmore general case, a.k.a long-tail face learning, which suffers from data\nimbalance and intra-class diversity dearth simultaneously. These adverse\nconditions damage the training and result in the decline of model performance.\nBased on the Semi-Siamese Training (SST), we introduce an advanced solution,\nnamed Multi-Agent Semi-Siamese Training (MASST), to address these problems.\nMASST includes a probe network and multiple gallery agents, the former aims to\nencode the probe features, and the latter constitutes a stack of networks that\nencode the prototypes (gallery features). For each training iteration, the\ngallery network, which is sequentially rotated from the stack, and the probe\nnetwork form a pair of semi-siamese networks. We give the theoretical and\nempirical analysis that, given the long-tail (or shallow) data and training\nloss, MASST smooths the loss landscape and satisfies the Lipschitz continuity\nwith the help of multiple agents and the updating gallery queue. The proposed\nmethod is out of extra-dependency, thus can be easily integrated with the\nexisting loss functions and network architectures. It is worth noting that,\nalthough multiple gallery agents are employed for training, only the probe\nnetwork is needed for inference, without increasing the inference cost.\nExtensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the advantages of MASST for\nlong-tail and shallow face learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 04:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 10:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Existing approaches often model\npedestrian behaviors using trajectories or poses but do not offer a deeper\nsemantic interpretation of a person's actions or how actions influence a\npedestrian's intention to cross in the future. In this work, we follow the\nneuroscience and psychological literature to define pedestrian crossing\nbehavior as a combination of an unobserved inner will (a probabilistic\nrepresentation of binary intent of crossing vs. not crossing) and a set of\nmulti-class actions (e.g., walking, standing, etc.). Intent generates actions,\nand the future actions in turn reflect the intent. We present a novel\nmulti-task network that predicts future pedestrian actions and uses predicted\nfuture action as a prior to detect the present intent and action of the\npedestrian. We also designed an attention relation network to incorporate\nexternal environmental contexts thus further improve intent and action\ndetection performance. We evaluated our approach on two naturalistic driving\ndatasets, PIE and JAAD, and extensive experiments show significantly improved\nand more explainable results for both intent detection and action prediction\nover state-of-the-art approaches.

However, this technique has two\nremarkable drawbacks: (i) the large variability of the selected bandwidths, and\n(ii) the inability to provide results in a reasonable time for very large\nsample sizes. To overcome these problems, bagging cross-validation bandwidths\nare analyzed in this paper. This approach consists in computing the\ncross-validation bandwidths for a finite number of subsamples and then\nrescaling the averaged smoothing parameters to the original sample size. Under\na random-design regression model, asymptotic expressions up to a second-order\nfor the bias and variance of the leave-one-out cross-validation bandwidth for\nthe Nadaraya--Watson estimator are obtained.

Even with HLS, irregular\ndata-intensive applications require explicit optimizations, among which\nmultiple processing elements (PEs) with each owning a private BRAM-based buffer\nare usually adopted to process multiple data per cycle. Data routing, which\ndynamically dispatches multiple data to designated PEs, avoids data replication\nin buffers compared to statically assigning data to PEs, hence saving BRAM\nusage. However, the workload imbalance among PEs vastly diminishes performance\nwhen processing skew datasets. In this paper, we propose a skew-oblivious data\nrouting architecture that allocates secondary PEs and schedules them to share\nthe workload of the overloaded PEs at run-time. In addition, we integrate the\nproposed architecture into a framework called Ditto to minimize the development\nefforts for applications that require skew handling. We evaluate Ditto on five\ncommonly used applications: histogram building, data partitioning, pagerank,\nheavy hitter detection and hyperloglog. The results demonstrate that the\ngenerated implementations are robust to skew datasets and outperform the\nstateof-the-art designs in both throughput and BRAM usage efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

To train high dimensional machine learning\nmodels (such as CNN models), heavy communication traffic can be incurred by\nexchanging model updates via the Internet between clients and the parameter\nserver (PS), implying that the network resource can be easily exhausted.\nCompressing model updates is an effective way to reduce the traffic amount.\nHowever, a flexible unbiased compression algorithm applicable for both uplink\nand downlink compression in FL is still absent from existing works. In this\nwork, we devise the Model Update Compression by Soft Clustering (MUCSC)\nalgorithm to compress model updates transmitted between clients and the PS. In\nMUCSC, it is only necessary to transmit cluster centroids and the cluster ID of\neach model update. Moreover, we prove that: 1) The compressed model updates are\nunbiased estimation of their original values so that the convergence rate by\ntransmitting compressed model updates is unchanged; 2) MUCSC can guarantee that\nthe influence of the compression error on the model accuracy is minimized.\nThen, we further propose the boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) algorithm, a biased\ncompression algorithm that can achieve an extremely high compression rate by\ngrouping insignificant model updates into a super cluster. B-MUCSC is suitable\nfor scenarios with very scarce network resource.

In this\npaper, we present a Conversational Dense Retrieval system, ConvDR, that learns\ncontextualized embeddings for multi-turn conversational queries and retrieves\ndocuments solely using embedding dot products. In addition, we grant ConvDR\nfew-shot ability using a teacher-student framework, where we employ an ad hoc\ndense retriever as the teacher, inherit its document encodings, and learn a\nstudent query encoder to mimic the teacher embeddings on oracle reformulated\nqueries. Our experiments on TREC CAsT and OR-QuAC demonstrate ConvDR's\neffectiveness in both few-shot and fully-supervised settings. It outperforms\nprevious systems that operate in the sparse word space, matches the retrieval\naccuracy of oracle query reformulations, and is also more efficient thanks to\nits simplicity.

In recent years, various types of side information have been\nexplored to alleviate this problem. Among them, knowledge graph (KG) has\nattracted extensive research interests as it can encode users/items and their\nassociated attributes in the graph structure to preserve the relation\ninformation. In contrast, less attention has been paid to the item-item\nco-occurrence information (i.e., \\textit{co-view}), which contains rich\nitem-item similarity information. It provides information from a perspective\ndifferent from the user/item-attribute graph and is also valuable for the CF\nrecommendation models. In this work, we make an effort to study the potential\nof integrating both types of side information (i.e., KG and item-item\nco-occurrence data) for recommendation. To achieve the goal, we propose a\nunified graph-based recommendation model (UGRec), which integrates the\ntraditional directed relations in KG and the undirected item-item co-occurrence\nrelations simultaneously.

Due to the challenges of dynamic channel conditions,\ncentralized resource management schemes that require global information are\ninefficient and lead to large signaling overheads.

Existing MARL algorithms\nconsider a holistic reward function for the group's collective success, which\noften ends up with unsatisfactory results and cannot guarantee an optimal\npolicy for each agent. Consequently, motivated by the existing literature in\nRL, we propose a novel MARL framework that trains two critics with the\nfollowing goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and\nmotivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local\ncritic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward.

This paper\nfocuses on a related yet relatively unexplored topic: the effects of the\ngeographical proximity of cities located in Arab countries on their dialectical\nsimilarity. Our work is twofold, reliant on: 1) comparing the textual\nsimilarities between dialects using cosine similarity and 2) measuring the\ngeographical distance between locations. We study MADAR and NADI, two\nestablished datasets with Arabic dialects from many cities and provinces. Our\nresults indicate that cities located in different countries may in fact have\nmore dialectical similarity than cities within the same country, depending on\ntheir geographical proximity. The correlation between dialectical similarity\nand city proximity suggests that cities that are closer together are more\nlikely to share dialectical attributes, regardless of country borders. This\nnuance provides the potential for important advancements in Arabic dialect\nresearch because it indicates that a more granular approach to dialect\nclassification is essential to understanding how to frame the problem of Arabic\ndialects identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 09:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

We present the results of a monitoring campaign of\nULXP NGC 7793 P13. Over our four-year monitoring campaign with Swift,\nXMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, we measured a continuous spin-up with $\\dot P$ ~\n-3.8e-11 s/s. The strength of the spin-up is independent of the observed X-ray\nflux, indicating that despite a drop in observed flux in 2019, accretion onto\nthe source has continued at largely similar rates. The source entered an\napparent off-state in early 2020, which might have resulted in a change in the\naccretion geometry as no pulsations were found in observations in July and\nAugust 2020. We used the long-term monitoring to update the orbital ephemeris\nand the periodicities seen in both the observed optical/UV and X-ray fluxes. We\nfind that the optical/UV period is very stable over the years, with\n$P_\\text{UV}$ = 63.75 (+0.17, -0.12) d. The best-fit orbital period determined\nfrom our X-ray timing results is 64.86 +/- 0.19 d, which is almost a day longer\nthan previously implied, and the X-ray flux period is 65.21+/- 0.15 d, which is\nslightly shorter than previously measured. The physical origin of these\ndifferent flux periods is currently unknown. We study the hardness ratio to\nsearch for indications of spectral changes. We find that the hardness ratios at\nhigh energies are very stable and not directly correlated with the observed\nflux. At lower energies we observe a small hardening with increased flux, which\nmight indicate increased obscuration through outflows at higher luminosities.\nWe find that the pulsed fraction is significantly higher at low fluxes. This\nseems to imply that the accretion geometry already changed before the source\nentered the deep off-state. We discuss possible scenarios to explain this\nbehavior, which is likely driven by a precessing accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 09:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Deep learning even aims to\nfind a nonlinear dependence with many layers which require a large amount of\ncomputation. However, most of these algorithms build upon simple linear models.\nWe then describe linear models from different views and find the properties and\ntheories behind the models. The linear model is the main technique in\nregression problems and the primary tool for it is the least squares\napproximation which minimizes a sum of squared errors. This is a natural choice\nwhen we're interested in finding the regression function which minimizes the\ncorresponding expected squared error. This survey is primarily a summary of\npurpose, significance of important theories behind linear models, e.g.,\ndistribution theory, minimum variance estimator. We first describe ordinary\nleast squares from three different points of view upon which we disturb the\nmodel with random noise and Gaussian noise. By Gaussian noise, the model gives\nrise to the likelihood so that we introduce a maximum likelihood estimator. It\nalso develops some distribution theories via this Gaussian disturbance. The\ndistribution theory of least squares will help us answer various questions and\nintroduce related applications. We then prove least squares is the best\nunbiased linear model in the sense of mean squared error and most importantly,\nit actually approaches the theoretical limit.

However,\neach modality embeddings stem from non-related feature spaces, which causes the\nnotorious 'heterogeneity gap'. Currently, many cross-modal systems try to\nbridge the gap with self-attention. However, self-attention has been widely\ncriticized for its quadratic complexity, which prevents many real-life\napplications. In response to this, we propose T-EMDE - a neural density\nestimator inspired by the recently introduced Efficient Manifold Density\nEstimator (EMDE) from the area of recommender systems. EMDE operates on\nsketches - representations especially suitable for multimodal operations.\nHowever, EMDE is non-differentiable and ingests precomputed, static embeddings.\nWith T-EMDE we introduce a trainable version of EMDE which allows full\nend-to-end training. In contrast to self-attention, the complexity of our\nsolution is linear to the number of tokens/segments. As such, T-EMDE is a\ndrop-in replacement for the self-attention module, with beneficial influence on\nboth speed and metric performance in cross-modal settings. It facilitates\ncommunication between modalities, as each global text/image representation is\nexpressed with a standardized sketch histogram which represents the same\nmanifold structures irrespective of the underlying modality. We evaluate T-EMDE\nby introducing it into two recent cross-modal SOTA models and achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and decreasing model latency by\nup to 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 10:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

The\nsuccess of quantization during inference has motivated the academic community\nto explore fully quantized training, i.e. quantizing back-propagation as well.\nHowever, effective gradient quantization is still an open problem. Gradients\nare unbounded and their distribution changes significantly during training,\nwhich leads to the need for dynamic quantization. As we show, dynamic\nquantization can lead to significant memory overhead and additional data\ntraffic slowing down training. We propose a simple alternative to dynamic\nquantization, in-hindsight range estimation, that uses the quantization ranges\nestimated on previous iterations to quantize the present.

This work focuses on the problem of ranking type-based facets.\nIn a structured information space, type-based facets (t-facets) indicate the\ncategory to which each object belongs. When they belong to a large multi-level\ntaxonomy, it is desirable to rank them separately before ranking other facet\ngroups. This helps the searcher in filtering the results according to their\ntype first. This also makes it easier to rank the rest of the facets once the\ntype of the intended search target is selected. Existing research employs the\nsame ranking methods for different facet groups. In this research, we propose a\ntwo-step approach to personalize t-facet ranking. The first step assigns a\nrelevance score to each individual leaf-node t-facet. The score is generated\nusing probabilistic models and it reflects t-facet relevance to the query and\nthe user profile. In the second step, this score is used to re-order and select\nthe sub-tree to present to the user. We investigate the usefulness of the\nproposed method to a Point Of Interest (POI) suggestion task.

Recent works that learn representations of code\nbased on pre-training techniques in NLP have pushed the frontiers in this\ndirection. However, the semantics of PL and NL have essential differences.\nThese being ignored, we believe it is difficult to build a model to better\nunderstand programs, by either directly applying off-the-shelf NLP pre-training\ntechniques to the source code, or adding features to the model by the\nheuristic. In fact, the semantics of a program can be rigorously defined by\nformal semantics in PL theory. For example, the operational semantics,\ndescribes the meaning of a valid program as updating the environment (i.e., the\nmemory address-value function) through fundamental operations, such as memory\nI/O and conditional branching. Inspired by this, we propose a novel program\nsemantics learning paradigm, that the model should learn from information\ncomposed of (1) the representations which align well with the fundamental\noperations in operational semantics, and (2) the information of environment\ntransition, which is indispensable for program understanding. To validate our\nproposal, we present a hierarchical Transformer-based pre-training model called\nOSCAR to better facilitate the understanding of programs. OSCAR learns from\nintermediate representation (IR) and an encoded representation derived from\nstatic analysis, which are used for representing the fundamental operations and\napproximating the environment transitions respectively. OSCAR empirically shows\nthe outstanding capability of program semantics understanding on many practical\nsoftware engineering tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 12:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 08:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

Here, we report on three stick-slip experiments\nperformed on cylindrical samples of Indian metagabbro under upper crustal\nstress conditions (30-60 $MPa$). Acoustic emissions (AEs) were continuously\nrecorded by 8 calibrated acoustic sensors during the experiments. Seismological\nparameters (moment magnitude, corner frequency and stress-drop) of the detected\nAEs ($-8.8 \\leq Mw \\leq -7 $) follow the scaling law between moment magnitude\nand corner frequency that characterizes natural earthquakes. AE activity always\nincreases towards failure and is found to be driven by along fault slip\nvelocity. Consistently for all three experiments, the stacked AE foreshock\nsequences follow an inverse power-law of the time to failure (inverse Omori),\nwith a characteristic Omori time $c$ inversely proportional to normal stress.\nAEs moment magnitudes increase towards failure, as manifested by a decrease in\nb-value from $\\sim 1$ to $\\sim 0.5$ at the end of the nucleation process.\nDuring nucleation, the averaged distance of foreshocks to mainshock also\ncontinuously decreases, highlighting the fast migration of foreshocks towards\nthe mainshock epicenter location, and stabilizing at a distance from the latter\ncompatible with the predicted Rate-and-State nucleation size. Importantly, we\nalso show that the nucleation characteristic timescale scales inversely with\napplied normal stress and the expected nucleation size. Finally, the seismic\ncomponent of the nucleation phase is orders of magnitude smaller than that of\nits aseismic component, which suggests that, in this experimental setting at\nleast, foreshocks are the byproducts of a process almost fully aseismic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 12:21:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 11:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

In the present work, we use the duration measurements of HM+16 to\nsystematically study the duration changes of 561 KOIs and identify 15 KOIs with\na significant long-term linear change of transit durations and another 16 KOIs\nwith an intermediate significance. We show that the observed linear trend is\nprobably caused by a precession of the orbital plane of the transiting planet,\ninduced in most cases by another planet. The leading term of the precession\nrate depends on the mass and relative inclination of the perturber, and the\nperiod ratio between the two orbits, but not on the mass and period of the\ntransiting planet itself. Interestingly, our findings indicate that, as a\nsample, the detected time derivatives of the durations get larger as a function\nof the planetary orbital period, probably because short-period planetary\nsystems display small relative inclinations. The results might indicate that\nshort-period planets reside in relatively flattened planetary systems,\nsuggesting these systems experienced stronger dissipation either when formed or\nwhen migrated to short orbits.

In order to enhance the\ninference speed and reduce the complexity, current methods commonly integrate\nthese double subtasks into a unified framework. Nevertheless, detection and\nReID demand diverse features. This issue would result in an optimization\ncontradiction during the training procedure. With the target of alleviating\nthis contradiction, we devise a module named Global Context Disentangling (GCD)\nthat decouples the learned representation into detection-specific and\nReID-specific embeddings. As such, this module provides an implicit manner to\nbalance the different requirements of these two subtasks. Moreover, we observe\nthat preceding MOT methods typically leverage local information to associate\nthe detected targets and neglect to consider the global semantic relation. To\nresolve this restriction, we develop a module, referred to as Guided\nTransformer Encoder (GTE), by combining the powerful reasoning ability of\nTransformer encoder and deformable attention. Unlike previous works, GTE avoids\nanalyzing all the pixels and only attends to capture the relation between query\nnodes and a few self-adaptively selected key samples. Therefore, it is\ncomputationally efficient.

But it is yet unknown whether consensus can be solved\nwhen less than $2n/3$ participants are correct and $k$ participants are\nrational players, which misbehave if they can gain the loot.

We also investigate data\nsparsity through a pruning parameter and the influence of using additional\nmetadata. As recommender models, we focus on different autoencoders, which are\nparticularly suited for reconstructing missing items in a set. We extend\nautoencoders to exploit a multi-modal input of text and structured data. Our\nexperiments on six real-world datasets show that supplying the partial item set\nas input is helpful when item co-occurrence resembles relatedness, while\nmetadata are effective when co-occurrence implies diversity. This outcome means\nthat the semantics of item co-occurrence is an important factor. The simple\nitem co-occurrence model is a strong baseline for citation recommendation.\nHowever, autoencoders have the advantage to enable exploiting additional\nmetadata besides the partial item set as input and achieve comparable\nperformance. For the subject label recommendation task, the title is the most\nimportant attribute. Adding more input modalities sometimes even harms the\nresult.

This limit was identified\nlong ago by Lieb and Simon for the total electronic energy of a system. This is\na universal limit of all electronic structure: atoms, molecules, and solids.\nFor the total energy, Thomas-Fermi theory becomes relatively exact in the\nlimit. The limit can also be studied for much simpler model systems, including\nnon-interacting fermions in a one-dimensional well, where the WKB approximation\napplies for individual eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Summation techniques\nlead to energies and densities that are functionals of the potential. We\nconsider several examples in one dimension (fermions in a box, in a harmonic\nwell, in a linear half-well, and in the P\\\"oschl-Teller well. The effects of\nhigher dimension are also illustrated with the three-dimensional harmonic well\nand the Bohr atom, non-interacting fermions in a Coulomb well. Modern density\nfunctional calculations use the Kohn-Sham scheme almost exclusively. The same\nsemiclassical limit can be studied for the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy, for the\nexchange energy, and for the correlation energy. For all three, the local\ndensity approximation appears to become relatively exact in this limit. Recent\nwork, both analytic and numerical, explores how this limit is approached, in an\neffort to deduce the leading corrections to the local approximation. A simple\nscheme, using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, is the result of many\ndifferent attempts at this problem. In very simple cases, the correction\nformulas are much more accurate than standard density functionals. Several\nfunctionals are already in widespread use in both chemistry and materials that\nincorporate these limits, and prospects for the future are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 14:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 13:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

In the opposite scenario, when a narrow resonance is\nconsidered in the vicinity of a slightly broader one, we observe that the\nEfimov features are pushed to lower binding energies and smaller scattering\nlengths by a significant factor facilitating their experimental investigation.\nBoth scenarios are referenced to the case of two narrow resonances which are\nfar enough away from each other to be effectively decoupled. In this case the\ntwo-channel model results are recovered. Finally, we analyze the rich\nexcitation spectrum of the system and construct and explain its nodal pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 14:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The algorithm\nexecutes on grid maps and generates the corresponding distance field for\nrecording distance information against obstacles, which forms the basis of\nnumerous motion planning algorithms. The contributions of this work mainly lie\nin three folds. Firstly, we propose a novel algorithm that can facilitate\ndistance transform procedures by optimizing the scheduling priorities of\ntransform functions, which significantly improves the running speed of\nconventional EDT algorithms. Secondly, we for the first time introduce the\nmemory-efficient VDB data structure, a customed B+ tree, to represent the\ndistance field hierarchically. Benefiting from the special index and caching\nmechanism, VDB shows a fast (average \\textit{O}(1)) random access speed, and\nthus is very suitable for the frequent neighbor-searching operations in EDT.\nMoreover, regarding the small scale of existing datasets, we release a\nlarge-scale dataset captured from subterranean environments to benchmark EDT\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments on the released dataset and publicly\navailable datasets show that VDB-EDT can reduce memory consumption by about\n30%-85%, depending on the sparsity of the environment, while maintaining a\ncompetitive running speed with the fastest array-based implementation. The\nexperiments also show that VDB-EDT can significantly outperform the\nstate-of-the-art EDT algorithm in both runtime and memory efficiency, which\nstrongly demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method.

This paper presents an effective solution to semi-supervised face\nrecognition that is robust to the label noise aroused by the auto-labelling.\nSpecifically, we introduce a multi-agent method, named GroupNet (GN), to endow\nour solution with the ability to identify the wrongly labelled samples and\npreserve the clean samples. We show that GN alone achieves the leading accuracy\nin traditional supervised face recognition even when the noisy labels take over\n50\\% of the training data. Further, we develop a semi-supervised face\nrecognition solution, named Noise Robust Learning-Labelling (NRoLL), which is\nbased on the robust training ability empowered by GN. It starts with a small\namount of labelled data and consequently conducts high-confidence labelling on\na large amount of unlabelled data to boost further training. The more data is\nlabelled by NRoLL, the higher confidence is with the label in the dataset. To\nevaluate the competitiveness of our method, we run NRoLL with a rough condition\nthat only one-fifth of the labelled MSCeleb is available and the rest is used\nas unlabelled data. On a wide range of benchmarks, our method compares\nfavorably against the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 14:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Moreover, we find that the time of\nmaximum brightness and light-curve shape (both of which are spectroscopically\nderived in our method) are only minimally responsible for the observed scatter.\nIn a companion paper, we apply the SDM to a large number of sparsely observed\nSNe Ia as part of a cosmological study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 15:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Such a modeling framework, however,\nis naturally limited to pairwise interactions, making it less suitable to\nproperly describe social contagion, where individuals acquire new norms or\nideas after simultaneous exposure to multiple sources of infections. Simplicial\ncontagion has been proposed as an alternative framework where simplices are\nused to encode group interactions of any order. The presence of higher-order\ninteractions leads to explosive epidemic transitions and bistability which\ncannot be obtained when only dyadic ties are considered. In particular,\ncritical mass effects can emerge even for infectivity values below the standard\npairwise epidemic threshold, where the size of the initial seed of infectious\nnodes determines whether the system would eventually fall in the endemic or the\nhealthy state. Here we extend simplicial contagion to time-varying networks,\nwhere pairwise and higher-order simplices can be created or destroyed over\ntime. By following a microscopic Markov chain approach, we find that the same\nseed of infectious nodes might or might not lead to an endemic stationary\nstate, depending on the temporal properties of the underlying network\nstructure, and show that persistent temporal interactions anticipate the onset\nof the endemic state in finite-size systems. We characterize this behavior on\nhigher-order networks with a prescribed temporal correlation between\nconsecutive interactions and on heterogeneous simplicial complexes, showing\nthat temporality again limits the effect of higher-order spreading, but in a\nless pronounced way than for homogeneous structures. Our work suggests the\nimportance of incorporating temporality, a realistic feature of many real-world\nsystems, into the investigation of dynamical processes beyond pairwise\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 15:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

In\nthis paper, we examine the implications of this result on the question of\nclassicalization, and demonstrate that the birth of quantum fluctuations at the\nPlanck scale would have been a `process' supplanting the need for a\n`measurement' in quantum mechanics.

The high computational cost of\ndata assimilation with a high-dimensional parameter space impedes fast\ndecision-making for commercial-scale reservoir management. We propose to\nleverage physical understandings of porous medium flow behavior with deep\nlearning techniques to develop a fast history matching-reservoir response\nforecasting workflow. Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation\nframework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir\nperformance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes\ninterpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive\ncomponent in such a workflow is reservoir simulation, we developed surrogate\nmodels to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well\ninjection. The surrogate models employ deep convolutional neural networks,\nspecifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is\nvalidated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a\nclastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to\nbridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a\nsingle-layer reservoir model.

Using physics models can be inaccurate because they cannot account\nfor unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is\nlaunched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not\npossible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in\ndata-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and\nsystems to emerge. It is desirable to train a model for launch prediction on a\nrobot, as deep neural networks can account for immeasurable dynamics. However,\nthe inability to collect large amounts of experimental data decreases\nperformance of deep neural networks. Through estimating force coefficients, the\naccepted physics models can be leveraged to produce adequate supplemental data\nto artificially increase the size of the training set, yielding improved neural\nnetworks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for algorithmic\nestimation of force coefficients for non-rigid object launching, which can be\ngeneralized to other domains, in order to generate large datasets. We implement\na novel training algorithm and objective for our deep neural network to\naccurately model launch trajectory of non-rigid objects and predict whether\nthey will hit a series of targets.

To access the channel, a device\ncompares the measured power with a predefined ST value and accordingly decides\nif the channel is idle or not. Improper setting of the ST values creates\nasymmetric sensing floors, resulting in collisions due to hidden terminals\nand/or reduction in the spatial reuse due to exposed terminals. Optimal ST\nsetting is challenging because it requires global knowledge of mobility,\ntraffic loads, and channel access behavior of all contending devices. Sense-\nBandits tackles this problem by employing a clustering-based multi-armed bandit\n(MAB) algorithm, which adapts its learning behavior based on network dynamics.\nClustering allows the algorithm to track network changes in real-time, ensuring\nfast learning of the best ST values by classifying the state and dynamics of\ncoexisting networks. We develop a C++-based network simulator that implements\nSense-Bandits and we apply it to evaluate the coexistence of Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U\nsystems over the unlicensed 5 GHz U NII bands.

In many\napplications the well-known Morison's equation is employed to estimate the\nforcing from waves with assumed particle velocities and accelerations. This\npaper develops a grey-box modelling approach to improve the predictions of the\nforce on structural members. A grey-box model intends to exploit the enhanced\npredictive capabilities of data-based modelling whilst retaining physical\ninsight into the behaviour of the system; in the context of the work carried\nout here, this can be considered as physics-informed machine learning. There\nare a number of possible approaches to establish a grey-box model. This paper\ndemonstrates two means of combining physics (white box) and data-based (black\nbox) components; one where the model is a simple summation of the two\ncomponents, the second where the white-box prediction is fed into the black box\nas an additional input. Here Morison's equation is used as the physics-based\ncomponent in combination with a data-based Gaussian process NARX - a dynamic\nvariant of the more well-known Gaussian process regression. Two key challenges\nwith employing the GP-NARX formulation that are addressed here are the\nselection of appropriate lag terms and the proper treatment of uncertainty\npropagation within the dynamic GP. The best performing grey-box model, the\nresidual modelling GP-NARX, was able to achieve a 29.13\\% and 5.48\\% relative\nreduction in NMSE over Morison's Equation and a black-box GP-NARX respectively,\nalongside significant benefits in extrapolative capabilities of the model, in\ncircumstances of low dataset coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 15:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 15:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}
