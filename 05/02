Our research program is\nmotivated by the fact that the p-adic strings seem to be related in some\ninteresting ways with ordinary strings. For instance, connections through the\nadelic relations and through the limit when p tends to 1. Gerasimov and\nShatashvili studied the limit p tends to 1 of the p-adic effective action\nintroduced by Brekke, Freund, Olson and Witten. They showed that this limit\ngives rise to a boundary string field theory, which was previously proposed by\nWitten in the context of background independent string theory.

At a mathematical\nlevel, this phenomenon is deeply connected with the topological zeta functions\nintroduced by Denef and Loeser. A Koba-Nielsen amplitude is just a new type of\nlocal zeta function, which can be studied by using embedded resolution of\nsingularities. In this way, one shows the existence of a meromorphic\ncontinuations for the Koba-Nielsen amplitudes as functions of the kinematic\nparameters.

A question of general interest is: How does the survival probability\n$S_m$, namely, the probability that an initial state survives even after $m$\nnumber of measurements, behave as a function of $m$? We address these issues in\nthe context of two paradigmatic quantum systems, one, the quantum random walk\nevolving in discrete time, and the other, the tight-binding model evolving in\ncontinuous time, with both defined on a one-dimensional periodic lattice with a\nfinite number of sites $N$. For these two models, we present several numerical\nand analytical results that hint at the curious nature of quantum measurement\ndynamics. In particular, we unveil that when evolution after every projective\nmeasurement continues with the projected component of the instantaneous state,\nthe average and the typical survival probability decay as an exponential in $m$\nfor large $m$. By contrast, if the evolution continues with the leftover\ncomponent, namely, what remains of the instantaneous state after a measurement\nhas been performed, the survival probability exhibits two characteristic $m$\nvalues, namely, $m_1^\\star(N) \\sim N$ and $m_2^\\star(N) \\sim N^\\delta$ with\n$\\delta >1$. These scales are such that (i) for $m$ large and satisfying $m <\nm_1^\\star(N)$, the decay of the survival probability is as $m^{-2}$, (ii) for\n$m$ satisfying $m_1^\\star(N) \\ll m < m_2^\\star(N)$, the decay is as $m^{-3/2}$,\nwhile (iii) for $m \\gg m_2^\\star(N)$, the decay is as an exponential. We find\nthat our results hold independently of the choice of the distribution of times\nbetween successive measurements, as have been corroborated by our results for a\nwide range of distributions. This fact hints at robustness and ubiquity of our\nderived results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 19:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 10:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Nowadays, the evaluation is performed in a manual\nmanner, which is time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. In this paper, we\naim to automate this process by leveraging the advances in computer vision and\nartificial intelligence, to provide an objective and accurate method for root\ncanal therapy result assessment. A novel anatomy-guided multi-branch\nTransformer (AGMB-Transformer) network is proposed, which first extracts a set\nof anatomy features and then uses them to guide a multi-branch Transformer\nnetwork for evaluation. Specifically, we design a polynomial curve fitting\nsegmentation strategy with the help of landmark detection to extract the\nanatomy features.

The multiscale solution\nof the UGKS is determined by the integral solution of the kinetic model\nequation, which is composed of the Lagrangian integration of the equilibrium\nand the free particle transport of the nonequilibrium state. With the implicit\nevaluation of the macroscopic variables in the first iterative step, the\nintegration of the equilibrium can be directly used in the flux calculation of\nmacroscopic flow variables in the second iterative step. This is equivalent to\ninclude the viscous flux in the implicit scheme to accelerate the convergence\nof the solution instead of using the Euler flux in the iterative process of the\noriginal IUGKS. In the present IUGKS, the update of macroscopic flow variables\nare closely coupled with the implicit evolution of the gas distribution\nfunction.

However, in the actual\nsystems with limitations such as measurement error and data acquisition\nproblems, people usually obtain incomplete data. Although data completion has\nattracted wide attention, the underlying data pattern and relativity are still\nunder-developed. Currently, the family of latent variable models allows\nlearning deep latent variables over observed variables by fitting the marginal\ndistribution. As far as we know, current methods fail to perceive the data\nrelativity under partial observation. Aiming at modeling incomplete data, this\nwork uses relational inference to fill in the incomplete data. Specifically, we\nexpect to approximate the real joint distribution over the partial observation\nand latent variables, thus infer the unseen targets respectively. To this end,\nwe propose Omni-Relational Network (OR-Net) to model the pointwise relativity\nin two aspects: (i) On one hand, the inner relationship is built among the\ncontext points in the partial observation; (ii) On the other hand, the unseen\ntargets are inferred by learning the cross-relationship with the observed data\npoints.

The class centers generated by the algorithm will produce some\nerrors with the theoretically evenly-distributed points, and the generation\ntime will be longer. This paper takes advantage of regular polyhedron in\nhigh-dimensional space and the evenly distribution of points on the n\ndimensional hypersphere to generate PEDCC mathematically.

Despite the progress, efficient and accurate end-to-end spotting of\narbitrarily-shaped text remains challenging. In this work, we propose an\nend-to-end text spotting framework, termed PAN++, which can efficiently detect\nand recognize text of arbitrary shapes in natural scenes. PAN++ is based on the\nkernel representation that reformulates a text line as a text kernel (central\nregion) surrounded by peripheral pixels. By systematically comparing with\nexisting scene text representations, we show that our kernel representation can\nnot only describe arbitrarily-shaped text but also well distinguish adjacent\ntext. Moreover, as a pixel-based representation, the kernel representation can\nbe predicted by a single fully convolutional network, which is very friendly to\nreal-time applications. Taking the advantages of the kernel representation, we\ndesign a series of components as follows: 1) a computationally efficient\nfeature enhancement network composed of stacked Feature Pyramid Enhancement\nModules (FPEMs); 2) a lightweight detection head cooperating with Pixel\nAggregation (PA); and 3) an efficient attention-based recognition head with\nMasked RoI. Benefiting from the kernel representation and the tailored\ncomponents, our method achieves high inference speed while maintaining\ncompetitive accuracy. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method.\nFor example, the proposed PAN++ achieves an end-to-end text spotting F-measure\nof 64.9 at 29.2 FPS on the Total-Text dataset, which significantly outperforms\nthe previous best method.

Rather than packaging all aspects of stack safety into\na monolithic property, we decompose it into an integrity property and a\nconfidentiality property for each of the caller and the callee, plus a\ncontrol-flow property -- five properties in all.\n  This formulation is motivated by a particular class of enforcement\nmechanisms, the ``lazy'' stack safety micro-policies studied by Roessler and\nDeHon~\\cite{DBLP:conf/sp/RoesslerD18}, which permit functions to write into one\nanother's frames, but which taint the changed locations so that the frame's\nowner cannot access it. No existing characterization of stack safety captures\nthis style of safety. We capture it here by stating our properties in terms of\nthe observable behavior of the system.\n  Our properties go further than previous formal definitions of stack safety,\nsupporting caller- and callee-saved registers, arguments passed on the stack,\nand tail-call elimination.\n  We validate our properties by using them to distinguish between correct and\nincorrect implementations of Roessler and DeHon's micro-policies using\nproperty-based random testing. Our test harness successfully identifies several\nbroken variants, including Roessler and DeHon's lazy policy; a repaired version\nof their policy does pass our tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 08:18:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 03:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

While\nresearch on brain image super-resolution has undergone a rapid development in\nthe recent years, brain graph super-resolution is still poorly investigated\nbecause of the complex nature of non-Euclidean graph data. In this paper, we\npropose the first-ever deep graph super-resolution (GSR) framework that\nattempts to automatically generate high-resolution (HR) brain graphs with N'\nnodes (i.e., anatomical regions of interest (ROIs)) from low-resolution (LR)\ngraphs with N nodes where N < N'. First, we formalize our GSR problem as a node\nfeature embedding learning task. Once the HR nodes' embeddings are learned, the\npairwise connectivity strength between brain ROIs can be derived through an\naggregation rule based on a novel Graph U-Net architecture. While typically the\nGraph U-Net is a node-focused architecture where graph embedding depends mainly\non node attributes, we propose a graph-focused architecture where the node\nfeature embedding is based on the graph topology. Second, inspired by graph\nspectral theory, we break the symmetry of the U-Net architecture by\nsuper-resolving the low-resolution brain graph structure and node content with\na GSR layer and two graph convolutional network layers to further learn the\nnode embeddings in the HR graph. Third, to handle the domain shift between the\nground-truth and the predicted HR brain graphs, we incorporate adversarial\nregularization to align their respective distributions.

Successful transferability-based attacks\nrequiring no prior knowledge of the attacked model's parameters or training\ndata have been demonstrated numerous times in the past, implying that machine\nlearning models pose an inherent security threat to real-life systems. However,\nall of the research performed in this area regarded transferability as a\nprobabilistic property and attempted to estimate the percentage of adversarial\nexamples that are likely to mislead a target model given some predefined\nevaluation set. As a result, those studies ignored the fact that real-life\nadversaries are often highly sensitive to the cost of a failed attack. We argue\nthat overlooking this sensitivity has led to an exaggerated perception of the\ntransferability threat, when in fact real-life transferability-based attacks\nare quite unlikely. By combining theoretical reasoning with a series of\nempirical results, we show that it is practically impossible to predict whether\na given adversarial example is transferable to a specific target model in a\nblack-box setting, hence questioning the validity of adversarial\ntransferability as a real-life attack tool for adversaries that are sensitive\nto the cost of a failed attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 09:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 11:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 07:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Especially, for jumbled urban road\nnetworks, drivers' actual routing strategies deteriorated to a series of\nempirical and selfish decisions that result in congestion. Self-evidently, if\nminimum mobility can be kept, traffic congestion is avoidable by traffic load\ndispersing. In this paper, we establish a novel dynamic routing method catering\ndrivers' preferences and retaining maximum traffic mobility simultaneously\nthrough multi-agent systems (MAS). Modeling human-drivers' behavior through\nagents' dynamics, MAS can analyze the global behavior of the entire traffic\nflow. Therefore, regarding agents as particles in smoothed particles\nhydrodynamics (SPH), we can enforce the traffic flow to behave like a real\nflow. Thereby, with the characteristic of distributing itself uniformly in road\nnetworks, our dynamic routing method realizes traffic load balancing without\nviolating the individual time-saving motivation. Moreover, as a discrete\ncontrol mechanism, our method is robust to chaos meaning driver's disobedience\ncan be tolerated. As controlled by SPH based density, the only intelligent\ntransportation system (ITS) we require is the location-based service (LBS). A\nmathematical proof is accomplished to scrutinize the stability of the proposed\ncontrol law. Also, multiple testing cases are built to verify the effectiveness\nof the proposed dynamic routing algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 09:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

What happens\nif this question is modified in a way that we get a possibly infinite family of\ngraphs as an input, and the question is if there is a graph satisfying $\\Phi$\nin the family? We approach this question by using formal languages for\nspecifying families of graphs, in particular by regular sets of words. We show\nthat certain graph properties can be decided by studying the syntactic monoid\nof the specification language $L$ if a certain torsion condition is satisfied.\nThis condition holds trivially if $L$ is regular. More specifically, we use a\nnatural binary encoding of finite graphs over a binary alphabet $\\Sigma$, and\nwe define a regular set $\\mathbb{G}\\subseteq \\Sigma^*$ such that every nonempty\nword $w\\in \\mathbb{G}$ defines a finite and nonempty graph.

In this\nletter we detail a mechanism by which pressure maxima form just inward the\nsnow-line in stratified disks. This mechanism does not need the presence of a\nplanet. Using a combination of analytical and numerical investigation we\nexplore the range of conditions for a pressure maximum to form inside the\ndead-zone and just inward the snow-line. When the vertically averaged $\\alpha$\nis a decreasing function of surface density then the release of water vapor at\nthe snow-line lowers the sound velocity, and in turn, a pressure bump appears.\nThis requires a constant inflow of icy pebbles with pebbles influx to gas\ninflux $>0.6$ for a power law disk with $1\\%$ ice/gas ratio, and $>1.8$ for a\ndisk with ice/gas ratio $\\sim 0.3\\%$. If these conditions are met, then a\nPressure-maximum appears just inward the snow-line due to a process coupling\nthe dead and active layers at the evaporation front. The pressure bump survives\nas long as the icy pebble flux is high enough. The formation of the pressure\nbump is triggered by the drop of sound velocity inward the snow-line, due to\nthe release of water vapor. This mechanism is promising for isolating early\nreservoirs carrying different isotopic signatures in the Solar System and for\npromoting dry planetesimal formation inward the snow-line, provided the\nvertically averaged description of a dead-zone is valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 12:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Accounting for interdependence\namong ties while studying tie formation is one of the key challenges in this\narea of research. We address this challenge using an equilibrium framework\nwhere firms' decisions to form links with other firms are modeled as a\nstrategic game. In this game, firms weigh the costs and benefits of\nestablishing a relationship with other firms and form ties if their net payoffs\nare positive. We characterize the equilibrium networks as exponential random\ngraphs (ERGM), and we estimate the firms' payoffs using a Bayesian approach. To\ndemonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we apply the framework to a\nco-investment network of venture capital firms in the medical device industry.\nThe equilibrium framework allows researchers to draw economic interpretation\nfrom parameter estimates of the ERGM Model. We learn that firms rely on their\njoint partners (transitivity) and prefer to form ties with firms similar to\nthemselves (homophily).

To engineer skyrmions in vdW magnets by transforming Bloch-type\nmagnetic bubbles into N\\'eel-type skyrmions, the heterostructure of heavy\nmetal/vdW magnetic thin film has been made to induce interfacial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the unambiguous\nidentification of the magnetic textures inherent to vdW magnets, e.g., whether\nthe magnetic twists (skyrmions/domain walls) are N\\'eel- or Bloch-type, is\nunclear.

We observe that q is perpendicular to the in-plane field in the\nheterostructure (Pt/oxidized-FGT/FGT/oxidized-FGT), while q aligns at a rotated\nangle with respect to the field direction in the thin plate by thinning bulk\nFGT. We find that the aligned domain wall twists hold fan-like modulations,\ncoinciding qualitatively with our computational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 13:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

For OTA\naggregation per level, the source WDs employ a channel inverse structure\nmultiplied by their individual transmit coefficients in transmission over the\nsame time frequency resource blocks, and the destination WD finally uses a\nreceive filtering factor to construct the aggregated IVA. Under this setup, we\ndevelop a unified transceiver design framework that minimizes the mean squared\nerror (MSE) of the aggregated IVA at the destination WD subject to the source\nWDs' individual power constraints, by jointly optimizing the source WDs'\nindividual transmit coefficients and the destination WD's receive filtering\nfactor. First, based on the primal decomposition method, we derive the\nclosed-form solution under the special case of a common transmit coefficient.\nIt shows that all the source WDs' common transmit is determined by the minimal\ntransmit power budget among the source WDs.

In the case of weak dipolar\ninteraction ($h^{}_d\\approx0$) and substantial temperature, the magnetic\nrelaxation follows the N\\'eel Brown model as expected. Interestingly, the\ndipolar interaction of enough strength is found to induce antiferromagnetic\ncoupling in the square arrangement of MNPs ($A^{}_r=1.0$), resulting in the\nfastening of magnetic relaxation with $h^{}_d$. There is also a rapid increase\nin relaxation even with $A^{}_r<100$ above a particular dipolar interaction\nstrength $h^{\\star}_d$, which gets enhanced with $A^{}_r$. Remarkably, there is\na slowing down of magnetic relaxation with $h^{}_d$ for the highly anisotropic\nsystem such as linear chain of MNPs. It is because the dipolar interaction\ninduces ferromagnetic interaction in such a case. The thermal fluctuations also\naffect the relaxation properties drastically. In the case of weak dipolar\nlimit, magnetization relaxes rapidly with $T$ because of enhancement in thermal\nfluctuations. The effect of dipolar interaction and aspect ratio on the\nmagnetic relaxation is also clearly indicated in the variation of N\\'eel\nrelaxation time $\\tau^{}_N$.

Meanwhile, HyperGraph Neural Network (HGNN) is currently the\nde-facto method for hypergraph representation learning. However, HGNN aims at\nsingle hypergraph learning and uses a pre-concatenation approach when\nconfronting multi-modal datasets, which leads to sub-optimal exploitation of\nthe inter-correlations of multi-modal hypergraphs. HGNN also suffers the\nover-smoothing issue, that is, its performance drops significantly when layers\nare stacked up. To resolve these issues, we propose the Residual enhanced\nMulti-Hypergraph Neural Network, which can not only fuse multi-modal\ninformation from each hypergraph effectively, but also circumvent the\nover-smoothing issue associated with HGNN.

We find that the extremal points of the off shell Gibbs free\nenergy correspond to physical black holes. For small-large black hole phase\ntransition, the off shell Gibbs free energy exhibits a double well behavior\nwith the same depth. Contrary to previous research for the kinetics of phase\ntransition for the Kerr-Newman-AdS family black holes on a free energy\nlandscape, we find that there is a lower bound for the order parameter and the\nlower bound corresponds to extremal black holes. In particular, the off shell\nGibbs free energy is zero instead of divergent as previous work suggested for\nvanishing black hole horizon radius, which corresponds to the Gibbs free energy\nof a thermal AdS space. The investigation for the evolution of the probability\ndistribution for the phase transition indicates that the initial stable small\n(large) black hole tends to switch to stable large (small) black hole.\nIncreasing the temperature along the coexistence curve, the switching process\nbecomes faster and the probability distribution reaches the final stationary\nBoltzmann distribution at a shorter time.

Different defences have been proposed; however, most of them are\ntailored to particular ML models and adversarial attacks, therefore their\neffectiveness and applicability are strongly limited. A similar problem plagues\ncheminformatics: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models\nstruggle to predict biological activity for the entire chemical space because\nthey are trained on a very limited amount of compounds with known effects. This\nproblem is relieved with a technique called Applicability Domain (AD), which\nrejects the unsuitable compounds for the model. Adversarial examples are\nintentionally crafted inputs that exploit the blind spots which the model has\nnot learned to classify, and adversarial defences try to make the classifier\nmore robust by covering these blind spots. There is an apparent similarity\nbetween AD and adversarial defences. Inspired by the concept of AD, we propose\na multi-stage data-driven defence that is testing for: Applicability: abnormal\nvalues, namely inputs not compliant with the intended use case of the model;\nReliability: samples far from the training data; and Decidability: samples\nwhose predictions contradict the predictions of their neighbours.It can be\napplied to any classification model and is not limited to specific types of\nadversarial attacks.

However, an explicit determination of a maximizing arrangement for the\nsemi-regular continuant turned out to be more difficult.

Such circuit has been modeled by a new three-dimensional autonomous\ndynamical system exhibiting very particular properties such as the transition\nfrom torus breakdown to chaos. Then, mathematical analysis and detailed\nnumerical investigations have enabled to establish that such a transition\ncorresponds to the so-called route to Shilnikov spiral chaos but gives rise to\na \"double spiral attractor\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 06:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Comprehensive knowledge of the bandstructure with band parameters\nexplains intrinsic physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the solid.\nHere we report the artificial polaritonic bandstructures of two-dimensional\nhoneycomb lattices for microcavity exciton-polaritons using GaAs semiconductors\nin the wide-range detuning values, from cavity-photon-like (red-detuned) to\nexciton-like (blue-detuned) regimes. In order to understand the experimental\nbandstructures and their band parameters, such as gap energies, bandwidths,\nhopping integrals and density of states, we originally establish a polariton\nband theory within an augmented plane wave method with two-kind-bosons, cavity\nphotons trapped at the lattice sites and freely moving excitons. In particular,\nthis two-kind-band theory is absolutely essential to elucidate the exciton\neffect in the bandstructures of blue-detuned exciton-polaritons, where the\nflattened exciton-like dispersion appears at larger in-plane momentum values\ncaptured in our experimental access window. We reach an excellent agreement\nbetween theory and experiments in all detuning values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 16:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

However, such mapping effort\nis challenging due to the existence of various land cover classes, noisy data,\nand the lack of proper labels. Also, each land cover class typically has its\nown unique temporal pattern and can be identified only during certain periods.\nIn this article, we introduce a novel architecture that incorporates the UNet\nstructure with Bidirectional LSTM and Attention mechanism to jointly exploit\nthe spatial and temporal nature of satellite data and to better identify the\nunique temporal patterns of each land cover. We evaluate this method for\nmapping crops in multiple regions over the world. We compare our method with\nother state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on two\nreal-world datasets which involve multiple land cover classes. We also\nvisualise the attention weights to study its effectiveness in mitigating noise\nand identifying discriminative time period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 05:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 03:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

This paper discusses how this discriminatory information can help\nin continuous user authentication by a wearable chest strap which uses dry\nelectrodes to obtain a single lead ECG signal. To the best of the authors'\nknowledge, this is the first such work which deals with continuous\nauthentication using a genuine wearable device as most prior works have either\nused medical equipment employing gel electrodes to obtain an ECG signal or have\nobtained an ECG signal through electrode positions that would not be feasible\nusing a wearable device. Prior works have also mainly dealt with using the ECG\nsignal for identification rather than verification, or dealt with using the ECG\nsignal for discrete authentication. This paper presents a novel algorithm which\nuses QRS detection, weighted averaging, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and a\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether the wearer of the\ndevice should be positively verified or not. Zero intrusion attempts were\nsuccessful when tested on a database consisting of 33 subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 04:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

This is in contrast to traditional approaches which\nrandomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard\ndistributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more\ninformed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where\neach layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is\ncast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and\ndecoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a\nuser-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into\nthe well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free\nsolutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to\nrandom initialization methods, both before start of training and after training\nis over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot\nand fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time\ncomplexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 07:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}
