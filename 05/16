Prioritized sampling is a promising technique to better utilize these\nsamples. Previous criteria of prioritization include TD error, recentness and\ncorrective feedback, which are mostly heuristically designed. In this work, we\nstart from the regret minimization objective, and obtain an optimal\nprioritization strategy for Bellman update that can directly maximize the\nreturn of the policy. The theory suggests that data with higher hindsight TD\nerror, better on-policiness and more accurate Q value should be assigned with\nhigher weights during sampling. Thus most previous criteria only consider this\nstrategy partially. We not only provide theoretical justifications for previous\ncriteria, but also propose two new methods to compute the prioritization\nweight, namely ReMERN and ReMERT. ReMERN learns an error network, while ReMERT\nexploits the temporal ordering of states. Both methods outperform previous\nprioritized sampling algorithms in challenging RL benchmarks, including MuJoCo,\nAtari and Meta-World.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 16:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 01:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 12:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Understanding the role of gravity is\nparticularly important for future planetary exploration in varying\ngravitational environments. Using the principle of minimization of energy\ndissipation, and combining experiments and variational analysis, we disentangle\nthe contributions of the gravitational acceleration and confining pressure on\nshear strain localization induced by moving fault boundaries at the bottom of a\ngranular layer. The flow profile is independent of the gravity for geometries\nwith a free top surface. However, under a confining pressure or if the sheared\nlayer withstands the weight of the upper layers, increasing gravity promotes\nthe transition from closed shear zones buried in the bulk to open ones that\nintersect the top surface. We show that the center position and width of the\nshear zone and the axial angular velocity at the top surface follow universal\nscaling laws when properly scaled by the gravity, applied pressure, and layer\nthickness.

Despite this success, existing GNNs are constrained\nby their local message-passing architecture and are provably limited in their\nexpressive power. In this work, we propose a new GNN architecture -- the Neural\nTree. The neural tree architecture does not perform message passing on the\ninput graph, but on a tree-structured graph, called the H-tree, that is\nconstructed from the input graph. Nodes in the H-tree correspond to subgraphs\nin the input graph, and they are reorganized in a hierarchical manner such that\nthe parent of a node in the H-tree always corresponds to a larger subgraph in\nthe input graph. We show that the neural tree architecture can approximate any\nsmooth probability distribution function over an undirected graph. We also\nprove that the number of parameters needed to achieve an\n$\\epsilon$-approximation of the distribution function is exponential in the\ntreewidth of the input graph, but linear in its size.

Gyrochronology, a relationship between\nstellar rotation and age, appears to offer a reliable age indicator for main\nsequence (MS) stars over the mass range of approximately 0.6 to 1.3 $M_\\odot$.\nThose stars lose their angular momentum due to magnetic braking and as a\nresult, their rotation speeds decrease with age. Although current\ngyrochronology relations are fairly well tested for young MS stars with masses\ngreater than 1 $M_\\odot$, primarily in young open clusters, insufficient tests\nexist for older and lower mass MS stars. Binary stars offer the potential to\nexpand and fill in the range of ages and metallicity over which gyrochronology\ncan be empirically tested.

The well known\nTMTO attack in Cryptanalysis is a probabilistic algorithm for computing one\nsolution of local inversion using $O(\\sqrt N)$ order computation in offline as\nwell as online for $N=2^n$. This paper proposes a complete algorithm for\nsolving the local inversion problem which uses linear complexity for a unique\nsolution in a periodic orbit.

To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is\nemerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through\nwell-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey,\nwe extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer\nvision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive\nreview of existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide\nexisting graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and\npredictive. More importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a\nhigh-level description of published research, we present an additional\nmathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to\nfacilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also\nsummarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks,\nopen-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms.\nFinally, we discuss the technical challenges and potential future directions\nfor improving graph self-supervised learning.

Recent work attempts to mitigate such\nproblems by augmenting training of deep anomaly detection models with\nadditional labeled anomaly samples.

In this paper, we aim to understand the effect of a biased anomaly set\non anomaly detection. Concretely, we view anomaly detection as a supervised\nlearning task where the objective is to optimize the recall at a given false\npositive rate. We formally study the relative scoring bias of an anomaly\ndetector, defined as the difference in performance with respect to a baseline\nanomaly detector. We establish the first finite sample rates for estimating the\nrelative scoring bias for deep anomaly detection, and empirically validate our\ntheoretical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We also provide\nan extensive empirical study on how a biased training anomaly set affects the\nanomaly score function and therefore the detection performance on different\nanomaly classes. Our study demonstrates scenarios in which the biased anomaly\nset can be useful or problematic, and provides a solid benchmark for future\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 03:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Building damage assessment from satellite\nimagery is critical before relief effort is deployed. With a pair of pre- and\npost-disaster satellite images, building damage assessment aims at predicting\nthe extent of damage to buildings. With the powerful ability of feature\nrepresentation, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to building\ndamage assessment. Most existing works simply concatenate pre- and\npost-disaster images as input of a deep neural network without considering\ntheir correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage convolutional\nneural network for Building Damage Assessment, called BDANet. In the first\nstage, a U-Net is used to extract the locations of buildings. Then the network\nweights from the first stage are shared in the second stage for building damage\nassessment. In the second stage, a two-branch multi-scale U-Net is employed as\nbackbone, where pre- and post-disaster images are fed into the network\nseparately. A cross-directional attention module is proposed to explore the\ncorrelations between pre- and post-disaster images.

This phenomenon is called\ncatastrophic forgetting. While a line of studies has been proposed with respect\nto avoiding catastrophic forgetting, most of the methods are based on intuitive\ninsights into the phenomenon, and their performances have been evaluated by\nnumerical experiments using benchmark datasets. Therefore, in this study, we\nprovide the theoretical framework for analyzing catastrophic forgetting by\nusing teacher-student learning. Teacher-student learning is a framework in\nwhich we introduce two neural networks: one neural network is a target function\nin supervised learning, and the other is a learning neural network. To analyze\ncontinual learning in the teacher-student framework, we introduce the\nsimilarity of the input distribution and the input-output relationship of the\ntarget functions as the similarity of tasks. In this theoretical framework, we\nalso provide a qualitative understanding of how a single-layer linear learning\nneural network forgets tasks. Based on the analysis, we find that the network\ncan avoid catastrophic forgetting when the similarity among input distributions\nis small and that of the input-output relationship of the target functions is\nlarge. The analysis also suggests that a system often exhibits a characteristic\nphenomenon called overshoot, which means that even if the learning network has\nonce undergone catastrophic forgetting, it is possible that the network may\nperform reasonably well after further learning of the current task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 09:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy, termed as\nSemi-supervised Contrastive Learning (SsCL), which combines the well-known\ncontrastive loss in self-supervised learning with the cross entropy loss in\nsemi-supervised learning, and jointly optimizes the two objectives in an\nend-to-end way. The highlight is that different from self-training based\nsemi-supervised learning that conducts prediction and retraining over the same\nmodel weights, SsCL interchanges the predictions over the unlabeled data\nbetween the two branches, and thus formulates a co-calibration procedure, which\nwe find is beneficial for better prediction and avoid being trapped in local\nminimum. Towards this goal, the contrastive loss branch models pairwise\nsimilarities among samples, using the nearest neighborhood generated from the\ncross entropy branch, and in turn calibrates the prediction distribution of the\ncross entropy branch with the contrastive similarity. We show that SsCL\nproduces more discriminative representation and is beneficial to few shot\nlearning.

ZAC-DEST exploits the similarity between recent data\ntransfers across channels and information about the error resilience behavior\nof applications to reduce on-die termination and switching energy by reducing\nthe number of 1's transmitted over the channels. ZAC-DEST also provides a\nnumber of knobs for trading off the application's accuracy for energy savings,\nand vice versa, and can be applied to both training and inference.\n  We apply ZAC-DEST to five machine learning applications. On average, across\nall applications and configurations, we observed a reduction of $40$% in\ntermination energy and $37$% in switching energy as compared to the state of\nthe art data encoding technique BD-Coder with an average output quality loss of\n$10$%.

Some fusion centers\n(FC) are placed at specific locations in the medium, which absorb all sensors\narrived at their locations, and by observing its state, each FC decides on the\nabnormality existence and/or its location. To reduce the effects of sensor\nimperfection, we propose a scheme where the sensors release some molecules\n(i.e., markers) into the medium after they sense an abnormality. If the goal is\nabnormality detection, the released molecules are used to cooperatively\nactivate other sensors. If the goal is abnormality localization, the released\nmolecules are used by the FCs to determine the location. In our model, both\nsensors' imperfection and markers background noise are taken into account. For\nthe detection phase, we consider two sensor types based on their activation\nstrategy by markers.

However, most of these methods cannot\nefficiently segment objects of variable sizes and train on small and biased\ndatasets, which are common for biomedical use cases. While methods exist that\nincorporate multi-scale fusion approaches to address the challenges arising\nwith variable sizes, they usually use complex models that are more suitable for\ngeneral semantic segmentation problems. In this paper, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Multi-Scale Residual Fusion Network (MSRF-Net), which is\nspecially designed for medical image segmentation. The proposed MSRF-Net is\nable to exchange multi-scale features of varying receptive fields using a\nDual-Scale Dense Fusion (DSDF) block. Our DSDF block can exchange information\nrigorously across two different resolution scales, and our MSRF sub-network\nuses multiple DSDF blocks in sequence to perform multi-scale fusion. This\nallows the preservation of resolution, improved information flow and\npropagation of both high- and low-level features to obtain accurate\nsegmentation maps. The proposed MSRF-Net allows to capture object variabilities\nand provides improved results on different biomedical datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on MSRF-Net demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the\ncutting-edge medical image segmentation methods on four publicly available\ndatasets.

This\ninvolves solving two sub-problems: (i)modeling the temporal dynamics of\nexpressions, and (ii) deforming the neutral mesh to obtain the expressive\ncounterpart. We represent the temporal evolution of expressions using the\nmotion of a sparse set of 3D landmarks that we learn to generate by training a\nmanifold-valued GAN (Motion3DGAN). To better encode the expression-induced\ndeformation and disentangle it from the identity information, the generated\nmotion is represented as per-frame displacement from a neutral configuration.\nTo generate the expressive meshes, we train a Sparse2Dense mesh Decoder\n(S2D-Dec) that maps the landmark displacements to a dense, per-vertex\ndisplacement. This allows us to learn how the motion of a sparse set of\nlandmarks influences the deformation of the overall face surface, independently\nfrom the identity.

In this paper, we compare and\ncontrast the various methods and models for image classification and semantic\nsegmentation on the FloodNet dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 09:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

We analyze and break down\nart-technology related innovations in the last three years, and thoroughly\nidentify the most recent and vibrant applications of interactive art\nexperiences in the review of numerous installation applications, studies, and\nevents. Display mediums such as virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed\nreality, and robotics are overviewed in the context of art experiences such as\nvisual art museums, park or historic site tours, live concerts, and theatre. We\nexplore research and extrapolate how recent innovations can lead to different\napplications that will be seen in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 05:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

The method uses a\ntwo-step proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique to extract the reduced\nbasis from a collection of high-fidelity solutions called snapshots. A third\nPOD level is then applied on the data of the projection coefficients associated\nwith the reduced basis to separate the time-dependent modes from the stochastic\nparametrized coefficients. These are approximated in the stochastic parameter\nspace using B-splines basis functions defined in the corresponding B\\'ezier\nelement. The accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method are assessed\nusing benchmark steady-state and time-dependent problems and compared to the\nreduced order model-based artificial neural network (POD-ANN) and to the\nfull-order model-based polynomial chaos expansion (Full-PCE). The POD-BSBEM is\nthen applied to analyze the uncertainty propagation through a flood wave flow\nstemming from a hypothetical dam-break in a river with a complex bathymetry.\nThe results confirm the ability of the POD-BSBEM to accurately predict the\nstatistical moments of the output quantities of interest with a substantial\nspeed-up for both offline and online stages compared to other techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 20:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

An infrared LED was used as light\nemitter, and an infrared phototransistor as light receiver. The signal\nprocessing control unit was developed with the Arduino Uno platform. The\ncalibration of the turbidimeter was done by means of a comparative test in\ntriplicate, using as reference the commercial turbidimeter 2100P, HACH. The\nturbidimeter was able to perform analysis in the range of 100 to 1000 NTU,\npresenting an innovation character given its portability and computer\ncommunication via USB, and in a good price range for the prototype, costing US$\n46.30.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 00:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Humans exhibit movements like walking,\nrunning, and jumping in the most efficient manner, which served as the source\nof motivation for this project. Skeletal and Musculoskeletal human models were\nconsidered for motions in the sagittal plane, and results from both were\ncompared exhaustively. While skeletal models are driven with motor actuation,\nmusculoskeletal models perform through muscle-tendon actuation. Model-free\nreinforcement learning algorithms were used to optimize inverse dynamics\ncontrol actions to satisfy the objective of imitating a reference motion along\nwith secondary objectives of minimizing effort in terms of power spent by\nmotors and metabolic energy consumed by the muscles. On the one hand, the\ncontrol actions for the motor actuated model is the target joint angles\nconverted into joint torques through a Proportional-Differential controller.\nWhile on the other hand, the control actions for the muscle-tendon actuated\nmodel is the muscle excitations converted implicitly to muscle activations and\nthen to muscle forces which apply moments on joints. Muscle-tendon actuated\nmodels were found to have superiority over motor actuation as they are\ninherently smooth due to muscle activation dynamics and don't need any external\nregularizers. Finally, a strategy that was used to obtain an optimal\nconfiguration of the significant decision variables in the framework was\ndiscussed. All the results and analysis are presented in an illustrative,\nqualitative, and quantitative manner.
