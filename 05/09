Computer systems employ a range of techniques to reduce overheads tied\nto data movement, spanning from traditional mechanisms (e.g., deep multi-level\ncache hierarchies, aggressive hardware prefetchers) to emerging techniques such\nas Near-Data Processing (NDP), where some computation is moved close to memory.\nOur goal is to methodically identify potential sources of data movement over a\nbroad set of applications and to comprehensively compare traditional\ncompute-centric data movement mitigation techniques to more memory-centric\ntechniques, thereby developing a rigorous understanding of the best techniques\nto mitigate each source of data movement.\n  With this goal in mind, we perform the first large-scale characterization of\na wide variety of applications, across a wide range of application domains, to\nidentify fundamental program properties that lead to data movement to/from main\nmemory. We develop the first systematic methodology to classify applications\nbased on the sources contributing to data movement bottlenecks. From our\nlarge-scale characterization of 77K functions across 345 applications, we\nselect 144 functions to form the first open-source benchmark suite (DAMOV) for\nmain memory data movement studies. We select a diverse range of functions that\n(1) represent different types of data movement bottlenecks, and (2) come from a\nwide range of application domains. Using NDP as a case study, we identify new\ninsights about the different data movement bottlenecks and use these insights\nto determine the most suitable data movement mitigation mechanism for a\nparticular application.

We make use of a one-square-degree map of\nvelocity-resolved [CII] line emission towards the Orion Nebula complex,\nincluding M43 and NGC 1977.

A slight\ndecrease in the FIR line-over-continuum intensity ratio can be attributed to a\ndecreased heating efficiency of the gas. We find that, at the mapped spatial\nscales, predictions of the star-formation rate from [CII] emission\nunderestimate the star-formation rate calculated from YSO counts in the Orion\nNebula complex by an order of magnitude.

However, they tend to yield worse performance\nwhen pre-trained on images in the wild.

We realize\nthis strategy with contrastive attraction and contrastive repulsion (CACR),\nwhich makes the query not only exert a greater force to attract more distant\npositive samples but also do so to repel closer negative samples. Theoretical\nanalysis reveals that CACR generalizes CL's behavior by taking into\nconsideration the differences between the distributions of the\npositive/negative samples, which in general are sampled independently of the\nquery, and their true conditional distributions given the query. We demonstrate\nthis unique intra-positive attraction and intra-negative repulsion mechanism,\nwhich helps remove the need to assume uniform prior distributions on both the\ndata and their latent representation, is particularly beneficial when data sets\nare less curated.

We assume that there are some inadvertent (or undesirable)\nfeatures of the input data that unnecessarily increase the cost of clustering.\nConsequently, we want to select a subset of the original features from the data\nsuch that there is a small-cost clustering on the selected features. More\nprecisely, for given integers $\\ell$ (the number of irrelevant features) and\n$k$ (the number of clusters), budget $B$, and a set of $n$ categorical data\npoints (represented by $m$-dimensional vectors whose elements belong to a\nfinite set of values $\\Sigma$), we want to select $m-\\ell$ relevant features\nsuch that the cost of any optimal $k$-clustering on these features does not\nexceed $B$.

The crux of few-shot learning is to extract prior knowledge from\nrelated tasks to enable fast adaptation to a new task with a limited amount of\ndata. In this paper, we propose meta-learning kernels with random Fourier\nfeatures for few-shot learning, we call MetaKernel. Specifically, we propose\nlearning variational random features in a data-driven manner to obtain\ntask-specific kernels by leveraging the shared knowledge provided by related\ntasks in a meta-learning setting. We treat the random feature basis as the\nlatent variable, which is estimated by variational inference. The shared\nknowledge from related tasks is incorporated into a context inference of the\nposterior, which we achieve via a long-short term memory module. To establish\nmore expressive kernels, we deploy conditional normalizing flows based on\ncoupling layers to achieve a richer posterior distribution over random Fourier\nbases. The resultant kernels are more informative and discriminative, which\nfurther improves the few-shot learning. To evaluate our method, we conduct\nextensive experiments on both few-shot image classification and regression\ntasks. A thorough ablation study demonstrates that the effectiveness of each\nintroduced component in our method.

MTL is based on\nthe assumption that the tasks under consideration are related; therefore it\nexploits shared knowledge for improving performance on each individual task.\nTasks are generally considered to be homogeneous, i.e., to refer to the same\ntype of problem. Moreover, MTL is usually based on ground truth annotations\nwith full, or partial overlap across tasks. In this work, we deal with\nheterogeneous MTL, simultaneously addressing detection, classification &\nregression problems. We explore task-relatedness as a means for co-training, in\na weakly-supervised way, tasks that contain little, or even non-overlapping\nannotations. Task-relatedness is introduced in MTL, either explicitly through\nprior expert knowledge, or through data-driven studies. We propose a novel\ndistribution matching approach, in which knowledge exchange is enabled between\ntasks, via matching of their predictions' distributions. Based on this\napproach, we build FaceBehaviorNet, the first framework for large-scale face\nanalysis, by jointly learning all facial behavior tasks.

A\ndriven cavity Lagrangian is derived from first principles, including the\neffects of cavity wall losses, input power and beam interaction. The general\nformulation is applied to a typical klystron input cavity to predict the\nappropriate detuning parameters required to maximize the gain (or modulation\ndepth) in the average Lorentz factor boost, $\\langle \\Delta\\gamma \\rangle$.\nNumerical examples are presented, showing agreement with the general detuning\ntrends previously observed in the literature. The developed formulation carries\nseveral advantages for beam-loaded cavity structures. It provides a\nself-consistent model for the dynamical (nonlinear) beam--field interaction, a\nprocedure for maximizing gain under beam-loading conditions, and a useful set\nof parameters to guide cavity-shape optimization during the design of\nbeam-loaded systems. Enhanced clarity of the physical picture underlying the\nproblem seems to be gained using this approach, allowing straightforward\ninclusion or exclusion of different field configurations in the calculation and\nexpressing the final results in terms of measurable quantities.

A small percent improvement on the CTR\nprediction accuracy has been mentioned to add millions of dollars of revenue to\nthe advertisement industry. Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction is a special\nversion of recommender system in which the goal is predicting whether or not a\nuser is going to click on a recommended item. A content-based recommendation\napproach takes into account the past history of the user's behavior, i.e. the\nrecommended products and the users reaction to them. So, a personalized model\nthat recommends the right item to the right user at the right time is the key\nto building such a model. On the other hand, the so-called collaborative\nfiltering approach incorporates the click history of the users who are very\nsimilar to a particular user, thereby helping the recommender to come up with a\nmore confident prediction for that particular user by leveraging the wider\nknowledge of users who share their taste in a connected network of users.

Fundamentally addressing this data movement bottleneck\nrequires a paradigm where the memory system assumes an active role in computing\nby integrating processing capabilities.

In order to enhance the informativeness\nof the generated text, existing solutions typically learn to copy entities or\ntriples from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, they lack overall consideration\nto select and arrange the incorporated knowledge, which tends to cause text\nincoherence.\n  To address the above issue, we focus on improving entity-centric coherence of\nthe generated reviews by leveraging the semantic structure of KGs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Coherence Enhanced Text Planning model (CETP) based\non knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve both global and local coherence for review\ngeneration. The proposed model learns a two-level text plan for generating a\ndocument: (1) the document plan is modeled as a sequence of sentence plans in\norder, and (2) the sentence plan is modeled as an entity-based subgraph from\nKG. Local coherence can be naturally enforced by KG subgraphs through\nintra-sentence correlations between entities. For global coherence, we design a\nhierarchical self-attentive architecture with both subgraph- and node-level\nattention to enhance the correlations between subgraphs. To our knowledge, we\nare the first to utilize a KG-based text planning model to enhance text\ncoherence for review generation.

Long GRBs\n(LGRBs) are associated with the end states of very massive stars, while short\nGRBs (SGRBs) are linked to the merger of compact objects. GRB 200826A was a\npeculiar event, because by definition it was a SGRB, with a rest-frame duration\nof ~ 0.5 s. However, this event was energetic and soft, which is consistent\nwith LGRBs. The relatively low redshift (z = 0.7486) motivated a comprehensive,\nmulti-wavelength follow-up campaign to characterize its host, search for a\npossible associated supernova (SN), and thus understand the origin of this\nburst. To this aim we obtained a combination of deep near-infrared (NIR) and\noptical imaging together with spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals an optical and\nNIR bump in the light curve whose luminosity and evolution is in agreement with\nseveral LGRB-SNe. Analysis of the prompt GRB shows that this event follows the\n$E_{\\rm p,i}-E_{\\rm iso}$ relation found for LGRBs. The host galaxy is a\nlow-mass star-forming galaxy, typical for LGRBs, but with one of the highest\nstar-formation rates (SFR), especially with respect to its mass ($\\log\nM_\\ast/M_\\odot = 8.6$, SFR $\\sim 4.0 \\,M_\\odot$/yr). We conclude that GRB\n200826A is a typical collapsar event in the low tail of the duration\ndistribution of LGRBs. These findings support theoretical predictions that\nevents produced by collapsars can be as short as 0.5 s in the host frame and\nfurther confirm that duration alone is not an efficient discriminator for the\nprogenitor class of a GRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 04:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 15:20:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 10:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Taking images in the rain however often\nresults in degraded quality of images, thus compromises the performance of many\ncomputer vision systems.

Moreover, even for single image based monocular deraining, many current\nmethods fail to complete the task satisfactorily because they mostly rely on\nper pixel loss functions and ignore semantic information. In this paper, we\npresent a Paired Rain Removal Network (PRRNet), which exploits both stereo\nimages and semantic information. Specifically, we develop a Semantic-Aware\nDeraining Module (SADM) which solves both tasks of semantic segmentation and\nderaining of scenes, and a Semantic-Fusion Network (SFNet) and a View-Fusion\nNetwork (VFNet) which fuse semantic information and multi-view information\nrespectively. In addition, we also introduce an Enhanced Paired Rain Removal\nNetwork (EPRRNet) which exploits semantic prior to remove rain streaks from\nstereo images. We first use a coarse deraining network to reduce the rain\nstreaks on the input images, and then adopt a pre-trained semantic segmentation\nnetwork to extract semantic features from the coarse derained image. Finally, a\nparallel stereo deraining network fuses semantic and multi-view information to\nrestore finer results. We also propose new stereo based rainy datasets for\nbenchmarking. Experiments on both monocular and the newly proposed stereo rainy\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 04:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Previous works usually use a\nsequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,\nwhich causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A\nstraightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive\n(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model\nfor ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly\nincreased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns\nand correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,\nwe propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit\nalignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output\nsentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence\nbased on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and\nextracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during\nedition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to\nadjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for\nparallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length\npredictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.\nExperiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale\nASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)\nit speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER\nreduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it\noutperforms the popular NAR models adopted in neural machine translation and\ntext edition by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 05:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 13:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 02:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 06:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 09:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

By horizontally rotating a quasi two-dimensional\ngranular pile whose apex is located at the vertical rotation axis, the\nresultant force of gravity and centrifuge yields the deformation of the\ngranular pile. In this setup, centrifugal force depends on distance from the\nrotation axis whilst gravitational force is constant everywhere. Therefore,\nfree-surface deformation by various centrifuge degrees can be systematically\nexamined using this apparatus. In the system, a small unit consisting of a\ncamera and computer is rotated with the granular sample to record the\nrotation-induced deformation. To evaluate the validity of the system,\ndeformation of a rotated water surface is first measured and analyzed. The\nobtained data are properly explained by the theoretical parabolas without any\nfitting parameter. Next, we measure the deformation of non-cohesive and\ncohesive granular piles using the developed apparatus. Both granular samples\nshow the significant deformation of granular pile and finally develop steep\ngranular slopes on the side walls. However, details of the deformation\nprocesses depend on the cohesion strength.

In this study, we present lambda-BCE and lambda-smooth L1loss to\neffectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model\ncan learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices.

For 5G integrated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite\ncommunication systems, the timing advance (TA) is required to be estimated in\nthe initial random access procedure in order to facilitate the uplink frame\nalignment among different users. However, due to the inherent characteristics\nof LEO satellite communication systems, e.g., wide beam coverage and long\npropagation delays, the existing 5G terrestrial uplink TA scheme is not\napplicable in the satellite networks. In this paper, we investigate\nlocation-based TA estimation for 5G integrated LEO satellite communication\nsystems. We obtain the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency\ndifference of arrival (FDOA) measurements in the downlink timing and frequency\nsynchronization phase, which are made from the satellite at different time\ninstants. We propose to take these measurements for either UE geolocation or\nephemeris estimation, thus calculating the TA value. The estimation is then\nformulated as a quadratic optimization problem whose globally optimal solution\ncan be obtained by a quadratic penalty algorithm. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity, we further propose an alternative approximation method based on\niteratively performing a linearization procedure on the quadratic equality\nconstraints.

In this work, we revisit the higher-order PageRank problem and\nconsider how to solve it efficiently. The contribution of this work is as\nfollows. First, we accelerate the truncated power method for high-order\nPageRank. In the improved version, it is neither to form and store the vectors\narising from the dangling states, nor to store an auxiliary matrix. Second, we\npropose a truncated power method with partial updating to further release the\noverhead, in which one only needs to update some important columns of the\napproximation in each iteration. On the other hand, the truncated power method\nsolves a modified high-order PageRank model for convenience, which is not\nmathematically equivalent to the original one.

A theory is used\nthat allows one to obtain MESM in Minkowski space only if we start with an\naccurate account of gravity and only at the end go to the limit of Minkowski\nspace. Spontaneous breaking of left-right symmetry and the \"wrong\" sign in the\nmass terms of the Higgs fields potentials arise due to the initial conditions\nimposed on the T-model inflation. MESM allows choosing the universal Yukawa\ncoupling constant $y$ in the underlying Lagrangian for all generations of\ncharged leptons and up-quarks. As an example, with y=10^{-3}, it is shown that\na set of additional dimensionless parameters in width range less than 0.5 is\nsufficient to obtain the masses of all known charged leptons and up-quarks. In\nthis sense, MESM bypasses the problem of the fermion mass hierarchy. With this\nchoice of parameters, MESM predicts that vacuum expectation value for the\nmirror Higgs field is 10^{14}GeV and masses of mirror particles are in the\nrange 10^{8}GeV-10^{14}GeV. There is only gravitational interaction between\nparticles of the SM and mirror sectors. Hence, mirror particles can constitute\ndark matter. The vacuum is realized as a limiting state in the cosmological\nevolution of the inflaton and classical Higgs fields, in which the energy\nstored in them becomes minimal, providing the maximum possible contribution of\nthese fields to the entropy of the Universe. If further study of the model\nreveals the existence of an effective mechanism for preheating the Universe,\nthis will mean that the cosmological constant problem is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 08:57:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 15:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 15:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 10:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Consequently, we have provided semiclassical\nmagnetic structures of the degenerate ground state and the metastable state via\nboth magnetic symmetries and experimental constraints. Moreover, we have\ndiscovered mechanisms raising degeneracy and metastability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 10:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) have emerged as a\npopular modeling framework by removing the need for ML practitioners to choose\nthe number of layers in a recurrent model. While we can control the\ncomputational cost by choosing the number of layers in standard architectures,\nin NDEs the number of neural network evaluations for a forward pass can depend\non the number of steps of the adaptive ODE solver. But, can we force the NDE to\nlearn the version with the least steps while not increasing the training cost?\nCurrent strategies to overcome slow prediction require high order automatic\ndifferentiation, leading to significantly higher training time. We describe a\nnovel regularization method that uses the internal cost heuristics of adaptive\ndifferential equation solvers combined with discrete adjoint sensitivities to\nguide the training process towards learning NDEs that are easier to solve. This\napproach opens up the blackbox numerical analysis behind the differential\nequation solver's algorithm and directly uses its local error estimates and\nstiffness heuristics as cheap and accurate cost estimates.

We find that for the iso-symmetric quark matter, the\nmodification reduces the chemical potential of the phase coexistence region of\nthe first--order phase transition. We also implement the relativistic mean\nfield theory to describe the hadron matter, and make use of the Maxwell and\nGibbs construction method to study the phase transition of beta--equilibrium\nand charge neutral matter in compact stars. The results show that the phase\ntransition will not happen in case of the Gaussian--type gluon model without\nany modification. The results also indicate that the upper boundary of the\ncoexistence region should be larger than the current Nambu solution existing\nregion.

Naturally, users need different term types\neither to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient\ndata structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic\nsystem which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the\ndomain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface\nwhich allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by\nformalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can\nretroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the\npre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term\nconstruction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations.\nFurther, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary\nterm-rewriting implementations. We demonstrate the ability to swap between\nclassical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting\nsimplifiers. We showcase an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU\ncycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a\nreal-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we\nshow a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to\nbe automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch\ntracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x\nsimulation speedup.

Hence, a subclass of ZD strategies can\nfix the opponent's expected payoff and another subclass of the strategies can\nexceed the opponent for the expected payoff. Since this discovery, theories for\nZD strategies are extended to cope with various natural situations. It is\nespecially important to consider the theory of ZD strategies for repeated games\nwith a discount factor and observation errors because it allows the theory to\nbe applicable in the real world. Recent studies revealed their existence of ZD\nstrategies even in repeated games with both factors. However, the conditions\nfor the existence has not been sufficiently analyzed.

In this work, based on symmetry analysis and\nfirst-principles calculations, we propose that hourglass Weyl nodal line (HWNL)\nphonons and Dirac nodal line (DNL) phonons coexist in the phonon dispersion of\na single material, KCuS, with a $Pnma$-type structure. The HWNLs and DNLs are\nrelatively flat in frequency and well separated from other phonon bands. The\ncorresponding topological phonon surface states appear only in the [100] and\n[001] surfaces, unlike those of typical phononic nodal-line materials. The\nreason for this phenomenon is explained based on Zak phase calculations. Our\nwork, for the first time, proves that phononic nodal lines with different types\nof degeneracies can be achieved in one single material. Thus, KCuS can be\nviewed as a good platform to investigate the entanglement between HWNL phonons\nand DNL phonons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 15:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

HAp is a bioceramic material used as a plasma-sprayed coating to\npromote osseointegra-tion of femoral stems. Biomaterial coatings are fabricated\nmostly using atmospheric plasma spray (APS). However, the conventional plasma\nspray process requires hydrox-yapatite powder with good flow, and to prepare\nsuch free-flowing powder, agglomer-ation, such as spray drying, fusing, and\ncrushing is used. Therefore, it is impossible to spray nano-powder using\nconventional methods. Here, we designed a suspension-feeding system to feed\nnanoparticles using a liquid carrier. Suspension plasma spray (SPS)\nsuccessfully deposited homogeneous HAp/Gray Titania coating with less poros-ity\non the surface of titanium substrates. The microstructure of coatings with\ndiffer-ent compositions was then characterized using scanning electron\nmicroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy to identify the crystal\nstructure. All results con-sistently demonstrated that SPS could transform Ti2\nO3 into TiO2 with mixed Magneli phases, such as Ti4 O7 and Ti3 O5, which\nusually show photocatalytic activity. Interfacial strength, hardness, young\nmodulus, and fracture toughness were also improved with a high concentration of\nTiO2. Antibacterial test for E.Coli under LED light re-vealed that SPSed\nHAp/Gray Titania coating could significantly enhance antibacterial properties.\nThe possible underlying mechanism of enhanced antibacterial properties can be\nattributed to increased Magneli phases and better bacterial adhesion caused by\nhydrophilic properties due to submicron size particles. SPS can fabricate\nvisible light-responsive antibacterial coating, which can be used for medical\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 07:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

One of\nthe most important aspects of cloud computing for IaaS is resource management.\nScalability, quality of service, optimum utility, reduced overheads, increased\nthroughput, reduced latency, specialised environment, cost effectiveness, and a\nstreamlined interface are some of the advantages of resource management for\nIaaS in cloud computing. Traditionally, resource management has been done\nthrough static policies, which impose certain limitations in various dynamic\nscenarios, prompting cloud service providers to adopt data-driven,\nmachine-learning-based approaches.

At present, rich resource data-based SA has been well developed,\nwhile the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e. a\ntarget domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom\nstudied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of\nsupervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts),\nand the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the\ndistinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private\nknowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain\nadaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based\nshared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain common\nfeatures and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In\nthe second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared private\narchitecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first\nmechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers\nknowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a\ntarget-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred\nthrough a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations\nverify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised\nstate-of-the-art competitors.
