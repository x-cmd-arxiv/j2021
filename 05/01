An interesting perspective over the role and nature of dark energy\ncan be achieved by drawing a parallel with a previous epoch of accelerated\nexpansion, inflation, which we assume to be driven by a single scalar field,\nthe inflaton. Since the Planck satellite has constrained the value of $n_s$\naway from 1, the inflaton cannot be identified with a pure cosmological\nconstant, as is also suggested by the fact that inflation ended. Thus, it is\ninteresting to verify whether a hypothetical observer would have been able to\nmeasure the deviation of the w of the inflaton from -1. To do so, we consider a\nclass of single-field slow-roll inflationary models dubbed HSR{i}, where the\nhierarchy of Hubble slow-roll parameters is truncated at the i-th order. The\nmodels are tested through a MCMC analysis based on combinations of the latest\nPlanck and BICEP2/Keck data sets, and the resulting chains are converted into\nsets of allowed evolution histories of w. HSR{1} is excluded observationally\nsince it would predict that $n_s=1$, in contrast with the recent Planck\nconstraints, while we find that HSR{2} would prefer w>-1, but is disfavoured by\nthe addition of the BICEP2/Keck data.

However, FWI with unknown sources is a severely\nunderdetermined optimization problem, and hence requires strong prior\ninformation about the sources and/or the velocity model. The frequency-domain\nwavefield reconstruction inversion method (WRI) has shown promising results to\nmitigate the nonlinearity of the FWI objective function that is generated by\ncycle-skipping. WRI relies on the reconstruction of data-assimilated\nwavefields, which approach the true wavefields near the receivers, a helpful\nfeature when the source is added as an additional optimization variable. We\npresent an adaptation of a recently proposed version of WRI based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that first finds the\nlocation of the MSEs and then reconstructs the wavefields and the source\nsignatures jointly. Finally, the subsurface model is updated to focus the MSEs\nat their true location. The method does not require prior knowledge of the\nnumber of MSEs.

By compiling queries this interpretation overhead is\neliminated at the cost of a compilation phase that delays execution,\nsacrificing latency for throughput. For short-lived queries, minimizing latency\nis important, while for long-running queries throughput outweighs latency.\nBecause neither a purely interpretive model nor a purely compiling model can\nprovide low latency and high throughput, adaptive solutions emerged. Adaptive\nsystems seamlessly transition from interpreted to compiled execution, achieving\nlow latency for short-lived queries and high throughput for long-running\nqueries. However, these adaptive systems pose an immense development effort and\nrequire expert knowledge in both interpreter and compiler design.\n  In this work, we investigate query execution by compilation to WebAssembly.\nWe are able to compile even complex queries in less than a millisecond to\nmachine code with near-optimal performance. By delegating execution of\nWebAssembly to the V8 engine, we are able to seamlessly transition from rapidly\ncompiled yet non-optimized code to thoroughly optimized code during execution.\nOur approach provides both low latency and high throughput, is adaptive out of\nthe box, and is straight forward to implement.

The latter is of first importance since it controls the\nnucleation, propagation and arrest of the seismic rupture. On one side,\nfracture energy estimated for natural earthquakes (breakdown work) shows a\nclear slip-dependence. On the other side, recent experimental studies\nhighlighted that, fracture energy is a material property limited by an upper\nbound value corresponding to the fracture energy of the intact material\nindependently of the size of the event. To reconcile these contradictory\nobservations, we performed stick-slip experiments in a bi-axial shear\nconfiguration. We analyzed the fault weakening during frictional rupture by\naccessing to the near-fault stress-slip curve through strain gauge array. We\nfirst estimated fracture energy by comparing the measured strain with the\ntheoretical predictions from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and a Cohesive\nZone Model. By comparing these values to the breakdown work obtained from the\nintegration of the stress-slip curve, we show that, at the scale of our\nexperiments, fault weakening is divided into two stages; the first one\nconsistent with the estimated fracture energy, and a long-tailed weakening\ncorresponding to a larger energy not localized at the rupture tip, increasing\nwith slip. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that only the first\nweakening stage controls the rupture initiation and that the breakdown work\ninduced by the long-tailed weakening can enhance slip during rupture\npropagation and allow the rupture to overcome stress heterogeneity along the\nfault. We conclude that the origin of the seismological estimates of breakdown\nwork could be related to the energy dissipated in the long-tailed weakening\nrather than to the one dissipated near the tip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 16:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The action inherits a gauged scale symmetry $D(1)$\n(known as Weyl gauge symmetry) from the underlying geometry. The associated\nWeyl quadratic gravity undergoes spontaneous breaking of $D(1)$ by a geometric\nStueckelberg mechanism in which the Weyl gauge field ($\\omega_\\mu$) acquires\nmass by \"absorbing\" the spin-zero mode ($\\phi_0$) of the $\\tilde R^2$ term in\nthe action. This mode also generates the Planck scale and the cosmological\nconstant. The Einstein-Proca action of $\\omega_\\mu$ emerges in the broken\nphase. In the presence of the SM, this mechanism receives corrections (from the\nHiggs) and it can induce electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking. The EW scale is\nproportional to the vev of the Stueckelberg field ($\\phi_0$). The Higgs field\n($\\sigma$) has direct couplings to the Weyl gauge field, and its mass may be\nprotected at quantum level by the D(1) symmetry.

While it plays a fundamental role in the development and\napplication of unsteady aerodynamic methods, explicit expressions for this\nfunction are difficult to obtain. The Wagner function requires computation of\nan inverse Laplace transform, or similar inversion, of a non-rational function\nin the Laplace domain, which is closely related to the Theodorsen function.\nThis has led to numerous proposed approximations to the Wagner function, which\nfacilitate convenient and rapid computations. While these approximations can be\nsufficient for many purposes, their behavior is often noticeably different from\nthe true Wagner function, especially for long-time asymptotic behavior. In\nparticular, while many approximations have small maximum absolute error across\nall times, the relative error of the asymptotic behavior can be substantial. As\nwell as documenting this error, we propose an alternative approximation\nmethodology that is accurate for all times, for a variety of accuracy measures.\nThis methodology casts the Wagner function as the solution of a nonlinear\nscalar ordinary differential equation, which is identified using a variant of\nthe sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. We show that\nthis approach can give accurate approximations using either first- or\nsecond-order differential equations.

This paper presents the thermal conductivity measurement of\nflowing fluid within a pipe using a non-contact modulated photothermal\nradiometry (MPR) technique, where the surface of the pipe is heated by an\nintensity-modulated laser and the heat diffuses into the fluid with suitable\nmodulation frequency.

Intrinsic thermal conductivity of different fluids was obtained within\na proper range of frequency and flow velocity where the forced convection\neffect is negligible. The forced convection effect became prominent at high\nflowing velocity and at low modulation frequency, leading to overestimated\nthermal conductivity of fluid.

The proposed method may be extended to the decoding of\nconvolutional codes and block codes by Monte-Carlo trellis search, to enable\nsmooth complexity-performance trade-offs in these decoding tasks.

However,\nannotation of complex activities is usually time consuming and challenging in\npractice. Therefore, recent works started to tackle the problem of unsupervised\nlearning of sub-actions in complex activities. This paper proposes a novel\napproach for unsupervised sub-action learning in complex activities. The\nproposed method maps both visual and temporal representations to a latent space\nwhere the sub-actions are learnt discriminatively in an end-to-end fashion. To\nthis end, we propose to learn sub-actions as latent concepts and a novel\ndiscriminative latent concept learning (DLCL) module aids in learning\nsub-actions. The proposed DLCL module lends on the idea of latent concepts to\nlearn compact representations in the latent embedding space in an unsupervised\nway. The result is a set of latent vectors that can be interpreted as cluster\ncenters in the embedding space. The latent space itself is formed by a joint\nvisual and temporal embedding capturing the visual similarity and temporal\nordering of the data. Our joint learning with discriminative latent concept\nmodule is novel which eliminates the need for explicit clustering. We validate\nour approach on three benchmark datasets and show that the proposed combination\nof visual-temporal embedding and discriminative latent concepts allow to learn\nrobust action representations in an unsupervised setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 20:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Most existing schemes classify entire traffic flows, but there\nare major limitations to their practicality. At a network router, the packets\nneed to be processed with minimum delay, so the classifier cannot wait until\nthe end of the flow to make a decision. Furthermore, a complicated machine\nlearning algorithm can be too computationally expensive to implement inside the\nrouter. In this paper, we introduce flow-packet hybrid traffic classification\n(FPHTC), where the router makes a decision per packet based on a routing policy\nthat is designed through transferring the learned knowledge from a flow-based\nclassifier residing outside the router. We analyze the generalization bound of\nFPHTC and show its advantage over regular packet-based traffic classification.\nWe present experimental results using a real-world traffic dataset to\nillustrate the classification performance of FPHTC.

To alleviate this problem, we\npropose to train the generation model in a bidirectional manner by adding a\nbackward reasoning step to the vanilla encoder-decoder training.

The advantage of our method is\nthat the forward generation and backward reasoning steps are trained\nsimultaneously through the use of a latent variable to facilitate bidirectional\noptimization.

As a consequence, (i) agents may have difficulties to reasoning\nabout how to achieve their own social goals with the help of artificial\ninstitutions and (ii) these institutions are not well instrumented to receive\nincoming agents, in the case of open systems. Considering those problems, this\npaper proposes a model to express the functions -- or the purposes --\nassociated with the status-functions helping the agents to reason about their\nsocial goals and the institution. We evaluate the model by using it in some\nscenarios, showing how the agents can use purposes to reason about the\nsatisfaction of their social goals in institutional contexts and how the\ninstitution can be flexible enough to support new agents operating in the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 21:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Conventional monocular SLAM has two major\nchallenges leading inaccurate localization and mapping. First, it is\nchallenging to estimate scales in localization and mapping. Second,\nconventional monocular SLAM uses inappropriate mapping factors such as dynamic\nobjects and low-parallax areas in mapping. This paper proposes an improved\nreal-time monocular SLAM that resolves the aforementioned challenges by\nefficiently using deep learning-based semantic segmentation. To achieve the\nreal-time execution of the proposed method, we apply semantic segmentation only\nto downsampled keyframes in parallel with mapping processes. In addition, the\nproposed method corrects scales of camera poses and three-dimensional (3D)\npoints, using estimated ground plane from road-labeled 3D points and the real\ncamera height. The proposed method also removes inappropriate corner features\nlabeled as moving objects and low parallax areas. Experiments with eight video\nsequences demonstrate that the proposed monocular SLAM system achieves\nsignificantly improved and comparable trajectory tracking accuracy, compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art monocular and stereo SLAM systems, respectively.

While\napproximate computing techniques can be developed for individual\nhigh-performance computing applications by domain specialists, this often\nrequires additional theoretical analysis and potentially extensive software\nmodification. Hence, the development of low-level error-bounded approximate\ncomputing strategies that can be introduced into any high-performance computing\napplication without requiring additional analysis or significant software\nalterations is desirable. In this paper, we provide a contribution in this\ndirection by proposing a general framework for designing error-bounded\napproximate computing strategies and apply it to the dot product kernel to\ndevelop qdot -- an error-bounded approximate dot product kernel.

For these efforts to be successful, a solid\nexperimental methodology is needed to evaluate workflow algorithms and systems.\nA foundation for this methodology is the availability of realistic workflow\ninstances. Dozens of workflow instances for a few scientific applications are\navailable in public repositories. While these are invaluable, they are limited:\nworkflow instances are not available for all application scales of interest. To\naddress this limitation, previous work has developed generators of synthetic,\nbut representative, workflow instances of arbitrary scales. These generators\nare popular, but implementing them is a manual, labor-intensive process that\nrequires expert application knowledge. As a result, these generators only\ntarget a handful of applications, even though hundreds of applications use\nworkflows in production.\n  In this work, we present WfChef, a framework that fully automates the process\nof constructing a synthetic workflow generator for any scientific application.\nBased on an input set of workflow instances, WfChef automatically produces a\nsynthetic workflow generator.

While science is\nheavily supported by public funding, common depictions suggest that scientific\nresearch remains an isolated or 'ivory tower' activity, with weak connectivity\nto public use, little relationship between the quality of research and its\npublic use, and little correspondence between the funding of science and its\npublic use. This paper introduces a measurement framework to examine public\ngood features of science, allowing us to study public uses of science, the\npublic funding of science, and how use and funding relate. Specifically, we\nintegrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all\nscientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses\nacross three public domains - government documents, the news media, and\nmarketplace invention. We find that the public uses of science are extremely\ndiverse, with different public domains drawing distinctively across scientific\nfields. Yet amidst these differences, we find key forms of alignment in the\ninterface between science and society. First, despite concerns that the public\ndoes not engage high-quality science, we find universal alignment, in each\nscientific field and public domain, between what the public consumes and what\nis highly impactful within science. Second, despite myriad factors underpinning\nthe public funding of science, the resulting allocation across fields presents\na striking alignment with the field's collective public use. Overall, public\nuses of science present a rich landscape of specialized consumption, yet\ncollectively science and society interface with remarkable, quantifiable\nalignment between scientific use, public use, and funding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 03:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Cache-enabled Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, which is recognized\nas one of the key enablers of the fifth generation (5G) cellular network, is a\npromising solution to alleviate this problem. However, conventional half-duplex\n(HD) communication may not be sufficient to provide fast enough content\ndelivery over D2D links in order to meet strict latency targets of emerging D2D\napplications.

The second approach uses subtle differences between text\ngenerated by language models and real natural text to produce trigger sentences\nwith correct grammar and high fluency. We demonstrate that the proposed hidden\nbackdoors can be effective across three downstream security-critical NLP tasks,\nrepresentative of modern human-centric NLP systems, including toxic comment\ndetection, neural machine translation (NMT), and question answering (QA).

To achieve high data rates, system performance\nremains a challenge given the impact of propagation channels in mm-wave that is\ninsufficient in both path loss, delay spread, and penetration loss.

In this paper, the distributed\npowers in the small cell to suppress path loss by specifying a considerable\npower and controlling the distributed power to reduce the high cost and energy\nconsumption was proposed. The hybrid beamforming in mm-wave exploits a large\nbandwidth which reduces the large path loss in Rayleigh fading channel.

When\nprobing an ensemble of molecules, the question therefore arises: What quantum\nstate should be used to describe the molecular ensemble following spontaneous\nStokes scattering? We experimentally address this question by measuring\ntime-resolved Stokes--anti-Stokes two-photon coincidences on a molecular liquid\nconsisting of several sub-ensembles with slightly different vibrational\nfrequencies. When spontaneously scattered Stokes photons and subsequent\nanti-Stokes photons are detected into a single spatiotemporal mode, the\nobserved dynamics is inconsistent with a statistical mixture of individually\nexcited molecules. Instead, we show that the data are reproduced if\nStokes--anti-Stokes correlations are mediated by a collective vibrational\nquantum, i.e. a coherent superposition of all molecules interacting with light.\nOur results demonstrate that the degree of coherence in the vibrational state\nof the liquid is not an intrinsic property of the material system, but rather\ndepends on the optical excitation and detection geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 10:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 14:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 20:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

However,\nreviews can be lengthy, may contain repeated, or sometimes irrelevant\ninformation that does not help in decision making. In this paper, we introduce\nMRCBert, a novel unsupervised method to generate summaries from product\nreviews. We leverage Machine Reading Comprehension, i.e. MRC, approach to\nextract relevant opinions and generate both rating-wise and aspect-wise\nsummaries from reviews. Through MRCBert we show that we can obtain reasonable\nperformance using existing models and transfer learning, which can be useful\nfor learning under limited or low resource scenarios. We demonstrated our\nresults on reviews of a product from the Electronics category in the Amazon\nReviews dataset. Our approach is unsupervised as it does not require any\ndomain-specific dataset, such as the product review dataset, for training or\nfine-tuning. Instead, we have used SQuAD v1.1 dataset only to fine-tune BERT\nfor the MRC task. Since MRCBert does not require a task-specific dataset, it\ncan be easily adapted and used in other domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 12:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

To overcome the limitations, here we\npropose a fully unsupervised quality enhancement scheme, which boosts the\nresolution and removes the motion artifact simultaneously. This process is done\nby first training the network using optimal transport driven cycleGAN with\nstochastic degradation block which learns to remove aliasing artifacts and\nenhance the resolution, then using the trained network in the test stage by\nutilizing bootstrap subsampling and aggregation for motion artifact\nsuppression. We further show that we can control the trade-off between the\namount of artifact correction and resolution by controlling the bootstrap\nsubsampling ratio at the inference stage. To the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed method is the first to tackle super-resolution and motion artifact\ncorrection simultaneously in the context of MRI using unsupervised learning.

In order to address these challenges, this\nresearch proposes a novel attribute-assisted loss, which utilizes ancillary\ninformation to learn discriminative features for classification.

Few\ndeep matrix factorization methods provide a basis for the selection of the new\nrepresentation's dimensions of different layers. ii) the majority of current\napproaches only concentrate on the view-shared information and ignore the\nspecific local features in different views.

Furthermore, radiologist validation on\nselect cases by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of\nexperience, respectively, showed consistency between radiologist interpretation\nand critical factors leveraged by COVID-Net CXR-S for severity assessment.\nWhile not a production-ready solution, the ultimate goal for the open source\nrelease of COVID-Net CXR-S is to act as a catalyst for clinical scientists,\nmachine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to develop\ninnovative new clinical decision support solutions for helping clinicians\naround the world manage the continuing pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 14:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

To this end,\nwe focus on the joint positioning of UAVs and the association of TSBSs such\nthat the sum-rate of the overall system is maximized.

Computational\nmethods efficiently predict DTIs and recommend a small part of potential\ninteracting pairs for further experimental confirmation, accelerating the drug\ndiscovery process. Although it has been shown that fusing heterogeneous drug\nand target similarities can improve the prediction ability, the existing\nsimilarity combination methods ignore the interaction consistency for neighbour\nentities which is more crucial for the DTI prediction model. Furthermore, area\nunder the precision-recall curve (AUPR) that emphasizes the accuracy of\ntop-ranked pairs and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUC) that heavily punishes the existence of low ranked interacting pairs are\ntwo widely used evaluation metrics in DTI prediction. However, the two metrics\nare seldom considered as losses within existing DTI prediction methods. This\npaper first proposes two matrix factorization (MF) methods that optimize AUPR\nand AUC using convex surrogate losses respectively, and then develops an\nensemble MF approach takes advantage of the two area under the curve metrics by\ncombining the two single metric based MF models. Both three proposed approaches\nincorporate a novel local interaction consistency aware similarity interaction\nmethod to generate fused drug and target similarities that preserve vital\ninformation from the more reliable view. Experimental results over five\ndatasets under different prediction settings show that the proposed methods\noutperform various competitors in terms of the metric(s) they optimize. In\naddition, the validation on the top ranked novel predictions confirms the\nability of our methods to discover potential new DTIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 14:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 04:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

These social determinants of infectious disease and\nvulnerability to disaster have converged to affect already disadvantaged\ncommunities with higher levels of economic instability, disease exposure,\ninfection severity, and death.

The main aim is to make\nthe cooking process easier, safer, and create human welfare. To allow robots to\naccurately perform the cooking activities, it is important for them to\nunderstand the cooking environment and recognize the objects, especially\ncorrectly identifying the state of the cooking objects. This will significantly\nimprove the correctness of the following cooking recipes. In this project,\nseveral parts of the experiment were conducted to design a robust deep\nconvolutional neural network for classifying the state of the cooking objects\nfrom scratch. The model is evaluated by using various techniques, such as\nadjusting architecture layers, tuning key hyperparameters, and using different\noptimization techniques to maximize the accuracy of state classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 22:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}
