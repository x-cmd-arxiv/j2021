Particularly, when only \"single\" noisy images are\navailable for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing\nmethods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image\ndenoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in\nthe above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which\nutilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow\ninference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and\nthat of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we\npropose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise,\nwhich consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates\nPoisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional\nmethods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise\naffine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.\nConsequently, we show that our FBI-Denoiser blindly trained solely based on\nsingle noisy images can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several\nreal-world noisy image benchmark datasets with much faster inference time (x\n10), compared to BP-AIDE.

In statistics, power law\ndistribution is often found to fit data exceptionally well when the normal\n(Gaussian) distribution fails. Nevertheless, predicting power law phenomena is\nnotoriously difficult because some of its idiosyncratic properties such as lack\nof well-defined average value, and potentially unbounded variance. TPL\n(Taylor's power law), a power law first discovered to characterize the spatial\nand/or temporal distribution of biological populations and recently extended to\ndescribe the spatiotemporal heterogeneities (distributions) of human\nmicrobiomes and other natural and artificial systems such as fitness\ndistribution in computational (artificial) intelligence. The power law with\nexponential cutoff (PLEC) is a variant of power-law function that tapers off\nthe exponential growth of power-law function ultimately and can be particularly\nuseful for certain predictive problems such as biodiversity estimation and\nturning-point prediction for COVID-19 infection/fatality. Here, we propose\ncoupling (integration) of TPL and PLEC to offer improved prediction quality of\ncertain power-law phenomena.

Using a scenario tree\nrepresentation of the uncertainties, we formulate a multistage stochastic\ninteger program to dynamically locate facilities in each period and compare it\nwith a two-stage approach that determines the facility locations up front. In\nthe multistage model, in each stage, a decision maker optimizes facility\nlocations and recourse flows from open facilities to demand sites, to minimize\ncertain risk measures of the cost associated with current facility location and\nshipment decisions. When the budget is also uncertain, a popular modeling\nframework is to prioritize the candidate sites.

Uniform post-training\nquantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented\nefficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a\ntraining set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with\nnegligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with\nPTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the\nincrease in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware\nquantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation\nsparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit\nquantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of\n8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value\nbits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we\nfocus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal\nto zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the\nother's 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically\nquantized to 4 bits, as described.

To the best of our knowledge, studying and\nbalancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their\nimpacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises\nsignificantly faster FL.

As analyzed by Rafikov\n(2020), Doppler boosting of stellar light may be of relevance at the pericenter\nof stellar orbits, especially with the upcoming high-precision photometry in\nthe near- and mid-infrared bands. Here we analyze the previously neglected\neffect of infrared spectral index of monitored objects on the Doppler-boosted\ncontinuum emission in a narrow band. In contrast to main-sequences stars, the\ndetected compact infrared-excess dust-enshrouded objects have an enhanced\nDoppler-boosting effect by as much as an order of magnitude, with the\nvariability amplitude of the order of ten percent for the most eccentric\norbits. In a similar way, pulsars dominated by non-thermal synchrotron emission\nare also expected to exhibit a stronger Doppler-boosted signal by a factor of\nat least four in comparison with canonical S stars. In case the stellar orbit\nis robustly determined, the relative flux variation can thus provide hints\nabout the nature of the objects. For extended dust-enshrouded objects, such as\nG1, that are variable due to tidal, ellipsoidal, bow-shock, and irradiation\neffects, the subtraction of the expected Doppler-boosting variations will help\nto better comprehend their internal physics. In addition, the relative flux\nvariability due to higher-order relativistic effects is also modified for\ndifferent negative spectral indices in a way that it can obtain both positive\nand negative values with the relative variability of the order of one percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 22:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

It is based\non the transformer backbone and offers interpretability of the model's\ndecisions at both the epoch and sequence level. We further propose a simple yet\nefficient method to quantify uncertainty in the model's decisions.

Results: Making sense of the\ntransformer's self-attention scores for interpretability, at the epoch level,\nthe attention scores are encoded as a heat map to highlight sleep-relevant\nfeatures captured from the input EEG signal. At the sequence level, the\nattention scores are visualized as the influence of different neighboring\nepochs in an input sequence (i.e. the context) to recognition of a target\nepoch, mimicking the way manual scoring is done by human experts.

The main idea is to\nrepresent a text as a context-free grammar whose language is precisely the\ninput string. This is called a straight-line grammar (SLG). An AVL grammar,\nproposed by Rytter [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003] is a type of SLG that\nadditionally satisfies the AVL-property: the heights of parse-trees for\nchildren of every nonterminal differ by at most one. In contrast to other SLG\nconstructions, AVL grammars can be constructed from the LZ77 parsing in\ncompressed time: $\\mathcal{O}(z \\log n)$ where $z$ is the size of the LZ77\nparsing and $n$ is the length of the input text. Despite these advantages, AVL\ngrammars are thought to be too large to be practical.\n  We present a new technique for rapidly constructing a small AVL grammar from\nan LZ77 or LZ77-like parse. Our algorithm produces grammars that are always at\nleast five times smaller than those produced by the original algorithm, and\nnever more than double the size of grammars produced by the practical Re-Pair\ncompressor [Larsson and Moffat, Proc. IEEE, 2000]. Our algorithm also achieves\nlow peak RAM usage. By combining this algorithm with recent advances in\napproximating the LZ77 parsing, we show that our method has the potential to\nconstruct a run-length BWT from an LZ77 parse in about one third of the time\nand peak RAM required by other approaches. Overall, we show that AVL grammars\nare surprisingly practical, opening the door to much faster construction of key\ncompressed data structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 00:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

The proposed approach is comprised of two\nmain parts. The first is a nonlinear customizable pose mapping based on\nThin-Plate Splines (TPS), to directly transfer human body motion to robotic arm\nmotion in a nonlinear fashion, thus allowing matching dissimilar bodies with\ndifferent workspace shapes and kinematic constraints. The second is a Deep\nNeural Network hand-state classifier based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional\nNetworks (LRCN) that exploits the temporal coherence of the acquired depth\ndata. We validate, evaluate and compare our approach through both classical\ncross-validation experiments of the proposed hand state classifier; and user\nstudies over a set of practical experiments involving variants of\npick-and-place and manufacturing tasks.

In the field of anomaly detection, improvements in deep learning opened\nnew prospects of exploration for the researchers whom tried to automate the\nlabor-intensive features of data collection. First, in terms of data\ncollection, it is impossible to anticipate all the anomalies that might exist\nin a given environment. Second, assuming we limit the possibilities of\nanomalies, it will still be hard to record all these scenarios for the sake of\ntraining a model. Third, even if we manage to record a significant amount of\nabnormal data, it's laborious to annotate this data on pixel or even frame\nlevel. Various approaches address the problem by proposing one-class\nclassification using generative models trained on only normal data. In such\nmethods, only the normal data is used, which is abundantly available and\ndoesn't require significant human input. However, these are trained with only\nnormal data and at the test time, given abnormal data as input, may often\ngenerate normal-looking output. This happens due to the hallucination\ncharacteristic of generative models. Next, these systems are designed to not\nuse abnormal examples during the training. In this paper, we propose anomaly\ndetection with negative learning (ADNL), which employs the negative learning\nconcept for the enhancement of anomaly detection by utilizing a very small\nnumber of labeled anomaly data as compared with the normal data during\ntraining. The idea is to limit the reconstruction capability of a generative\nmodel using the given a small amount of anomaly examples. This way, the network\nnot only learns to reconstruct normal data but also encloses the normal\ndistribution far from the possible distribution of anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 01:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

It demonstrated that superconductivity is an equilibrium\nstate of matter, thus allowing to use thermodynamics for its study. This\nprovided a justification for the two-fluid model of Gorter and Casimir, a\nseminal thermodynamic theory founded on a postulate of zero entropy of the\nsuperconducting (S) component of conduction electrons. It also demonstrated\nthat, apart from zero resistivity, the S phase is also characterized by zero\nmagnetic induction, used as a basic postulate in the theory of Londons\nunderlying the understanding of electromagnetic properties of superconductors.\nHere the experimental and theoretical aspects of the Meissner effect are\nreviewed. The reader will see that, in spite of almost nine decades age, the\nLondon theory still contains questions, the answers to which can lead to a\nrevision of the standard picture of the Meissner state (MS) and other\nsuperconducting states. An attempt is made to take a fresh look at\nelectrodynamics of the MS and try resolve the issues associated with this most\nimportant state of all superconductors. It is shown that the concept of Cooper\npairing along with the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition allows one to\nconstruct a semi-classical theoretical model consistently addressing properties\nof the MS and beyond, including non-equilibrium properties of superconductors\ncaused by the total current. As follows from the model, the three \"big zeros\"\nof superconductivity (zero resistance, induction and entropy) have equal weight\nand grow from a single root: quantization of the angular momentum of paired\nelectrons. The model predicts some yet unknown effects. If confirmed, they can\nhelp in studies of microscopic properties of all superconductors.

This indicates that star formation activity in the CNDs is essential\nfor triggering the accretion of mass to AGNs. Although the starburst-driven\nturbulence is a key mechanism for the transfer of angular momentum and the\nresultant mass accretion from the CND scale to the inner radius, the\nobservational evidence is lacking. We report the\nvery-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) detection of the diffuse synchrotron\nemission on a scale of several tens-pc coinciding spatially with the molecular\ngas disk recently discovered by ALMA observations in NGC~1275. The synchrotron\nemissions are most likely resulted from the relativistic electrons produced by\nthe supernova explosions. This is an unambiguous evidence of the star formation\nactivity in a CND. The turbulent velocity and the scale height of the CND\npredicted from the supernova-driven turbulence model agree with the\nobservations, although the model-predicted accretion rate disagrees with the\nbolometric luminosity. This might indicate that additional mechanisms to\nenhance the turbulence is required for the inner disk.

When\na cluster needs to be dynamically scaled in or out, data must be efficiently\nrebalanced. Ideally, data rebalancing should have a low data movement cost,\nincur a small overhead on data ingestion and query processing, and be performed\nonline without blocking reads or writes. However, existing parallel data\nmanagement systems often exhibit certain limitations and drawbacks in terms of\nefficient data rebalancing.\n  In this paper, we introduce DynaHash, an efficient data rebalancing approach\nthat combines dynamic bucketing with extendible hashing for shared-nothing\nOLAP-style parallel data management systems. DynaHash dynamically partitions\nthe records into a number of buckets using extendible hashing to achieve good a\nload balance with small rebalancing costs. We further describe an end-to-end\nimplementation of the proposed approach inside an open-source Big Data\nManagement System (BDMS), Apache AsterixDB. Our implementation exploits the\nout-of-place update design of LSM-trees to efficiently rebalance data without\nblocking concurrent reads and writes.

The nodes in the CS-BRM are sampled in belief space\nand represent distributions of the system states. A covariance steering\ncontroller steers the system from one BRM node to another, thus acting as an\nedge controller of the corresponding belief graph that ensures belief\nconstraint satisfaction. After the edge controller is computed, a specific edge\ncost is assigned to that edge. The CS-BRM algorithm allows the sampling of\nnon-stationary belief nodes, and thus is able to explore the velocity space and\nfind efficient motion plans.

Robustness and imperceptibility are two\nchallenging features of watermarking methods that the trade-off between them\nshould be satisfied.

The main reason is that NMT pays excessive\nattention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to\nsome extent, namely overconfidence of the LM. Accordingly, we define the Margin\nbetween the NMT and the LM, calculated by subtracting the predicted probability\nof the LM from that of the NMT model for each token.

However, most existing TAL benchmarks are built upon the\ncoarse granularity of action classes, which exhibits two major limitations in\nthis task. First, coarse-level actions can make the localization models overfit\nin high-level context information, and ignore the atomic action details in the\nvideo. Second, the coarse action classes often lead to the ambiguous\nannotations of temporal boundaries, which are inappropriate for temporal action\nlocalization. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel large-scale and\nfine-grained video dataset, coined as FineAction, for temporal action\nlocalization. In total, FineAction contains 103K temporal instances of 106\naction categories, annotated in 17K untrimmed videos. Compared to the existing\nTAL datasets, our FineAction takes distinct characteristics of fine action\nclasses with rich diversity, dense annotations of multiple instances, and\nco-occurring actions of different classes, which introduces new opportunities\nand challenges for temporal action localization. To benchmark FineAction, we\nsystematically investigate the performance of several popular temporal\nlocalization methods on it, and deeply analyze the influence of fine-grained\ninstances in temporal action localization. As a minor contribution, we present\na simple baseline approach for handling the fine-grained action detection,\nwhich achieves an mAP of 13.17% on our FineAction. We believe that FineAction\ncan advance research of temporal action localization and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 06:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 02:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 10:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

The\ndifficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource\nconstraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based\nrepresentation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have\ndemonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory\ncost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training\nset, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we\npropose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically,\nfor each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are\ndynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated\non-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is\nselected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a\nsingle server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale\ndatasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as\nusing all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a\nfew-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few\ninstances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest\npublic dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88%\nof them have less than 10 instances.

However, for the high doped graphene, which manifests the negative\nphotoinduced terahertz conductivity, there is still no consensus on the\ndominant aspects of the cooling process on a time scale of a few picoseconds.\nHere, the competition between the disorders assisted defect scattering and the\nelectron-phonon coupling process in the cooling process of the graphene\nterahertz dynamics is systematically studied and disentangled.

Indeed, it is\nimportant to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations\nand discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph\nNeural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous\ngraphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics.\nSpecifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to\nlearn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately.\nThen, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the\ninteractions of node representations across different relations. Also, the\nrelation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation\nsemantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process.\nMoreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware\nnode representations into a compact representation with the learned relation\nrepresentations.

Nowadays, substantial achievements have been\nmade by supervised learning techniques, especially after the emergence of deep\nlearning. However, it is extremely expensive and difficult to collect human\nannotation for large-scale video datasets. To address this problem, we propose\na convolutional attentive adversarial network (CAAN), whose key idea is to\nbuild a deep summarizer in an unsupervised way. Upon the generative adversarial\nnetwork, our overall framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The\nformer predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter\ntries to distinguish the score-weighted frame features from original frame\nfeatures. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence\nnetwork to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based\nnetwork to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our\nobjective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the\nframe-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this\nproposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public\nbenchmarks SumMe and TVSum.

Datalog+/-\nis a common family of languages for schema constraints, including\ntuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and equality-generating dependencies\n(EGDs). The interplay of TGDs and EGDs leads to undecidability or\nintractability of query answering when adding EGDs to tractable Datalog+/-\nfragments, like Warded Datalog+/-, for which, in the sole presence of TGDs,\nquery answering is PTIME in data complexity. There have been attempts to limit\nthe interaction of TGDs and EGDs and guarantee tractability, in particular with\nthe introduction of separable EGDs, to make EGDs irrelevant for query answering\nas long as the set of constraints is satisfied. While being tractable,\nseparable EGDs have limited expressive power.\n  We propose a more general class of EGDs, which we call \"harmless\", that\nsubsume separable EGDs and allow to model a much broader class of problems.\nUnlike separable EGDs, harmless EGDs, besides enforcing ground equality\nconstraints, specialize the query answer by grounding or renaming the labelled\nnulls introduced by existential quantification in the TGDs.

To this end, we propose a\nsimple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any\ndecision.

In this paper, we\nintroduce AirNet, a novel training and transmission method that allows\nefficient wireless delivery of DNNs under stringent transmit power and latency\nconstraints. We first train the DNN with noise injection to counter the channel\nnoise. We then employ pruning to reduce the network size to the available\nchannel bandwidth, and perform knowledge distillation from a large model to\nimprove the performance. We show that AirNet achieves significantly higher test\naccuracy compared to digital alternatives under the same bandwidth and power\nconstraints. We further improve the performance of AirNet by pruning the\nnetwork below the available bandwidth, and using channel expansion to provide\nbetter robustness against channel noise. We also benefit from unequal error\nprotection (UEP) by selectively expanding more important layers of the network.\nFinally, we develop an ensemble training approach, which trains a whole\nspectrum of DNNs, each of which can be used at different channel condition,\nresolving the impractical memory requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 09:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 15:44:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 11:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 16:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 12:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Methods:\nThe lung volume was segmented on 46 CT images, and a 3D sliding window kernel\nwas implemented across the lung volume to capture the spatial-encoded image\ninformation. Fifty-three radiomic features were extracted within the kernel,\nresulting in a 4th order tensor object. As such, each voxel coordinate of the\noriginal lung was represented as a 53-dimensional feature vector, such that\nradiomic features could be viewed as feature maps within the lungs. To test the\ntechnique as a potential pulmonary ventilation biomarker, the radiomic feature\nmaps were compared to paired functional images (Galligas PET or DTPA-SPECT)\nbased on Spearman correlation (r) analysis. Results: The radiomic feature map\nGLRLM-based Run-Length Non-Uniformity and GLCOM-based Sum Average are found to\nbe highly correlated with the functional imaging.

Local energy generation, consumption and trading are identified as\ndesirable forms of involvement, especially in energy communities. The\npotentials for energy communities in the residential building stock are high\nbut are largely untapped in multi-family buildings. In many countries, rapidly\nevolving legal frameworks aim at overcoming related barriers, e.g. ownership\nstructures, principal-agent problems and system complexity. But academic\nliterature is scarce regarding the techno-economic and environmental\nimplications of such complex frameworks.

Here we show that\nstrongly valley-dependent scattering also emerges from bilayer graphene quantum\ndots, where the gap size can be easily modulated using the interlayer\npotentials in dual-gated devices. Robust valley-dependent scattering and\nconcomitant valley currents are observed for a range of systems, and we\ninvestigate the role of dot size, mass strength and additional potential terms.\nFinally, we note that a strong valley splitting of electronic current also\nemerges when a biased bilayer dot is embedded in a single layer of graphene,\nbut that the effect is less robust than for a bilayer host.

Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action\nasymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an\nenvironment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in\nthe argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference,\nrelies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of\na system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence\ndoes not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an\neffective decoupling from the system's history of interactions.

The\ntopic of our paper is in-between these limits. System behavior becomes\nnon-trivial and manifests a sort of transitions between regular and chaotic\ndynamics. We show that such dynamic transitions occur when the Loschmidt echo\ntime of life exceeds the typical recurrence cycle period. We illustrate this\nbehavior in the frame work of a few versions of the exactly solvable quantum\nproblem, proposed long ago by Zwanzig. It is based on the study of time\nevolution of the initially prepared vibrational state coupled to a reservoir\nwith dense spectrum of its vibrational states. In the simplest version of the\nZwanzig model, the reservoir has an equidistant spectrum, and the system -\nreservoir coupling matrix elements are independent of the reservoir states. We\ngeneralize the model to include into consideration the coupling of the\ninitially prepared single state to system phonon excitations. The coupling\nresults to temperature dependent broadening and decay of the echo components.\nAnother generalization is to replace a single level by two states coupled to\nthe Zwanzig reservoir.

For accurate but approximate simulations one\nneeds a way to keep track of essential (quantum) information while discarding\ninessential one. To this end, we first introduce the concept of the information\nlattice, which supplements the physical spatial lattice with an additional\ndimension and where a local Hamiltonian gives rise to well defined locally\nconserved von Neumann information current. This provides a convenient and\ninsightful way of capturing the flow, through time and space, of information\nduring quantum time evolution, and gives a distinct signature of when local\ndegrees of freedom decouple from long-range entanglement. As an example, we\ndescribe such decoupling of local degrees of freedom for the mixed field\ntransverse Ising model. Building on this, we secondly construct algorithms to\ntime-evolve sets of local density matrices without any reference to a global\nstate. With the notion of information currents, we can motivate algorithms\nbased on the intuition that information for statistical reasons flow from small\nto large scales. Using this guiding principle, we construct an algorithm that,\nat worst, shows two-digit convergence in time-evolutions up to very late times\nfor diffusion process governed by the mixed field transverse Ising Hamiltonian.\nWhile we focus on dynamics in 1D with nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians, the\nalgorithms do not essentially rely on these assumptions and can in principle be\ngeneralized to higher dimensions and more complicated Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 11:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 10:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 13:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

We propose to map and count oil palms by\nestimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for\nfine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To\nthat end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm\ndensity at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to\ngenerate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of\noil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that\ncovers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.\nSpecifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves\ncounting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we\npropose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most\nrelevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the\nepistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it\npossible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.\nMoreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily\nparallelisable to cover large areas.

However, the non-standard\nphysical behaviour of perovskite solar cells (PSC), which are heavily\ninfluenced by the motion of mobile ion vacancies, has hindered efforts to\nobtain a consistent theory to interpret PSC impedance data. This work rectifies\nthis omission by deriving a simple analytic model of the impedance response of\na PSC from the underlying drift-diffusion model of charge carrier dynamics and\nion vacancy motion. Extremely good agreement is shown between the analytic\nmodel and the much more complex drift-diffusion model in regimes (including\nmaximum power point) where the applied voltage is close to the open circuit\nvoltage $V_{oc}$. Both models show good qualitative agreement to experimental\nIS data in the literature and predict many of the observed anomalous features\nfound in impedance measurements on PSCs, such as `the giant low frequency\ncapacitance` and `inductive arcs' in the Nyquist plots. Where the physical\nproperties of the PSC are already known the analytic model can be used to\npredict the recombination current $j_{rec}$ and the high and low frequency\nresistances and capacitances of the cell, $R_{HF}$, $C_{HF}$, $R_{LF}$ and\n$C_{LF}$. In scenarios where the physical properties of the cell are unknown\nthe analytic model can also used to extract physical parameters from\nexperimental PSC impedance data. {A novel physical parameter of particular\nsignificance to PSC physics is identified.

Given an input set R of n real numbers and a positive integer k, our\ntarget is to generate the k best subsets of R such that the sum of their\nelements is minimized. Our solution methodology is based on constructing a\nmetadata structure G for a given n. Each node of G stores a bit vector of size\nn from which a subset of R can be retrieved. Here it is shown that the\nconstruction of the whole graph G is not needed. To answer a query, only\nimplicit traversal of the required portion of G on demand is sufficient, which\nobviously gets rid of the preprocessing step, thereby reducing the overall time\nand space requirement. A modified algorithm is then proposed to generate each\nsubset incrementally, where it is shown that it is possible to do away with the\nexplicit storage of the bit vector. This not only improves the space\nrequirement but also improves the asymptotic time complexity.

Since accuracy is guaranteed, the performance of a\nconformal predictor is measured through the efficiency of the prediction sets.\nTypically, a conformal predictor is built on an underlying machine learning\nalgorithm and hence its predictive power is inherited from this algorithm.\nHowever, since the underlying machine learning algorithm is not trained with\nthe objective of minimizing predictive efficiency it means that the resulting\nconformal predictor may be sub-optimal and not aligned sufficiently to this\nobjective.

By using additional prompts to fine-tune\nPLMs, we can further stimulate the rich knowledge distributed in PLMs to better\nserve downstream tasks. Prompt tuning has achieved promising results on some\nfew-class classification tasks such as sentiment classification and natural\nlanguage inference. However, manually designing lots of language prompts is\ncumbersome and fallible. For those auto-generated prompts, it is also expensive\nand time-consuming to verify their effectiveness in non-few-shot scenarios.\nHence, it is still challenging for prompt tuning to address many-class\nclassification tasks. To this end, we propose prompt tuning with rules (PTR)\nfor many-class text classification and apply logic rules to construct prompts\nwith several sub-prompts. In this way, PTR is able to encode prior knowledge of\neach class into prompt tuning. We conduct experiments on relation\nclassification, a typical and complicated many-class classification task, and\nthe results show that PTR can significantly and consistently outperform\nexisting state-of-the-art baselines. This indicates that PTR is a promising\napproach to take advantage of both human prior knowledge and PLMs for those\ncomplicated classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 13:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 03:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 09:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

As a result, we identified that the most used\nmethods in the analyzed works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer\nworks employ classic computer vision only (101 papers). The most recurrent\nmetric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy (33 papers\nand 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient\n(38 papers). Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed\none (130 papers), followed by H&E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of\nthe datasets used in the papers are publicly available, with the DTU/Herlev\ndataset being the most used one. We conclude that there still is a lack of\nhigh-quality datasets for many types of stains and most of the works are not\nmature enough to be applied in a daily clinical diagnostic routine. We also\nidentified a growing tendency towards adopting deep learning-based approaches\nas the methods of choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 13:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The domination number of $G$ is the\norder of a minimum dominating set of $G$.

Such GNNs are incapable of\nlearning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs\nwith the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then,\nusing the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative\npositions between nodes. However, P-GNNs arbitrarily select anchors, leading to\ncompromising position-awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this\ncompromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric\nanchors is essential. On the other hand, we show that choosing anchors that can\naggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-hard. Therefore,\ndevising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is\npractically not feasible. To ensure position-awareness and bypass\nNP-completeness, we propose Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks (PSGNNs),\nlearning how to choose anchors in a back-propagatable fashion. Experiments\nverify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially\nimproving performance on various synthetic and real-world graph datasets while\nenjoying stable scalability.

In this paper,\nwe propose a Dividing and Downsampling mixed Registration network (DDR-Net), a\ngeneral architecture that preserves most of the image information at multiple\nscales. DDR-Net leverages the global context via downsampling the input and\nutilizes the local details from divided chunks of the input images.

Since data distribution shift is very\ncommon in security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection,\nlocal robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at\nthe time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to\nenforce global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is\nstrictly stronger than local robustness.\n  In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that\nsatisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global\nrobustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel\nbooster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We\nstructure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new\nverifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster\nincreases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global\nrobustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.\n  We show that we can train classifiers to satisfy different global robustness\nproperties for three security datasets, and even multiple properties at the\nsame time, with modest impact on the classifier's performance. For example, we\ntrain a Twitter spam account classifier to satisfy five global robustness\nproperties, with 5.4% decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in\nfalse positive rate, compared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy\nany property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 15:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 05:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 20:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Although straightforward factors stay\nduration, extracted from unimodal sources like GPS, at these locations look\nerratic, a thorough analysis of public bus GPS trails for 720km of bus travels\nat the city of Durgapur, a semi-urban city in India, reveals that several other\nfine-grained contextual features can characterize these locations accurately.\nAccordingly, we develop BuStop, a system for extracting and characterizing the\nstay locations from multi-modal sensing using commuters' smartphones. Using\nthis multi-modal information BuStop extracts a set of granular contextual\nfeatures that allow the system to differentiate among the different\nstay-location types. A thorough analysis of BuStop using the collected dataset\nindicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different\nstay locations like regular bus stops, random ad-hoc stops, stops due to\ntraffic congestion stops at traffic signals, and stops at sharp turns.\nAdditionally, we also develop a proof-of-concept setup on top of BuStop to\nanalyze the potential of the framework in predicting expected arrival time, a\ncritical piece of information required to pre-plan travel, at any given bus\nstop.

It is shown\nthat the g-r bulk noise can also be described by the random succession of\nelementary g-r pulses. This enables g-r bulk noise to be interpreted in terms\nof the numbers of traps. The transition from g-r bulk noise to discrete\nswitching in small-area semiconductors is found by reducing the number of traps\nto just one single active trap. The resulting g-r noise spectrum is shown to be\nequivalent to Machlups noise spectrum. The probability of an overlap of\nsucceeding g-r pulses is calculated. Such an overlap is attributed to the\noccupation of an empty single trap by an electron transferred from a\nneighboring trap. Simulating a g-r pulse train we find a large variety of\npatterns similar to those observed in MOSFETs. Excluding overlapping g-r\npulses, the up and down distribution of succeeding g-r pulses is estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 14:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}
