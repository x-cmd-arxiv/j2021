Recently, the advent of\ncontextualized word embeddings has led to success on tasks involving lexical\nambiguity, such as Word Sense Disambiguation. However, there are few tasks that\ndirectly evaluate how well these contextualized embeddings accommodate the more\ncontinuous, dynamic nature of word meaning--particularly in a way that matches\nhuman intuitions. We introduce RAW-C, a dataset of graded, human relatedness\njudgments for 112 ambiguous words in context (with 672 sentence pairs total),\nas well as human estimates of sense dominance. The average inter-annotator\nagreement (assessed using a leave-one-annotator-out method) was 0.79. We then\nshow that a measure of cosine distance, computed using contextualized\nembeddings from BERT and ELMo, correlates with human judgments, but that cosine\ndistance also systematically underestimates how similar humans find uses of the\nsame sense of a word to be, and systematically overestimates how similar humans\nfind uses of different-sense homonyms.

We investigate how the inward drift and evaporation of\nvolatile rich pebbles influences the atmospheric C/O ratio and heavy element\ncontent of giant planets growing by pebble and gas accretion. To achieve this\ngoal, we perform semi analytical 1D models of protoplanetary disks including\nthe treatment of viscous evolution and heating, pebble drift and simple\nchemistry to simulate the growth of planets from planetary embryos to Jupiter\nmass objects by accretion of pebbles and gas while they migrate through the\ndisk. Our simulations show that the composition of the planetary gas atmosphere\nis dominated by the accretion of vapour, originating from inward drifting\nevaporating pebbles. This process allows the giant planets to harbour large\nheavy element contents. In addition, our model reveals that giant planets\noriginating further away from the central star have a higher C/O ratio on\naverage due to the evaporation of methane rich pebbles in the outer disk. These\nplanets can then also harbour super-solar C/O ratios, in line with exoplanet\nobservations. However, planets formed in the outer disk harbour a smaller heavy\nelement content, due to a smaller vapour enrichment of the outer disk. Our\nmodel predicts that giant planets with low/large atmospheric C/O should harbour\na large/low total heavy element content. We further conclude that the inclusion\nof pebble evaporation at evaporation lines is a key ingredient to determine the\nheavy element content and composition of giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 16:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 14:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 08:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

This opens to the possibility for an adaptive\nmethodology to switch among different object detection networks according to\nrun-time requirements (e.g. maximum quality subject to a time-to-solution\nconstraint).\n  Moreover, we demonstrated by developing an ad hoc oracle, that an additional\nproactive methodology could provide even greater benefits, allowing us to\nselect the best network among the available ones given some characteristics of\nthe processed image. To exploit this method, we need to identify some image\nfeatures that can be used to steer the decision on the most promising network.\nDespite the optimization opportunity that has been identified, we were not able\nto identify a predictor function that validates this attempt neither adopting\nclassical image features nor by using a DNN classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 16:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The solar irradiance is commonly measured\nby Earth observation satellites before the start of the solar eclipse and is\nnot corrected for this reduction, which results in a decrease of the computed\nTOA reflectances. Consequently, air quality products that are derived from TOA\nreflectance spectra, such as the ultraviolet (UV) Absorbing Aerosol Index\n(AAI), are distorted or undefined in the shadow of the Moon. The availability\nof air quality satellite data in the penumbral and antumbral shadow during\nsolar eclipses, however, is of particular interest to users studying the\natmospheric response to solar eclipses. Given the time and location of a point\non the Earth's surface, we explain how to compute the obscuration during a\nsolar eclipse taking into account wavelength-dependent solar limb darkening.\nWith the calculated obscuration fractions, we restore the TOA reflectances and\nthe AAI in the penumbral shadow during the annular solar eclipses on 26\nDecember 2019 and 21 June 2020 measured by the TROPOMI/S5P instrument. In the\ncorrected products, the signature of the Moon shadow disappeared, but only if\nwavelength-dependent solar limb darkening is taken into account. We conclude\nthat the correction method of this paper can be used to detect real AAI rising\nphenomena during a solar eclipse and has the potential to restore any other\nproduct that is derived from TOA reflectance spectra. This would resolve the\nsolar eclipse anomalies in satellite air quality measurements and would allow\nfor studying the effect of the eclipse obscuration on the composition of the\nEarth's atmosphere from space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 17:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

Here we report spectropolarimetry of two fast declining\nType II (Type IIL) SNe: SN 2013ej and SN 2017ahn. SN 2013ej exhibited high\ncontinuum polarization from very soon after the explosion to the radioactive\ntail phase with time-variable polarization angles. The origin of this\npolarimetric behavior can be interpreted as the combination of two different\naspherical structures, namely an aspherical interaction of the SN ejecta with\ncircumstellar matter (CSM) and an inherently aspherical explosion. Aspherical\nexplosions are a common feature of slowly declining Type II (Type IIP) SNe. By\ncontrast, SN 2017ahn showed low polarization not only in the photospheric phase\nbut also in the radioactive tail phase. This low polarization in the tail\nphase, which has never before been observed in other Type IIP/L SNe, suggests\nthat the explosion of SN 2017ahn was nearly spherical. These observations imply\nthat Type IIL SNe have, at least, two different origins: they result from stars\nthat have different explosion properties and/or different mass-loss processes.\nThis fact might indicate that 13ej-like Type IIL SNe originate from a similar\nprogenitor to those of Type IIP SNe accompanied by an aspherical CSM\ninteraction, while 17ahn-like Type IIL SNe come from a more massive progenitor\nwith less hydrogen in its envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 17:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Presently, deep neural networks can be deployed on embedded\ntargets to perform different tasks such as speech recognition,object detection\nor Human Activity Recognition.

The quantization methods, relevant in the context of\nan embedded execution onto a microcontroller, are first outlined. Then, a new\nframework for end-to-end deep neural networks training, quantization and\ndeployment is presented.

With\nGaia, an in-depth study of the Taurus census is possible to confirm membership,\nidentify substructure, and reconstruct its star formation history. We have\ncompiled an expansive census of the greater Taurus region, identifying spatial\nsubgroups and confirming that Taurus is substructured across stellar density.\nThere are two populations of subgroups: clustered groups near the clouds and\nsparse groups spread throughout the region. The sparse groups comprise Taurus's\ndistributed population, which is on average older than the population near the\nclouds, and hosts sub-populations up to 15 Myr old. The ages of the clustered\ngroups increase with distance, suggesting that the current star formation was\ntriggered from behind. Still, the region is kinematically coherent, and its\nvelocity structure reflects an initial turbulent spectrum similar to Larson's\nLaw that has been modified by dynamical relaxation. Overall, Taurus has a\ncomplicated star formation history, with at least two epochs of star formation\nfeaturing both clustered and distributed modes.

Surface brightness profiles and\nradial SED fitting provide insight into stellar population gradients in stellar\ndiscs and haloes. A double exponential SFH model is used in the SED fitting to\nbetter understand the distributions of young vs. old populations throughout\nthese galaxies. Different regions of a galaxy often have undergone very\ndifferent SFHs, either in strength, rate, timing, or some combination of all\nthese factors. An analysis of individual stellar complexes within these\ngalaxies shows a relationship between the ages of stellar clusters and how\nthese clusters are distributed throughout the galaxy.

A key challenge in analyzing such networks is\ndetermining whether an observed number of co-occurrences between two nodes is\nsignificant, and therefore whether an edge exists between them. One approach,\nthe fixed degree sequence model (FDSM), evaluates the significance of an edge's\nweight by comparison to a null model in which the degree sequences of the\noriginal bipartite network are fixed. Although the FDSM is an intuitive null\nmodel, it is computationally expensive because it requires Monte Carlo\nsimulation to estimate each edge's $p$-value, and therefore is impractical for\nlarge projections. In this paper, we explore four potential alternatives to\nFDSM: fixed fill model (FFM), fixed row model (FRM), fixed column model (FCM),\nand stochastic degree sequence model (SDSM). We compare these models to FDSM in\nterms of accuracy, speed, statistical power, similarity, and ability to recover\nknown communities. We find that the computationally-fast SDSM offers a\nstatistically conservative but close approximation of the\ncomputationally-impractical FDSM under a wide range of conditions, and that it\ncorrectly recovers a known community structure even when the signal is weak.\nTherefore, although each backbone model may have particular applications, we\nrecommend SDSM for extracting the backbone of bipartite projections when FDSM\nis impractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 18:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 12:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 15:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 17:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 18:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

As such, liquids are more\nchallenging to understand than either gases or solids generally. In weakly\ninteracting gases, the kinetic effects dominate. By contrast, low temperature\nsolids typically feature far smaller fluctuations about their ground state.\nNotwithstanding their complexity, with the exception of quantum fluids and\nsupercooled liquids, various aspects of common liquid dynamics such as their\ndynamic viscosity are often assumed to be given by rather simple,\nArrhenius-type, activated forms with nearly constant (i.e., temperature\nindependent) energy barriers. In this work, we analyze experimentally measured\nviscosities of numerous liquids far above their equilibrium melting temperature\nto see how well this assumption fares. We find, for the investigated liquids,\nmarked deviations from simple activated dynamics. Even far above their\nequilibrium melting temperatures, as the temperature drops, the viscosity of\nthese liquids increases more strongly than predicted by activated dynamics\ndominated by a single uniform energy barrier. For metallic fluids, the scale of\nthe prefactors of the best Arrhenius fits for the viscosity is typically\nconsistent with that given by the product $nh$ with $n$ the number density and\n$h$ Planck's constant. In various fluids that we examined, $nh$ constitutes a\nlower bound scale on the viscosity. We find that a scaling of the temperature\naxis (complementing that of the viscosity) leads to a partial collapse of the\ntemperature dependent viscosities of different fluids; such a scaling allows\nfor a functional dependence of the viscosity on temperature that includes yet\nis far more general than activated Arrhenius form alone.

However, current UBEM are\nlimited in their abilities to capture the inter-building interdependency due to\ntheir dynamic and non-linear characteristics.

The MPC\noptimization operates over a longer time horizon to compensate for the inherent\nmyopic nature of the real-time dispatching. These longer time horizons are\nbeneficial for the quality of relocation decisions but increase computational\ncomplexity. Consequently, the ride-sharing operators are often forced to use a\nrelatively short time horizon.

The optimization component transforms the machine-learning\nprediction back to the original granularity through a tractable transportation\nmodel.

Several indicators of stellar activity are routinely used to\nidentify activity-related signals in RVs, but not all indicators trace exactly\nthe same activity effects, nor are any of them always effective in all stars.\nWe evaluate the performance of a set of spectroscopic activity indicators for M\ndwarf stars with different masses and activity levels with the aim of finding a\nrelation between the indicators and stellar properties. In a sample of 98 M\ndwarfs observed with CARMENES, we analyse the temporal behaviour of RVs and\nnine spectroscopic activity indicators: cross-correlation function (CCF)\nfull-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), contrast, and bisector inverse slope (BIS),\nchromatic index (CRX), differential line width (dLW), and indices of the\nchromospheric lines H$\\alpha$ and calcium infrared triplet. A total of 56 stars\nof the initial sample show periodic signals related to activity in at least one\nof these ten parameters. RV is the parameter for which most of the targets show\nan activity-related signal. CRX and BIS are effective activity tracers for the\nmost active stars in the sample, especially stars with a relatively high mass,\nwhile for less active stars, chromospheric lines perform best. FWHM and dLW\nshow a similar behaviour in all mass and activity regimes, with the highest\nnumber of activity detections in the low-mass, high-activity regime. Most of\nthe targets for which we cannot identify any activity-related signals are stars\nat the low-mass end of the sample. These low-mass stars also show the lowest RV\nscatter, which indicates that ultracool M dwarfs could be better candidates for\nplanet searches than earlier types, which show larger RV jitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 22:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

This makes them a natural choice for modelling many types of\ntemporal dynamics. Training a Neural SDE (either as a VAE or as a GAN) requires\nbackpropagating through an SDE solve. This may be done by solving a\nbackwards-in-time SDE whose solution is the desired parameter gradients.\nHowever, this has previously suffered from severe speed and accuracy issues,\ndue to high computational cost and numerical truncation errors. Here, we\novercome these issues through several technical innovations. First, we\nintroduce the \\textit{reversible Heun method}. This is a new SDE solver that is\n\\textit{algebraically reversible}: eliminating numerical gradient errors, and\nthe first such solver of which we are aware. Moreover it requires half as many\nfunction evaluations as comparable solvers, giving up to a $1.98\\times$\nspeedup. Second, we introduce the \\textit{Brownian Interval}: a new, fast,\nmemory efficient, and exact way of sampling \\textit{and reconstructing}\nBrownian motion. With this we obtain up to a $10.6\\times$ speed improvement\nover previous techniques, which in contrast are both approximate and relatively\nslow. Third, when specifically training Neural SDEs as GANs (Kidger et al.\n2021), we demonstrate how SDE-GANs may be trained through careful weight\nclipping and choice of activation function. This reduces computational cost\n(giving up to a $1.87\\times$ speedup) and removes the numerical truncation\nerrors associated with gradient penalty. Altogether, we outperform the\nstate-of-the-art by substantial margins, with respect to training speed, and\nwith respect to classification, prediction, and MMD test metrics.

We propose an over-the-air controller scheme where all sensors\nattached to the plant simultaneously transmit scaled sensing signals directly\nto the actuator; then the feedback control signal is computed partially over\nthe air and partially by a scaling operation at the actuator. Such over-the-air\ncontroller essentially adopts the over-the-air computation concept to compute\nthe control signal for closed-loop wireless control systems. In contrast to the\nstate-of-the-art sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator communication\napproach, the over-the-air controller exploits the superposition properties of\nmultiple-access wireless channels to complete the communication and computation\nof a large number of sensing signals in a single communication resource unit.\nTherefore, the proposed scheme can obtain significant benefits in terms of low\nactuation delay and low wireless resource utilization by a simple network\narchitecture that does not require a dedicated controller. Numerical results\nshow that our proposed over-the-air controller achieves a huge widening of the\nstability region in terms of sampling time and delay, and a significant\nreduction of the computation error of the control signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 23:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

He therefore took the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) phenomenon, which he generalized and called\n`steering', to require nonlocal wavefunction collapse. Because this would\nentail faster-than-light (FTL) information transmission, he doubted that it\nwould be seen experimentally. Here we report a demonstration of EPR steering\nwith entangled photon pairs that puts--in Schr\\\"odinger's interpretation--a\nnon-zero lower bound on the amount of FTL information transmission. We develop\na family of $n$-setting loss-tolerant EPR-steering inequalities allowing for a\nsize-$d$ classical message sent from Alice's laboratory to Bob's. For the case\n$n=3$ and $d=2$ (one bit) we observe a statistically significant violation. Our\nexperiment closes the efficiency and locality loopholes, and we address the\nfreedom-of-choice loophole by using quantum random number generators to\nindependently choose Alice's and Bob's measurement basis settings. To close the\nefficiency and locality loopholes simultaneously, we introduce methods for\nquickly switching between three mutually unbiased measurement bases and for\naccurately characterizing the efficiency of detectors. From the space-time\narrangement of our experiment, we can conclude that if the mechanism for the\nobserved bipartite correlations is that Alice's measurement induces\nwave-function collapse of Bob's particle, then more than one bit of information\nmust travel from Alice to Bob at more than three times the speed of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 00:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 18:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

However, these clustering approaches have been primarily designed and\nused to extract major dataset components, and are consequently likely to\nstruggle with identifying very rare features and behaviors which may\nnonetheless contain physically meaningful information. In this work, we thus\nintroduce a completely new analysis framework specifically designed for rare\nevent detection in single-molecule break junction data to help unlock such\ninformation and provide a new perspective with different implicit assumptions\nthan clustering. Our approach leverages the concept of correlations of breaking\ntraces with their own history to robustly identify paths through\ndistance-conductance space that correspond to reproducible rare behaviors.

In this paper, by introducing\nappropriate assumptions, we propose more concise coarse basis functions for\ngeneral Hermitian positive and definite discrete systems, and establish the\nalgorithmic and theoretical frameworks of the corresponding TL-OS methods.\nFurthermore, to enhance the practicability of the algorithm, we design two\neconomical TL-OS preconditioners and prove the condition number estimate. As\nthe first application of the frameworks, we prove that the assumptions hold for\nthe linear finite element discretization of second order elliptic problem with\nhigh contrast and oscillatory coefficient and the condition number of the TL-OS\npreconditioned system is robust with respect to the model and mesh parameters.\nIn particular, we also prove that the condition number of the economically\npreconditioned system is independent of the jump range under a certain jump\ndistribution.

The measurements are shown to be internally\nconsistent across redshift bins, angular scales and correlation functions. The\nanalysis is demonstrated to be robust to calibration systematics, with the\n$S_8$ posterior consistent when varying the choice of redshift calibration\nsample, the modeling of redshift uncertainty and methodology. Similarly, we\nfind that the corrections included to account for the blending of galaxies\nshifts our best-fit $S_8$ by $0.5\\sigma$ without incurring a substantial\nincrease in uncertainty. We examine the limiting factors for the precision of\nthe cosmological constraints and find observational systematics to be\nsubdominant to the modeling of astrophysics. Specifically, we identify the\nuncertainties in modeling baryonic effects and intrinsic alignments as the\nlimiting systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 01:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 18:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

We perform an analysis combining\nthree two-point correlation functions (3$\\times$2pt): (i) cosmic shear using\n100 million source galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the\ncross-correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions. The\nanalysis was designed to mitigate confirmation or observer bias; we describe\nspecific changes made to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the\nresults. We model the data within the flat $\\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmological\nmodels.

Grounded in 1467 data points from a large-scale practitioner survey,\nwe study the question: What are hybrid methods made of and how can they be\nsystematically constructed? Our findings show that only eight methods and few\npractices build the core of modern software development. Using an 85% agreement\nlevel in the participants' selections, we provide examples illustrating how\nhybrid methods can be characterized by the practices they are made of.\nFurthermore, using this characterization, we develop an initial construction\nprocedure, which allows for defining a method frame and enriching it\nincrementally to devise a hybrid method using ranked sets of practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 03:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

It exploits particle-based methods to characterize\nthe physical quantities of each sea ice floe along its trajectory under\nLagrangian coordinates. One major challenge in applying the DEM models is the\nheavy computational cost when the number of floes becomes large. In this paper,\nan efficient Lagrangian parameterization algorithm is developed, which aims at\nreducing the computational cost of simulating the DEM models while preserving\nthe key features of the sea ice. The new parameterization takes advantage of a\nsmall number of artificial ice floes, named the superfloes, to effectively\napproximate a considerable number of the floes, where the parameterization\nscheme satisfies several important physics constraints. The physics constraints\nguarantee the superfloe parameterized system will have similar short-term\ndynamical behavior as the full system. These constraints also allow the\nsuperfloe parameterized system to accurately quantify the long-range\nuncertainty, especially the non-Gaussian statistical features, of the full\nsystem. In addition, the superfloe parameterization facilitates a systematic\nnoise inflation strategy that significantly advances an ensemble-based data\nassimilation algorithm for recovering the unobserved ocean field underneath the\nsea ice. Such a new noise inflation method avoids ad hoc tunings as in many\ntraditional algorithms and is computationally extremely efficient.

To understand\ntheir regulatory roles in various ecosystems and to harness the potential of\nbacteriophages for use in therapy, more knowledge of viral-host relationships\nis required. High-throughput sequencing and its application to the microbiome\nhave offered new opportunities for computational approaches for predicting\nwhich hosts particular viruses can infect. However, there are two main\nchallenges for computational host prediction. First, the empirically known\nvirus-host relationships are very limited. Second, although sequence similarity\nbetween viruses and their prokaryote hosts have been used as a major feature\nfor host prediction, the alignment is either missing or ambiguous in many\ncases. Thus, there is still a need to improve the accuracy of host prediction.\nResults: In this work, we present a semi-supervised learning model, named\nHostG, to conduct host prediction for novel viruses. We construct a knowledge\ngraph by utilizing both virus-virus protein similarity and virus-host DNA\nsequence similarity. Then graph convolutional network (GCN) is adopted to\nexploit viruses with or without known hosts in training to enhance the learning\nability. During the GCN training, we minimize the expected calibrated error\n(ECE) to ensure the confidence of the predictions.

Previous meta-models assume that\nglitches are triggered by an avalanche process, e.g. involving superfluid\nvortices, and that the probability density function (PDF) of the avalanche\nsizes is history-independent and specified exogenously. Here a recipe is\nproposed to generate the avalanche sizes endogenously in a history-dependent\nmanner, by tracking the thresholds of occupied vortex pinning sites as a\nfunction of time. Vortices unpin spasmodically from sites with thresholds below\na global, time-dependent stress and repin at sites with thresholds above the\nglobal stress, imbuing the system with long-term memory. The meta-model\npredicts PDFs, auto- and cross-correlations for glitch sizes and waiting times,\nwhich are provisionally inconsistent with current observations, unlike some\nprevious meta-models (e.g. state dependent Poisson process), whose predictions\nare consistent. The theoretical implications are intriguing, albeit uncertain,\nbecause history-dependent avalanches embody faithfully the popular, idealized\nunderstanding in the literature of how vortex unpinning operates as a driven,\nstochastic process. The meta-model predicts aftershocks, which occur with\nlarger than average sizes and longer than average waiting times after the\nlargest, system-resetting glitches.

Most previous works model the road segments\nor intersections separately by learning their spatio-temporal characteristics\nto estimate travel time. However, due to the continuous alternations of the\nroad segments and intersections in a path, the dynamic features are supposed to\nbe coupled and interactive. Therefore, modeling one of them limits further\nimprovement in accuracy of estimating travel time. To address the above\nproblems, a novel graph-based deep learning framework for travel time\nestimation is proposed in this paper, namely Spatio-Temporal Dual Graph Neural\nNetworks (STDGNN). Specifically, we first establish the node-wise and edge-wise\ngraphs to respectively characterize the adjacency relations of intersections\nand that of road segments. In order to extract the joint spatio-temporal\ncorrelations of the intersections and road segments, we adopt the\nspatio-temporal dual graph learning approach that incorporates multiple\nspatial-temporal dual graph learning modules with multi-scale network\narchitectures for capturing multi-level spatial-temporal information from the\ndual graph. Finally, we employ the multi-task learning approach to estimate the\ntravel time of a given whole route, each road segment and intersection\nsimultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model\non three real-world trajectory datasets, and the experimental results show that\nSTDGNN significantly outperforms several state-of-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 05:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

In particular, the WD executes the first few\nlayers of the DNN and sends the intermediate features to the edge server that\nprocesses the remaining layers of the DNN. By adapting the model splitting\ndecision, there exists a tradeoff between local computation cost and\ncommunication overhead. In practice, the DNN model is re-trained and updated\nperiodically at the edge server. Once the DNN parameters are regenerated, part\nof the updated model must be placed at the WD to facilitate on-device\ninference. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of the model\nplacement and online model splitting decisions to minimize the energy-and-time\ncost of device-edge co-inference in presence of wireless channel fading. The\nproblem is challenging because the model placement and model splitting\ndecisions are strongly coupled, while involving two different time scales.

Considering the fact that hospitals generally\nrecord ECG signals in the form of graphic waves of 2-D images, we first extract\nthe graphic waves of 12-lead images into numerical 1-D ECG signals by a\nproposed bi-directional connectivity method. Subsequently, a novel deep neural\nnetwork, namely CRT-Net, is designed for the fine-grained and comprehensive\nrepresentation and recognition of 1-D ECG signals. The CRT-Net can well explore\nwaveform features, morphological characteristics and time domain features of\nECG by embedding convolution neural network(CNN), recurrent neural\nnetwork(RNN), and transformer module in a scalable deep model, which is\nespecially suitable in clinical scenarios with different lengths of ECG signals\ncaptured from different devices.

Most of the research on this domain is focused\non producing a predictor able to forecast the value of the next function having\nobserved a part of the sequence. For this, the Autoregresive Hilbertian process\nis a suitable framework. We address here the problem of constructing\nsimultaneous predictive confidence bands for a stationary functional time\nseries. The method is based on an entropy measure for stochastic processes, in\nparticular functional time series. To construct predictive bands we use a\nfunctional bootstrap procedure that allow us to estimate the prediction law\nthrough the use of pseudo-predictions. Each pseudo-realisation is then\nprojected into a space of finite dimension, associated to a functional basis.\nWe use Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) to represent the functions,\nconsidering then the basis associated to the reproducing kernel.

Electron-cyclotron maser emission (ECME) is the favored mechanism\nfor solar radio spikes and has been investigated extensively since the 1980s.\nMost studies relevant to solar spikes employ a loss-cone-type distribution of\nenergetic electrons, generating waves mainly in the fundamental X/O mode\n(X1/O1), with a ratio of plasma oscillation frequency to electron gyrofrequency\n(${\\omega}_ {pe}/{\\Omega}_{ce}$) lower than 1. Despite the great progress made\nin this theory, one major problem is how the fundamental emissions pass through\nthe second-harmonic absorption layer in the corona and escape. This is\ngenerally known as the escaping difficulty of the theory. Aims. We study the\nharmonic emissions generated by ECME driven by energetic electrons with the\nhorseshoe distribution to solve the escaping difficulty of ECME for solar\nspikes. Methods. We performed a fully kinetic electromagnetic PIC simulation\nwith ${\\omega}_ {pe}/{\\Omega}_{ce}$ = 0.1, corresponding to the strongly\nmagnetized plasma conditions in the flare region, with energetic electrons\ncharacterized by the horseshoe distribution. We also varied the density ratio\nof energetic electrons to total electrons ($n_e/n_0$) in the simulation.\nResults. We obtain efficient amplification of waves in Z and X2 modes, with a\nrelatively weak growth of O1 and X3. With a higher-density ratio, the X2\nemission becomes more intense, and the rate of energy conversion from energetic\nelectrons into X2 modes can reach $\\sim$0.06% and 0.17%, with $n_e/n_0$= 5% and\n10%, respectively. Conclusions. We find that the horseshoe-driven ECME can lead\nto an efficient excitation of X2 and X3 with a low value of ${\\omega}_\n{pe}/{\\Omega}_{ce}$, providing novel means for resolving the escaping\ndifficulty of ECME when applied to solar radio spikes. The simultaneous growth\nof X2 and X3 can be used to explain some harmonic structures observed in solar\nspikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

To address\nthis problem, we propose to solve density ratio matrix estimation (DRME), a\nnovel type of density ratio estimation that consists of estimating matrices of\nmultiple density ratios with constraints and thus is more challenging than the\nconventional density ratio estimation.

The\nother two are excluded in this work due to the possible unphysical deviations.\nWe consider the inspiral range with the cutoff frequency at the innermost\nstable circular orbit and add a modification of dipole radiation into the\nwaveform template. The scalar charges of neutron stars in the dipole term are\nderived by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for different\nequations-of-states. The constraints are obtained by performing the full\nBayesian inference with the help of the open source software \\texttt{Bilby}.\nThe results show that the constraints given by GWs are comparable with those\ngiven by pulsar timing experiments for DEF theory, but are not competitive with\nthe current solar system constraints for BD and SMG theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Proper selection of cuts would remove\ninfeasible solutions in the early stage, thus largely reducing the\ncomputational burden without hurting the solution accuracy. However, the major\ncut selection approaches heavily rely on heuristics, which strongly depend on\nthe specific problem at hand and thus limit their generalization capability. In\nthis paper, we propose a data-driven and generalizable cut selection approach,\nnamed Cut Ranking, in the settings of multiple instance learning. To measure\nthe quality of the candidate cuts, a scoring function, which takes the\ninstance-specific cut features as inputs, is trained and applied in cut ranking\nand selection. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Compared with\ncommonly used heuristics for cut selection, the learning-based policy has shown\nto be more effective, and is capable of generalizing over multiple problems\nwith different properties. Cut Ranking has been deployed in an industrial\nsolver for large-scale MIPs. In the online A/B testing of the product planning\nproblems with more than $10^7$ variables and constraints daily, Cut Ranking has\nachieved the average speedup ratio of 12.42% over the production solver without\nany accuracy loss of solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 02:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 08:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 06:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

First, we reformulate NMF as\nminimizing a concave function over a product of convex cones--one approach is\nbased on the exponential cone, and the other on the second-order cone. Then, we\nsolve these reformulations iteratively: at each step, we minimize exactly, over\nthe feasible set, a majorization of the objective functions obtained via\nlinearization at the current iterate. Hence these subproblems are convex conic\nprograms and can be solved efficiently using dedicated algorithms.

A giant impact between\nproto-Uranus and a 2-3 M_Earth impactor could lead to a large tilt and to the\nformation of an impact generated disc, where prograde and circular satellites\nare accreted. The most intriguing features of the current regular Uranian\nsatellite system is that it possesses a positive trend in the mass-distance\ndistribution and likely also in the bulk density, implying that viscous\nspreading of the disc after the giant impact plays a crucial role in shaping\nthe architecture of the final system. In this paper, we investigate the\nformation of Uranus' satellites by combining results of SPH simulations for the\ngiant impact, a 1D semi-analytic disc model for viscous spreading of the\npost-impact disc, and N-body simulations for the assembly of satellites from a\ndisc of moonlets. Assuming the condensed rock (i.e., silicate) remains small\nand available to stick onto the relatively rapid growing condensed water-ice,\nwe find that the best case in reproducing the observed mass and bulk\ncomposition of Uranus' satellite system is a pure-rocky impactor with 3 M_Earth\ncolliding with the young Uranus with an impact parameter b = 0.75. Such an\noblique collision could also naturally explain Uranus' large tilt and possibly,\nits low internal heat flux. The giant impact scenario can naturally explain the\nkey features of Uranus and its regular moons. We therefore suggest that the\nUranian satellite system formed as a result of an impact rather than from a\ncircumplanetary disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 08:19:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

In contrast, the locality of a lane marker has finite geometric\nvariations and spatial coverage. We propose a novel lane marker detection\nsolution, FOLOLane, that focuses on modeling local patterns and achieving\nprediction of global structures in a bottom-up manner. Specifically, the CNN\nmodels lowcomplexity local patterns with two separate heads, the first one\npredicts the existence of key points, and the second refines the location of\nkey points in the local range and correlates key points of the same lane line.\nThe locality of the task is consistent with the limited FOV of the feature in\nCNN, which in turn leads to more stable training and better generalization.

While different algorithms have been\ngiven for reachability in different variants of this model, most of these\nresults are purely theoretical and do not give rise to efficient\nimplementations. One main reason for this is that none of these algorithms (and\nthe implementations that exist) use the so-called zone-based abstraction, but\nrely either on the region-abstraction or other approaches, which are\nsignificantly harder to implement.\n  In this paper, we show that a naive extension of the zone based reachability\nalgorithm for the control state reachability problem of timed automata is not\nsound in the presence of a stack.

We study characteristic time\nsignatures of fully developed, dispersive fast magnetoacoustic wave trains in\nfield-aligned zero-$\\beta$ plasma slabs in the linear regime. Fast wave trains\nare excited by a spatially localised impulsive driver and propagate along the\nwaveguide as prescribed by the waveguide-caused dispersion. In slabs with\nsteeper transverse density profiles, developed wave trains are shown to consist\nof three distinct phases: a long-period quasi-periodic phase with the\noscillation period shortening with time, a multi-periodic (peloton) phase in\nwhich distinctly different periods co-exist, and a short-lived periodic Airy\nphase. The appearance of these phases is attributed to a non-monotonic\ndependence of the fast wave group speed on the parallel wavenumber due to the\nwaveguide dispersion, and is shown to be different for axisymmetric (sausage)\nand non-axisymmetric (kink) modes. In wavelet analysis, this corresponds to the\ntransition from the previously known tadpole shape to a new boomerang shape of\nthe wave train spectrum, with two well-pronounced arms at shorter and longer\nperiods. We describe a specific previously published radio observation of a\ncoronal fast wave train, highly suggestive of a change of the wavelet spectrum\nfrom a tadpole to a boomerang, broadly consistent with our modelling. The\napplicability of these boomerang-shaped fast wave trains for probing the\ntransverse structuring of the waveguiding coronal plasma is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 09:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

To date, many DNN IP protection methods have been proposed,\nbut most of them are watermarking based verification methods where model owners\ncan only verify their ownership passively after the copyright of DNN models has\nbeen infringed. In this paper, we propose an effective framework to actively\nprotect the DNN IP from infringement. Specifically, we encrypt the DNN model's\nparameters by perturbing them with well-crafted adversarial perturbations. With\nthe encrypted parameters, the accuracy of the DNN model drops significantly,\nwhich can prevent malicious infringers from using the model. After the\nencryption, the positions of encrypted parameters and the values of the added\nadversarial perturbations form a secret key. Authorized user can use the secret\nkey to decrypt the model. Compared with the watermarking methods which only\npassively verify the ownership after the infringement occurs, the proposed\nmethod can prevent infringement in advance. Moreover, compared with most of the\nexisting active DNN IP protection methods, the proposed method does not require\nadditional training process of the model, which introduces low computational\noverhead. Experimental results show that, after the encryption, the test\naccuracy of the model drops by 80.65%, 81.16%, and 87.91% on Fashion-MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, and GTSRB, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method only needs to\nencrypt an extremely low number of parameters, and the proportion of the\nencrypted parameters of all the model's parameters is as low as 0.000205%. The\nexperimental results also indicate that, the proposed method is robust against\nmodel fine-tuning attack and model pruning attack. Moreover, for the adaptive\nattack where attackers know the detailed steps of the proposed method, the\nproposed method is also demonstrated to be robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 09:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Recent enumerative\napproaches for quantifier instantiation consider tuples of terms in some\nheuristic order. This paper studies different strategies to order such tuples\nand their impact on performance. We decouple the ordering problem into two\nparts. First is the order of the sequence of terms to consider for each\nquantified variable, and second is the order of the instantiation tuples\nthemselves. While the most and least preferred tuples, i.e. those with all\nvariables assigned to the most or least preferred terms, are clear, the\ncombinations in between allow flexibility in an implementation. We look at\nprincipled strategies of complete enumeration, where some strategies are more\nfair, meaning they treat all the variables the same but some strategies may be\nmore adventurous, meaning that they may venture further down the preference\nlist. We further describe new techniques for discarding irrelevant\ninstantiations which are crucial for the performance of these strategies in\npractice. These strategies are implemented in the SMT solver cvc5, where they\ncontribute to the diversification of the solver's configuration space, as shown\nby our experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 09:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

To study\nconvection in a novel context, we derive and solve a quasilinear form of the\nRayleigh-B\\'enard problem by representing the perturbations in terms of\nmarginally-stable eigenmodes. The amplitude of each eigenmode is determined by\nrequiring that the background state maintains marginal stability. The\nbackground temperature profile evolves due to the advective flux of every\nmarginally-stable eigenmode, as well as diffusion. To ensure marginal stability\nand to obtain the eigenfunctions at every timestep, we perform a\none-dimensional eigenvalue solve on each of the allowable wavenumbers. The\nbackground temperature field evolves to an equilibrium state, where the\nadvective flux from the marginally-stable eigenmodes and the diffusive flux sum\nto a constant. These marginally-stable thermal equilibria (MSTE) are exact\nsolutions of the quasilinear equations. The mean temperature profile has\nthinner boundary layers and larger Nusselt numbers than thermally-equilibrated\n2D and 3D simulations of the full nonlinear equations. We find the Nusselt\nnumber scales like $\\rm{Nu} \\sim\\rm{Ra}^{1/3}$. When an MSTE is used as initial\nconditions for a 2D simulation, we find that Nu quickly equilibrates without\nthe burst of turbulence often induced by purely conductive initial conditions,\nbut we also find that the kinetic energy is too large and viscously attenuates\non a long viscous time scale. This is due to the thin temperature boundary\nlayers which diffuse heat very effectively, thereby requiring high-velocity\nadvective flows to reach an equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 09:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

The Bayesian\nmean is an important decoder, as it is optimal for purposes of both estimation\nand discrimination. We present widely-applicable approximations to the bias and\nto the variance of the Bayesian mean, obtained under the minimal and\nbiologically-relevant assumption that the encoding results from a series of\nindependent, though not necessarily identically-distributed, signals.\nSimulations substantiate the accuracy of our approximations in the small-noise\nregime. The bias of the Bayesian mean comprises two components: one driven by\nthe prior, and one driven by the precision of the encoding. If the encoding is\n'efficient', the two components have opposite effects; their relative strengths\nare determined by the objective that the encoding optimizes. The experimental\nliterature on perception reports both 'Bayesian' biases directed towards prior\nexpectations, and opposite, 'anti-Bayesian' biases. We show that different\ntasks are indeed predicted to yield such contradictory biases, under a\nconsistently-optimal encoding-decoding model.

The appearance of markers and the detection robustness are\ngenerally limited by the existing detection algorithms, which are hand-crafted\nwith traditional low-level image processing techniques. Furthermore, a\nsophisticatedly designed coding system is required to overcome the shortcomings\nof both markers and detection algorithms. To improve the flexibility and\nrobustness in various applications, we propose a general deep learning based\nframework, DeepTag, for fiducial marker design and detection. DeepTag not only\nsupports detection of a wide variety of existing marker families, but also\nmakes it possible to design new marker families with customized local patterns.\nMoreover, we propose an effective procedure to synthesize training data on the\nfly without manual annotations. Thus, DeepTag can easily adapt to existing and\nnewly-designed marker families. To validate DeepTag and existing methods,\nbeside existing datasets, we further collect a new large and challenging\ndataset where markers are placed in different view distances and angles.\nExperiments show that DeepTag well supports different marker families and\ngreatly outperforms the existing methods in terms of both detection robustness\nand pose accuracy.

Fundamentally,\nsampling rate offset (SRO) nonlinearly relates the discrete-time signals\nacquired by different sensor nodes. As such, retrieval of SRO from the\navailable signals requires nonlinear estimation, like double-cross-correlation\nprocessing (DXCP), and frequently results in biased estimation. SRO\ncompensation by asynchronous sampling rate conversion (ASRC) on the signals\nthen leaves an unacceptable residual. As a remedy to this problem, multi-stage\nprocedures have been devised to diminish the SRO residual with multiple\niterations of SRO estimation and ASRC over the entire signal. This paper\nconverts the mechanism of offline multi-stage processing into a continuous\nfeedback-control loop comprising a controlled ASRC unit followed by an online\nimplementation of DXCP-based SRO estimation. To support the design of an\noptimum internal model control unit for this closed-loop system, the paper\ndeploys an analytical dynamical model of the proposed online DXCP. The\nresulting control architecture then merely applies a single treatment of each\nsignal frame, while efficiently diminishing SRO bias with time.

We use backfitting within an iteratively\nreweighted penalized least square algorithm. The specific approach is a version\nof penalized quasi-likelihood due to Schall (1991). A straightforward version\nof Schall's algorithm would also cost more than $N^{3/2}$ because it requires\nthe trace of the inverse of a large matrix. We approximate that quantity at\ncost $O(N)$ and prove that this substitution makes an asymptotically negligible\ndifference. Our backfitting algorithm also collapses the fixed effect with one\nrandom effect at a time in a way that is analogous to the collapsed Gibbs\nsampler of Papaspiliopoulos et al. (2020).

This hinders the extraction of useful\nvisual features and results in deteriorated image captioning performance. To\naddress practical issues, this study introduces a new encoder for captioning\nheavy rain images. The central idea is to transform output features extracted\nfrom heavy rain input images into semantic visual features associated with\nwords and sentence context. To achieve this, a target encoder is initially\ntrained in an encoder-decoder framework to associate visual features with\nsemantic words. Subsequently, the objects in a heavy rain image are rendered\nvisible by using an initial reconstruction subnetwork (IRS) based on a heavy\nrain model. The IRS is then combined with another semantic visual feature\nmatching subnetwork (SVFMS) to match the output features of the IRS with the\nsemantic visual features of the pretrained target encoder. The proposed encoder\nis based on the joint learning of the IRS and SVFMS. It is is trained in an\nend-to-end manner, and then connected to the pretrained decoder for image\ncaptioning. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed encoder can\ngenerate semantic visual features associated with words even from heavy rain\nimages, thereby increasing the accuracy of the generated captions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 11:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 03:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 15:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

In this work we propose to solve this by leveraging human expert\nopinion to provide ground truth.

There\nhas been an intense debate on the mechanistic origin of the LQ model. An\ninteresting approach is that of obtaining LQ-like behavior from kinetic models,\nsystems of differential equations that model the induction and repair of\ndamage. Development of such kinetic models is particularly interesting for\napplication to continuous dose rate therapies, such as molecular radiotherapy\nor brachytherapy. In this work, we present a simple kinetic model that\ndescribes the kinetics of populations of tumor cells, rather than\nlethal/sub-lethal lesions, which may be especially useful for application to\ncontinuous dose rate therapies, as in molecular radiotherapy. The\nmulti-compartment model consists of a set of three differential equations. The\nmodel incorporates in an easy way different cross-interacting compartments of\ncells forming a tumor, and may be of especial interest for studying dynamics of\ntreated tumors.

However, physical access of users and\nlikewise attackers makes them often threatened by fault attacks: a single fault\nduring the computation of a cryptographic primitive can lead to a total loss of\nsystem security. This can have serious consequences, e.g., in safetycritical\nsystems, including bodily harm and catastrophic technical failures. However,\ncountermeasures often focus on isolated fault models and high layers of\nabstraction. This leads to a dangerous sense of security, because exploitable\nfaults that are only visible at machine code level might not be covered by\ncountermeasures. In this work we present ARMORY, a fully automated open source\nframework for exhaustive fault simulation on binaries of the ubiquitous ARM-M\nclass. It allows engineers and analysts to efficiently scan a binary for\npotential weaknesses against arbitrary combinations of multi-variate fault\ninjections under a large variety of fault models. Using ARMORY, we demonstrate\nthe power of fully automated fault analysis and the dangerous implications of\napplying countermeasures without knowledge of physical addresses and offsets.\nWe exemplarily analyze two case studies, which are highly relevant for\npractice: a DFA on AES (cryptographic) and a secure bootloader\n(non-cryptographic). Our results show that indeed numerous exploitable faults\nfound by ARMORY which occur in the actual implementations are easily missed in\nmanual inspection. Crucially, most faults are only visible when taking machine\ncode information, i.e., addresses and offsets, into account. Surprisingly, we\nshow that a countermeasure that protects against one type of fault can actually\nlargely increase the vulnerability to other fault models. Our work demonstrates\nthe need for countermeasures that, at least in their evaluation, are not\nrestricted to isolated fault models and consider low-level information [...].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 12:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

From a series of simulations incorporating such\ndependencies, they conclude that GAMMs are inappropriate for between-subject\ndesigns. They argue that in addition GAMMs come with too many modeling\npossibilities, and advise using the linear mixed model (LMM) instead. We\naddress the questions raised by Thul et al. (2020), who clearly demonstrated\nthat problems can indeed arise when using factor smooths in combination with\nfactorial designs. We show that the problem does not arise when using\nby-smooths. Furthermore, we have traced a bug in the implementation of factor\nsmooths in the mgcv package, which will have been removed from version 1.8-36\nonwards. To illustrate that GAMMs now produce correct estimates, we report\nsimulation studies implementing different by-subject longitudinal effects. The\nmaximal LMM emerges as slightly conservative compared to GAMMs, and GAMMs\nprovide estimated coefficients that can be less variable across simulation\nruns. We also discuss two datasets where time-varying effects interact with\nnumerical predictors in a theoretically informative way. Furthermore, we argue\nthat the wide range of tools that GAMMs make available to researcher across all\ndomains of scientific inquiry do not come with uncontrolled researcher degrees\nof freedom once confronted with a specific psycholinguistic datasets. We also\nintroduce a distinction between replicable and non-replicable non-linear\neffects. We conclude that GAMMs are an excellent and reliable tool for\nunderstanding experimental data, including chronometric data with time-varying\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 12:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

A key question for ranking universities is whether or not\nto allocate the publication output of affiliated hospitals to universities.\nHospital nomenclatures vary worldwide to denote some form of collaboration with\na university: academic hospitals, teaching hospitals, university hospitals, and\nacademic medical centres do not correspond to universally standard definitions.\nThus, rather than seeking a normative definition of academic hospitals, we are\nproposing a workflow that aligns the university-hospital relationship with one\nof three general models: full integration of the hospital and the medical\nfaculty into a single organization; health science centres in which hospitals\nand medical faculty remain separate entities albeit within the same governance\nstructure; and structures in which universities and hospitals are separate\nentities which collaborate with one another. This classification system\nprovides a standard by which we can allocate publications which note\naffiliations with academic hospitals.

We have introduced this\nstrategy before to construct adaptive lattice Boltzmann methods with this\ninteresting feature.Furthermore, these schemes allow for an effective memory\ncompression of the solution when spatially localized phenomena -- such as\nshocks or fronts -- are involved, to rely on the original scheme without any\nmanipulation at the finest level of grid and to reach a high level of accuracy\non the solution.Nevertheless, the peculiar way of modeling the desired physical\nphenomena in the lattice Boltzmann schemes calls, besides the possibility of\ncontrolling the error introduced by the mesh adaptation, for a deeper and more\nprecise understanding of how mesh adaptation alters the physics approximated by\nthe numerical strategy. In this contribution, this issue is studied by\nperforming the equivalent equations analysis of the adaptive method after\nwriting the scheme under an adapted formalism. It provides an essential tool to\nmaster the perturbations introduced by the adaptive numerical strategy, which\ncan thus be devised to preserve the desired features of the reference scheme at\na high order of accuracy.

Yet,\noutsourcing code and data into the cloud requires enterprises to trust cloud\nproviders not to meddle with their data. To reduce the level of trust towards\ncloud providers, AMD has introduced Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). By\nencrypting Virtual Machines (VMs), SEV aims to ensure data confidentiality,\ndespite a compromised or curious Hypervisor. The SEV Encrypted State (SEV-ES)\nextension additionally protects the VM's register state from unauthorized\naccess. Yet, both extensions do not provide integrity of the VM's memory, which\nhas already been abused to leak the protected data or to alter the VM's\ncontrol-flow. In this paper, we introduce the SEVerity attack; a missing puzzle\npiece in the series of attacks against the AMD SEV family. Specifically, we\nabuse the system's lack of memory integrity protection to inject and execute\narbitrary code within SEV-ES-protected VMs. Contrary to previous code execution\nattacks against the AMD SEV family, SEVerity neither relies on a specific CPU\nversion nor on any code gadgets inside the VM. Instead, SEVerity abuses the\nfact that SEV-ES prohibits direct memory access into the encrypted memory.\nSpecifically, SEVerity injects arbitrary code into the encrypted VM through I/O\nchannels and uses the Hypervisor to locate and trigger the execution of the\nencrypted payload. This allows us to sidestep the protection mechanisms of\nSEV-ES. Overall, our results demonstrate a success rate of 100% and hence\nhighlight that memory integrity protection is an obligation when encrypting\nVMs. Consequently, our work presents the final stroke in a series of attacks\nagainst AMD SEV and SEV-ES and renders the present implementation as incapable\nof protecting against a curious, vulnerable, or malicious Hypervisor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 13:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

We measure performance of signaling schemes via\nthe notion of (additive) regret: the difference between Sender's hypothetically\noptimal utility had she known Receiver's utility function and her actual\nutility induced by the given scheme.\n  On the negative side, we show that if Sender has no knowledge at all about\nReceiver's utility, then Sender has no signaling scheme that performs robustly\nwell.

Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain the real\ncausal effect since we can only recommend or not recommend an item to a user at\none time. Furthermore, previous works usually rely on the randomized controlled\ntrial~(RCT) experiment to evaluate their performance. However, it is usually\nnot practicable in the recommendation scenario due to its unavailable time\nconsuming. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a causal\ncollaborative filtering~(CausCF) method inspired by the widely adopted\ncollaborative filtering~(CF) technique. It is based on the idea that similar\nusers not only have a similar taste on items, but also have similar treatment\neffect under recommendations. CausCF extends the classical matrix factorization\nto the tensor factorization with three dimensions -- user, item, and treatment.\nFurthermore, we also employs regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate\nthe precision of the estimated causal effects from different models. With the\ntestable assumptions, RDD analysis can provide an unbiased causal conclusion\nwithout RCT experiments. Through dedicated experiments on both the public\ndatasets and the industrial application, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed CausCF on the causal effect estimation and ranking performance\nimprovement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 14:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

In this work, we show that this mixing time plays\na crucial role in the dynamics and stability of the trained model, and that\nRBMs operate in two well-defined regimes, namely equilibrium and\nout-of-equilibrium, depending on the interplay between this mixing time of the\nmodel and the number of steps, $k$, used to approximate the gradient. We\nfurther show empirically that this mixing time increases with the learning,\nwhich often implies a transition from one regime to another as soon as $k$\nbecomes smaller than this time. In particular, we show that using the popular\n$k$ (persistent) contrastive divergence approaches, with $k$ small, the\ndynamics of the learned model are extremely slow and often dominated by strong\nout-of-equilibrium effects. On the contrary, RBMs trained in equilibrium\ndisplay faster dynamics, and a smooth convergence to dataset-like\nconfigurations during the sampling. Finally we discuss how to exploit in\npractice both regimes depending on the task one aims to fulfill: (i) short $k$\ncan be used to generate convincing samples in short learning times, (ii) large\n$k$ (or increasingly large) is needed to learn the correct equilibrium\ndistribution of the RBM.

Different traffic control and management policies can be tested on\nthe traffic simulation. Current DRL-based studies are mainly supported by the\nmicroscopic simulation software (e.g., SUMO), while it is not suitable for\ncity-wide control due to the computational burden and gridlock effect. To the\nbest of our knowledge, there is a lack of studies on the large-scale traffic\nsimulator for DRL testbeds, which could further hinder the development of DRL.\nIn view of this, we propose a meso-macro traffic simulator for very large-scale\nDRL scenarios. The proposed simulator integrates mesoscopic and macroscopic\ntraffic simulation models to improve efficiency and eliminate gridlocks. The\nmesoscopic link model simulates flow dynamics on roads, and the macroscopic\nBathtub model depicts vehicle movement in regions. Moreover, both types of\nmodels can be hybridized to accommodate various DRL tasks. This creates portals\nfor mixed transportation applications under different contexts. The result\nshows that the developed simulator only takes 46 seconds to finish a 24-hour\nsimulation in a very large city with 2.2 million vehicles, which is much faster\nthan SUMO. Additionally, we develop a graphic interface for users to visualize\nthe simulation results in a web explorer. In the future, the developed\nmeso-macro traffic simulator could serve as a new environment for very\nlarge-scale DRL problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 15:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

A possible signature of MDM is the\ncapture of baryons from the cosmological plasma in the pre-recombination epoch,\nwith the consequent injection of high-energy photons in the baryon-photon\nplasma. By keeping a phenomenological approach, we consider two broad classes\nof MDM in which Macros are composed either of ordinary matter or antimatter. In\nboth scenarios, we also analyze the impact of a non-vanishing electric charge\ncarried by Macros. We derive constraints on the Macro parameter space from\nthree cosmological processes: the change in the baryon density between the end\nof the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\ndecoupling, the production of spectral distortions in the CMB and the kinetic\ncoupling between charged MDM and baryons at the time of recombination. In the\ncase of neutral Macros we find that the tightest constraints are set by the\nbaryon density condition in most of the parameter space. For Macros composed of\nordinary matter and with binding energy $I$, this leads to the following bound\non the reduced cross-section: $\\sigma_X/M_X \\lesssim 6.8 \\cdot 10^{-7}\n\\left(I/\\mathrm{MeV}\\right)^{-1.56} \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\, \\text{g}^{-1}$.

A key component in vision transformers is the\nfully-connected self-attention which is more powerful than CNNs in modelling\nlong range dependencies. However, since the current dense self-attention uses\nall image patches (tokens) to compute attention matrix, it may neglect locality\nof images patches and involve noisy tokens (e.g., clutter background and\nocclusion), leading to a slow training process and potential degradation of\nperformance. To address these problems, we propose the $k$-NN attention for\nboosting vision transformers. Specifically, instead of involving all the tokens\nfor attention matrix calculation, we only select the top-$k$ similar tokens\nfrom the keys for each query to compute the attention map. The proposed $k$-NN\nattention naturally inherits the local bias of CNNs without introducing\nconvolutional operations, as nearby tokens tend to be more similar than others.\nIn addition, the $k$-NN attention allows for the exploration of long range\ncorrelation and at the same time filters out irrelevant tokens by choosing the\nmost similar tokens from the entire image. Despite its simplicity, we verify,\nboth theoretically and empirically, that $k$-NN attention is powerful in\nspeeding up training and distilling noise from input tokens. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted by using 11 different vision transformer\narchitectures to verify that the proposed $k$-NN attention can work with any\nexisting transformer architectures to improve its prediction performance.

It is therefore\nnecessary to provide an accurate treatment of the blue wing of the Lyman-alpha\nline that enables correct calculations of radiative transport in DA and DBA\nwhite dwarf stars. On the theoretical front, we very recently developed very\naccurate H-He potential energies for the hydrogen 1s, 2s, and 2p states.\nNevertheless, an uncertainty remained about the asymptotic correlation of the\nSigma states and the electronic dipole transition moments. A similar difficulty\noccurred in our first calculations for the resonance broadening of hydrogen\nperturbed by collisions with neutral H atoms. The aim of this paper is twofold.\nFirst, we clarify the question of the asymptotic correlation of the Sigma\nstates, and we show that relativistic contributions, even very tiny, may need\nto be accounted for a correct long-range and asymptotic description of the\nstates because of the specific 2s 2p Coulomb degeneracy in hydrogen. This\neffect of relativistic corrections, inducing small splitting of the 2s and 2p\nstates of H, is shown to be important for the Sigma-Sigma$ transition dipole\nmoments in H-He and is also discussed in H-H. Second, we use existent (H-H) and\nnewly determined (H-He) accurate potentials and properties to provide a\ntheoretical investigation of the collisional effects on the blue wing of the\nLyman-alpha line of H perturbed by He and H.

We represent a colouring rule as a correspondence $F$ defined on\n$X\\times C^k$ with values in $C$. A function $f: X\\rightarrow C$ satisfies the\nrule at $x$ if $f(x) \\in F( x, f(g_1 x), \\dots , f(g_k x))$.

Real-time sensor\nmonitoring proves to be a key tool for reducing the risk related to these\never-evolving earth-fill structures, that exhibit a high rate of sudden and\nhazardous failures. In order to optimally exploit real-time embankment\nmonitoring, one major hindrance has to be overcome: the creation of a\nsupporting numerical model for stability analysis, with rapid-enough response\nto perform data assimilation in real time. A model should be built, such that\nits response can be obtained faster than the physical evolution of the analyzed\nphenomenon. In this work, Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) is used to boost\ncomputational efficiency in solving the coupled hydro-mechanical system of\nequations governing the problem. The Reduced Basis method is applied to the\ncoupled hydro-mechanical equations that govern the groundwater flow, that are\nmade non-linear as a result of considering an unsaturated soil. The resulting\nmodel's performance is assessed by solving a 2D and a 3D problem relevant to\ntailings dams' safety.

The present study attempted to explore the\nfull functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting\nand classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol\n(Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the\nclassification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the\ncontrol experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece and Limassol, Cyprus, and the\nsame was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands and\nspectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature\nprofile for plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from\nother marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its\ncontribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five\nmodels and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest\nperformance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective\nand increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy\nmeasured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using\nthe best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was\ndeveloped and tested in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model\nhad detected the floating plastic with ~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors,\nthe FDI was found the most important variable for detecting marine floating\nplastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote\nsensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for\nthe cost-effective detection of marine floating plastic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 20:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 08:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

It is\nconsidered that the pattern of the new call arrival and handoff call arrival\nfollows Markovian arrival process (MAP). The service times of both types of\ncalls are phase-type (PH ) distributed with different service rates, and\ninter-failure & inter-repair times of channels are exponentially distributed.\nFor the prioritization of handoff calls, G channels are kept in reserve for\nhandoff calls. When all the available channels, say S, are busy at the arrival\nepoch of a handoff call, the handoff call will be dropped. Whereas a new call\nwill be blocked and will have an option to join the orbit of infinite capacity\nor leave the system without getting the connection, if at least S-G channels\nare busy. A new call in the orbit, termed as retrial call, retries to get the\nconnection after a random interval which follows PH distribution.

Further, the closed-form expressions for\nessential performance measures of the proposed model are derived. Through\nnumerical illustrations, the behaviour of performance measures depending on the\nvarious relevant intensities is discussed. An expected cost optimization\nproblem is formulated to determine the optimal value of service intensity and\nthe optimal value of repair intensity.
