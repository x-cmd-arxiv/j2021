The large magnetic field of the trap splits the modes that describe\nin-plane motion of the ions into two branches: High frequency cyclotron modes\ndominated by kinetic energy and low frequency $\\mathbf{E \\times B}$ modes\ndominated by potential energy associated with thermal position displacements.\nUsing an eigenmode analysis we extract the equilibration rate between these two\nbranches as a function of the ratio of the frequencies that characterize the\ntwo branches and observe this equilibration rate to be exponentially suppressed\nas the ratio increases. Under experimental conditions relevant for current work\nat NIST, the predicted equilibration time is orders of magnitude longer than\nany relevant experimental timescales. We also study the coupling rate\ndependence on the thermal temperature and the number of ions. Besides, we show\nhow increasing the rotating wall strength improves crystal stability.

We then directly compare both approaches in a quantitative\nmanner by considering several factors, such as how well the reconstructions\napproximate the data sets themselves to how their respective uncertainties\nevolve. In light of the puzzling Hubble tension, it is important to consider\nhow the uncertain regions evolve over redshift and the methods compare for\nestimating cosmological parameters at current times. For cosmic chronometers\nand baryonic acoustic oscillation compiled data sets, we find that GP\ngenerically produce smaller variances for the reconstructed data with a minimum\nvalue of $\\sigma_{\\rm GP-min} = 1.1$, while the situation for LS is totally\ndifferent with a minimum of $\\sigma_{\\rm LS-min} = 50.8$.

Two scenarios for\nensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogeneous ensembles. In\nhomogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are\ngenerated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of\ndiversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN\nmodels which share the same architecture but have different levels of depth.\nThree types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles\nfor either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble\nMethod (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles.

The $hp$-AMR strategy is based on a\nmulti-level block-structured domain partition in which each level is\nrepresented by block-structured Cartesian grids and the embedded geometry is\nrepresented implicitly by a level set function. The intersection of the\nembedded geometry with the grids produces the implicitly-defined mesh that\nconsists of a collection of regular rectangular cells plus a relatively small\nnumber of irregular curved elements in the vicinity of the embedded boundaries.\nHigh-order quadrature rules for implicitly-defined domains enable high-order\naccuracy resolution of the curved elements with a cell-merging strategy to\naddress the small-cell problem. The $hp$-AMR algorithm treats the system with a\nsecond-order finite volume scheme at the finest level to dynamically track the\nevolution of solution discontinuities while using dG schemes at coarser levels\nto provide high-order accuracy in smooth regions of the flow. On the dG levels,\nthe methodology supports different orders of basis functions on different\nlevels.

To alleviate this concern, in this work, we propose a\nnetwork architecture that introduces tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAVs)\ncarrying green antennas to minimize the EMF exposure while guaranteeing a high\ndata rate for users. In particular, each TUAV can attach itself to one of the\npossible ground stations at the top of some buildings. The location of the\nTUAVs, transmit power of user equipment and association policy are optimized to\nminimize the EMF exposure. Unfortunately, the problem turns out to be\nmixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), which is non-deterministic\npolynomial-time (NP) hard. We propose an efficient low-complexity algorithm\ncomposed of three submodules. Firstly, we propose an algorithm based on the\ngreedy principle to determine the optimal association matrix between the users\nand base stations. Then, we offer two approaches, a modified K-mean and shrink\nand realign (SR) process, to associate each TUAV with a ground station.\nFinally, we put forward two algorithms based on the golden search and SR\nprocess to adjust the TUAV's position within the hovering area over the\nbuilding. After that, we consider the dual problem that maximizes the sum rate\nwhile keeping the exposure below a predefined value, such as the level enforced\nby the regulation. Next, we perform extensive simulations to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed TUAVs to reduce the exposure compared to various\narchitectures.

We formalize this problem as a model selection\ntask using the Minimum Description Length principle, capturing the similarity\nof the input graphs in a common model and the differences between them in\ntransformations to individual models. To discover good models, we propose Momo,\nwhich breaks the problem into two parts and introduces efficient algorithms for\neach. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide range of synthetic and\nreal-world graphs, we confirm that Momo works well in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 19:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Sentiment\nclassification is tackled mainly by machine learning-based classifiers. The\nliterature has adopted word representations from distinct natures to transform\ntweets to vector-based inputs to feed sentiment classifiers. The\nrepresentations come from simple count-based methods, such as bag-of-words, to\nmore sophisticated ones, such as BERTweet, built upon the trendy BERT\narchitecture.

We\nshow how to certify three of Boogie's core transformation phases: the\nelimination of cyclic control flow paths, the (SSA-like) replacement of\nassignments by assumptions using fresh variables (passification), and the final\ngeneration of verification conditions. Similar translations are employed by\nother verifiers. Our implementation produces certificates in Isabelle, based on\na novel formalisation of the Boogie language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 22:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

A binary\nreward signal indicates improvement or deterioration in task performance. The\nstatic policy produces superior training relative to the adaptive policy and is\nagnostic to activation function, network shape, and task.

The combined parameter draws are used for efficient posterior\ninference in massive data settings. A major restriction of existing\ndivide-and-conquer methods is that their first two steps assume that the\nobservations are independent. We address this problem by developing a\ndivide-and-conquer method for Bayesian inference in parametric hidden Markov\nmodels, where the state space is known and finite.

In this\npaper, we propose SyReNets, an approach that leverages neural networks for\nlearning symbolic relations to accurately describe dynamic physical systems\nfrom data. It explores a sequence of symbolic layers that build, in a residual\nmanner, mathematical relations that describes a given desired output from input\nvariables.

Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed\nas a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all previously mentioned\ndrawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution uses the IsoMax\nloss for training and the entropic score for out-of-distribution detection. The\nIsoMax loss works as a drop-in replacement of the SoftMax loss (i.e., the\ncombination of the output linear layer, the SoftMax activation, and the\ncross-entropy loss) because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss\nrequires no changes in the model's architecture or training\nprocedures/hyperparameters.

In this work, we further\ninvestigate the possibility of applying Transformers for image matching and\nmetric learning given pairs of images. We find that the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) and the vanilla Transformer with decoders are not adequate for image\nmatching due to their lack of image-to-image attention. Thus, we further design\ntwo naive solutions, i.e. query-gallery concatenation in ViT, and query-gallery\ncross-attention in the vanilla Transformer. The latter improves the\nperformance, but it is still limited. This implies that the attention mechanism\nin Transformers is primarily designed for global feature aggregation, which is\nnot naturally suitable for image matching. Accordingly, we propose a new\nsimplified decoder, which drops the full attention implementation with the\nsoftmax weighting, keeping only the query-key similarity computation.\nAdditionally, global max pooling and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) head are\napplied to decode the matching result.

A modern multi-core CPU generally employs a multi-level hierarchy\nof caches, through which the most recently and frequently used data are\nmaintained in each core's local private caches while all cores share the\nlast-level cache (LLC). For inclusive caches, clean cache lines replaced in\nhigher-level caches are not necessarily copied back to lower levels, as the\ninclusiveness implies their existences in lower levels. For exclusive and\nnon-inclusive caches that are widely utilized by Intel, AMD, and ARM today,\neither indiscriminately copying back all or none of replaced clean cache lines\nto lower levels raises no violation to exclusiveness and non-inclusiveness\ndefinitions.\n  We have conducted a quantitative study and found that, copying back all or\nnone of clean cache lines to lower-level cache of exclusive caches entails\nsuboptimal performance. The reason is that only a part of cache lines would be\nreused and others turn to be dead in a long run. This observation motivates us\nto selectively copy back some clean cache lines to LLC in an architecture of\nexclusive or non-inclusive caches. We revisit the concept of reuse distance of\ncache lines. In a nutshell, a clean cache line with a shorter reuse distance is\ncopied back to lower-level cache as it is likely to be re-referenced in the\nnear future, while cache lines with much longer reuse distances would be\ndiscarded or sent to memory if they are dirty. We have implemented and\nevaluated our proposal with non-volatile (STT-MRAM) LLC. Experimental results\nwith gem5 and SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks show that on average our proposal yields\nup to 12.8% higher throughput of IPC (instructions per cycle) than the\nleast-recently-used (LRU) replacement policy with copying back all clean cache\nlines for STT-MRAM LLC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 06:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

Therefore, model compression is\nnecessary to reduce the computation and memory cost of pre-trained models. In\nthis work, we aim to compress BERT and address the following two challenging\npractical issues: (1) The compression algorithm should be able to output\nmultiple compressed models with different sizes and latencies, in order to\nsupport devices with different memory and latency limitations; (2) The\nalgorithm should be downstream task agnostic, so that the compressed models are\ngenerally applicable for different downstream tasks. We leverage techniques in\nneural architecture search (NAS) and propose NAS-BERT, an efficient method for\nBERT compression. NAS-BERT trains a big supernet on a search space containing a\nvariety of architectures and outputs multiple compressed models with adaptive\nsizes and latency. Furthermore, the training of NAS-BERT is conducted on\nstandard self-supervised pre-training tasks (e.g., masked language model) and\ndoes not depend on specific downstream tasks. Thus, the compressed models can\nbe used across various downstream tasks. The technical challenge of NAS-BERT is\nthat training a big supernet on the pre-training task is extremely costly. We\nemploy several techniques including block-wise search, search space pruning,\nand performance approximation to improve search efficiency and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on GLUE and SQuAD benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nNAS-BERT can find lightweight models with better accuracy than previous\napproaches, and can be directly applied to different downstream tasks with\nadaptive model sizes for different requirements of memory or latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 07:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

So far, most of the studies were devoted to the\nfluctuations in the time-averaged current -- the zero frequency Fourier\ncomponent of the time dependent current. However, in many practical\napplications the fluctuations at other frequencies are of equal importance.\nHere we study the full frequency dependence of current statistics in\nperiodically driven stochastic systems. First, we show a general method to\ncalculate the current statistics, valid even when the current's frequency is\nincommensurate with the driving frequency, breaking the time periodicity of the\nsystem. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the cumulant generating function\n(CGF), that encodes all the statistics of the current, is composed of a\ncontinuous background at any frequency accompanied by either positive or\nnegative peaks at current's frequencies commensurate with the driving\nfrequency. We show that cumulants of increasing orders display peaks at an\nincreasing number of locations but with decreasing amplitudes that depend on\nthe commensurate ratio of frequencies. All these peaks are then transcribed in\nthe behaviour of the CGF. As the measurement time increases, these peaks become\nsharper but keep the same amplitude and eventually lead to discontinuities of\nthe CGF at all the frequencies that are commensurate with the driving frequency\nin the limit of infinitely long measurement. We demonstrate our formalism and\nits consequences on three types of models: an underdamped Brownian particle in\na periodically driven harmonic potential; a periodically driven run-and-tumble\nparticle; and a two-state system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 08:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

In the standard formulation, a quantizer is designed to minimize\nthe distortion between input and output when the number of reconstruction\npoints is fixed. We consider, instead, the scenario in which the number of\ncomparators used in quantization is fixed. More precisely, we study the case in\nwhich a vector quantizer of dimension d is comprised of k comparators, each\nreceiving a linear combination of the inputs and producing the output value\none/zero if this linear combination is above/below a certain threshold. In\nreconstruction, the comparators' output is mapped to a reconstruction point,\nchosen so as to minimize a chosen distortion measure between the quantizer\ninput and its reconstruction.

As part of this setting, each\ntransportation request of a chronic or walk-in patient consists of an outbound\ntrip to the GP and an inbound trip back home. The economic sustainability of\npatient transportation systems mainly depends on their utilization and how well\ntransportation requests can be bundled through ride sharing. To ease the\nlatter, we consider a flexible scheduling of chronic patients in which only a\ncertain range for an appointment is fixed a priori while the exact time is\ndetermined by the scheduling of the outbound trip. This leads to a novel\nextension of the dial-a-ride problem that we call the dial-a-ride problem with\ncombined requests and flexible scheduling (DARPCF). In this paper, we introduce\ntwo heuristics for the DARPCF that exploit this increased flexibility. Both\napproaches initially compute so-called mini-clusters of outbound requests.\nThen, the mini-clusters are linked by (i) solving a traveling salesman problem\nand creating routes of outbound rides with a splitting procedure or by (ii)\nusing a rolling horizon approach and solving bipartite matching problems for\nthe vehicle assignment. Our computational study shows that by using the\npresented algorithms with the flexible scheduling of chronic appointments, the\naverage number of served requests can be increased by 16% compared to a\nnon-flexible setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 09:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

The difficulties arise from several aspects. First, collecting ground\ntruth labels or prior knowledge for anomalies is hard in real-world systems,\nwhich often lead to limited or no anomaly labels in the dataset. Second,\nanomalies in large systems usually occur in a collective manner due to the\nunderlying dependency structure among devices or sensors. Lastly, real-time\nanomaly detection for high-dimensional data requires efficient algorithms that\nare capable of handling different types of data (i.e. continuous and discrete).\nWe propose a correlation structure-based collective anomaly detection (CSCAD)\nmodel for high-dimensional anomaly detection problem in large systems, which is\nalso generalizable to semi-supervised or supervised settings.

The\nreconstruction loss and latent standard deviation vector of a sample obtained\nfrom reconstruction network can be perceived as two natural anomalous degree\nmeasures.

In\nthis paper, we propose a paragraph captioning model which eschews the\nproblematic event detection stage and directly generates paragraphs for\nuntrimmed videos. To describe coherent and diverse events, we propose to\nenhance the conventional temporal attention with dynamic video memories, which\nprogressively exposes new video features and suppresses over-accessed video\ncontents to control visual focuses of the model.

The resonance around 520, 514\ncm-1, due to symmetric-asymmetric bending of silicate tetrahedral units,\ndecreases in intensity very rapidly as hydration progresses and more so for the\nnanosilica incorporated samples demonstrating accelerated hydration.\nInterestingly, the resonance around 451 cm-1, due to symmetric and asymmetric\nbending of silicate tetrahedral units along with some contribution of\nvibrational modes of calcium oxide polyhedral units, does not show a similar\ndecrease in intensity.

Intuitively, interactions with\ndistant nodes introduce more noise for a node than those with close neighbors.\nHowever, in most existing works, messages being passed among nodes are mingled\ntogether, which is inefficient from a communication perspective.

Researchers\nhave begun to design and build DLSRs. Among various DLSR proposals, the hybrid\nmultibend achromat (HMBA) lattice enables sextupole strengths to be maintained\nat a reasonable level when minimizing the emittance; hence, it has been adopted\nin many DLSR designs. Based on the H7BA lattice, the design of the Advanced\nPhoton Source Upgrade Project (APSU) can effectively reduce emittance by\nreplacing six quadrupoles with antibends. Herein, we discuss the feasibility of\ndesigning an APSU type HMBA lattice for the Southern Advanced Photon Source, a\nmid energy DLSR light source with ultralow emittance that has been proposed to\nbe built adjacent to the China Spallation Neutron Source. Both linear and\nnonlinear dynamics are optimized to obtain a detailed design of this type of\nlattice. The emittance is minimized, while a sufficiently large dynamic\naperture (DA) and momentum acceptance (MA) are maintained. A design comprising\n36 APSU type H7BAs, with an energy of 3 GeV and a circumference of 972 m, is\nachieved.

These networks have an inherent feature of parallelism that\nallows them to boost the capacity and enhance the security of communication\nsystems. Recent advances led to the deployment of small- and large-scale\nquantum communication networks with real quantum hardware. In quantum networks,\nentanglement is a key resource that allows for data transmission between\ndifferent nodes. However, to reap the benefits of entanglement and enable\nefficient quantum communication, the number of generated entangled pairs must\nbe optimized. Indeed, if the entanglement generation rates are not optimized,\nthen some of these valuable resources will be discarded and lost. In this\npaper, the problem of optimizing the entanglement generation rates and their\ndistribution over a quantum memory is studied. In particular, a quantum network\nin which users have heterogeneous distances and applications is considered.\nThis problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization\nproblem whose goal is to efficiently utilize the available quantum memory by\ndistributing the quantum entangled pairs in a way that maximizes the user\nsatisfaction.

It is generally\nbelieved that the lower fill factor may reduce the accuracy of photogrammetric\nmeasurements. But nevertheless, there are no studies addressing the effect of\nthe imaging sensor's fill factor on digital image correlation (DIC) measurement\naccuracy.

These CNNs require a large number of manual\ndelineations of the WM tracts of interest for training, which are generally\nlabor-intensive and costly. The expensive manual delineation can be a\nparticular disadvantage when novel WM tracts, i.e., tracts that have not been\nincluded in existing manual delineations, are to be analyzed. To accurately\nsegment novel WM tracts, it is desirable to transfer the knowledge learned\nabout existing WM tracts, so that even with only a few delineations of the\nnovel WM tracts, CNNs can learn adequately for the segmentation. In this paper,\nwe explore the transfer of such knowledge to the segmentation of novel WM\ntracts in the few-shot setting. Although a classic fine-tuning strategy can be\nused for the purpose, the information in the last task-specific layer for\nsegmenting existing WM tracts is completely discarded. We hypothesize that the\nweights of this last layer can bear valuable information for segmenting the\nnovel WM tracts and thus completely discarding the information is not optimal.\nIn particular, we assume that the novel WM tracts can correlate with existing\nWM tracts and the segmentation of novel WM tracts can be predicted with the\nlogits of existing WM tracts. In this way, better initialization of the last\nlayer than random initialization can be achieved for fine-tuning. Further, we\nshow that a more adaptive use of the knowledge in the last layer for segmenting\nexisting WM tracts can be conveniently achieved by simply inserting a warmup\nstage before classic fine-tuning.

In this work, we propose the Vector Detection Network\n(VDN) to detect analog meters' pointers given their images, eliminating the\nbarriers for autonomously reading such meters using intelligent agents like\nrobots. We tackled the pointer as a two-dimensional vector, whose initial point\ncoincides with the tip, and the direction is along tail-to-tip.

Massive stars form in magnetized and turbulent\nenvironments, and are often located in stellar clusters. Their accretion\nmechanism, as well as the origin of their system's stellar multiplicity are\npoorly understood. Aims. We study the influence of both magnetic fields and\nturbulence on the accretion mechanism of massive protostars and their\nmultiplicity. Methods. We present a series of four Radiation-MHD simulations of\nthe collapse of a massive magnetized, turbulent core of 100 $M_\\odot$ with the\nAMR code Ramses, including a hybrid radiative transfer method for stellar\nirradiation and ambipolar diffusion. We vary the Mach and Alfvenic Mach numbers\nto probe sub- and superalfvenic turbulence as well as sub- and supersonic\nturbulence regimes. Results. Subalfvenic turbulence leads to single stellar\nsystems while superalfvenic turbulence leads to binary formation from disk\nfragmentation following spiral arm collision, with mass ratios of 1.1-1.6. In\nthose runs, infalling gas reaches the individual disks via a transient\ncircumbinary structure. Magnetically-regulated, thermally-dominated (plasma\nbeta $\\beta>1$), Keplerian disks form in all runs, with sizes 100-200 AU and\nmasses 1-8 $M_\\odot$. The disks around primary and secondary sink particles\nshare similar properties. We observe higher accretion rates onto the secondary\nstars than onto their primary star companion. The primary disk orientation is\nfound to be set by the initial angular momentum carried by turbulence.\nConclusions. Small (300 AU) massive protostellar disks as those frequently\nobserved nowadays can only be reproduced so far in the presence of (moderate)\nmagnetic fields with ambipolar diffusion, even in a turbulent medium. The\ninterplay between magnetic fields and turbulence sets the multiplicity of\nstellar clusters. A plasma beta $\\beta>1$ is a good indicator of streamers and\ndisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 13:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models were\ndeveloped for synthetically distorted images, however, they perform poorly on\nin-the-wild images, which are widely existed in various practical applications.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel BIQA model for in-the-wild images by\naddressing two critical problems in this field: how to learn better\nquality-aware feature representation, and how to solve the problem of\ninsufficient training samples in terms of their content and distortion\ndiversity. Considering that perceptual visual quality is affected by both\nlow-level visual features (e.g. distortions) and high-level semantic\ninformation (e.g. content), we first propose a staircase structure to\nhierarchically integrate the features from intermediate layers into the final\nfeature representation, which enables the model to make full use of visual\ninformation from low-level to high-level. Then an iterative mixed database\ntraining (IMDT) strategy is proposed to train the BIQA model on multiple\ndatabases simultaneously, so the model can benefit from the increase in both\ntraining samples and image content and distortion diversity and can learn a\nmore general feature representation. Experimental results show that the\nproposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art BIQA models on six\nin-the-wild IQA databases by a large margin. Moreover, the proposed model shows\nan excellent performance in the cross-database evaluation experiments, which\nfurther demonstrates that the learned feature representation is robust to\nimages with diverse distortions and content.

Active learning gives a procedure to select the most\ninformative data points and improve data efficiency by reducing the cost of\nlabeling. The info-max learning principle maximizing mutual information such as\nBALD has been successful and widely adapted in various active learning\napplications. However, this pool-based specific objective inherently introduces\na redundant selection and further requires a high computational cost for batch\nselection. In this paper, we design and propose a new uncertainty measure,\nBalanced Entropy Acquisition (BalEntAcq), which captures the information\nbalance between the uncertainty of underlying softmax probability and the label\nvariable. To do this, we approximate each marginal distribution by Beta\ndistribution. Beta approximation enables us to formulate BalEntAcq as a ratio\nbetween an augmented entropy and the marginalized joint entropy. The\nclosed-form expression of BalEntAcq facilitates parallelization by estimating\ntwo parameters in each marginal Beta distribution. BalEntAcq is a purely\nstandalone measure without requiring any relational computations with other\ndata points. Nevertheless, BalEntAcq captures a well-diversified selection near\nthe decision boundary with a margin, unlike other existing uncertainty measures\nsuch as BALD, Entropy, or Mean Standard Deviation (MeanSD). Finally, we\ndemonstrate that our balanced entropy learning principle with BalEntAcq\nconsistently outperforms well-known linearly scalable active learning methods,\nincluding a recently proposed PowerBALD, a simple but diversified version of\nBALD, by showing experimental results obtained from MNIST, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and\nTinyImageNet datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 14:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 05:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Therefore,\ntraditional neural style transfer methods face biased content representation.\nTo address this critical issue, we take long-range dependencies of input images\ninto account for image style transfer by proposing a transformer-based approach\ncalled StyTr$^2$. In contrast with visual transformers for other vision tasks,\nStyTr$^2$ contains two different transformer encoders to generate\ndomain-specific sequences for content and style, respectively. Following the\nencoders, a multi-layer transformer decoder is adopted to stylize the content\nsequence according to the style sequence. We also analyze the deficiency of\nexisting positional encoding methods and propose the content-aware positional\nencoding (CAPE), which is scale-invariant and more suitable for image style\ntransfer tasks.

Recently, some purely quantum machine learning models were proposed\nsuch as the quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) to perform\nclassification on quantum data. However, all of the existing QML models rely on\ncentralized solutions that cannot scale well for large-scale and distributed\nquantum networks. Hence, it is apropos to consider more practical quantum\nfederated learning (QFL) solutions tailored towards emerging quantum network\narchitectures. Indeed, developing QFL frameworks for quantum networks is\ncritical given the fragile nature of computing qubits and the difficulty of\ntransferring them. On top of its practical momentousness, QFL allows for\ndistributed quantum learning by leveraging existing wireless communication\ninfrastructure. This paper proposes the first fully quantum federated learning\nframework that can operate over quantum data and, thus, share the learning of\nquantum circuit parameters in a decentralized manner. First, given the lack of\nexisting quantum federated datasets in the literature, the proposed framework\nbegins by generating the first quantum federated dataset, with a hierarchical\ndata format, for distributed quantum networks. Then, clients sharing QCNN\nmodels are fed with the quantum data to perform a classification task.\nSubsequently, the server aggregates the learnable quantum circuit parameters\nfrom clients and performs federated averaging. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed QFL\nsolution. This work is the first to combine Google's TensorFlow Federated and\nTensorFlow Quantum in a practical implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 12:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Compression methods are often\napplied on the massive amounts of sensor data generated prior to sending it to\nthe Cloud to reduce the storage and delivery costs. A lossy compression\nprovides high compression gain (CG), but may reduce the performance of an ECG\napplication (downstream task) due to information loss. Previous works on ECG\nmonitoring focus either on optimizing the signal reconstruction or the task's\nperformance.

Among the challenges, we list a lack\nof recognised best practice and procedural transparency, researcher opportunity\ncosts, institutional and social pressures, cognitive biases, and the inherently\ndifficult nature of the task. The potential benefits, on the other hand,\ninclude improved anticipation and identification of impacts, better\ncommunication with policy and governance experts, and a general strengthening\nof the norms around responsible research. To maximise the chance of success, we\nrecommend measures to increase transparency, improve guidance, create\nincentives to engage earnestly with the process, and facilitate public\ndeliberation on the requirement's merits and future.

However, in practice, estimating\nomnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial\npanoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and\nmobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements\nin mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep\nlearning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and\nunderstand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in\nthis work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile\nAR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting\nestimation in real time. Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique\nthat efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile\ndevice. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent\n3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting\nestimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored\nGPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique\nthat reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive\ntriggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations\nand a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the\nmobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time\nof Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe's APIs.
