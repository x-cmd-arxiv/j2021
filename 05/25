This\nwork proposes a novel approach that instead utilizes the magnitude of affine\nmeasurements to achieve ambiguity-free signal reconstruction. The proposed\nmethod relies on two-stage approach that consists of support identification\nfollowed by the exact recovery of nonzero signal entries. In the noise-free\ncase, perfect support identification using a simple counting rule is guaranteed\nsubject to a mild condition on the signal sparsity, and subsequent exact\nrecovery of the nonzero signal entries can be obtained in closed-form. The\nproposed approach is then extended to two noisy scenarios, namely, sparse noise\n(or outliers) and non-sparse bounded noise. For both cases, perfect support\nidentification is still ensured under mild conditions on the noise model,\nnamely, the support size for sparse outliers and the power of the bounded\nnoise. Under perfect support identification, exact signal recovery can be\nachieved using a simple majority rule for the sparse noise scenario, and\nreconstruction up to a bounded error can be achieved using linear least-squares\n(LS) estimation for the non-sparse bounded noise scenario. The obtained\nanalytic performance guarantee for the latter case also sheds light on the\nconstruction of the sensing matrix and bias vector. In fact, we show that a\nnear optimal performance can be achieved with high probability by the random\ngeneration of the nonzero entries of the sparse sensing matrix and bias vector\naccording to the uniform distribution over a circle.

In this paper we are interested in\nunderstanding the structure of satisfiable and unsatisfiable sentences. In\nprevious work we initiated a new approach to SAT by formulating a mapping from\npropositional logic sentences to graphs, allowing us to find structural\nobstructions to 2SAT (clauses with exactly 2 literals) in terms of graphs. Here\nwe generalize these ideas to multi-hypergraphs in which the edges can have more\nthan 2 vertices and can have multiplicity. This is needed for understanding the\nstructure of SAT for sentences made of clauses with 3 or more literals (3SAT),\nwhich is a building block of NP-completeness theory. We introduce a decision\nproblem that we call GraphSAT, as a first step towards a structural view of\nSAT. Each propositional logic sentence can be mapped to a multi-hypergraph by\nassociating each variable with a vertex (ignoring the negations) and each\nclause with a hyperedge. Such a graph then becomes a representative of a\ncollection of possible sentences and we can then formulate the notion of\nsatisfiability of such a graph. With this coarse representation of classes of\nsentences one can then investigate structural obstructions to SAT. To make the\nproblem tractable, we prove a local graph rewriting theorem which allows us to\nsimplify the neighborhood of a vertex without knowing the rest of the graph. We\nuse this to deduce several reduction rules, allowing us to modify a graph\nwithout changing its satisfiability status which can then be used in a program\nto simplify graphs. We study a subclass of 3SAT by examining sentences living\non triangulations of surfaces and show that for any compact surface there\nexists a triangulation that can support unsatisfiable sentences, giving\nspecific examples of such triangulations for various surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 16:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Its arrows are functions from source nodes to target nodes\nthat preserve the additional structure. For instance, a game's information-set\ncollection is newly regarded as a topological basis for the game's\ndecision-node set, and thus a morphism's continuity serves to preserve\ninformation sets. Given these definitions, a game monomorphism is characterized\nby the property of not mapping two source runs (plays) to the same target run.\nFurther, a game isomorphism is characterized as a bijection whose restriction\nto decision nodes is a homeomorphism, whose induced player transformation is\ninjective, and which strictly preserves the ordinal content of the utility\nfunctions.\n  The category is then applied to some game-theoretic concepts beyond the\ndefinition of a game.

In this work we explore the phase diagram of a\nfrustrated localized magnet on a two-dimensional centrosymmetric triangular\nlattice, focusing on the interplay between the two-ion anisotropy (TIA) and the\nsingle-ion anisotropy (SIA).

The model allows us to estimate the role of each ingredient and\nanalyze the tradeoff between adherence and duration of self-isolation.

If\nadherence improves for shorter quarantine periods, there exists an optimal\nduration of isolation, shorter than the infectious period. However,\nheterogeneities in the connectivity pattern, coupled to a reduced compliance\nfor highly active individuals, may almost completely offset the effectiveness\nof self-isolation measures on the control of the epidemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 17:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 08:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

The general diagnosis methods for tuberculosis include\nmicroscopic examination, tuberculin skin test, culture method, enzyme linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electronic nose system. World Health\nOrganization (WHO) recommends standard microscopic examination for early\ndiagnosis of tuberculosis. In microscopy, the technician examines field of\nviews (FOVs) in sputum smear for presence of any TB bacilli and counts the\nnumber of TB bacilli per FOV to report the level of severity. This process is\ntime consuming with an increased concentration for an experienced staff to\nexamine a single sputum smear. The examination demands for skilled technicians\nin high-prevalence countries which may lead to overload, fatigue and diminishes\nthe quality of microscopy. Thus, a computer assisted system is proposed and\ndesigned for the detection of tuberculosis bacilli to assist pathologists with\nincreased sensitivity and specificity. The manual efforts in detecting and\ncounting the number of TB bacilli is greatly minimized. The system obtains\nZiehl-Neelsen stained microscopic images from conventional microscope at 100x\nmagnification and passes the data to the detection system. Initially the\nsegmentation of TB bacilli was done using RGB thresholding and Sauvola's\nadaptive thresholding algorithm. To eliminate the non-TB bacilli from coarse\nlevel segmentation, shape descriptors like area, perimeter, convex hull, major\naxis length and eccentricity are used to extract only the TB bacilli features.\nFinally, the TB bacilli are counted using the generated bounding boxes to\nreport the level of severity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 17:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Most\nFRBs have only ever been seen once, while others flash repeatedly, though\nsporadically (Spitler et al. 2016, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021). Many\nmodels invoke magnetically powered neutron stars (magnetars) as the engines\nproducing FRB emission (Margalit & Metzger 2018, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.\n2020). Recently, CHIME/FRB announced the discovery (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) of\nthe repeating FRB 20200120E, coming from the direction of the nearby grand\ndesign spiral galaxy M81. Four potential counterparts at other observing\nwavelengths were identified (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) but no definitive\nassociation with these sources, or M81, could be made. Here we report an\nextremely precise localisation of FRB 20200120E, which allows us to associate\nit with a globular cluster (GC) in the M81 galactic system and to place it ~2pc\noffset from the optical center of light of the GC. This confirms (Bhardwaj et\nal. 2021) that FRB 20200120E is 40 times closer than any other known\nextragalactic FRB. Because such GCs host old stellar populations, this\nassociation strongly challenges FRB models that invoke young magnetars formed\nin a core-collapse supernova as powering FRB emission. We propose, instead,\nthat FRB 20200120E is a highly magnetised neutron star formed via either\naccretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf or via merger of compact stars in a\nbinary system (Margalit et al. 2019). Alternative scenarios involving compact\nbinary systems, efficiently formed inside globular clusters, could also be\nresponsible for the observed bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 17:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

However, high-time-resolution studies of FRBs are limited\nby their unpredictable activity levels, available instrumentation and temporal\nbroadening in the intervening ionised medium.

We apply this framework to isolated disc galaxy simulations\nwith mass resolutions between $10^3~{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and $10^5~{\\rm M}_\\odot$ per\ngas cell. Each simulation accounts for the self-gravity of the gas, the\nmomentum and thermal energy from supernovae, the injection of mass by stellar\nwinds, and the non-equilibrium chemistry of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. We\nreduce the resolution-dependence of our model by grouping those HII regions\nwith overlapping ionisation front radii. The Str\\\"{o}mgren radii of the grouped\nHII regions are at best marginally-resolved, so that the injection of\npurely-thermal energy within these radii has no effect on the interstellar\nmedium.

To investigate gas accretion in the vicinity of galaxies, we\nanalyze the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations for 4 Milky Way mass\ngalaxies (M_halo ~ 10E12 solar masses), focusing on simulations with cosmic ray\nphysics. We find that at z~0, gas approaches the disk with angular momentum\nsimilar to the gaseous disk edge and low radial velocities, piling-up near the\nedge and settling into full rotational support. Accreting gas moves\npredominantly parallel to the disk with small but nonzero vertical velocity\ncomponents, and joins the disk largely in the outskirts as opposed to \"raining\"\ndown onto the disk. Once in the disk, gas trajectories are complex, being\ndominated by spiral arm induced oscillations and feedback. However, time and\nazimuthal averages show clear but slow net radial infall with transport speeds\nof 1-3 km/s and net mass fluxes through the disk on the order of one solar mass\nper year, comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies and decreasing\ntowards galactic center as gas is sunk into star formation. These rates are\nslightly higher in simulations without cosmic rays (1-7 km/s, ~4-5 solar masses\nper year). We find overall consistency of our results with observational\nconstraints and discuss prospects of future observations of gas flows in and\naround galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 18:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 03:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

This paper first\npoints out that RCube is suitable as a candidate topology of DCNs for edge\ncomputing. Three transmission types are among core and edge servers based on\nthe demand for applications' computation and instant response. We then employ\nprotection routing to analyze the transmission failure of RCube DCNs.

A\npractical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential\nlearning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases\nthat are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information\ntheoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective\ncriteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample\nselection scenario.

A local\nkernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the\nadaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the\noriginal formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local\nkernels methodology is developed that allows for the conformability of the\nkernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational\ncomplexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to\nwork on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel\nhyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood\nestimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters\ncan be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion\nperformance.

While acoustofluidic devices can manipulate particles in\ntwo dimensions, the production of these devices often demands a cleanroom\nenvironment. Therefore, acoustically excited glass capillaries present a cheap\nalternative to labour-intensive cleanroom production. Here, we present 2D metal\nmicro-particle focusing in a round glass capillary using bulk acoustic waves.\nExcitation of the piezoelectric transducer at specific frequencies leads to\nmode shapes in the round capillary, concentrating particles towards the\ncapillary centre. We experimentally investigate the particle linewidth for\ndifferent particle materials and concentrations. We demonstrate the focus of\ncopper particles with 1 $\\mu$m in diameter down to a line of width 60.8 $\\pm$\n7.0 $\\mu$m and height 45.2 $\\pm$ 9.3 $\\mu$m, corresponding to a local\nconcentration of 4.5 % v/v, which is 90 times higher than the concentration of\nthe initial solution. Through numerical analysis, we could obtain further\ninsights into the particle manipulation mechanism inside the capillary and\npredict the particle trajectories.

It is an\nimportant and long understood special case of the Littlewood-Richardson rule\nfor decomposing general tensor products of representations of GL(n,C). In our\nrecent work [Gurevich-Howe17, Gurevich-Howe19] on the organization of\nrepresentations of the general linear group over a finite field F_q using small\nrepresentations, we used a generalization of the Pieri rule to the context of\nthis latter group. In this note, we demonstrate how to derive the Pieri rule\nfor GL(n,Fq). This is done in two steps; the first, reduces the task to the\ncase of the symmetric group S_n, using the natural relation between the\nrepresentations of S_n and the spherical principal series representations of\nGL(n,F_q); while in the second step, inspired by a remark of Nolan Wallach, the\nrule is obtained for S_n invoking the S_\\ell-GL_(n,C)) Schur duality. Along the\nway, we advertise an approach to the representation theory of the symmetric\ngroup which emphasizes the central role played by the dominance order on Young\ndiagrams.

Over time, these discussions can become extensively lengthy and\ndifficult to understand. Inevitably, these discussion threads lead to instances\nwhere bug-fixing comments intermingle with seemingly-unrelated comments. This\ntask, however, poses further challenges when dealing with high volumes of bug\nreports. Large software systems are plagued by thousands of bug reports daily.\nHence, it becomes time-consuming to investigate these bug reports efficiently.\nTo address this gap, this paper builds a ranked-based automated tool that we\nrefer it to as RETRORANK. Specifically, RETRORANK recommends bug-fixing\ncomments from issue tracking discussion threads in the context of user query\nrelevance, the use of positive language, and semantic relevance among comments.\nBy using a combination of Vector Space Model (VSM), Sentiment Analysis (SA),\nand the TextRank Model (TR) we show how that past fixed bugs and their\nassociated bug-fixing comments with relatively positive sentiments can\nsemantically connect to investigate the root cause of a new bug.

However, current SAR damage mapping methods struggle to separate\ndamage from other changes in the Earth's surface. In this study, we propose a\nnovel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time\nhistory of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous\nvariations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. We\nquantify Earth surface change using time series of Interferometric SAR\ncoherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly\ndetector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event\ncoherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the\ncoherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the\nforecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence\nin the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage\ndetection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local\nbehavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to\ncalculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time\nseries of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Our approach shows good agreement with\nobserved damage and quantitative improvement compared to using pre- to co-event\ncoherence loss as a damage proxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 21:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Graphene-like 2D\nDirac materials are gapless only within certain approximations, e.g., if\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected. It has recently been reported that\nmaterials with nonsymmorphic crystal lattice possess symmetry-enforced\nDirac-like band dispersion around certain high-symmetry momenta even in the\npresence of SOC. Here we calculate the optical absorption coefficient of\nnonsymmorphic semimetals, such as $\\alpha$-bismuthene, which hosts two\nanisotropic Dirac cones with different Fermi velocities along $x$ and $y$\ndirections.We find that the optical absorption coefficient depends strongly on\nthe anisotropy factor and the photon polarization. When a magnetic field is\napplied perpendicular to the plane of the material, the absorption coefficient\nalso depends on an internal parameter we termed the mixing angle of the band\nstructure. We further find that an in-plane magnetic field, while leaving the\nsystem gapless, can induce a Van-Hove singularity in the joint density of\nstates: this causes a significant enhancement of the optical absorption at the\nfrequency of the singularity for one direction of polarization but not for the\northogonal one, making the optical properties even more strongly dependent on\npolarization. Due to the anisotropy present in our model, the Dirac cones at\ntwo high-symmetry momenta in the Brillouin zone contribute very differently to\nthe optical absorbance. Consequently, it might be possible to preferentially\npopulate one valley or the other by varying photon polarization and frequency.\nThese results suggest that nonsymmorphic 2D Dirac semimetals are excellent\ncandidate materials for tunable magneto-optic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 21:29:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 01:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 19:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 21:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Additionally, the\npast works do not include interactions between these structures and exposure\nfactors. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of paramount interest in\nheterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma exposure interacts\nwith brain shape changes to influence behavior. We propose a comprehensive\nframework that overcomes these limitations by representing brain substructures\nas continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape differences\nusing elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute shape\nsummaries of subcortical data and represent individual shapes by their\nprincipal scores. These representations allow visualization tools that help\nlocalize changes when these PCs are varied. Subsequently, these PCs, the\nauxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are used for regression\nmodeling. We apply our method to data from the Grady Trauma Project, where the\ngoal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD using shapes of brain\nsubstructures. Our analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power\nunder the elastic shape analysis than widely used approaches such as\nvertex-wise shape analysis and even volumetric analysis. It helped identify\nlocal deformations in brain shapes related to change in PTSD severity. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis approaches that can\nseamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for improved\naccuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape\nand additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when\nmodeling clinical outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 21:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

While\nshown to be more stable in practice, powered prostheses generally use\nmodel-independent control methods that lack formal guarantees of stability and\nrely on heuristic tuning. Recent work overcame one of the limitations of\nmodel-based prosthesis control by developing a class of provably stable\nprosthesis controllers that only require the human interaction forces with the\nprosthesis, yet these controllers have not been realized with sensing of these\nforces in the control loop. Our work realizes the first model-dependent\nprosthesis knee controller that uses in-the-loop on-board real-time force\nsensing at the interface between the human and prosthesis and at the ground.\nThe result is an optimization-based control methodology that formally\nguarantees stability while enabling human-prosthesis walking on a variety of\nterrain types.

Our\nframework adopts the reweighing estimation approach for bias correction and the\nminimax robust estimation approach for achieving robustness on prediction\naccuracy. Moreover, during the minimax optimization, the fairness is achieved\nunder the worst case, which guarantees the model's fairness on test data.

However, estimating\nthe entropy rate for stationary continuous-valued stochastic processes has not\nreceived as much attention. In fact, many current techniques are not able to\naccurately estimate or characterise the complexity of the differential entropy\nrate for strongly correlated processes, such as Fractional Gaussian Noise and\nARFIMA(0,d,0). To the point that some cannot even detect the trend of the\nentropy rate, e.g. when it increases/decreases, maximum, or asymptotic trends,\nas a function of their Hurst parameter. However, a recently developed technique\nprovides accurate estimates at a high computational cost. In this paper, we\ndefine a robust technique for non-parametrically estimating the differential\nentropy rate of a continuous valued stochastic process from observed data, by\nmaking an explicit link between the differential entropy rate and the Shannon\nentropy rate of a quantised version of the original data. Estimation is\nperformed by a Shannon entropy rate estimator, and then converted to a\ndifferential entropy rate estimate. We show that this technique inherits many\nimportant statistical properties from the Shannon entropy rate estimator. The\nestimator is able to provide better estimates than the defined relative\nmeasures and much quicker estimates than known absolute measures, for strongly\ncorrelated processes. Finally, we analyse the complexity of the estimation\ntechnique and test the robustness to non-stationarity, and show that none of\nthe current techniques are robust to non-stationarity, even if they are robust\nto strong correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 23:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-black-box attack framework called\none-feature-each-iteration (OFEI) to craft Android adversarial samples. This\nframework modifies as few features as possible and requires less classifier\ninformation to fool the classifier. We conduct a controlled experiment to\nevaluate our OFEI framework by comparing it with the benchmark methods JSMF,\nGenAttack and pointwise attack. The experimental results show that our OFEI has\na higher misclassification rate of 98.25%.

When optimizing MRF\nscans, modeling undersampling errors and field imperfections in cost functions\nwill make the optimization results more practical and robust. However, this\nprocess is computationally expensive and impractical for sequence optimization\nalgorithms when MRF signal evolutions need to be generated for each\noptimization iteration. Here, we introduce a fast MRF simulator to simulate\naliased images from actual scan scenarios including undersampling and system\nimperfections, which substantially reduces computational time and allows for\ndirect error estimation and efficient sequence optimization. By constraining\nthe total number of tissues present in a brain phantom, MRF signals from highly\nundersampled scans can be simulated as the product of the spatial response\nfunctions based on sampling patterns and sequence-dependent temporal functions.\nDuring optimization, the spatial response function is independent of sequence\ndesign and does not need to be recalculated. We evaluate the performance and\ncomputational speed of the proposed approach by simulations and in vivo\nexperiments. We also demonstrate the power of applying the simulator in MRF\nsequence optimization. The simulation results from the proposed method closely\napproximate the signals and MRF maps from in vivo scans, with 158 times shorter\nprocessing time than the conventional simulation method using Non-uniform\nFourier transform. Incorporating the proposed simulator in the MRF optimization\nframework makes direct estimation of undersampling errors during the\noptimization process feasible, and provide optimized MRF sequences that are\nrobust against undersampling factors and system inhomogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 01:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

We analyze the conversations at the individual, dyad, and group level.\nAt the individual level, we find that toxicity is spread across many low to\nmoderately toxic users. At the dyad level, we observe that toxic replies are\nmore likely to come from users who do not have any social connection nor share\nmany common friends with the poster. At the group level, we find that toxic\nconversations tend to have larger, wider, and deeper reply trees, but sparser\nfollow graphs. To test the predictive power of the conversational structure, we\nconsider two prediction tasks. In the first prediction task, we demonstrate\nthat the structural features can be used to predict whether the conversation\nwill become toxic as early as the first ten replies. In the second prediction\ntask, we show that the structural characteristics of the conversation are also\npredictive of whether the next reply posted by a specific user will be toxic or\nnot. We observe that the structural and linguistic characteristics of the\nconversations are complementary in both prediction tasks. Our findings inform\nthe design of healthier social media platforms and demonstrate that models\nbased on the structural characteristics of conversations can be used to detect\nearly signs of toxicity and potentially steer conversations in a less toxic\ndirection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 01:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Therefore AUV paths which sample\nsparsely, yet effectively, the survey areas are necessary. Broad scale acoustic\nbathymetric data is ready available over large areas, and often is a useful\nprior of seafloor cover. As such, prior bathymetry can be used to guide AUV\ndata collection. This research proposes methods for planning initial AUV\nsurveys that efficiently explore a feature space representation of the\nbathymetry, in order to sample from a diverse set of bathymetric terrain. This\nwill enable the AUV to visit areas that likely contain unique habitats and are\nrepresentative of the entire survey site.

In this work, we close\nthis gap, and propose a computational light transport imaging method that\ncaptures the spatially- and temporally-resolved complete polarimetric response\nof a scene. Our method hinges on a 7D tensor theory of light transport. We\ndiscover low-rank structure in the polarimetric tensor dimension and propose a\ndata-driven rotating ellipsometry method that learns to exploit redundancy of\npolarimetric structure. We instantiate our theory with two prototypes:\nspatio-polarimetric imaging and coaxial temporal-polarimetric imaging. This\nallows us, for the first time, to decompose scene light transport into\ntemporal, spatial, and complete polarimetric dimensions that unveil scene\nproperties hidden to conventional methods. We validate the applicability of our\nmethod on diverse tasks, including shape reconstruction with subsurface\nscattering, seeing through scattering media, untangling multi-bounce light\ntransport, breaking metamerism, and decomposition of crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 02:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Two different phase spaces are considered. One, which\nseems to reflect what previous workers have done (it leads to the usual\nformulas for the Ashtekar-Streubel fluxes), is mathematically simpler, but this\nhas unwanted degrees of freedom and is difficult to interpret physically. The\nsecond is a quotient of the first; it is better justified (at least in terms of\ndegrees of freedom), and plausibly decouples the radiative angular momentum\nfrom internal modes (at least for systems which ultimately become stationary).\nThe symplectic form for this quotient, and the corresponding angular momentum\nflux, involve highly non-local correlations. Both phase spaces are shown to\nhave Poisson brackets implementing the BMS algebra.

While continuous opinion evolution independent of discrete choice\nbehavior has been extensively studied, few works unveil how the group binary\ndecision-making result is determined by the coupled dynamics of these two\nprocesses. To this end, we propose an agent-based model to study the collective\nbehaviors of individual binary decision-making process through competitive\nopinion dynamics on social networks. Three key factors are considered: bounded\nconfidence that describes the cognitive scope of the population, stubbornness\nlevel that characterizes the opinion updating speed, and the opinion strength\nthat represents the asymmetry power or attractiveness of the two choices. We\nfind that bounded confidence plays an important role in determining competing\nevolution results. As bounded confidence grows, population opinions experience\npolarization to consensus, leading to the emergence of phase transition from\nco-existence to winner-takes-all state under binary decisions. Of particular\ninterest, we show how the combined effects of bounded confidence and asymmetry\nopinion strength may reverse the initial supportive advantage in competitive\ndynamics. Notably, our model qualitatively reproduces the important dynamical\npattern during a brutal competition, namely, cascading collapse, as observed by\nreal data. Finally and intriguingly, we find that individual cognitive\nheterogeneity can bring about randomness and unpredictability in binary\ndecision-making process, leading to the emergence of indeterministic\noscillation. Our results reveal how the diverse behavioral patterns of binary\ndecision-making can be interpreted by the complicated interactions of the\nproposed elements, which provides important insights toward competitive\ndynamics\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 02:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

The relation\nbetween the rest-frame X-ray luminosity and other quasar parameters, such as\nthe bolometric luminosity, UV luminosity, or SMBH mass, show large scatters.\nThese large scatters can be attributed to the narrow luminosity range at the\nhighest redshift, the large measurement error based on relatively poor X-ray\ndata, and the inclusion of radio-loud quasars in the sample. The $L_{\\rm\nX}-L_{\\rm UV}$ relationship is significantly sub-linear.

In Boosting-GNN, higher weights are set for the training\nsamples that are not correctly classified by the previous classifier, thus\nachieving higher classification accuracy and better reliability. Besides,\ntransfer learning is used to reduce computational cost and increase fitting\nability. Experimental results indicate that the proposed Boosting-GNN model\nachieves better performance than GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, SGC, N-GCN, and most\nadvanced reweighting and resampling methods on synthetic imbalanced datasets,\nwith an average performance improvement of 4.5%\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 02:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 01:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Our prior studies showed\nthat the paramagnetic molecules can produce strong antiferromagnetic coupling\nwith FM electrodes. The device properties of MTJMSD depend upon various factors\nsuch as anisotropy, spin fluctuation, thermal energy, etc. In this paper, we\nreport a theoretical Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) study to explain the impact\nof anisotropy on the MTJMSD equilibrium properties. We studied the energy\nvariation of the MTJMSD system with time as a function of FM electrode\nanisotropy. Experimentally designed FM electrodes of MTJMSD contain\nmulti-layers of different ferromagnetic materials. These materials possess\nin-plane and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy characteristics. To understand\nthe competing effect of in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy, we have\ncomputationally applied anisotropies on the left FM electrode.

As a result, the\napplied anisotropy along the X-direction (\\mathbit{A}_{\\mathbit{Lx}}) and\nY-direction (\\mathbit{A}_{\\mathbit{Ly}}) represent out-of-plane and in-plane\nanisotropy, respectively.

In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal\nconversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose\nRate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,\nenabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN.

It is based on the repeated\napplication of the same interaction pulse in two manners: with the same phase\nof each subsequent pulse, and with an alternating phase shift of $\\pi$ (i.e. a\nminus sign) from pulse to pulse. Two specific types of pulses are considered: a\nresonant $\\pi$ pulse and an adiabatic chirped pulse, both of which produce\ncomplete population inversion with high fidelity. In the presence of a weak\nambient external electric or magnetic field, the ensuing Stark or Zeeman shift\nleads to an energy level shift and hence a static detuning. In both the\nresonant and adiabatic approaches, a small level shift does not alter the\ntransition probability very much; however, it can significantly change the\ndynamical phases in the propagator. The repeated application of the same pulse\ngreatly amplifies the changes in the dynamical phases and maps them onto the\npopulations. Hence the effect of the level shift can be measured with good\naccuracy. It is found that sequences of pulses with alternating phases deliver\nmuch greater error amplification and much steeper excitation profiles around\nresonance, thereby providing much higher sensitivity to small energy level\nshifts. Explicit analytic estimates of the sensitivity are derived using the\nwell-known non-crossing Rosen-Zener and Rabi models and the level-crossing\nDemkov-Kunike model. This recipe provides a simple tool for rapid and accurate\nsensing of weak electric and magnetic fields by using the same pulse generating\nan inversion quantum gate, without sophisticated tomography or entangling\noperations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 04:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

We examine the\ndynamics of the cylinder for a wide range of reduced velocities ($U^*$), mass\nratios ($m^*$), and Reynolds numbers ($Re$). Of particular interest is to\nexplore the possibility of flow-induced vibrations in a slender cantilever\ncylinder of aspect ratio $AR=100$ at laminar subcritical $Re$ regime (i.e., no\nperiodic vortex shedding). We assess the extent to which such a flexible\ncylindrical beam can sustain flow-induced vibrations and characterize the\ncontribution of the beam's flexibility to the stability of the wake at low\n$Re$. We show that when certain conditions are satisfied, the flexible\ncantilever cylinder undergoes sustained large-amplitude vibrations. The\nfrequency of the oscillations is found to match the frequency of the periodic\nfluid forces for a particular range of system parameters. In this range, the\nfrequency of the transverse vibrations is shown to match the first-mode natural\nfrequency of the cylinder, indicating the existence of the lock-in phenomenon.\nThe range of the lock-in regime is shown to have a strong dependence on $Re$\nand $m^*$. We discover that unlike the steady wake behind a stationary rigid\ncylinder, the wake of a low mass ratio flexible cantilever cylinder could lose\nits stability in the lock-in regime at Reynolds numbers as low as $Re=22$. A\ncombined VIV-galloping type instability is shown to be the possible cause of\nthe wake instability at this $Re$ regime.

A particularly important laboratory\nrealization of such an active fluid is a system composed of microtubules,\naligned in a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nematic phase, and driven by ATP-fueled\nkinesin motor proteins. This system exhibits robust chaotic advection and gives\nrise to a pronounced fractal structure in the nematic contours. We characterize\nsuch experimentally derived fractals using the power spectrum and discover that\nthe power spectrum decays as $k^{-\\beta}$ for large wavenumbers $k$. The\nparameter $\\beta$ is measured for several experimental realizations. Though\n$\\beta$ is effectively constant in time, it does vary with experimental\nparameters, indicating differences in the scale-free behavior of the\nmicrotubule-based active nematic. Though the fractal patterns generated in this\nactive system are reminiscent of passively advected dye in 2D chaotic flows,\nthe underlying mechanism for fractal generation is more subtle.

A natural question arises: what is the upper limit of the decaying rate\nw.r.t. frequency when one trains a DNN? In this work, our theory, confirmed by\nnumerical experiments, suggests that there is a critical decaying rate w.r.t.\nfrequency in DNN training. Below the upper limit of the decaying rate, the DNN\ninterpolates the training data by a function with a certain regularity.\nHowever, above the upper limit, the DNN interpolates the training data by a\ntrivial function, i.e., a function is only non-zero at training data points.\nOur results indicate a better way to overcome the high-frequency curse is to\ndesign a proper pre-condition approach to shift high-frequency information to\nlow-frequency one, which coincides with several previous developed algorithms\nfor fast learning high-frequency information.

In this work, we investigate\nwhether this theory's negative branch can also provide a different feature of\nthe ultra-compact object compared to those obtained from the GR-TOV equation.\nWe study ultra-compact objects with an isotropically ideal fluid matter where\nwe use a simple but physically motivated equation of state $\\rho=p/w+\\rho_0$\nwith $w$=1 and $w$=1/3. In general, we obtain that the range of $l_p$ is very\nrestricted and must not be equal to $r_c$. Here $r_c$ is the starting point of\nintegration located at the center of the star. While $l_p$ should be set to be\nmuch larger than Planck length $L_\\text{Pl}$. Consequently, the mass-radius\ncurves for the various value of $l_p$ for both $w$ cases are still\nindistinguishable from the standard GR-TOV results. Hence from the negative\nbranch of $p'(r)$, the additional free parameter $l_p$ does not provide a\nsignificant effect compared to the standard GR-TOV equation results, even\nthough $l_p$ is not in the limit of $l_p\\to0$ anymore. Therefore, similar to\nthe conclusion in Ref. [3] with GR theory that the ultra-compact objects from\nnegative branch of semi-classical gravity with a linear equation of state are\nunable to generate demanding gravitational echoes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 06:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

The charging efficiency is limited by the\nmoving speed of ground chargers and rough environments, especially in\nlarge-scale scenarios or challenging scenarios such as separate islands. To\naddress the limitations, some researchers consider replacing ground mobile\nchargers with lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support extremely\nlarge-scale scenarios, because of the UAV moving at higher speed without\ngeographical limitation. Moreover, multiple automatic landing wireless charging\nPADs are deployed in the network to recharge UAVs automatically.

In this paper, we introduce the Stereo\nBird's Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for\nestimation of bird's eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our\nnetwork reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth\nestimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good\ninternal bird's eye view feature representation is effective for layout\nestimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using\nthe features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird's eye view\ncoordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene\nstructure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input\nimages and their features to the bird's eye view.

The specific functionality selection\nof each of the two HF circuit designs is enabled mainly by the inherent\nambipolar feature at a device level. Furthermore, at a circuit level the\nmatching networks are the same regardless the operation mode. In-phase and\ninverting amplification are enabled in the PCA by switching the gate-to-source\nvoltage (VGS) from -0.3 V to 0.9 V while the drain-to-source voltage (VDS)\nremains at 3 V. By designing carefully the matching and stability networks,\npower gains of 4.5 dB and 6.7 dB at 2.4 GHz for the in-phase and inverting\noperation mode have been achieved, respectively. The FCA, in its frequency\ndoubler operation mode, exhibits 20 dBc of fundamental-harmonic suppression at\n2.4 GHz when an input signal at 1.2 GHz is considered. This frequency doubler\nfunctionality is enabled at VGS=0.3 V, whereas at VGS=0.9 V amplification of\n4.5 dB is obtained while VDS remains at 3 V in both cases.

This paper aims at studying randomized synchronous\ndistributed computing through the lens of algebraic topology. We do so by\nstudying the wide class of (input-free) symmetry-breaking tasks, e.g., leader\nelection, in synchronous fault-free anonymous systems. We show that it is\npossible to redefine solvability of a task \"locally\", i.e., for each simplex of\nthe protocol complex individually, without requiring any global consistency.\nHowever, this approach has a drawback: it eliminates the topological aspect of\nthe computation, since a single facet has a trivial topological structure. To\novercome this issue, we introduce a \"projection\" $\\pi$ of both protocol and\noutput complexes, where every simplex $\\sigma$ is mapped to a complex\n$\\pi(\\sigma)$; the later has a rich structure that replaces the structure we\nlost by considering one single facet at a time.\n  To show the significance and applicability of our topological approach, we\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions for solving leader election in\nsynchronous fault-free anonymous shared-memory and message-passing models. In\nboth models, we consider scenarios in which there might be correlations between\nthe random values provided to the nodes. In particular, different parties might\nhave access to the same randomness source so their randomness is not\nindependent but equal. Interestingly, we find that solvability of leader\nelection relates to the number of parties that possess correlated randomness,\neither directly or via their greatest common divisor, depending on the specific\ncommunication model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Autoencoder (AE) models have been widely\nused in image compression, but few AE-based compression approaches support\nerror-bounding features, which are highly required by scientific applications.\nTo address this issue, we explore using convolutional autoencoders to improve\nerror-bounded lossy compression for scientific data, with the following three\nkey contributions.

We analyze the temporal evolution of\nfloc size and shape due to aggregation, breakage, and deformation. Larger\nturbulent shear and weaker cohesive forces yield elongated flocs that are\nsmaller in size. Flocculation proceeds most rapidly when the fluid and particle\ntime scales are balanced and a suitably defined Stokes number is \\textit{O}(1).\nDuring the transient stage, cohesive forces of intermediate strength produce\nflocs of the largest size, as they are strong enough to cause aggregation, but\nnot so strong as to pull the floc into a compact shape. Small Stokes numbers\nand weak turbulence delay the onset of the equilibrium stage. During\nequilibrium, stronger cohesive forces yield flocs of larger size.

The latter exploits a diagrammatic decomposition, which\nclassifies the contributions to the full scattering amplitude in terms of their\nreducibility with respect to cutting one interaction line, naturally\ndistinguishing the processes mediated by the exchange of a single boson in the\ndifferent channels. We apply this idea to the fRG by splitting the one-loop fRG\nflow equations for the vertex function into SBE contributions and a residual\nfour-point fermionic vertex. Similarly as in the case of parquet solvers,\nrecasting the fRG algorithm in the SBE representation offers both computational\nand interpretative advantages: the SBE decomposition not only significantly\nreduces the numerical effort of treating the high-frequency asymptotics of the\nflowing vertices, but it also allows for a clear physical identification of the\ncollective degrees of freedom at play.

Taking a stripe-patterned metasurface as an example, we\ndemonstrate the generation of broadband terahertz waves with tunable chirality.\nBased on experimental and theoretical studies, the interplay between the\nlaser-induced spintronic-origin currents and the metasurface-induced transient\ncharges/currents are investigated, revealing the strong influence on the device\nfunctionality originated from both the light-matter interactions in individual\nmetasurface units and the dynamic coupling between them. Our work not only\noffers a flexible, reliable and cost-effective solution for chiral terahertz\nwave generation and manipulation, but also opens a new pathway to\nmetasurface-tailored spintronic devices for efficient vector-control of\nelectromagnetic waves in the terahertz regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 09:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Composite\nrequirements are specified as collections of elementary ones. Two\nrequirements-driven test generation strategies are introduced, and their fault\ncoverage guarantees are proven. The first is exhaustive in the sense that it\nproduces test suites guaranteeing requirements satisfaction if the test suite\nis passed.

Both long waiting\ntimes and uncertain travel times has driven many people to acquire their own\nvehicle or use alternative modes of transport. This has significantly increased\nthe number of vehicles on the roads leading to even more traffic and greater\ntraffic congestion. This paper investigates urban travel demand in Lagos and\nexplores passenger dynamics in time and space. Using individual commuter trip\ndata from tickets purchased from the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the\ndemand patterns through the hours of the day, days of the week and bus stations\nare analysed. This study aims to quantify demand from actual passenger trips\nand estimate the impact that dynamic scheduling could have on passenger waiting\ntimes.

In contrast to conventional spin-singlet superconductivity,\nspin-triplet superconductivity possesses spin and angular momentum degrees of\nfreedom. To detect these degrees of freedom and obtain the solid evidence of\nspin-triplet superconductivity in UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR\nmeasurement. We previously reported that the shoulder signal appears in NMR\nspectra below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ in $H\n\\parallel b$, and that a slight decrease in the Knight shift along the $b$ and\n$c$ axes ($K_b$ and $K_c$, respectively) below $T_{\\rm c}$ at a low magnetic\nfield $H$. To clarify the origin of the shoulder signal and the trace of the\ndecrease in $K_b$, we compared the $^{125}$Te-NMR spectra obtained when\n$H~\\parallel~b$ and $H~\\parallel~c$ and measured the $^{125}$Te-NMR spectra for\n$H~\\parallel~b$ up to 14.5~T.

Moreover,\nthe decrease in $K_b$ in the SC state starts to be small around 7~T and almost\nzero at 12.5~T. This indicates that the SC spin state gradually changes with\nthe application of $H$.

Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and\nmaintains high performance despite failures. Narwhal is designed to easily\nscale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and we demonstrate that\nthere is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can achieve. Composing\nNarwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (Narwhal-HotStuff)\nyields significantly better throughput even in the presence of faults or\nintermittent loss of liveness due to asynchrony. However, loss of liveness can\nresult in higher latency. To achieve overall good performance when faults occur\nwe design Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol, to\nwork with Narwhal. We demonstrate its high performance under a variety of\nconfigurations and faults. As a summary of results, on a WAN, Narwhal-Hotstuff\nachieves over 130,000 tx/sec at less than 2-sec latency compared with 1,800\ntx/sec at 1-sec latency for Hotstuff. Additional workers increase throughput\nlinearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any latency increase. Tusk achieves 160,000\ntx/sec with about 3 seconds latency. Under faults, both protocols maintain high\nthroughput, but Narwhal-HotStuff suffers from increased latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 10:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 12:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 16:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 09:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

The distribution of the\nrelative coordinate $y$ indeed reaches a steady state that we characterize in\nterms of the solution of a second-order differential equation. We obtain the\nexplicit formula for the stationary probability $P(y)$ of $y$ for two examples\nof interaction potential $V(y)$. The first one corresponds to $V(y) \\sim |y|$.\nIn this case, for $D=0$ we find that $P(y)$ contains a delta function part at\n$y=0$, signaling a strong clustering effect, together with a smooth exponential\ncomponent.

We reduce this to\n$O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ with a method that requires only a constant number of\ngradient and function computations per iteration; and thus, we obtain for the\nfirst time a multi-objective descent-type method with a query complexity cost\nthat is unaffected by increasing values of $m$.

Yet, bulk\nmaterials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology\nremain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic --\ntopological surface states -- proved challenging due to a dominant contribution\nfrom the superconducting bulk. Reported here is a highly anomalous behaviour of\nsurface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi\nwhere the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, which\nitself is a consequence of the non-symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong\nspin-orbit coupling.

The\nenhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the\ncritical field of surface superconductivity Hc3. Using theoretical modelling,\nwe show that the anomalous screening is consistent with modification of surface\nsuperconductivity due to the presence of topological surface states.

Among them, a UAV\ncan be employed as a relay in a \"store-carry and forward\" fashion by uploading\ndata from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a\ncentral unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone\nto potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless\nnetworks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to\nUAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it\nis mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this paper, we\ninvestigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over\ndoubly-selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the\nsignals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both\ntime dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion\ncaused by their mobility.

The educated\nnature of material fingerprints has led to the conception of analogical\nmaterials discovery that facilitates inverse exploration of promising\nperovskites based on similarity investigation with known materials. The search\nspace of unstudied perovskites is screened from ~600,000 feasible compounds\nusing experimental data powered ML models and automated web mining tools at a\n94% success rate. This concept further provides insights on possible phase\ntransitions and computational modelling of complex compositions. The proposed\nquantitative analysis of materials analogies is expected to bridge the gap\nbetween the existing materials literature and the undiscovered terrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 12:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

To this end, we\nstudy the $\\textrm{CF}_{<:}$ calculus, a conservative and lightweight extension\nof $\\textrm{System F}_{<:}$, to track how values and their references can be\ncaptured and escape. We show that existing terms in $\\textrm{System F}_{<:}$\nembed naturally in our calculus, and that many natural problems can be\nexpressed in a system that tracks variable references like we do in\n$\\textrm{CF}_{<:}$. We also give mechanized proofs of the soundness properties\nof $\\textrm{CF}_{<:}$ in Coq. The type system presented in $\\textrm{CF}_{<:}$\nis powerful enough to reason about safety in the context of many natural\nextensions of $\\textrm{CF}_{<:}$ such as region-based memory-management,\nnon-local returns, and effect handlers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 13:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

These fluctuations are from the tails of the\nprobability distribution of species concentrations. They render a coexistence\nof three populations unstable even if the coexistence is stable in the\ndeterministic limit. We determine the mean time to extinction (MTE) by using a\nWKB-ansatz in the master equation that represents the stochastic description of\nthis model. This way, the calculation is reduced to a problem of classical\nmechanics and amounts to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with zero-energy\nHamiltonian. We solve the corresponding Hamilton's equations of motion in\nsix-dimensional phase space numerically by using the Iterative Action\nMinimization Method. This allows to project on the optimal path to extinction,\nstarting from a parameter choice where the three-species coexistence-fixed\npoint undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and becomes stable. Specifically for our\nsystem of three species, extinction events can be triggered along various paths\nto extinction, differing in their intermediate steps. We compare our analytical\npredictions with results from Gillespie simulations for two-species\nextinctions, complemented by an analytical calculation of the MTE in which the\nremaining third species goes extinct. From Gillespie simulations we also\nanalyze how the distributions of times to extinction change upon varying the\nbifurcation parameter. Even within the same model and the same dynamical\nregime, the MTE depends on the distance from the bifurcation point in a way\nthat contains the system size dependence in the exponent. It is challenging and\nworthwhile to quantify how rare the rare events of extinction are.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 13:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

We propose a sparsity-driven latent space\nsampling (SDLSS) framework and develop a proximal meta-learning (PML) algorithm\nto enforce sparsity in the latent space. SDLSS allows the range-space of the\ngenerator to be considered as a union-of-submanifolds. We also derive the\nsample complexity bounds within the SDLSS framework for the linear measurement\nmodel.

A CR scheme takes a fractional point $x$ in a relaxation\npolytope, rounds each coordinate $x_i$ independently to get a possibly\nnon-feasible set, and then drops some elements in order to satisfy the\nconstraints. Intuitively, a contention resolution scheme is $c$-balanced if\nevery element $i$ is selected with probability at least $c \\cdot x_i$.\n  It is known that general matroids admit a $(1-1/e)$-balanced CR scheme, and\nthat this is (asymptotically) optimal. This is in particular true for the\nspecial case of uniform matroids of rank one. In this work, we provide a simple\nand explicit monotone CR scheme for uniform matroids of rank $k$ on $n$\nelements with a balancedness of $1 -\n\\binom{n}{k}\\:\\left(1-\\frac{k}{n}\\right)^{n+1-k}\\:\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)^k$,\nand show that this is optimal. As $n$ grows, this expression converges from\nabove to $1 - e^{-k}k^k/k!$. While this asymptotic bound can be obtained by\ncombining previously known results, these require defining an exponential-sized\nlinear program, as well as using random sampling and the ellipsoid algorithm.\nOur procedure, on the other hand, has the advantage of being simple and\nexplicit.

Our first contribution is a proof of the NP-completeness of the\nminimisation of transition-based Rabin automata. Our second contribution\nconcerns the memory requirements of games over graphs using Muller conditions.\nA memory structure is a finite state machine that implements a strategy and is\nupdated after reading the edges of the game; the special case of chromatic\nmemories being those structures whose update function only consider the colours\nof the edges. We prove that the minimal amount of chromatic memory required in\ngames using a given Muller condition is exactly the size of a minimal Rabin\nautomaton recognising this condition. Combining these two results, we deduce\nthat finding the chromatic memory requirements of a Muller condition is\nNP-complete. This characterisation also allows us to prove that chromatic\nmemories cannot be optimal in general, disproving a conjecture by Kopczy\\'nski.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 15:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 17:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Suppression of the\ncavity resonance drift can be achieved using precision interrogation of the\ncavity temperature through the dual-mode optical thermometry. This approach\nenables measurement of the cavity temperature change by detecting the resonance\ndifference shift between two polarization or optical frequency modes.

While there is profound\nknowledge base regarding the sedimentation of rigid solid particles, the\nfundamental principles of sedimentation dynamics of elastic, nonheavy spheres\nin bounded fluids are not well understood. Therefore, we performed\nsedimentation of deformable, elastic solid spheres with particle Reynolds\nnumbers much smaller than 1 in a model experiment. The spheres started from\nrest in a rectangular duct with a width of about 23 times the radius R of the\nsphere. The particle dynamics of elastic spheres differed fundamentally from\nthat of rigid spheres. Elastic effects were found to take place on\ncomparatively large time scales, such that elastic spheres underwent four\nphases of sedimentation. Phases I and II, including transient acceleration and\na short steady velocity plateau, are comparable with sedimentation of rigid\nspheres. From a characteristic onset position of about 10R, deformability\neffects kick in and a second acceleration appears (phase III). In the fourth\nphase, the deformable spheres reach the terminal sedimentation velocity. The\nsofter the spheres are, the higher the terminal velocity is. In the present\nsetup, a terminal velocity up to 9 percent higher than the velocity for\ncomparable rigid spheres was reached.

Keeping the\nbalance between freedom of speech and respecting each other dignity is a major\nconcern of social media platform regulators. Although, automatic detection of\noffensive content using deep learning approaches seems to provide encouraging\nresults, training deep learning-based models requires large amounts of\nhigh-quality labeled data, which is often missing. In this regard, we present\nin this paper a new deep learning-based method that fuses a Back Translation\nmethod, and a Paraphrasing technique for data augmentation. Our pipeline\ninvestigates different word-embedding-based architectures for classification of\nhate speech. The back translation technique relies on an encoder-decoder\narchitecture pre-trained on a large corpus and mostly used for machine\ntranslation. In addition, paraphrasing exploits the transformer model and the\nmixture of experts to generate diverse paraphrases. Finally, LSTM, and CNN are\ncompared to seek enhanced classification results. We evaluate our proposal on\nfive publicly available datasets; namely, AskFm corpus, Formspring dataset,\nWarner and Waseem dataset, Olid, and Wikipedia toxic comments dataset. The\nperformance of the proposal together with comparison to some related\nstate-of-art results demonstrate the effectiveness and soundness of our\nproposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 09:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

MedWriter\nfirst employs the Visual-Language Retrieval~(VLR) module to retrieve the most\nrelevant reports for the given images. To guarantee the logical coherence\nbetween sentences, the Language-Language Retrieval~(LLR) module is introduced\nto retrieve relevant sentences based on the previous generated description. At\nlast, a language decoder fuses image features and features from retrieved\nreports and sentences to generate meaningful medical reports.

This calls for new few-shot\nlearning techniques that are able to capture task relations from only a few\nexamples and jointly learn multiple tasks. To achieve this, we propose a\nsimilarity-based few-shot learning scheme, named Contrastive Prototype Merging\nnetwork (ConProm), that learns to bridge metric spaces of intent and slot on\ndata-rich domains, and then adapt the bridged metric space to the specific\nfew-shot domain.

There is hardly\nresearch where system evolution is described on the base of information flows\nin the system. The paper focuses on the link between the dynamics of\ninformation and system evolution. Information, exchanged between different\nsystem's parts, before being processed is first provided with meaning by the\nsystem. Meanings are generated from the perspective of hindsight, i.e. against\nthe arrow of time. The same information can be differently interpreted by\ndifferent system's parts (i,e,provided with different meanings) so that the\nnumber of options for possible system development is proliferated. Some options\neventually turn into observable system states. So that system evolutionary\ndynamics can be considered as due to information processing within the system.\nThis process is considered here in a model representation. The model under\nstudy is Triple Helix (TH) model, which was earlier used to describe\ninteractions between university, industry and government to foster innovations.\nIn TH model the system is comprised of three interacting parts where each part\nprocess information ina different way. The model is not limited to the sphere\nof innovation and can be used in a broader perspective. Here TH is\nconceptualized in the framework of three compertment model used to describe\ninfectious disease.
