By\nassuming that the wave action and vorticity are confined to infinitesimally\nsmall, widely separated regions of the flow, we obtain model equations that are\nanalogous to, but significantly more general than, the familiar system\nconsisting solely of point vortices. We analyze stable and unstable harmonic\nsolutions, solutions in which wave packets eventually coincide with point\nvortices (violating our assumptions), and solutions in which the wave vector\neventually blows up. Additionally, we show that a wave packet induces a net\ndrift on a passive vortex in the direction of wave propagation which is\nequivalent to Darwin drift. Generalizing our analysis to many wave packets and\nvortices, we examine the influence of wave packets on an otherwise unstable\nvortex street and show analytically, according to linear stability analysis,\nthat the wave packet induced drift can stabilize the vortex street.

However, significant miss rates for polyps have been reported,\nparticularly when there are multiple small adenomas. This presents an\nopportunity to leverage computer-aided systems to support clinicians and reduce\nthe number of polyps missed.\n  Method: In this work we introduce the Focus U-Net, a novel dual\nattention-gated deep neural network, which combines efficient spatial and\nchannel-based attention into a single Focus Gate module to encourage selective\nlearning of polyp features. The Focus U-Net further incorporates short-range\nskip connections and deep supervision. Furthermore, we introduce the Hybrid\nFocal loss, a new compound loss function based on the Focal loss and Focal\nTversky loss, to handle class-imbalanced image segmentation. For our\nexperiments, we selected five public datasets containing images of polyps\nobtained during optical colonoscopy: CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB,\nETIS-Larib PolypDB and EndoScene test set. To evaluate model performance, we\nuse the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU)\nmetrics.\n  Results: Our model achieves state-of-the-art results for both CVC-ClinicDB\nand Kvasir-SEG, with a mean DSC of 0.941 and 0.910, respectively.

Furthermore, a challenging task is to preserve\nhyperbolicity of the gPC moment system. An intrusive method which guarantees\nhyperbolicity is the intrusive polynomial moment (IPM) method, which performs\nthe gPC expansion on the entropy variables. The method, while still being\nsubject to oscillations, requires solving a convex optimization problem in\nevery spatial cell and every time step. The aim of this work is to mitigate\noscillations in the IPM solution by applying filters. Filters reduce\noscillations by damping high order gPC coefficients. Naive filtering, however,\nmay lead to unrealizable moments, which means that the IPM optimization problem\ndoes not have a solution and the method breaks down. In this paper, we propose\nand analyze two separate strategies to guarantee the existence of a solution to\nthe IPM problem. First, we propose a filter which maintains realizability by\nbeing constructed from an underlying Fokker-Planck equation. Second, we\nregularize the IPM optimization problem to be able to cope with non-realizable\ngPC coefficients. Consequently, standard filters can be applied to the\nregularized IPM method. We demonstrate numerical results for the two strategies\nby investigating the Euler equations with uncertain shock structures in one-\nand two-dimensional spatial settings.

The mixed wettability was implemented in the\nmodels by allowing each tube or link to have a different wetting angle chosen\nrandomly from a given distribution. Both models showed that mixed wettability\ncan have significant influence on the rheology in terms of the dependence of\nthe global volumetric flow rate on the global pressure drop. In the capillary\nfiber bundle model, for small pressure drops when only a small fraction of the\ntubes were open, it was found that the volumetric flow rate depended on the\nexcess pressure drop as a power law with an exponent equal to 3/2 or 2\ndepending on the minimum pressure drop necessary for flow. When all the tubes\nwere open due to a high pressure drop, the volumetric flow rate depended\nlinearly on the pressure drop, independent of the wettability. In the\ntransition region in between where most of the tubes opened, the volumetric\nflow depended more sensitively on the wetting angle distribution function and\nwas in general not a simple power law. The dynamic pore network model results\nalso showed a linear dependence of the flow rate on the pressure drop when the\npressure drop is large. However, out of this limit the dynamic pore network\nmodel demonstrated a more complicated behaviour that depended on the mixed\nwettability condition and the saturation. In particular, the exponent relating\nvolumetric flow rate to the excess pressure drop could take on values anywhere\nbetween 1.0 and 1.8. The values of the exponent were highest for saturations\napproaching 0.5, also, the exponent generally increased when the difference in\nwettability of the two fluids were larger and when this difference was present\nfor a larger fraction of the porous network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 18:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 11:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

We\ncompute the mass dispersion relations for those fields with and without a\ndilaton coupling. It leads to new results for the band gap structure of these\nfields. In the case of the Kalb-Ramond field, and with the correct dispersion\nrelation, there is no gap between the mass bands. Also, always that the field\nis coupled with the dilaton, its first mass mode decreases. When the\ngeneralization to the $q-$form is done, we show that it is not possible to\nsuppress or generate mass for the fields by controlling the dilaton coupling,\ndifferently of what was argued previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 19:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 12:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

To effectively and safely deploy these systems, their\ndecision-making must be understandable to a wide range of stakeholders. Methods\nto explain AI have been proposed to answer this challenge, but a lack of theory\nimpedes the development of systematic abstractions which are necessary for\ncumulative knowledge gains. We propose Bayesian Teaching as a framework for\nunifying explainable AI (XAI) by integrating machine learning and human\nlearning. Bayesian Teaching formalizes explanation as a communication act of an\nexplainer to shift the beliefs of an explainee. This formalization decomposes\nany XAI method into four components: (1) the inference to be explained, (2) the\nexplanatory medium, (3) the explainee model, and (4) the explainer model. The\nabstraction afforded by Bayesian Teaching to decompose any XAI method\nelucidates the invariances among them. The decomposition of XAI systems enables\nmodular validation, as each of the first three components listed can be tested\nsemi-independently. This decomposition also promotes generalization through\nrecombination of components from different XAI systems, which facilitates the\ngeneration of novel variants. These new variants need not be evaluated one by\none provided that each component has been validated, leading to an exponential\ndecrease in development time. Finally, by making the goal of explanation\nexplicit, Bayesian Teaching helps developers to assess how suitable an XAI\nsystem is for its intended real-world use case. Thus, Bayesian Teaching\nprovides a theoretical framework that encourages systematic, scientific\ninvestigation of XAI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 20:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 18:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

However, data samples are not always accessible in many cases\ndue to large data sizes, privacy, or confidentiality. Many efforts have been\nmade on addressing this problem for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose\ninputs lie in a grid domain within a continuous space such as images and\nvideos, but largely overlook graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid\ndata with different topology structures within a discrete space. The inherent\ndifferences between their inputs make these CNN-based approaches not applicable\nto GNNs. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated\napproach to distilling knowledge from a GNN without graph data. The proposed\ngraph-free KD (GFKD) learns graph topology structures for knowledge transfer by\nmodeling them with multivariate Bernoulli distribution. We then introduce a\ngradient estimator to optimize this framework. Essentially, the gradients\nw.r.t. graph structures are obtained by only using GNN forward-propagation\nwithout back-propagation, which means that GFKD is compatible with modern GNN\nlibraries such as DGL and Geometric. Moreover, we provide the strategies for\nhandling different types of prior knowledge in the graph data or the GNNs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that GFKD achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance for distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 21:38:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 03:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Its\nrationale was simple: to curb the spread of misinformation by harming the\nadvertising revenue of sources that produce this type of content. Like its\ninternational counterparts, Sleeping Giants Brasil (SGB) campaigned against\nmedia outlets using Twitter to ask companies to remove ads from the targeted\noutlets. This work presents a thorough quantitative characterization of this\nactivism model, analyzing the three campaigns carried out by SGB between May\nand September 2020. To do so, we use digital traces from both Twitter and\nGoogle Trends, toxicity and sentiment classifiers trained for the Portuguese\nlanguage, and an annotated corpus of SGB's tweets. Our key findings were\nthreefold. First, we found that SGB's requests to companies were largely\nsuccessful (with 83.85\\% of all 192 targeted companies responding positively)\nand that user pressure was correlated to the speed of companies' responses.\nSecond, there were no significant changes in the online attention and the user\nengagement going towards the targeted media outlets in the six months that\nfollowed SGB's campaign (as measured by Google Trends and Twitter engagement).\nThird, we observed that user interactions with companies changed only\ntransiently, even if the companies did not respond to SGB's request.

For example, to compute the\nproduct of matrices ${\\bf U, V}$, MatDot codes partition each matrix into $p>1$\nsub-matrices to create smaller coded computation tasks that reduce the\nupload/storage at each server by $1/p$, such that ${\\bf UV}$ can be recovered\nfrom the answers returned by any $R=2p-1$ servers. An important concern in CDMM\nis to reduce the recovery threshold $R$ for a given storage/upload constraint.\nRecently, Jeong et al. introduced Approximate MatDot (AMD) codes that are shown\nto improve the recovery threshold by a factor of nearly $2$, from $2p-1$ to\n$p$. A key observation that motivates our work is that the storage/upload\nrequired for approximate computing depends not only on the dimensions of the\n(coded) sub-matrices that are assigned to each server, but also on their\nprecision levels -- a critical aspect that is not explored by Jeong et al. Our\nmain contribution is a dimensional analysis of AMD codes inspired by the\nGeneralized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) framework previously developed for\nwireless networks, which indicates that for the same upload/storage, once the\nprecision levels of the task assignments are accounted for, AMD codes\nsurprisingly fall short in all aspects to even the trivial replication scheme\nwhich assigns the full computation task to every server.

These sensors are expected to sense reliable information from a\nphysical environment, facilitating the critical decision-making process of the\nAVs. Ultrasonic sensors, which detect obstacles in a short distance, play an\nimportant role in assisted parking and blind spot detection events. However,\ndue to their weak security level, ultrasonic sensors are particularly\nvulnerable to signal injection attacks, when the attackers inject malicious\nacoustic signals to create fake obstacles and intentionally mislead the\nvehicles to make wrong decisions with disastrous aftermath. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the attack model of signal injection attacks toward\nmoving vehicles. By considering the potential threats, we propose SoundFence, a\nphysical-layer defense system which leverages the sensors' signal processing\ncapability without requiring any additional equipment. SoundFence verifies the\nbenign measurement results and detects signal injection attacks by analyzing\nsensor readings and the physical-layer signatures of ultrasonic signals. Our\nexperiment with commercial sensors shows that SoundFence detects most (more\nthan 95%) of the abnormal sensor readings with very few false alarms, and it\ncan also accurately distinguish the real echo from injected signals to identify\ninjection attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 01:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 18:55:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 18:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

However, extracted user features\ngenerally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant\nto the recommendation purpose. Therefore, excessive reliance on these features\nwill make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. In this\narticle, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (VBAE) for\nrecommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems\nsimultaneously. VBAE first encodes user collaborative and feature information\ninto Gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear\nuser similarities. Moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and\nfeature variables as a virtual communication channel from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to\ndynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature\nembeddings. A quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating\nembeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by\ndisentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic\ninformation. Through this mechanism, VBAE incorporates adequate auxiliary\ninformation from user features if collaborative information is insufficient,\nwhile avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its\ngeneralization ability to new users.

To test these theories, one-hour averages of Parker Solar Probe\ndata were summed over orbits three through seven. It is found that:\n  1. The average switchback rate was independent of distance from the Sun. 2.\nThe average switchback rate increased with solar wind speed. 3.

To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel unsupervised federated face recognition approach\n(FedFR). FedFR improves the performance in the target domain by iteratively\naggregating knowledge from the source domain through federated learning.

Extensive experiments\nand analysis on two newly constructed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness\nof FedFR.

We further propose a novel QA model termed TAGOP, which is\ncapable of reasoning over both tables and text. It adopts sequence tagging to\nextract relevant cells from the table along with relevant spans from the text\nto infer their semantics, and then applies symbolic reasoning over them with a\nset of aggregation operators to arrive at the final answer. TAGOPachieves 58.0%\ninF1, which is an 11.1% absolute increase over the previous best baseline\nmodel, according to our experiments on TAT-QA. But this result still lags far\nbehind performance of expert human, i.e.90.8% in F1. It is demonstrated that\nour TAT-QA is very challenging and can serve as a benchmark for training and\ntesting powerful QA models that address hybrid form data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 06:12:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 05:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

However, because a self-organizing multi-agent system has\nautonomous agents and local interactions between them, it is difficult to\npredict the behavior of the system from the behavior of the local agents we\ndesign. This paper proposes a logic-based framework of self-organizing\nmulti-agent systems, where agents interact with each other by following their\nprescribed local rules. The dependence relation between coalitions of agents\nregarding their contributions to the global behavior of the system is reasoned\nabout from the structural and semantic perspectives.

The scheme adopts a solution of the conduction equation in\neach interval of the chosen discretization that is valid if the fluxes at\ninterval boundaries are constant in time. This piece-wise steady flux (PWSF)\nnumerical scheme is continuous and differentiable in the space domain, which is\nconvenient for implementing the numerical scheme in an energy-conserved thermal\nevolution model of a planetary core in which a conductive stratified layer\ndevelops below the core-mantle boundary when the heat flux is subadiabatic. The\ninfluence of a time-variable stratified region on the general evolution of the\nplanetary body is examined, in comparison to imposing an adiabatic temperature\nprofile for the core. By considering stratification in a planetary core where\nthe heat flux is subadiabatic, radial variations in the cooling rate are\naccounted for whereas otherwise the distribution of energy in the core is fixed\nby the imposed adiabat. During the growth of the thermally stratified region,\nthe deep part of the core cools more rapidly than the outer part of the core.\nTherefore, the inner core grows to a larger size and the temperature and heat\nflux at the core-mantle boundary are higher and larger, respectively, if a\nstratified region is considered. For the Earth, the implications are likely\nvery minor and can be neglected in thermal evolution studies that are not\nspecifically interested in the stratified region itself. For Mercury, these\nimplications are much larger. For example, the age of the inner core can be\nunderestimated by several billion years if thermal stratification is neglected.\nConsideration of thermal stratification in the core of Mercury also increases\nthe mantle temperature, leads to a larger heat flux into the lithosphere, and\nprolongs mantle convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 07:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Various alignment-based, signal-based and content-based approaches are\nreported for the prediction of promoters. However, since all promoter sequences\ndo not show explicit features, the prediction performance of these techniques\nis poor. Therefore, many machine learning and deep learning models have been\nproposed for promoter prediction. In this work, we studied methods for vector\nencoding and promoter classification using genome sequences of three distinct\nhigher eukaryotes viz. yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), A. thaliana (plant)\nand human (Homo sapiens). We compared one-hot vector encoding method with\nfrequency-based tokenization (FBT) for data pre-processing on 1-D Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) model. We found that FBT gives a shorter input dimension\nreducing the training time without affecting the sensitivity and specificity of\nclassification. We employed the deep learning techniques, mainly CNN and\nrecurrent neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and random forest\n(RF) classifier for promoter classification at k-mer sizes of 2, 4 and 8.

Multimodal learning,\nespecially for audiovisual learning, has drawn considerable attention recently,\nwhich can boost the performance of various computer vision tasks. However, in\nvideo summarization, existing approaches just exploit the visual information\nwhile neglect the audio information. In this paper, we argue that the audio\nmodality can assist vision modality to better understand the video content and\nstructure, and further benefit the summarization process. Motivated by this, we\npropose to jointly exploit the audio and visual information for the video\nsummarization task, and develop an AudioVisual Recurrent Network (AVRN) to\nachieve this. Specifically, the proposed AVRN can be separated into three\nparts: 1) the two-stream LSTM is utilized to encode the audio and visual\nfeature sequentially by capturing their temporal dependency. 2) the audiovisual\nfusion LSTM is employed to fuse the two modalities by exploring the latent\nconsistency between them. 3) the self-attention video encoder is adopted to\ncapture the global dependency in the video. Finally, the fused audiovisual\ninformation, and the integrated temporal and global dependencies are jointly\nused to predict the video summary. Practically, the experimental results on the\ntwo benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.,} SumMe and TVsum, have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of each part, and the superiority of AVRN compared to those\napproaches just exploiting visual information for video summarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 08:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

In recent years, although the interpolation performance has achieved\ngreat success, image blur usually occurs at the object boundaries owing to the\nlarge motion.

In this paper, we propose to reduce the image blur and get the clear shape\nof objects by preserving the edges in the interpolated frames. To this end, the\nproposed Edge-Aware Network (EA-Net) integrates the edge information into the\nframe interpolation task. It follows an end-to-end architecture and can be\nseparated into two stages, \\emph{i.e.}, edge-guided flow estimation and\nedge-protected frame synthesis. Specifically, in the flow estimation stage,\nthree edge-aware mechanisms are developed to emphasize the frame edges in\nestimating flow maps, so that the edge-maps are taken as the auxiliary\ninformation to provide more guidance to boost the flow accuracy. In the frame\nsynthesis stage, the flow refinement module is designed to refine the flow map,\nand the attention module is carried out to adaptively focus on the\nbidirectional flow maps when synthesizing the intermediate frames. Furthermore,\nthe frame and edge discriminators are adopted to conduct the adversarial\ntraining strategy, so as to enhance the reality and clarity of synthesized\nframes.

When the follow up period of control patients starts\nearlier in the disease trajectory than follow up of the treated, estimation of\nthe treatment effect suffers from different types of survival/survivorship\nbias. We study unobserved heterogeneity and illustrate how failing to account\nfor the time difference in recruitment between treated and controls leads to\nbias in the estimated treatment effect. We explore five methods to adjust for\nthis survivorship bias by including the time between diagnosis and treatment\ninitiation (wait time) in the analysis in different ways. We first conducted a\nsimulation study on whether these methods reduce survivorship bias, then\napplied our methods to fertility data on insemination. The five methods were:\nfirst, to regress on wait time as an additional covariate in the analysis\nmodel. Second, to match on wait time. Third, to select treated who started\ntreatment immediately. Fourth, to select controls who survived up to the median\ntime of treatment initiation. Fifth, to consider the wait time as the time of\nleft truncation. All methods reduced survivorship bias in the simulation. In\nthe application to fertility data, failing to adjust for survivorship bias led\nto a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.63 (95%CI: 1.13-1.65) whereas a HR of 2.15\n(1.71-2.69) was expected when using a time-varying covariate for treatment,\nwhich in this prospective cohort coincided with the left truncation approach.\nIn agreement with our simulations, the method in which adjustment corrected the\nHR upwards the most was left truncation.

This sensor is composed of a focal plane mask\nmade of a phase shifting dot fully described by two parameters: its diameter\nand depth.

We begin with a general\ntheoretical framework providing an analytical description of the FFWFS\nproperties, then we predict the expected ZWFS sensitivity for different\nconfigurations of dot diameters and depths. The analytical predictions are then\nvalidated with end-to-end simulations. From this, we propose a variation of the\nclassical ZWFS shape which exhibits extremely appealing properties. We show\nthat the ZWFS sensitivity can be optimized by modifying the dot diameter and\neven reach the optimal theoretical limit, with a trade-off for low spatial\nfrequencies sensitivity. As an example, we show that a ZWFS with a 2{\\lambda}/D\ndot diameter (where {\\lambda} is the sensing wavelength and D the telescope\ndiameter), hereafter called Z2WFS, exhibits a sensitivity twice higher than the\nclassical 1.06{\\lambda}/D ZWFS for all the phase spatial components except for\ntip-tilt modes.

It is thus unclear\nto what extent algorithmic bias has a harmful influence on collective\ndecision-making, such as a tendency to polarize debate. Here we introduce a\ngeneral theoretical framework to systematically link models of opinion\ndynamics, social network structure, and content filtering. We showcase the\nflexibility of our framework by exploring a family of binary-state opinion\ndynamics models where information exchange lies in a spectrum from pairwise to\ngroup interactions. All models show an opinion polarization regime driven by\nalgorithmic bias and modular network structure. The role of content filtering\nis, however, surprisingly nuanced; for pairwise interactions it leads to\npolarization, while for group interactions it promotes coexistence of opinions.\nThis allows us to pinpoint which social interactions are robust against\nalgorithmic bias, and which ones are susceptible to bias-enhanced opinion\npolarization.

Device-to-Device (D2D)\nauthentication of these networks ensures the integrity, authenticity, and\nconfidentiality of information in the deployed area. The literature suggests\ndifferent approaches to address security issues in CPS technologies. However,\nthey are mostly based on centralized techniques or specific system deployments\nwith higher cost of computation and communication. It is therefore necessary to\ndevelop an effective scheme that can resolve the security problems in CPS\ntechnologies of IoT devices. In this paper, a lightweight Hash-MAC-DSDV (Hash\nMedia Access Control Destination Sequence Distance Vector) routing scheme is\nproposed to resolve authentication issues in CPS technologies, connected in the\nform of IoT networks. For this purpose, a CPS of IoT devices (multi-WSNs) is\ndeveloped from the local-chain and public chain, respectively. The proposed\nscheme ensures D2D authentication by the Hash-MAC-DSDV mutual scheme, where the\nMAC addresses of individual devices are registered in the first phase and\nadvertised in the network in the second phase. The proposed scheme allows\nlegitimate devices to modify their routing table and unicast the one-way hash\nauthentication mechanism to transfer their captured data from source towards\nthe destination. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Hash- MAC-DSDV\noutweighs the existing schemes in terms of attack detection, energy consumption\nand communication metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 10:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

However, due\nto the existence of domain shifts among different modalities, the performance\nof networks decreases dramatically when training on one modality and performing\non another, e.g., train on T1 image while performing on T2 image, which is\noften required in clinical applications. This also prohibits a network from\nbeing trained on labeled data and then transferred to unlabeled data from a\ndifferent domain. To overcome this, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nmethods provide effective solutions to alleviate the domain shift between\nlabeled source data and unlabeled target data. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Bidirectional Global-to-Local (BiGL) adaptation framework under a UDA\nscheme.

The functions at these\ntwo layers, are referred to as the inner and outer functions with the key\nproperty that the design of the inner functions is independent of that of the\noriginal function of interest to be computed. This brings modularity and\nuniversality to the design of the inner function, and subsequently, a part of\ncomputation. This paper capitalizes on such modularity and universality in\nfunctional representation to propose two frameworks for distributed computation\nover the additive multiple access channels (MACs). In the first framework, each\nsource encodes the inner representations and sends them over the additive MAC.\nSubsequently, the receiver computes the outer functions to compute the function\nof interest. Transmitting the values of the inner functions instead of the\nmessages directly leads to compression gains. In the second approach, in order\nto further increase the compression rate, the framework aims to also bring\ncomputing the outer functions to the source sites. Specifically, each source\nemploys a graph-coloring-based approach to perform joint functional compression\nof the inner and the outer functions, which may attain further compression\nsavings over the former. These modular encoding schemes provide an exact\nrepresentation in the asymptotic regime and the non-asymptotic regime.\nContrasting these with the baseline model where sources directly transmit data\nover MAC, we observe gains. To showcase the gains of these two frameworks and\ntheir discrepancies, they are applied to a number of commonly used computations\nin distributed systems, e.g., computing products, $\\ell_m$-norms, polynomial\nfunctions, extremum values of functions, and affine transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 10:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

In some\nworkloads, a high-critically task might overrun and overload the system, or a\nfault can occur during the execution. However, these systems must be\nfault-tolerant and guarantee the correct execution of all high-criticality\ntasks by their deadlines to avoid catastrophic consequences, in any situation.\nFurthermore, in these MC systems, the peak power consumption of the system may\nincrease, especially in an overload situation and exceed the processor Thermal\nDesign Power (TDP) constraint. This may cause generating heat beyond the\ncooling capacity, resulting the system stop to avoid excessive heat and halting\nthe processor.

To overcome this, we propose a method, called\nGeneric Itemset Mining based on Reinforcement Learning (GIM-RL), that offers a\nunified framework to train an agent for extracting any type of itemsets. In\nGIM-RL, the environment formulates iterative steps of extracting a target type\nof itemsets from a dataset. At each step, an agent performs an action to add or\nremove an item to or from the current itemset, and then obtains from the\nenvironment a reward that represents how relevant the itemset resulting from\nthe action is to the target type. Through numerous trial-and-error steps where\nvarious rewards are obtained by diverse actions, the agent is trained to\nmaximise cumulative rewards so that it acquires the optimal action policy for\nforming as many itemsets of the target type as possible. In this framework, an\nagent for extracting any type of itemsets can be trained as long as a reward\nsuitable for the type can be defined. The extensive experiments on mining high\nutility itemsets, frequent itemsets and association rules show the general\neffectiveness and one remarkable potential (agent transfer) of GIM-RL. We hope\nthat GIM-RL opens a new research direction towards learning-based itemset\nmining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 11:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 15:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing\nentries from the so-called \"exposure\" perspective, i.e., modeling how an item\nis exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic\nmodels or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the\nmissing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how\nthe ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we\npropose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding\nin Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In\ngeneral, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors\n(e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network's perspective.\nParticularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social\nnetwork confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We\nalso develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning\nto retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize\nwell on the rating prediction.

Each new\nrelease of an instruction set was usually a doubling of the vector length\ncoupled with new operations. Each generation was pushing for adapting and\nimproving previous implementations. The release of the ARM scalable vector\nextension (SVE) changed things radically for several reasons. First, we expect\nARM processors to equip many supercomputers in the next years. Second, SVE's\ninterface is different in several aspects from the x86 extensions as it\nprovides different instructions, uses a predicate to control most operations,\nand has a vector size that is only known at execution time. Therefore, using\nSVE opens new challenges on how to adapt algorithms including the ones that are\nalready well-optimized on x86. In this paper, we port a hybrid sort based on\nthe well-known Quicksort and Bitonic-sort algorithms.

We propose an expansion of the gluon correlator, using a basis\nof four tensors (one antisymmetric and three symmetric), which are expressed\nthrough generators of the $U(2)$ group acting in the two-dimensional transverse\nplane. One can do clear interpretations of the two transversity T-odd TMDs with\nlinear polarization of gluons: symmetric and asymmetric under permutation of\nthe transverse spin of the nucleon and the transverse momentum of the gluon.\nUsing light-front wave function (LFWF) representation, we also derive T-even\nand T-odd gluon TMDs in the nucleon at leading twist. The gluon-three-quark\nFock component in the nucleon is considered as bound state of gluon and\nthree-quark core (spectator). The TMDs are constructed as factorized product of\ntwo LFWFs and gluonic matrix encoding information about both T-even and T-odd\nTMDs. In particular, T-odd TMDs arise due to gluon rescattering between the\ngluon and three-quark spectator. Gluon rescattering effects are parametrized by\nunknown scalar functions depending on the $x$ and ${\\bf k}_{\\perp}$ variables.\nOur gluon TDMs obey the model-independent Mulders-Rodrigues inequalities. We\nalso derive new sum rules (SRs) involving T-even TMDs. One of the SRs states\nthat the square of the unpolarized TMD is equal to a sum of the squares of\nthree polarized TMDs.

Although many works have\nbeen proposed for dynamic graph modeling in recent years, effective and\nscalable models are yet to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph neural network approach, called TCL, which deals with the\ndynamically-evolving graph in a continuous-time fashion and enables effective\ndynamic node representation learning that captures both the temporal and\ntopology information. Technically, our model contains three novel aspects.\nFirst, we generalize the vanilla Transformer to temporal graph learning\nscenarios and design a graph-topology-aware transformer. Secondly, on top of\nthe proposed graph transformer, we introduce a two-stream encoder that\nseparately extracts representations from temporal neighborhoods associated with\nthe two interaction nodes and then utilizes a co-attentional transformer to\nmodel inter-dependencies at a semantic level. Lastly, we are inspired by the\nrecently developed contrastive learning and propose to optimize our model by\nmaximizing mutual information (MI) between the predictive representations of\ntwo future interaction nodes. Benefiting from this, our dynamic representations\ncan preserve high-level (or global) semantics about interactions and thus is\nrobust to noisy interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nattempt to apply contrastive learning to representation learning on dynamic\ngraphs. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets for interaction\nprediction and experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 15:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Often, the choice set itself is\ninfluenced by an individual's preferences; for instance, a consumer choosing a\nproduct from an online retailer is often presented with options from a\nrecommender system that depend on information about the consumer's preferences.\nIgnoring these assignment mechanisms can mislead choice models into making\nbiased estimates of preferences, a phenomenon that we call choice set\nconfounding; we demonstrate the presence of such confounding in widely-used\nchoice datasets.\n  To address this issue, we adapt methods from causal inference to the discrete\nchoice setting.

The analysis and empirical results suggest that contributors who make\nlarge edits (``creators'') eventually lose the article's ownership to those who\nrefine the articles and typically make smaller edits (``curators''). Whereas\nneutrality-seeking mechanisms are essential for ensuring that ownership is not\nconcentrated within a small number of contributors, our findings suggest that\nthe burden of excessive governance may deter contributors from participating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 15:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

In addition, it has been reported that the presence of a\nspike brings in unsteadiness in the form of oscillation and pulsation to the\nstructure. Previous researchers have investigated the aerothermodynamic\ncoefficients, together with offering a detailed explanation of the flow physics\nand associated unsteadiness, and their dependence on the spike's geometric\ncharacteristics (spike nose, and length-to-fore-body diameter ratio, L/D). This\nwork focuses on ascertaining the role of flow speeds (free-stream Mach number),\nand their energy content, in governing the physics around a spiked body, which\nis yet to be established. Numerical investigation has been carried out using\naxisymmetric Navier-Stokes laminar flow solver for Mach number range of 2.0 to\n7.0. A round-tip spike with flat-face cylindrical after-body have been\nsimulated for spike length ratio of L/D = 2.0, with spike diameter to fore-body\ndiameter of 0.1.

The original\nVP works well when the prescribed pair of JD and curl is calculated from a\ndiffeomorphism, but not necessarily when the prescribed JD and curl are not\nknown to come from a diffeomorphism.

To resolve these issues, in this paper, we describe a new version\nof VP (revised VP), which is based on composition of transformations and,\ntherefore, is invariant in the Lie algebra.
