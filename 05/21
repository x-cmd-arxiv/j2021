In\nthis paper, we introduce a feedforward software compensation algorithm, based\non the filtered B-splines (FBS) method, that rectifies errors due to racking.\nThe FBS approach expresses the motion command to the machine as a linear\ncombination of B-splines. The B-splines are filtered through an identified\nmodel of the machine dynamics and the control points of the B-spline based\nmotion command are optimized such that the tracking error is minimized. To\ncompensate racking using the FBS algorithm, an accurate frequency response\nfunction of the racking motion is obtained and coupled to the H-frame's x- and\ny-axis dynamics with a kinematic model. The result is a coupled linear\nparameter varying model of the H-frame that is utilized in the FBS framework to\ncompensate racking. An approximation of the proposed racking compensation\nalgorithm, that decouples the x- and y-axis compensation, is developed to\nsignificantly improve its computational efficiency with almost no loss of\ncompensation accuracy. Experiments on an H-frame 3D printer demonstrate a 43\npercent improvement in the shape accuracy of a printed part using the proposed\nalgorithm compared to the standard FBS approach without racking compensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 16:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Motivated to develop\na more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint\ndetection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from\nany camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may\nbe of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The\nwidely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not\nwell-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model\nkeypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around\nthis idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points\nwithin an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.\nAdditionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to\nimprove the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets\ncomprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were\nmanually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset\ncontaining 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a\nsmartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test\nimages. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data\n(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and\nextensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because\nDeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on\nedge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart\nscoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 16:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

We consider a 2D approximation of\nthe gravitationally stratified and partially-ionized lower solar atmosphere\nconsisting of ion+electron and neutral fluids that are coupled by ion-neutral\ncollisions. In this model, the convection below the photosphere is responsible\nfor the excitation of ion magnetoacoustic-gravity and neutral acoustic-gravity\nwaves. We find that in the solar photosphere, where ions and neutrals are\nstrongly coupled by collisions, ion magnetoacoustic-gravity and neutral\nacoustic-gravity waves have periods ranging from 250 s to 350 s. In the\nchromosphere, where the collisional coupling is weak, the wave characteristics\nstrongly depend on the magnetic field configuration. Above the foot-points of\nthe considered arcade, the plasma is dominated by a vertical magnetic field\nalong which ion magnetoacoustic-gravity waves propagate. These waves exhibit a\nbroad range of periods with the most prominent periods of 180 s, 220 s, and 300\ns. Above the main loop of the solar arcade, where mostly horizontal magnetic\nfield lines guide ion magnetoacoustic-gravity waves, the main spectral power\nreduces to the period of about 180 s and longer wave-periods do not exist.

The result is that data\naccess libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot\nutilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive\nsolution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering\ntasks to the storage layer.

However, many systems in the real-world do not\nresult in all agents eventually reaching consensus, but rather in the opposite:\nthey converge to a state of rich diversity. Consider for example task\nallocation in ants. If eventually all ants perform the same task, then the\ncolony will perish (lack of food, no brood care, etc.). Then, it is vital for\nthe survival of the colony to have a diverse set of tasks and enough ants\nworking on each task. What complicates matters is that ants need to switch\ntasks periodically to adjust the needs of the colony; e.g., when too many\nforagers fell victim to other ant colonies. Moreover, all tasks are equally\nimportant and maybe they need to keep certain proportions in the distribution\nof the task. How can ants keep a healthy and balanced allocation of tasks?\n  To answer this question, we propose a simple population protocol for $n$\nagents on a complete graph and an arbitrary initial distribution of $k$ colours\n(tasks). We assume that each colour $i$ has an associated weight (importance)\n$w_i \\geq 1$. By denoting $w$ as the sum of the weights of different colours,\nwe show that the protocol converges in $O(w^2 n \\log n)$ rounds to a\nconfiguration where the number of agents supporting each colour $i$ is\nconcentrated on the fair share $w_in/w$ and will stay concentrated for a large\nnumber of rounds, w.h.p.\n  Our protocol has many interesting properties: agents do not need to know\nother colours and weights in the system, and our protocol requires very little\nmemory per agent. Furthermore, the protocol guarantees fairness meaning that\nover a long period each agent has each colour roughly a number of times\nproportional to the weight of the colour. Finally, our protocol also fulfils\nsustainability meaning that no colour ever vanishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 17:39:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 09:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

But what are the limits\nof generalization given such bias, and up to what point might it be sufficient\nfor a real problem task? Although many have examined issues regarding\ngeneralization, this question may require examining the data itself. Here, we\nfocus on the characteristics of the training data that may play a role. Other\ndisciplines have grappled with these problems, most interestingly epidemiology,\nwhere experimental bias is a critical concern. The range and nature of data\nbiases seen clinically are really quite relatable to learned vision systems.\nOne obvious way to deal with bias is to ensure a large enough training set, but\nthis might be infeasible for many domains. Another approach might be to perform\na statistical analysis of the actual training set, to determine if all aspects\nof the domain are fairly captured.

However, we show that the observation of multiple rings, corresponding to\nthe low-order photon rings, can break this degeneracy and produce mass and spin\nmeasurements independent of the shape of the rings. We describe two potential\nexperiments that would measure the spin. In the first, observations of the\ndirect emission and $n=1$ photon ring are made at multiple epochs with\ndifferent emission locations. This method is conceptually similar to spacetime\nconstraints that arise from variable structures (or hot spots) in that it\nbreaks the near-perfect degeneracy between emission location, mass, and spin\nfor polar observers using temporal variability. In the second, observations of\nthe direct emission, $n=1$ and $n=2$ photon rings are made during a single\nepoch. For both schemes, additional observations comprise a test of general\nrelativity.

Adding solid particles to the liquid\nphase leads to a more complex dynamic, notably by increasing the shear\nviscosity. Moreover, it introduces an additional length scale to the system,\nthe diameter of the particles, which eventually becomes comparable to the\ndiameter of the ligament. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the\nthinning and pinch-off of drops of suspensions with two different sizes of\nparticles. We characterize the thinning for different particle size ratios and\ndifferent proportions of small particles. Long before the pinch-off, the\nthinning rate is that of an equivalent liquid whose viscosity is that of the\nsuspension. Later, when the ligament thickness approaches the size of the large\nparticles, the thinning accelerates and leads to an early pinch-off. We explain\nhow the bidisperse particle size distribution lowers the viscosity by making\nthe packing more efficient, which speeds up the thinning. This result can be\nused to predict the dynamics of droplet formation with bidisperse suspensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 18:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Focusing on group fairness metrics, we\ninvestigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires\ncontrolling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical\nsetting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group\ninformation, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more\nof these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a\nproxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed\nto provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in\nthis work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a\ntheoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which\naccurate fairness evaluation is possible.\n  Furthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples\nthem into two interpretable parts $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$. The first part\n$\\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and\nrecall, whereas the second part $\\epsilon$ captures correlations between all\nthe variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the\nestimates is dominated by $\\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the\ndependence on the correlations $\\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.\nAs a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model\nfairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via\nsimulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated\nestimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,\nis key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 18:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

The difficulty of this problem originates from the\nviewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes\nreconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In\nthis paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface\nreconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present\na simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light\nrays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and\ndevelop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and\ntriangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to\nmodel the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,\nneither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact\nnumber of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can\ntherefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and\nstructure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that\nfor thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further\nsimplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results\non both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 19:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

For visible light the bandwidth of photoconductive sampling of\nfields and field-induced dynamics can be extended to the petahertz domain.\nDespite the growing importance of ultrafast photoconductive measurements, a\nrigorous model for connecting the microscopic electron dynamics to the\nmacroscopic external signal is lacking. This has caused conflicting\ninterpretations about the origin of macroscopic currents. Here, we present\nsystematic experimental studies on the macroscopic signal formation of\nultrafast currents in gases. We developed a theoretical model based on the\nRamo-Shockley-theorem that overcomes the previously introduced artificial\nseparation into dipole and current contributions. Extensive numerical\nparticle-in-cell (PIC)-type simulations based on this model permit a\nquantitative comparison with experimental results and help to identify the\nroles of electron scattering and Coulomb interactions. The results imply that\nmost of the heuristic models utilized so far will need to be amended. Our\napproach can aid in the design of more sensitive and more efficient\nphotoconductive devices.

ALI-G (Berrada et al., 2020)\nand SPS (Loizou et al., 2021) are both adaptations of the Polyak step-size to\noptimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The\nmain algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant\nin the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,\nand (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses\na constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two\nworks, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In\ntheir experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which\nis a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for\ne.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the\nimproved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.\nIn particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%\n(+8%) with a very small amount of tuning.

While this\nranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting the\noutputs produced by pointwise regression or classification techniques,\nstrategies using Learning to Rank algorithms have recently presented themselves\nas competitive and viable alternatives. Although the rankers at the core of\nthese strategies are learned globally and improve ranking accuracy on average,\nthey ignore the differences between the distributions of asset features over\nthe times when the portfolio is rebalanced. This flaw renders them susceptible\nto producing sub-optimal rankings, possibly at important periods when accuracy\nis actually needed the most. For example, this might happen during critical\nrisk-off episodes, which consequently exposes the portfolio to substantial,\nunwanted drawdowns.

We present a number of improvements to prior modeling\napproaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that\nutilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story\nand generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for\nsequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to\nmodel complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of\nthe model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard\nevaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also\nprovide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects\nof the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,\nthe relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images. We also\npresent correlation experiments of our proposed automated metrics with human\nevaluations.

Based\non work-pairing, work-conjugated section-section interaction forces and\nmoments, either in spatial or in material form, are identified that can be\nconsistently derived from a variational principle.

To address this problem, some researchers have proposed both offline\nand online data poisoning detection defenses which employ machine learning\nalgorithms to identify such attacks. In this work, we take a different approach\nto preventing data poisoning attacks which relies on cryptographically-based\nauthentication and provenance to ensure the integrity of the data used to train\na machine learning model. The same approach is also used to prevent software\npoisoning and model poisoning attacks. A software poisoning attack maliciously\nalters one or more software components used to train a model. Once the model\nhas been trained it can also be protected against model poisoning attacks which\nseek to alter a model's predictions by modifying its underlying parameters or\nstructure. Finally, an evaluation set or test set can also be protected to\nprovide evidence if they have been modified by a second data poisoning attack.\nTo achieve these goals, we propose VAMP which extends the previously proposed\nAMP system, that was designed to protect media objects such as images, video\nfiles or audio clips, to the machine learning setting. We first provide\nrequirements for authentication and provenance for a secure machine learning\nsystem. Next, we demonstrate how VAMP's manifest meets these requirements to\nprotect a machine learning system's datasets, software components, and models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 21:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

The classifiers are trained to\ndiscriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation\npolicy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators.

The origin of the EUV late phase (ELP) is explained by either\na long-lasting cooling process in the long ELP loops, or a delayed energy\nejection into the ELP loops well after the main flare heating. Using the\nobservations with the \\emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (\\emph{SDO}), we\ninvestigate the production of the ELP in six homologous flares (F1--F6)\noriginating from a complex active region (AR) NOAA 11283, with an emphasis on\nthe emission characteristics of the flares. It is found that the main\nproduction mechanism of the ELP changes from additional heating in flare F1 to\nlong-lasting cooling in flares F3--F6, with both mechanisms playing a role in\nflare F2. The transition is evidenced by an abrupt decrease of the time lag of\nthe ELP peak, and the long-lasting cooling process in the majority of the\nflares is validated by a positive correlation between the flare ribbon fluence\nand the ELP peak intensity. We attribute the change in ELP production mechanism\nto an enhancement of the envelope magnetic field above the AR, which\nfacilitates a more prompt and energetic heating of the ELP loops. In addition,\nthe last and the only confined flare F6 exhibits an extremely large ELP.

This\nwork is motivated by the ongoing challenges of safety, computation, and\noptimality in high-dimensional optimal control. We address these key questions\nwith the following approach. First, we identify a sequence-modeling surrogate\nmethodology which takes as input the initial state and a time series of control\ninputs, and outputs an approximation of the objective function and trajectories\nof constraint functions. Importantly this approach entirely absorbs the\nindividual state transition dynamics. The sole dependence on the initial state\nmeans we can apply dimensionality reduction to compress the model input while\nretaining most of its information. Uncertainty in the surrogate objective will\naffect the result optimality. Critically, however, uncertainty in the surrogate\nconstraint functions will lead to infeasibility, i.e. unsafe actions. When\nconsidering offline reinforcement learning, the most significant modeling error\nwill be encountered on out-of-distribution data. Therefore, we apply\nWasserstein ambiguity sets to ``robustify'' our surrogate modeling approach\nsubject to worst-case out-of-sample modeling error based on the distribution of\ntest data residuals.

With a large volume of search\nlogs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click\nbehavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling\nthe users' click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.\nIn particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily\nchosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,\nespecially for lower-ranked results.

It is a non\ninvasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination while minimally handling\nthe neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts\nconcerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns\nfound in different respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the\noperator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in\nautomated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model for\ndiagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The\nalgorithm should output LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead.\nTherefore, in this paper we present a unique approach for extracting seven\nmeaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific\npathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura,\nAlines, Coalescent B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These\nartifacts can lead to early prediction of infants developing later respiratory\ndistress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based object detection\nmodel faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos\nto detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal\ndiseases. Our results show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as\nRetinaNet and can successfully detect the aforementioned LUS features with a\nmean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic diagnosis from\nimages without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the\nultimate control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more\ntrustworthy intelligent system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 01:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Here we use molecular field theory to study a simple\ntwo-parameter model, with one parameter promoting a biaxial phase and the\nsecond promoting smecticity. The theory combines the biaxial Maier-Saupe and\nMcMillan models. We use alternatively the Sonnet-Virga-Durand (SVD) and\ngeometric mean approximations (GMA) to characterize molecular biaxiality by a\nsingle parameter. For non-zero smecticity and biaxiality, the model always\npredicts a ground state biaxial smectic A phase. For a low degree of smectic\norder, the phase diagram is very rich, predicting uniaxial and biaxial nematic\nand smectic phases, with in addition a variety of tricritical and tetracritical\npoints.

In a model of an\nenvironment, to learn to make decisions, this AI agent needs to interact with\nits environment and make explorative actions. Each action in a given state\nbrings a reward signal to the agent. These interactive experience is saved in\nthe agent's memory, which is then used to update its subjective belief of the\nworld. The agent's decision-making strategy is formed and adjusted based on\nthis evolving subjective belief. This agent does not only take an action that\nit knows would bring a high reward, it also explores other possibilities. This\nis the process of taking explorative actions, and it ensures that the agent\nnotices changes in its environment and adapt its subjective belief and\ndecisions accordingly. Through a model of stochastic optimal growth, I\nillustrate that the economic agent under this proposed learning structure is\nadaptive to changes in an underlying stochastic process of the economy. AI\nagents can differ in their levels of exploration, which leads to different\nexperience in the same environment. This reflects on to their different\nlearning behaviours and welfare obtained.

We show that such methods are\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks - where an attacker poisons a small part of the\nunlabeled data by adding a trigger (image patch chosen by the attacker) to the\nimages. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker\ncan manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time.\nBackdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised\nlearning.

Due to the theoretical ideal, conditions for robust\nstability of FIE are relatively easier to establish than those for MHE, and\nvarious sufficient conditions have been developed in literature. This work\nreveals a generic link from robust stability of FIE to that of MHE, showing\nthat the former implies at least a weaker robust stability of MHE which\nimplements a long enough horizon. The implication strengthens to strict robust\nstability of MHE if the corresponding FIE satisfies a mild Lipschitz continuity\ncondition.

This is\nbecause there is an unavoidable ambiguity in the definition of the spin of a\nmoving particle. In this paper, by introducing a vector bundle theoretic way to\nview the single-particle state space, we try to rule out this ambiguity. The\ndiscrete degree of freedom of the resulting representation space contains\ninformation about the Pauli-Lubansky four-vector of the particle instead of the\nambiguous spin. Comparing this representation with the standard one used in the\nRQI literature, we show that the discrete degree of freedom of the standard\nrepresentation space attains the meaning of the Newton-Wigner spin. Also using\nthis viewpoint, we give a mathematical proof of why the spin reduced density\nmatrix is meaningless, which is stronger than the previous claims in that it\nasserts that the matrix is void of any meaning at all, not just in terms of the\nimpossibility of measurement or Lorentz non-covariance. We give a way (which\nturns out to be the only way) to modify it to obtain the Pauli-Lubansky reduced\ndensity matrix, which is covariant under Lorentz transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 05:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 14:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The local S0 population has both higher photometric\nconcentration and lower stellar spin than spiral galaxies of comparable mass\nand we test whether this separation can be accounted for by passive aging\nalone. We construct a suite of dynamically self--consistent galaxy models, with\na bulge, disc and halo using the GalactICS code. The dispersion-dominated bulge\nis given a uniformly old stellar population, while the disc is given a current\nstar formation rate putting it on the main sequence, followed by sudden\ninstantaneous quenching. We then generate mock observables (r-band images,\nstellar velocity and dispersion maps) as a function of time since quenching for\na range of bulge/total (B/T) mass ratios. The disc fading leads to a decline in\nmeasured spin as the bulge contribution becomes more dominant, and also leads\nto increased concentration. However, the quantitative changes observed after 5\nGyr of disc fading cannot account for all of the observed difference. We see\nsimilar results if we instead subdivide our SAMI Galaxy Survey sample by star\nformation (relative to the main sequence). We use EAGLE simulations to also\ntake into account progenitor bias, using size evolution to infer quenching\ntime. The EAGLE simulations suggest that the progenitors of current passive\ngalaxies typically have slightly higher spin than present day star-forming disc\ngalaxies of the same mass. As a result, progenitor bias moves the data further\nfrom the disc fading model scenario, implying that intrinsic dynamical\nevolution must be important in the transition from star-forming discs to\npassive discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

This\npaper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the\ndirection/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the\nliterature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its\nmagnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size\nbased on the gradient angular information of previous iterations.

Two variants of\nAngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for\ncomputing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits\nthe same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes.

Here we\nstudy deterministic preparation of arbitrary size $W$ states with spin systems.\nWe present an efficient operation on three qubits, two being the logical qubits\nand one being the ancillary qubit, where no interaction between the logical\nqubits are required. The proposed operation can create a $W$-type\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair from two separable qubits, and expand that\nEPR pair or an arbitrary size $W$ state by one, creating a $W$-like state.\nTaking this operation as the fundamental building block, we show how to create\na large scale $W$ state out of separable qubits, or double the size of a $W$\nstate. Based on this operation and focusing on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in\ndiamond as an exemplary spin system, we propose a setup for preparing $W$\nstates of circularly polarized photons, assisted by a single spin qubit, where\nno photon-photon interactions are required. Next, we propose a setup for\npreparing $W$ states of spin qubits of spatially separated systems, assisted by\na single photon. We also analyze the effects of possible imperfections in\nimplementing the gates on the fidelity of the generated $W$ states. In our\nsetups, neither post-measurement, nor post-processing on the states of spin or\nphotonic qubit is required. Our setups can be implemented with current\ntechnology, and we anticipate that they contribute to quantum science and\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 08:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Inspired by the powerful learning ability of deep\nlearning, we attempt to develop a general deep learning approach for\nhyperspectral unmixing, by fully considering the properties of endmembers\nextracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing\nnetwork (EGU-Net). Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a\ntwo-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the\npure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing\nnetwork by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful\nconstraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and\ninterpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework\nis not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to\nspatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral\nunmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the\nground-truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms.

To analyze the\nefficiency of this class of non-Markovian search processes we present a general\nformalism that allows to compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a given\nset of conditional transition probabilities for non-Markovian random walks on a\nlattice.

To grade pelvic fracture severity\nin trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is\nfrequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in\nbusy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide\nsubstantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending\ntrauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform\ngrading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to\nenable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering\ninsights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an\nautomated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist\nradiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method\noperates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects\ndistinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model\nthat are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical\nbest practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and\nfinally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures\nthat may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating\npoint of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and\ncorresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides\nfinding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on\nimportant counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and\nachieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.\nDespite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not\ncompromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 09:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Recent developments address this issue through so-called\npredictive safety filters, which assess if a proposed learning-based control\ninput can lead to constraint violations and modifies it if necessary to ensure\nsafety for all future time steps. The theoretical guarantees of such predictive\nsafety filters rely on the model assumptions and minor deviations can lead to\nfailure of the filter putting the system at risk. This paper introduces an\nauxiliary soft-constrained predictive control problem that is always feasible\nat each time step and asymptotically stabilizes the feasible set of the\noriginal safety filter, thereby providing a recovery mechanism in\nsafety-critical situations.

The main challenge that needs\naddressing for these applications is the optimal placement of the end-users\ndemands to reduce the total power consumption and delay. One of the widely\nadopted paradigms to address such a challenge is fog computing. Placing fog\nunits close to end-users at the edge of the network can help mitigate some of\nthe latency and energy efficiency issues. Compared to the traditional\nhyperscale cloud data centres, fog computing units are constrained by\ncomputational power, hence, the capacity of fog units plays a critical role in\nmeeting the stringent demands of the end-users due to intensive processing\nworkloads. In this paper, we aim to optimize the placement of virtual machines\n(VMs) demands originating from end-users in a fog computing setting by\nformulating a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to minimize the\ntotal power consumption through the use of a federated architecture made up of\nmultiple distributed fog cells. The obtained results show an increase in\nprocessing capacity in the fog layer and a reduction in the power consumption\nby up to 26% compared to the Non-Federated fogs network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 09:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

The extension facilitates the\nmeasurement of surface height profiles with sub-nm resolution. The selection of\na dispersive element for encoding allows for tuning of the axial measurement\nrange and resolution of the setup. The approach is theoretically designed and\nimplemented for applications such as surface profilometry, the characterization\nof polymeric cross-linking and as a tool for the determination of layer\nthicknesses in thin-film processing. During the characterization of the\nimplemented setup, it was shown that an axial measurement range of 79.91 $\\mu\nm$ with a resolution of 0.1 nm was achievable in the evaluation of surface\nprofiles. Simultaneously, profiles of up to 1.5 mm length could be obtained\nwithout the need for mechanical scanning. This marked a significant improvement\nin relation to state-of-the-art technologies in terms of dynamic range. It was\nalso shown that axial and lateral measurement range can be decoupled partially.\nAdditionally, functional parameters such as surface roughness were\ncharacterized with the same tool.

The\nproblem of using the combination of n-order polynomials is that there is no\nideally match between the segments of trajectory path at the via point in terms\nof the number of kinematic constraints. It leads to generate undesirable\ntrajectory path at the via point that connects between two segments of the\ntrajectory path. In this paper, we aim to investigate the effect of increasing\nto higher order polynomial blends on the accuracy of the via points with\nconsidering different kinematics constraints. Based on that, the methodology\nthat was used in this paper is based on the polynomial segment with the higher\npolynomial blend (PSPB). Three techniques implemented which are 4-3-4 PSPB,\n5-4-5 PSPB, and 6-5-6 PSPB. Each technique implemented based on applying\ndifferent kinematic constraints.

An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of\nthe agent's decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous\ndriving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)\nmethod, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a\ncomplete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by\nlearning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric\nuncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to\nprovide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for\nclassifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also\nintroduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time\nefficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the\nestimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained\nagent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that\nthe agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,\npotentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 10:36:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 15:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The Variational\nQuantum Deflation (VQD) is an extension of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n(VQE) for calculating electronic excited state energies, and has the potential\nto address some of these scaling challenges using quantum computers. However,\nquantum computers available in the near term can only support a limited number\nof circuit operations, so reducing the quantum computational cost in VQD\nmethods is critical to their realisation. In this work, we investigate the use\nof adaptive quantum circuit growth (ADAPT-VQE) in excited state VQD\ncalculations, a strategy that has been successful previously in reducing the\nresource for ground state energy VQE calculations. We also invoke spin\nrestrictions to separate the recovery of eigenstates with different spin\nsymmetry to reduce the number of calculations and accumulation of errors.

We study the\neffect of partial ionization for 2D wave propagation in a gravitationally\nstratified, magnetized atmosphere with properties similar to the solar\nchromosphere. We adopt an oblique uniform magnetic field in the plane of\npropagation with strength suitable for a quiet sun region. The theoretical\nmodel used is a single fluid magnetohydrodynamic approximation, where\nion-neutral interaction is modeled by the ambipolar diffusion term. Magnetic\nenergy can be converted into internal energy through the dissipation of the\nelectric current produced by the drift between ions and neutrals. We use\nnumerical simulations where we continuously drive fast waves at the bottom of\nthe atmosphere. The collisional coupling between ions and neutrals decreases\nwith the decrease of the density and the ambipolar effect becomes important.\nFast waves excited at the base of the atmosphere reach the equipartition layer\nand reflect or transmit as slow waves. While the waves propagate through the\natmosphere and the density drops, the waves steepen into shocks. The main\neffect of ambipolar diffusion is damping of the waves. We find that for the\nparameters chosen in this work, the ambipolar diffusion affects the fast wave\nbefore it is reflected, with damping being more pronounced for waves which are\nlaunched in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. Slow waves are\nless affected by ambipolar effects. The damping increases for shorter periods\nand larger magnetic field strengths. Small scales produced by the nonlinear\neffects and the superposition of different types of waves created at the\nequipartition height are efficiently damped by ambipolar diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 11:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The nonlinear dynamics of the membrane gives\nrise to a rich dynamical behavior depending on the shear velocity. In quiescent\nconditions (i.e., absence of shear), the membrane freezes into a disordered\nlabyrinthine wrinkle pattern. In the presence of shear, we find four different\nregimes depending on the shear rate. Regime I. For small shear, the\nlabyrinthine pattern is still frozen, but exhibits a small drift which is\nmainly along the shear direction. In this regime, the tangential forces on the\nwalls due to the presence of the membrane increase linearly with the shear\nrate. Regime II. When the shear rate is increased above a critical value, the\nmembrane rearranges, and wrinkles start to align along the shear direction.\nThis regime is accompanied by a sharp drop of the tangential forces on the\nwall. Regime III. For larger shear rates, the wrinkles align strongly along the\nshear direction, with a set of dislocation defects which assemble in pairs. The\ntangential forces are then controlled by the number of dislocations, and by the\nnumber of wrinkles between the two dislocations within each dislocation pairs.\nIn this dislocation-dominated regime, the tangential forces in the transverse\ndirection most often exceed those in the shear direction. Regime IV. For even\nlarger shear, the membrane organizes into a perfect array of parallel stripes\nwith no defects. The wavelength of the wrinkles is still identical to the\nwavelength in the absence of shear. In this final regime, the tangential forces\ndue to the membrane vanish. These behaviors give rise to a non-linear\nrheological behavior of lubricated contacts containing membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 11:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

Finally, this is accompanied with a discussion around\nthe challenges posed by real-world animal behavior datasets and how best\npractices can be established for similar fine-grained action recognition tasks.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/sofiabroome/painface-recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 12:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 19:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 14:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In\nthis paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object\ndetection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and\nspeed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large\ndistances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded\nplatforms equipped with high-performance GPUs. Our experiments show that these\nmethods mostly fail to detect distant small objects due to the sparsity of the\ninput point clouds at large distances. Moreover, models trained on near objects\nachieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects\nin the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance\nrepresentations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a\nconsiderable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on\nlocations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection. This\nmeans that the methods can achieve a speed-up of $40$-$60\\%$ by restricting\noperation to near objects while not sacrificing much in performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 12:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

To this end, measurements with alpha particles from a\n241Am source were carried out using three different target gases, H2O, C3H8 and\nC4H8O. For each of the three target gases, three different drift-time windows\nwere applied to realise three different target sizes. A method has been\ndeveloped to determine the dimensions of the simulated nanometric target volume\nin liquid H2O for cylindrical and spherical shape, as often used in approaches\nto model radiation effects to DNA. Simulations with nanometric targets of\ndimensions determined with this method agree very well with the corresponding\nmeasurements. Scaling of the spatial distribution of the extraction efficiency\nfor different target gases and drift-time windows, which corresponds to the\nnanodosimeter's target volume, in terms of liquid H2O using\n($\\rho\\lambda_{ion}$)-ratios has also been investigated and proved to yield an\nestimate of the target volume in liquid H2O.

To address this issue, domain\nadaptation (DA) is one solution and many unsupervised DA methods have been\nproposed. These methods focus on a scenario of single source domain to single\ntarget domain. However, we will face such problem that test data comes from\nmultiple target domains. This problem can be addressed by producing one model\nper target domain, but this solution is too costly. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised multi-target domain adaption (MTDA) method for ASC, which\ncan adapt to multiple target domains simultaneously and make use of the\nunderlying relation among multiple domains. Specifically, our approach combines\ntraditional adversarial adaptation with two novel discriminator tasks that\nlearns a common subspace shared by all domains. Furthermore, we propose to\ndivide the target domain into the easy-to-adapt and hard-to-adapt domain, which\nenables the system to pay more attention to hard-to-adapt domain in training.\nThe experimental results on the DCASE 2020 Task 1-A dataset and the DCASE 2019\nTask 1-B dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the\nprevious unsupervised DA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 13:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

The pinnacle set of pi, denoted Pin pi, is the\nset of all pi_i such that pi_{i-1} < pi_i > pi_{i+1}. This is an analogue of\nthe well-studied peak set of pi where one considers values rather than\npositions. The pinnacle set was introduced by Davis, Nelson, Petersen, and\nTenner who showed that it has many interesting properties. In particular, they\nproved that the number of subsets of [n] = {1, 2, ..., n} which can be the\npinnacle set of some permutation is a binomial coefficient. Their proof\ninvolved a bijection with lattice paths and was somewhat involved. We give a\nsimpler demonstration of this result which does not need lattice paths.\nMoreover, we show that our map and theirs are different descriptions of the\nsame function. Davis et al. also studied the number of pinnacle sets with\nmaximum m and cardinality d which they denoted by p(m,d). We show that these\nintegers are ballot numbers and give two proofs of this fact: one using finite\ndifferences and one bijective. Diaz-Lopez, Harris, Huang, Insko, and Nilsen\nfound a summation formula for calculating the number of permutations in S_n\nhaving a given pinnacle set. We derive a new expression for this number which\nis faster to calculate in many cases. We also show how this method can be\nadapted to find the number of orderings of a pinnacle set which can be realized\nby some pi in S_n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 15:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Realizing this opportunity requires an efficient and\nflexible medium through which humans can communicate with collaborative robots.\nNatural language provides one such medium, and through significant progress in\nstatistical methods for natural-language understanding, robots are now able to\ninterpret a diverse array of free-form commands.

The latter have been identified on established active regions\nby various methods. The evolution of these inflows and their dependence on\nactive region properties as well as their impact on the global magnetic field\nare not yet understood. We aim to understand the evolution of the average\ninflows around emerging active regions and to derive an empirical model for\nthese inflows. We analyze horizontal flows at the surface of the Sun using\nlocal correlation tracking of solar granules observed in continuum images of\nSDO/HMI. We measure average flows of a sample of 182 isolated active regions up\nto seven days before and after their emergence onto the solar surface with a\ncadence of 12 hours. We investigate the average inflow properties with respect\nto active region characteristics of total flux and latitude. We fit a model to\nthese observed inflows for a quantitative analysis. We find that converging\nflows of around $20$ to $30$ m/s are first visible one day prior to emergence,\nin agreement with recent results. These converging flows are present\nindependently of active region properties of latitude or flux. We confirm a\nrecently found prograde flow of about $40$ m/s at the leading polarity during\nemergence.

By introducing a new laser configuration in\nplace of conventional optical system of the flow cytometry, the interference\nfringe (periodic intensity modulation) is created inside the flow which\nprovides a calibrated scale for the size measurement. The fringe pitch is\nprecisely determined by the crossing angle of laser beams and the wavelength.\nThe transverse size of the beam spot can be much larger than wavelength, for\nexample, 30 micro-meters, where the flow cell design in conventional system can\nbe used with moderated dimensional tolerance. The interaction length of sample\nwith laser becomes longer: ~30 micro-meter and thus the scattering light and\nfluorescent light in case of labeled particle becomes much higher. Importantly,\nthose signals are modulated in MHz frequency range associated with the periodic\nintensity modulation of the interference fringe. By measuring modulation depth,\nwe can determine the particle size. We may utilize a bandpass filter or the\ndigital signal processing of FFT, and thus we can drastically improve S/N\nratio. This is because of the narrow spectrum of signal and thus effectively\neliminates noise from various debris contained in the sample, and also low\nfrequency shot noise in the photo detector signal. Thanks to the\nabove-mentioned merits, it will be possible to measure the size of EVs and\nexosomes in particle-by-particle basis in reliable dimensional scale at\nnano-meter resolution.

The biopharmaceutical companies are currently\nstruggling to meet timely delivery and, given high prices of up to $2 million\nper patient, prove the cost-effectiveness of their ATMP. The fragility of ATMPs\ncombined with the impossibility for replacements due to the nature of the\ntreatment and the advanced stages of the patient's condition are some of the\nbottlenecks added to a generally critical supply chain. As a consequence, ATMPs\nare currently used in most cases only as a last resort. ATMPs are at the\nintersection of multiple healthcare logistic networks and, due to their\nnovelty, research around their commercialisation is still in its infancy from\nan operations research perspective. To accelerate technology adoption in this\ndomain, we characterize pertinent practical challenges in a PM supply chain and\nthen capture them in a holistic mathematical model ready for optimisation. The\nidentified challenges and derived model will be contrasted with literature of\nrelated supply chains in terms of model formulations and suitable optimisation\nmethods. Finally, needed technological advancements are discussed to pave the\nway to affordable commercialisation of PM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 12:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

This approach enables better resource management while being\nscalable, reliable, and cost-effective. However, it comes with a number of\norganizational and technical difficulties which stem from the interaction\nbetween the application and the cloud infrastructure, for example, having to\nset up a recurring task of reuploading updated files. In this paper, we present\nKotless - a Kotlin Serverless Framework. Kotless is a cloud-agnostic toolkit\nthat solves these problems by interweaving the deployed application into the\ncloud infrastructure and automatically generating the necessary deployment\ncode. This relieves developers from having to spend their time integrating and\nmanaging their applications instead of developing them. Kotless has proven its\ncapabilities and has been used to develop several serverless applications\nalready in production.

However, theoretical efforts to tackle\nthis fundamental problem are lacking, despite the abundant empirical data about\nthe brain that has been collected in the past few decades. To address this\nshortcoming, this document introduces a hypothetical framework for the\nfunctional nature of primitive neural networks. It analyzes the idea that the\nactivity of neurons and synapses can symbolically reenact the dynamic changes\nin the world and thus enable an adaptive system of behavior. More\nsignificantly, the network achieves this without participating in an\nalgorithmic structure. When a neuron's activation represents some symbolic\nelement in the environment, each of its synapses can indicate a potential\nchange to the element and its future state. The efficacy of a synaptic\nconnection further specifies the element's particular probability for, or\ncontribution to, such a change. As it fires, a neuron's activation is\ntransformed to its postsynaptic targets, resulting in a chronological shift of\nthe represented elements. As the inherent function of summation in a neuron\nintegrates the various presynaptic contributions, the neural network mimics the\ncollective causal relationship of events in the observed environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 05:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 06:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

This allows users to interact with uploaded\nmodels in real time to assess their quality, and permits the collection of\nadditional metrics such as memory use, throughput, and robustness, which --\ndespite their importance to practitioners -- have traditionally been absent\nfrom leaderboards. On each task, models are ranked according to the Dynascore,\na novel utility-based aggregation of these statistics, which users can\ncustomize to better reflect their preferences, placing more/less weight on a\nparticular axis of evaluation or dataset.

This directly influences spatial variability of the\nsnowpack as well as cumulative snow height. Contemporary glacier retreat\nreorganizes periglacial morphology: while the glacier area decreases, the\nmoraine area increases. The latter is becoming a new water storage potential\nalmost as important as the glacier itself, but with a much more complex\ntopography. This work hence fills one of the missing variables of the\nhydrological budget equation of an arctic glacier basin by providing an\nestimate of the snow water equivalent (SWE) of the moraine contribution. Such a\nresult is achieved by investigating Structure from Motion (SfM) image\nprocessing applied to pictures collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nas a method to produce snow depth maps over the proglacial moraine area.\nSeveral UAV campaigns were carried out on a small glacial basin in Spitsbergen\n(Arctic): measurements were made at the maximum snow accumulation season (late\nApril) while reference topography maps were acquired at the end of hydrological\nyear (late September) when the moraine is mostly free of snow. Snow depth is\ndetermined from Digital Surface Model (DSM) subtraction. Using dedicated and\nnatural ground control points for relative positioning of the DSMs, the\nrelative DSM georeferencing with sub-meter accuracy removes the main source of\nuncertainty when assessing snow depth. For areas where snow is deposited on\nbare rock surfaces, the correlation between avalanche probe in-situ snow depth\nmeasurements and DSM differences is excellent. Differences in ice covered areas\nbetween the two measurement techniques are attributed to the different\nquantities measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 19:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

WGMs excitation is\ncarried out by free-space coupling of optical radiation to a microsphere. The\ndistinctive feature of proposed sensor design is double excitation of optical\neigenmodes by forward and backward propagating radiation reflected from a\nmembrane that causes WGMs interference in particle volume. The optical\nintensity of resulting resonant field established in the microsphere carries\ninformation about the exact position of the pressure-loaded reflecting\nmembrane. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor strongly depends on the\nquality factor of the excited resonant mode, as well as geometrical and\nmechanical parameters of the flexible membrane.
