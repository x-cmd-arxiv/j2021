While parallel MRI and constrained image reconstruction\nalgorithms can accelerate the scans, image reconstruction artifacts are\ninevitable, especially at high acceleration factors. We introduce a novel image\ndomain deep-learning framework for calibrationless parallel MRI reconstruction,\ncoupled with a segmentation network to improve image quality and to reduce the\nvulnerability of current segmentation algorithms to image artifacts resulting\nfrom acceleration. The combination of the proposed image domain deep\ncalibrationless approach with the segmentation algorithm offers improved image\nquality, while increasing the accuracy of the segmentations. The novel\narchitecture with an encoder shared between the reconstruction and segmentation\ntasks is seen to reduce the need for segmented training datasets.

BO is a method to optimize\nexpensive black-box functions, by using a regression as a surrogate to guide\nthe search. In clinical trials, planning test procedures and sample sizes is a\ncrucial task. A common goal is to maximize the test power, given a set of\ntreatments, corresponding effect sizes, and a total number of samples. From a\nwide range of possible designs we aim to select the best one in a short time to\nallow quick decisions. The standard approach to simulate the power for each\nsingle design can become too time-consuming.

This impediment deteriorate the performance of the\nUAV-enabled cellular network and hinders wide adoption and use of the\ntechnology.

A nodal\nline from band inversion is a typical band structure to generate strong AHE.\nWhereas, in most collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), the integration of Berry\ncurvatures on Brillouin zone is forced to zero by the joint $TO$ symmetry,\nwhere $T$ and $O$ are time reversal and a space group operation, respectively.\nEven with inverted band structures, such kind of AFM cannot have AHE.\nTherefore, so far, AFM nodal line band structures constructed by spin\ndegenerated bands didn't get much attentions in AHE materials.

A Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) is used to model jets as\nsequences of constituent four-vectors. After applying a pre-processing method\nwhich boosts each jet to the same reference mass and energy, the VRNN provides\neach jet an Anomaly Score that distinguishes between the structure of signal\nand background jets. The model is trained in an entirely unsupervised setting\nand without high level variables, making the score more robust against mass and\n$p_{T}$ correlations when compared to methods based primarily on jet\nsubstructure. Performance is evaluated on the jet level, as well as in an\nanalysis context by searching for a heavy resonance with a final state of two\nboosted jets. The Anomaly Score shows consistent performance along a wide range\nof signal contamination amounts, for both two and three-pronged jet\nsubstructure hypotheses. Analysis results demonstrate that the use of Anomaly\nScore as a classifier enhances signal sensitivity while retaining a smoothly\nfalling background jet mass distribution.

We study the effects of tidal resonance locking, in which the planet\nlocks into resonance with a tidally excited stellar gravity mode. Because a\nstar's gravity mode frequencies typically increase as the star evolves, the\nplanet's orbital frequency increases in lockstep, potentially causing much\nfaster orbital decay than predicted by other tidal theories. Due to nonlinear\nmode damping, resonance locking in Sun-like stars likely only operates for\nlow-mass planets ($M \\lesssim 0.1 \\, M_{\\rm Jup}$), but in stars with\nconvective cores it can likely operate for all planetary masses. The orbital\ndecay timescale with resonance locking is typically comparable to the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime, corresponding to a wide range in effective stellar\nquality factor ($10^3 \\lesssim Q' \\lesssim 10^9$), depending on the planet's\nmass and orbital period. We make predictions for several individual systems and\nexamine the orbital evolution resulting from both resonance locking and\nnonlinear wave dissipation.

We apply these synthetic bugs toward two ends.\nFirst, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K\nrepositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute\ntests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that\nare covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information\nsuch as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model\nwhich was pretrained on raw source code.

These BICs possess an invariant\ntopological charge given by the winding number of the polarization vectors,\nsimilarly to vortices in quantum fluids, such as superfluid helium and atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates. In spite of several reports of optical BICs in\npatterned dielectric slabs with evidence of lasing, their potential as\ntopologically protected states with theoretically infinite lifetime has not\nbeen fully exploited, yet. Here we show Bose-Einstein condensation of\npolaritons, hybrid light-matter excitations, occuring in a BIC thanks to its\npeculiar non-radiative nature.

While the\nauctioneer takes as given the auction rule of the click-through auction, namely\nthe generalized second-price auction, the auctioneer can design the information\nflow regarding the click-through rates among the bidders. A natural requirement\nin this context is to ask for the information structure to be calibrated in the\nlearning sense. With this constraint, the auction needs to rank the ads by a\nproduct of the bid and an unbiased estimator of the click-through rates, and\nthe task of designing an optimal information structure is thus reduced to the\ntask of designing an optimal unbiased estimator.\n  We show that in a symmetric setting with uncertainty about the click-through\nrates, the optimal information structure attains both social efficiency and\nsurplus extraction.

In order to exploit\ncorrelations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed\nunder consideration of permutation-equivariance.

Greater levels of drag increase occur\nwhen more transpiration takes place at the boundary plane, with turbulent\ntranspiration being predominately coupled to the spanwise shear component for\ncanonical near-wall turbulence.

A nontrivial conclusion is that the\ndynamics can be equally well reproduced by an all-to-all coupled as well as by\na locally coupled model of the same agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 20:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

To address this issue, this\npaper presents DistTune based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the\nNelder-Mead method. Whenever encountering an unprocessed detector, DistTune\ndecides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the\ndetector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic\nspeed patterns they have observed.

We develop novel diagnostic\ntools designed to probe the level of coherence among triadic interactions\nrealizing different flow scenarios. We consider extreme 1D viscous Burgers\nflows and 3D Navier-Stokes flows which are complemented by singularity-forming\ninviscid Burgers flows as well as viscous Burgers flows and Navier-Stokes flows\ncorresponding to generic turbulent and simple unimodal initial data, such as\nthe Taylor-Green vortex. The main finding is that while the extreme viscous\nBurgers and Navier-Stokes flows reveal the same relative level of enstrophy\namplification by nonlinear effects, this behaviour is realized via modal\ninteractions with vastly different levels of coherence. In the viscous Burgers\nflows the flux-carrying triads have phase values which saturate the\nnonlinearity thereby maximizing the energy flux towards small scales. On the\nother hand, in 3D Navier-Stokes flows with the extreme initial data the energy\nflux to small scales is realized by a very small subset of helical triads. The\nsecond main finding concerns the role of initial coherence. Comparison of the\nflows resulting from the extreme and generic initial conditions shows striking\nsimilarities between these two types of flows, for the 1D viscous Burgers\nequation as well as the 3D Navier-Stokes equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 22:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

This raises the much\npublicised possibility that `Oumuamua is artificial in origin, sent\nintentionally across interstellar space by an alien civilisation, This\nconclusion, however, relies upon the common misapprehension that light (solar)\nsails can accelerate to a considerable fraction of the speed of light,\npermitting rapid interstellar travel. We show that such speeds are unattainable\nfor conceptual man-made sails and that, based upon its observed parameters,\n`Oumuamua would require half a billion years just to travel to our solar system\nfrom its closest likely system of origin. These cosmological time-scales make\nit very unlikely that this is a probe sent by an alien civilisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 23:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The ever increasing number of wireless devices\nand systems has led to a crowded spectrum and increased the demand for\nversatile and multi-functional full-duplex wireless apparatuses. Recently,\ndynamic and intelligent metasurfaces are explored as a prominent technological\nsolution to the current paradigm of spectrum scarcity by opportunistically\nsharing the spectrum with various users. In general, intelligent metasurfaces\nare dynamic, ultra-compact, multi-functional and programmable structures which\nare capable of both reciprocal and nonreciprocal signal wave transmissions in a\nfull-duplex manner.

Let us given a\ngraph with a weight and a capacity function on its edges, and a set of its\nsubgraphs along with a degree upper bound function for each of them. We are\nalso given a laminar system on the node set with an upper bound on the\ndegree-sum in each member of the system. Our goal is to assign each edge a\nnon-negative integer below its capacity such that the total weight is\nmaximized, the degrees in each subgraph are below the associated degree upper\nbound, and the degree-sum bound is respected in each member of the laminar\nsystem.\n  We identify special cases when the problem is solvable in polynomial time.\nOne of these cases is a common generalization of the hierarchical $b$-matching\nproblem and the laminar matchoid problem. This implies that both problems can\nbe solved efficiently in the weighted, capacitated case even if both lower and\nupper bounds are present -- generalizing the previous polynomial-time\nalgorithms. The problem is solvable for trees provided that the laminar system\nis empty and a natural assumption holds for the subgraphs.\n  The general problem, however, is shown to be APX-hard in the unweighted case,\nwhich implies that the $d$-distance matching problem is APX-hard. Furthermore,\nwe prove that the approximation guarantee of any polynomial-time algorithm must\nincrease linearly in the number of the given subgraphs unless P=NP. We give a\ngeneric framework for deriving approximation algorithms, which can be applied\nto a wide range of problems. As an application to our problem, a\nconstant-approximation algorithm is derived when the number of the subgraphs is\na constant.

This paper\naddresses a new challenging problem of camouflaged object segmentation. To\naddress this problem, we provide a new image dataset of camouflaged objects for\nbenchmarking purposes. In addition, we propose a general end-to-end network,\ncalled the Anabranch Network, that leverages both classification and\nsegmentation tasks. Different from existing networks for segmentation, our\nproposed network possesses the second branch for classification to predict the\nprobability of containing camouflaged object(s) in an image, which is then\nfused into the main branch for segmentation to boost up the segmentation\naccuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on the newly built dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our network using various fully convolutional\nnetworks. \\url{https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/camo}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 01:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on\nlatent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that\nmaximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.\nWe call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions\nsuch as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of\npre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or\nboundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns\npolicies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream\nof data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection\nstatistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created\nand deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones\nmight be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until\nunforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid\nresponses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in\norder to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a\n(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model\nthe different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We\nevaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning\nproblems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and\nmodel-based) RL algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art meta-learning methods\nspecially designed to deal with non-stationarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 01:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

The detector network of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo\nallows us to measure different linear combinations of the polarization modes\nand therefore we can constrain the polarization content by analyzing how the\npolarization modes are linearly combined. We propose the basis formulation to\nconstruct a null stream along the polarization basis modes without requiring\nmodeling the basis explicitly. We conduct a mock data study and we show that\nthe framework is capable of probing pure and mixed polarizations in the\nAdvanced LIGO-Advanced Virgo 3-detector network without knowing the sky\nlocation of the source from electromagnetic counterparts. We also discuss the\neffect of the presence of the uncaptured orthogonal polarization component in\nthe framework, and we propose using the plug-in method to test the existence of\nthe orthogonal polarizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 03:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 03:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Local random walk is considered to\nbe one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local\nmethods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a\nlimited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step\namong the nodes which have equal importance.

Our first algorithm, which is based on the idea of random\nsequential adsorption (RSA) process from the statistical physics literature,\ncan be implemented in a distributed and scalable manner while ensuring a\nminimum distance among the co-pilot users. Further, leveraging the rich\nliterature of the RSA process, we present an approximate analytical approach to\naccurately determine the density of the co-pilot users as well as the pilot\nassignment probability for the typical user in this network. We also develop\ntwo optimization-based centralized pilot allocation schemes with the primary\ngoal of benchmarking the RSA-based scheme. The first centralized scheme is\nbased only on the user locations (just like the RSA-based scheme) and\npartitions the users into sets of co-pilot users such that the minimum distance\nbetween two users in a partition is maximized. The second centralized scheme\ntakes both user and remote radio head (RRH) locations into account and provides\na near-optimal solution in terms of sum-user spectral efficiency (SE). The\ngeneral idea is to first cluster the users with similar propagation conditions\nwith respect to the RRHs using spectral graph theory and then ensure that the\nusers in each cluster are assigned different pilots using the branch and price\n(BnP) algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate that despite admitting\ndistributed implementation, the RSA-based scheme has a competitive performance\nwith respect to the first centralized scheme in all regimes as well as to the\nnear-optimal second scheme when the density of RRHs is high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 04:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

The results indicate that twisted\nmagnetic layer provides a new setting to engineer and tune a plethora of novel\nand exotic skyrmion phases and their dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 05:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

During this transition a rapid evolution in X-ray timing\nproperties and a short-lived radio flare were observed, both of which were\nlinked to the launching of bi-polar, long-lived relativistic ejecta. We provide\ndetailed analysis of two Very Long Baseline Array observations, using both time\nbinning and a new dynamic phase centre tracking technique to mitigate the\neffects of smearing when observing fast-moving ejecta at high angular\nresolution.

This is possible by considering the training of a deep neural network\nas a stochastic optimal control problem, which is solved using mean-field type\ncontrol. The optimality conditions for the stochastic optimal control problem\nyield a system of partial differential equations, which we reduce to a system\nof equations of quantum hydrodynamics.

In this paper, we propose four\nways of collaborative learning among different parts of a single network with\nnegligible engineering efforts. To improve the robustness of the network, we\nleverage the consistency of the output layer and intermediate layers for\ntraining under the collaborative learning framework.

Generally speaking, interacted examples are\nconsidered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted\nones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A\nnoisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative\nuser preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of\nunawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference.\nConventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to\nsub-optimal recommendations. In this work, we propose a novel framework to\nlearn robust recommenders from implicit feedback. Through an empirical study,\nwe find that different models make relatively similar predictions on clean\nexamples which denote the real user preference, while the predictions on noisy\nexamples vary much more across different models. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose denoising with cross-model agreement(DeCA) which aims to minimize\nthe KL-divergence between the real user preference distributions parameterized\nby two recommendation models while maximizing the likelihood of data\nobservation.

These functionals are often used when\ndealing with optimization problems where the computation of the gradient of the\nobjective function is costly or the objective function values are affected by\nsome noise. These functionals have been considered to estimate the gradient of\nthe objective function by the expected value of the function variations in the\nspace of directions. The expected value is then approximated by a sample\naverage over a proper (random) choice of sample directions in the domain of\nintegration. In this way the approximation error is characterized by\nstatistical properties of the sample average estimate, typically its variance.\nThis work instead is aimed at deriving a new approximation scheme, where linear\nfunctionals are no longer considered as expected values over the space of\ndirections, but rather as the filtered derivative of the objective function by\na gaussian kernel. By using this new approach, a gradient estimation based on a\nsuitable linear combination of central finite differences at different step\nsizes is proposed, allowing to characterize the error of approximation in a\ndeterministic way. Numerical experiments on a set of test functions are\nencouraging, showing good performances compared to those of the methods\ncommonly used in the literature, both in the noisy and in the non-noisy\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 09:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Various models have been proposed to understand the\nchirping mechanism, which is a long-standing problem in space plasmas. Based on\nanalysis of effective wave growth rate and electron phase space dynamics in a\nself-consistent particle simulation, we propose here a phenomenological model\ncalled the \"Trap-Release-Amplify\" (TaRA) model for chorus. In this model, phase\nspace structures of correlated electrons are formed by nonlinear wave particle\ninteractions, which mainly occur in the downstream. When released from the wave\npacket in the upstream, these electrons selectively amplify new emissions which\nsatisfy the phase-locking condition to maximize wave power transfer, leading to\nfrequency chirping. The phase-locking condition at the release point gives a\nfrequency chirping rate that is fully consistent with the one by Helliwell in\ncase of a nonuniform background magnetic field. The nonlinear wave particle\ninteraction part of the TaRA model results in a chirping rate that is\nproportional to wave amplitude, a conclusion originally reached by Vomvoridis\net al. Therefore, the TaRA model unifies two different results from seemingly\nunrelated studies. Furthermore, the TaRA model naturally explains fine\nstructures of chorus waves, including subpackets and bandwidth, and their\nevolution through dynamics of phase-trapped electrons. Finally, we suggest that\nthis model could be applied to explain other related phenomena, including\nfrequency chirping of chorus in a uniform background magnetic field and of\nelectromagnetic ion cyclotron waves in the magnetosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 09:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

To address this\nproblem, the completion method for a tensor based on a Biased Deep Tensor\nFactorization Network (BDTFN) is proposed. This method can not only overcome\nthe shortcomings of traditional tensor factorization, but also deal with\ncomplex non-linear data. Firstly, the horizontal and lateral tensors\ncorresponding to the observed values of the input tensors are used as inputs\nand projected to obtain their horizontal (lateral) potential feature tensors.\nSecondly, the horizontal (lateral) potential feature tensors are respectively\nconstructed into a multilayer perceptron network. Finally, the horizontal and\nlateral output tensors are fused by constructing a bilinear pooling layer.\nTensor forward-propagation is composed of those three step, and its parameters\nare updated by tensor back-propagation using the multivariable chain rule.

In this paper we present the novel TreeRay method for solving general\nradiative transfer problems, based on reverse ray tracing combined with\ntree-based accelerated integration. We implement TreeRay in the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH, as a module of the tree solver developed by W\\\"unsch et\nal. However, the method itself is independent of the host code and can be\nimplemented in any grid based or particle based hydrodynamics code. A key\nadvantage of TreeRay is that its computational cost is independent of the\nnumber of sources, making it suitable for simulations with many point sources\n(e.g. massive star clusters) as well as simulations where diffuse emission is\nimportant. A very efficient communication and tree-walk strategy enables\nTreeRay to achieve almost ideal parallel scalings. TreeRay can easily be\nextended with sub-modules to treat radiative transfer at different wavelengths\nand to implement related physical processes. Here, we focus on ionising (EUV)\nradiation and use the On-the-Spot approximation to test the method and its\nparameters. The ability to set the tree solver time step independently enables\nthe speedy calculation of radiative transfer in a multi-phase interstellar\nmedium, where the hydrodynamic time step is typically limited by the sound\nspeed of the hot gas produced in stellar wind bubbles or supernova remnants. We\nshow that complicated simulations of star clusters with feedback from multiple\nmassive stars become feasible with TreeRay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 10:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

It began to spread at the end of 2019 and has now spread across the\nworld. Until October 2020, It has infected around 37 million people and claimed\nabout 1 million lives. We propose a deep learning model that can help\nradiologists and clinicians use chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19 cases and\nshow the diagnostic features of pneumonia. Methods: The approach in this study\nis: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the\ndata set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our\ndeep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to\nthe DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly\nimproved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library\nto mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more\nquickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the\ndata with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training\nrespectively. At last, comparing two experimental results: among the 10 network\nmodels with different structures, 7 network models have improved their effects\nafter using data enhancement, with an average improvement of 1% in recognition\naccuracy. We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network\nare 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs.\nnormal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by\n2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective\nresults on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data\naugmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the\nsample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can\neffectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 11:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human\nmotion's balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part\nto whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions\nare sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called\nbalance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to\ncharacterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build\nnew joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and\nthus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the\nBA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,\nmainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and\nMulti-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE).

The number of the constraints depends on the size of\nstate and action spaces, which makes the problem intractable in large or\ncontinuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the\ndouble-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional\nexpectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic\npenalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling\nand evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the\nobstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the\nintractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep\nparameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the\nreplacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the\naugmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general\ntheoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the\nconstrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the\nerror is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty\nalgorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be\narbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is\nchosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is\ncompetitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 13:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

To address this, we present the design of a 6 MeV high capture\nefficiency S-band electron linac that captures 90% of the initial DC beam. This\nlinac does not require any extra parts that would increase the cost as the high\nefficiency is achieved via a low-field-amplitude in the first bunching cell to\ndecrease the number of backstreaming electrons, to velocity bunch the electron\nbeam, and recapture backstreaming electrons.

Acquired results confirm\nthe dynamical and thermal stability of BeN4, MgN4, IrN4, PtN4 and RhN4\nmonolayers.

We also elaborately explore the effects of number\nof atomic layers on the electronic features of BeN4 nanosheets, which reveal\nhighly appealing physics. Our results highlight that BeN4 nanosheet yield\nultrahigh elastic modulus and mechanical strength, outperforming all other\ncarbon-free 2D materials.

In particular, a coupling\nto the electromagnetic sector leads to a time (redshift) dependence of the\nfine-structure constant and a violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. Here\nwe extend the previous Euclid forecast constraints on dark energy models to\nthis enlarged (but physically more realistic) parameter space, and forecast how\nwell Euclid, together with high-resolution spectroscopic data and local\nexperiments, can constrain these models. Our analysis combines simulated Euclid\ndata products with astrophysical measurements of the fine-structure constant,\n$\\alpha$, and local experimental constraints, and includes both parametric and\nnon-parametric methods. For the astrophysical measurements of $\\alpha$ we\nconsider both the currently available data and a simulated dataset\nrepresentative of Extremely Large Telescope measurements and expected to be\navailable in the 2030s. Our parametric analysis shows that in the latter case\nthe inclusion of astrophysical and local data improves the Euclid dark energy\nfigure of merit by between $8\\%$ and $26\\%$, depending on the correct fiducial\nmodel, with the improvements being larger in the null case where the fiducial\ncoupling to the electromagnetic sector is vanishing. These improvements would\nbe smaller with the current astrophysical data. Moreover, we illustrate how a\ngenetic algorithms based reconstruction provides a null test for the presence\nof the coupling.

Once the initial density and velocity field are specified, the\nevolution of the axion fluid is unique in the classical field treatment.\nHowever, in the quantum field treatment, there are many quantum states\nconsistent with the given initial density and velocity field.

This transformer can be applied to a\nwide class of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, converting a given\nfault free synchronous algorithm that satisfies certain conditions into a\nself-stabilizing synchronous algorithm for the same problem. The resulting\nself-stabilizing algorithms are anonymous, size-uniform, and \\emph{fully\nadaptive} in the sense that their time complexity is bounded as a function of\nthe number $k$ of nodes that suffered faults (possibly at different times)\nsince the last legal configuration. Specifically, for graphs whose degrees are\nup-bounded by $\\Delta$, the algorithms produced by the transformer stabilize in\ntime proportional to $\\log (k + \\Delta)$ in expectation, independently of the\nnumber of nodes in the graph. As such, the transformer is applicable also for\ninfinite graphs (with degree bound $\\Delta$). Another appealing feature of the\ntransformer is its small message size overhead. The transformer is applied to\nknown algorithms (or simple variants thereof) for some classic LCL problems,\nproducing the first anonymous size-uniform self-stabilizing algorithms for\nthese problems that are provably fully adaptive. From a technical point of\nview, the transformer's key design feature is a novel probabilistic tool that\nallows different nodes to act in synchrony even though their clocks may have\nbeen adversarially manipulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 14:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 12:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

However, M83's nuclear star\nformation rate (SFR), as estimated by synchrotron and H-alpha emission, is an\norder of magnitude higher than the Milky Way's. To understand the origin of\nthis difference we use ALMA observations of HCN (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) to trace\nthe dense gas at the size scale of individual molecular clouds (0.54\", 12pc) in\nthe inner ~500 pc of M83, and compare this to gas clouds at similar resolution\nand galactocentric radius in the Milky Way. We find that both the overall gas\ndistribution and the properties of individual clouds are very similar in the\ntwo galaxies, and that a common mechanism may be responsible for instigating\nstar formation in both circumnuclear rings. Given the considerable similarity\nin gas properties, the most likely explanation for the order of magnitude\ndifference in SFR is time variability, with the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)\ncurrently being at a more quiescent phase of its star formation cycle. We show\nM83's SFR must have been an order of magnitude higher 5-7 Myr ago. M83's\n`starburst' phase was highly localised, both spatially and temporally, greatly\nincreasing the feedback efficiency and ability to drive galactic-scale\noutflows.

For an assumed age\nof 5 Gyr for the system, we get detectable mass limits as low as 4.4 $M_{\\rm\nJ}$ in NaCo $L^{\\prime}$ and 8.2 $M_{\\rm J}$ in NEAR bands at 1.5$\\arcsec$ from\nthe central star.

Both methods are based on the\nFloquet-Bloch transform which transforms the original problem to an equivalent\nfamily of cell problems. The first method, which is designed based on a complex\ncontour integral of the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform, is called the CCI\nmethod. The second method, which comes from an explicit definition of the\nradiation condition, is called the decomposition method. Due to the local\nperturbation, the family of cell problems are coupled with respect to the\nFloquet parameter and the computational complexity becomes much larger.

To make matters worse, this high\ninference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with\nlonger documents requiring more time and computation. To address this\nchallenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages\nof a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before\nrunning a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM.

While YouTube's recommendation\nalgorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's\nmonetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not\nentirely understood. In this thesis, we shed some light on the degree of\nproblematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in\nthe dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative\napproach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the\nrisks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the\nrecommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by\nfocusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure\nto pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this\nexposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that\nyoung children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly\nbrowse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that\nIncel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active\nrole in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying\npseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more\npseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g.,\nflat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these\nrecommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's\nhomepage or the video recommendations section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 15:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness\nproblems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on\nitems, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.\nTherefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for\nusers to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works\non fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it\nis important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness\nnotions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on\nthe above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized\ncounterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems.

It has been argued that GCIRS 7 is a pulsating body, on the basis\nof photometric variability. We present the first medium-resolution ($R=500$),\nK-band spectro-interferometric observations of GCIRS 7, using the GRAVITY\ninstrument with the four auxiliary telescopes of the ESO VLTI. We looked for\nvariations using two epochs, namely 2017 and 2019.

The narrow-band uniform-disk diameter increases above\n2.3 $\\mu$m, with a clear correlation with the CO band heads in the spectrum.\nThis correlation is aptly modeled by a hot ($T_\\text{L}=2368\\pm37$ K),\ngeometrically thin molecular shell with a diameter of\n$\\theta_\\text{L}=1.74\\pm0.03$ mas, as measured in 2017.

After briefly reviewing the basics of statistical\nhypothesis testing, uncertainty sets are introduced as a generic way of\nmodeling distributional uncertainty. The design of minimax detectors is then\nshown to reduce to the problem of determining a pair of least favorable\ndistributions, and different criteria for their characterization are discussed.\nExplicit expressions are given for least favorable distributions under three\ntypes of uncertainty: $\\varepsilon$-contamination, probability density bands,\nand $f$-divergence balls.

Recently, a series of models have\nattempted to relieve these issues by first augmenting the node features and\nthen imposing node-wise functions based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which\nare widely referred to as GA-MLP models. However, while GA-MLP models enjoy\ndeeper architectures for better accuracy, their efficiency largely\ndeteriorates. Moreover, popular acceleration techniques such as\nstochastic-version or data-parallelism cannot be effectively applied due to the\ndependency among samples (i.e., nodes) in graphs. To address these issues, in\nthis paper, instead of data parallelism, we propose a parallel graph deep\nlearning Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (pdADMM-G) framework to\nachieve model parallelism: parameters in each layer of GA-MLP models can be\nupdated in parallel. The extended pdADMM-G-Q algorithm reduces communication\ncosts by introducing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a\n(quantized) stationary point of the pdADMM-G algorithm and the pdADMM-G-Q\nalgorithm is provided with a sublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$, where $k$ is\nthe number of iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the convergence of\ntwo proposed algorithms.

The analysis of radiation\ntreatment planning using the OMAR and NMAR techniques in the corrected CT\nimages showed that the OMAR technique reduced the toxicity of healthy tissues\nby 10% compared to the uncorrected CT images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 15:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

First, we establish a bijective\nrelationship between depth and the visual disparity of two consecutive frames\nand show how to exploit it to perform motion-invariant pixel-wise depth\nestimation. Then, we detail M4Depth which is based on a pyramidal convolutional\nneural network architecture where each level refines an input disparity map\nestimate by using two customized cost volumes. We use these cost volumes to\nleverage the visual spatio-temporal constraints imposed by motion and to make\nthe network robust for varied scenes.

This paper draws from management literature on\ncertification and reviews current AI certification programs and proposals.\nSuccessful programs rely on both emerging technical methods and specific design\nconsiderations. In order to avoid two common failures of certification, program\ndesigns should ensure that the symbol of the certification is substantially\nimplemented in practice and that the program achieves its stated goals. The\nreview indicates that the field currently focuses on self-certification and\nthird-party certification of systems, individuals, and organizations - to the\nexclusion of process management certifications. Additionally, the paper\nconsiders prospects for future AI certification programs. Ongoing changes in AI\ntechnology suggest that AI certification regimes should be designed to\nemphasize governance criteria of enduring value, such as ethics training for AI\ndevelopers, and to adjust technical criteria as the technology changes.\nOverall, certification can play a valuable mix in the portfolio of AI\ngovernance tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 08:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Is it possible to say which\nmode of disease transmission is predominant in large indoor spaces? We\naddressed this question by measuring the transport of aerosols equivalent to\nthe size of human respiratory particles in two large hardware stores (V>10000\nm$^3$). We found that aerosol concentrations in both stores decreased rapidly\nand almost independently of aerosol size, despite the different ventilation\nsystems. A persistent and directional airflow on the order of a few cm/s was\nobserved in both stores. Consequently, aerosol dynamics in such open settings\ncan be expected to be dominated by turbulent dispersion and sweeping, and the\naccumulation of infectious aerosols in the indoor air is unlikely to contribute\nsignificantly to the risk of infection as long as the occupancy of the store is\nnot too high. Under these conditions, well-fitting face masks are an excellent\nmeans of preventing disease transmission by human aerosols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 11:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 09:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Due to this, computer\nvision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can\npredict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree.

However, due to the range of factors influencing news agencies,\nsuch coverage may not always be impartial. Media bias, or slanted news\ncoverage, can have a substantial impact on public perception of events, and,\naccordingly, can potentially alter the beliefs and views of the public. The\nmain data gap in current research on media bias detection is a robust,\nrepresentative, and diverse dataset containing annotations of biased words and\nsentences. In particular, existing datasets do not control for the individual\nbackground of annotators, which may affect their assessment and, thus,\nrepresents critical information for contextualizing their annotations. In this\nposter, we present a matrix-based methodology to crowdsource such data using a\nself-developed annotation platform. We also present MBIC (Media Bias Including\nCharacteristics) - the first sample of 1,700 statements representing various\nmedia bias instances. The statements were reviewed by ten annotators each and\ncontain labels for media bias identification both on the word and sentence\nlevel. MBIC is the first available dataset about media bias reporting detailed\ninformation on annotator characteristics and their individual background. The\ncurrent dataset already significantly extends existing data in this domain\nproviding unique and more reliable insights into the perception of bias. In\nfuture, we will further extend it both with respect to the number of articles\nand annotators per article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 15:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Several features of this result require more detailed description,\nto be given in the text. The equality is significant and unexpected. So is the\nstatement that the equality is independent of the rate of change from state A\nto state B. A few years ago, I had presented three papers in which the\ncontraction of the description from full phase space to coordinate space only\nwas made. This was motivated by the large difference in time scales for momenta\nrelaxation and coordinate relaxation. The Jarzynski equality (JE) will be shown\nhere to be correct only in the limit of extremely slow processes. The proposed\ncounterexample is for a macromolecular harmonic oscillator with a Hooke's\nspring constant, k, that during the time interval linearly changes from k1 to\nk2. When performed very slowly, we obtain JE in a form in which the free energy\nis related to the ratio of the k's. However, when the transition is performed\nmore rapidly the equality is lost.
