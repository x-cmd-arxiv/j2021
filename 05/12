Understanding the coupled heat and mass\ntransfer processes is important for the design of beamline cryogenic systems.\nOur past experimental study on nitrogen gas propagating in a copper tube cooled\nby normal liquid helium (He I) has revealed a nearly exponential slowing down\nof the gas front. A theoretical model that accounts for the interplay of the\ngas dynamics and the condensation was developed, which successfully reproduced\nvarious key observations. However, since many accelerator beamlines are\nactually cooled by the superfluid phase of helium (He II) in which the heat\ntransfer is via a non-classical thermal-counterflow mode, we need to extend our\nwork to the He II cooled tube. This paper reports our systematic measurements\nusing He II and the numerical simulations based on a modified model that\naccounts for the He II heat-transfer characteristics. By tuning the He II peak\nheat-flux parameter in our model, we have reproduced the observed gas dynamics\nin all experimental runs. The fine-tuned model is then utilized to reliably\nevaluate the heat deposition in He II.

In the shuffle model, each of the $n$ clients randomizes its response\nusing a local differentially private (LDP) mechanism and the untrusted server\nonly receives a random permutation (shuffle) of the client responses without\nassociation to each client. The principal result in this paper is the first\nnon-trivial RDP guarantee for general discrete local randomization mechanisms\nin the shuffled privacy model, and we develop new analysis techniques for\nderiving our results which could be of independent interest. In applications,\nsuch an RDP guarantee is most useful when we use it for composing several\nprivate interactions. We numerically demonstrate that, for important regimes,\nwith composition our bound yields an improvement in privacy guarantee by a\nfactor of $8\\times$ over the state-of-the-art approximate Differential Privacy\n(DP) guarantee (with standard composition) for shuffled models. Moreover,\ncombining with Poisson subsampling, our result leads to at least $10\\times$\nimprovement over subsampled approximate DP with standard composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 16:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Advanced statistical workflows\npermitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine; their\nadoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often\nproduce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to\nspecify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated\ndeveloping an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that\nutilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy\nthrough the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more\naccurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary\ntissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction\nwith V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging\nrealm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high\nperformance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct\ndiseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic\nObstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included\nnone of these cases.

Here we describe an AI strategy,\nretro drug design, or RDD, to generate novel small molecule drugs from scratch\nto meet predefined requirements, including but not limited to biological\nactivity against a drug target, and optimal range of physicochemical and ADMET\nproperties. Traditional predictive models were first trained over experimental\ndata for the target properties, using an atom typing based molecular descriptor\nsystem, ATP. Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the\nsolutions in the ATP space defined by the target properties, and the deep\nlearning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the\nsolutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate\nnovel drugs that can activate {\\mu} opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood\nbrain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated\n180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000\n(31%) of the valid structures fell into the property space defined by MOR\nactivity and BBB permeability.

It also induces a\n\"Pauli repulsion\" in the interaction between di-nuclear systems. It has been\nshown in [Phys. Rev. C 95, 031601 (2017)] that the Pauli repulsion widens the\nnucleus-nucleus potential barrier, thus hindering sub-barrier fusion. Purpose:\nTo investigate the proton and neutron contributions to the Pauli repulsion,\nboth in the bare potential neglecting shape polarization and transfer between\nthe reactants, as well as in the dynamical potential obtained by accounting for\nsuch dynamical rearrangements. Methods: As the basis of our study we utilize\nthe Pauli kinetic energy (PKE) obtained by studying the nuclear localization\nfunction (NLF). Recently this approach has been generalized to incorporate all\nof the dynamical and time-odd terms present in the nuclear energy density\nfunctional. This approach is employed in the DCFHF and DC-TDHF methods.\nResults: The PKE spatial distribution shows that a repulsion occurs in the neck\nbetween the nuclei when they first touch. Inside the barrier, neutrons can\ncontribute significantly more to the Pauli repulsion in neutron-rich systems.\nDynamical effects tend to lower the Pauli repulsion near the barrier. Proton\nand neutron dynamical contributions to the PKE significantly differ inside the\nbarrier for asymmetric collisions, which is interpreted as an effect of\nmultinucleon transfer. Conclusions: The PKE is shown to make a significant\ncontribution to nuclear interaction potentials. Protons and neutrons can play\nvery different roles in both the bare potential and in the dynamical\nrearrangement. Further microscopic studies are required to better understand\nthe role of transfer and to investigate the effect of pairing and deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 17:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Even under this simplifying approximation, the inference of orbital\nelements is a challenging technical problem because of the high dimensionality\nof the parameter space, and the complex relationships between those parameters\nand the observations (astrometry and radial velocity). In this work we propose\na new methodology for the study of triple hierarchical systems using a Bayesian\nMarkov-Chain Monte Carlo-based framework. In particular, graphical models are\nintroduced to describe the probabilistic relationship between parameters and\nobservations in a dynamically self-consistent way. As information sources we\nconsider the cases of isolated astrometry, isolated radial velocity, as well as\nthe joint case with both types of measurements. Graphical models provide a\nnovel way of performing a factorization of the joint distribution (of parameter\nand observations) in terms of conditional independent components (factors), so\nthat the estimation can be performed in a two-stage process that combines\ndifferent observations sequentially. Our framework is tested against three\nwell-studied benchmark cases of triple systems, where we determine the inner\nand outer orbital elements, coupled with the mutual inclination of the orbits,\nand the individual stellar masses, along with posterior probability (density)\ndistributions for all these parameters. Our results are found to be consistent\nwith previous studies. We also provide a mathematical formalism to reduce the\ndimensionality in the parameter space for triple hierarchical stellar systems\nin general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

This has\nbeen achieved generally through a subharmonic response, in which the system\nundergoes one oscillation every other driving period. Here, we demonstrate that\nclassical time crystals do not need to resonate in a subharmonic fashion but\ninstead can also exhibit a continuously tunable anharmonic response to driving,\nwhich we show can emerge through a coresonance between modes in different\nbranches of the dispersion relation in a parametrically driven medium. This\nresponse, characterized by a typically incommensurate ratio between the\nresonant frequencies and the driving frequency, is demonstrated by introducing\na time crystal model consisting of an array of coupled pendula with alternating\nlengths. Importantly, the coresonance mechanism is the result of a bifurcation\ninvolving a fixed point and an invariant torus, with no intermediate limit\ncycles. This bifurcation thus gives rise to a many-body symmetry-breaking\nphenomenon directly connecting the symmetry-unbroken phase with a previously\nuncharacterized phase of matter, which we call an anharmonic time crystal\nphase.

Our approach includes several levels of\noptimization, such as circuit identities and error mitigation and allows us to\ncross the classical threshold and demonstrate quantum advantage in one quantum\ncomputer. We conclude by introducing a different inequality that allows us to\nobserve quantum advantage in less accurate quantum computers, at the expense of\nprobing a larger number of circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 18:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 19:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

We first show\nthat several halo and galaxy properties strongly correlate with the slope of\nthe sMAH ($\\beta$) at fixed halo mass. Namely, haloes with increasingly steeper\n$\\beta$ increment their halo masses faster at early times, and their hosted\ngalaxies present larger stellar-to-halo mass ratios, lose their gas faster,\nreach the peak of their star formation histories at higher redshift, and become\nquenched earlier.

Finally, we measure the secondary dependence\nof galaxy clustering on $\\beta$ at fixed halo mass as a function of redshift.\nBy tracing back the evolution of individual haloes, we show that the amplitude\nof the galaxy assembly bias signal for the progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies\nincreases with redshift, reaching a factor of 2 at $z = 1$ for haloes of\n$M_\\mathrm{halo}=10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

Methods that estimate 3D bodies, faces, or hands have progressed\nsignificantly, yet separately. Face methods recover accurate 3D shape and\ngeometric details, but need a tight crop and struggle with extreme views and\nlow resolution. Whole-body methods are robust to a wide range of poses and\nresolutions, but provide only a rough 3D face shape without details like\nwrinkles. To get the best of both worlds, we introduce PIXIE, which produces\nanimatable, whole-body 3D avatars with realistic facial detail, from a single\nimage. For this, PIXIE uses two key observations. First, existing work combines\nindependent estimates from body, face, and hand experts, by trusting them\nequally. PIXIE introduces a novel moderator that merges the features of the\nexperts, weighted by their confidence. All part experts can contribute to the\nwhole, using SMPL-X's shared shape space across all body parts. Second, human\nshape is highly correlated with gender, but existing work ignores this. We\nlabel training images as male, female, or non-binary, and train PIXIE to infer\n\"gendered\" 3D body shapes with a novel shape loss. In addition to 3D body pose\nand shape parameters, PIXIE estimates expression, illumination, albedo and 3D\nfacial surface displacements. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows\nthat PIXIE estimates more accurate whole-body shape and detailed face shape\nthan the state of the art.

Most studies using TR-NEWS in Earth Science\nhave focused on relatively small objects and may have multiple acoustic\nsources. In Earth, within energy extraction settings, the structure and scale\nof wellbores makes acoustic focusing challenging. This paper explores the\nfeasibility of applying TR NEWS for damage detection in wellbores by\nconstructing a laboratory-scale wellbore, and using TR to focus and make\ndynamic linear and nonlinear elastic measurements. After successive cycles of\ninduced, localized mechanical damage the sample, the hysteretic nonlinear\nelastic parameter {\\alpha}, increased with damage cycle indicating progressive\nmechanical damage. In addition to these strain-dependent changes, TR peak width\nand changes to peak amplitude near the damage sites was also observed. To\ndeploy TR in a wellbore, it will be necessary to choose sensors that are\nsuitable for the environment, and that can be distributed along the wellbore.\nThus, this paper demonstrates that acoustic TR can be conducted using both an\nintrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer fiber optic strain sensor, and an\nintrinsic Michaelson interferometer fiber optic strain sensor, as a first step\ntowards deployable sensing for TR in a wellbore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 19:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

The former\nis an individual guarantee, requiring that each agent prefers their own\nallocation over the allocation of any other; in contrast, efficiency is a\nglobal property, requiring that the allocations clear the available resources.\nFor divisible resources, when the number of individuals of each type are known\nupfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable for a large class\nof utility functions.

Recovering such missing or noisy (under-reported)\nelements of the input tensor can be viewed as a generalized tensor completion\nproblem. Existing tensor completion methods usually assume that i) missing\nelements are randomly distributed and ii) noise for each tensor element is\ni.i.d. zero-mean.

This investigation is careful to\nrespect the transformation rules of special relativity throughout.

A replacement flow velocity is derived\nwhich is completely consistent with those transformation rules.

Thus, we\nachieve to handle the limited spatio-temporal observations. Then, by\nintroducing a set of Kalman filters running in parallel, we mitigate the\nuncertainty related to a tuning parameter of the proposed augmented model.

To\nmodel such a scenario, we define identity concealment games: zero-sum\nstochastic reachability games with a zero-sum objective of identity\nconcealment. To measure the identity concealment of the player, we introduce\nthe notion of an average player. The average player's policy represents the\nexpected behavior of a non-hostile player. We show that there exists an\nequilibrium policy pair for every identity concealment game and give the\noptimality equations to synthesize an equilibrium policy pair. If the player's\nopponent follows a non-equilibrium policy, the player can hide its identity\nbetter. For this reason, we study how the hostile player may learn the\nopponent's policy. Since learning via exploration policies would quickly reveal\nthe hostile player's identity to the opponent, we consider the problem of\nlearning a near-optimal policy for the hostile player using the game runs\ncollected under the average player's policy. Consequently, we propose an\nalgorithm that provably learns a near-optimal policy and give an upper bound on\nthe number of sample runs to be collected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 00:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

Measurements of these\nprecipitation at low-altitude spacecraft are thus often used to remotely probe\nthe magnetotail current sheet configuration. This configuration may include\nspatially localized maxima of the curvature radius at equator (due to localized\nhumps of the equatorial magnetic field magnitude) that reduce the energetic\nparticle scattering and precipitation. Therefore, the measured precipitation\npatterns are related to the spatial distribution of the equatorial curvature\nradius that is determined by the magnetotail current sheet configuration. In\nthis study, we show that, contrary to previous thoughts, the magnetic field\nline configuration with the localized curvature radius maximum can actually\nenhance the scattering and subsequent precipitation.

The coupling of different components of the composite overlapping grid\nis through numerical interpolations. However, interpolations introduce\nperturbation to the finite-difference discretization, which causes numerical\ninstability for time-stepping schemes used to advance the resulted\nsemi-discrete system. To address the instability, we propose to add a\nfourth-order hyper-dissipation to the spatially discretized system to stabilize\nits time integration; this additional dissipation term captures the essential\nupwinding effect of the original upwind scheme. The investigation of strategies\nfor incorporating the upwind dissipation term into several time-stepping\nschemes (both explicit and implicit) leads to the development of four novel\nalgorithms. For each algorithm, formulas for determining a stable time step and\na sufficient dissipation coefficient on curvilinear grids are derived by\nperforming a local Fourier analysis.

Besides, the medium properties are usually highly\nheterogeneous, which will result in a large linear system that needs to be\nsolved. Therefore, it is intrinsically inevitable to seek a\ncomputational-efficient model reduction method to overcome the difficulty. We\nwill explore the combination of the reduced basis method and the GMsFEM. In\nparticular, we will use residual-driven basis functions, which are key\ningredients in GMsFEM. This local-global multiscale method is more efficient\nthan applying the GMsFEM or reduced basis method individually. We first\nconstruct parameter-independent multiscale basis functions that include both\nlocal and global information of the permeability fields, and then use these\nbasis functions to construct several global snapshots and global basis\nfunctions for fast online computation with different parameter inputs. We\nprovide rigorous analysis of the proposed method and extensive numerical\nexamples to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the local-global\nmultiscale method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 03:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Finally we show how this result allows to\nfully map the computational complexity of these variants for proving full and\nnon compliance, while for partial compliance the complexity result of one of\nthe variants is still missing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 05:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Due to the\ndifficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of\nIoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers\ncannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing\nprocesses, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even\nimpossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an\nefficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing\ndomain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic\nblack-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client\ncommunicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based\non the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that\nreflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based\non message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the\nprobing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing\napproaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only\ninherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also\nutilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore,\nSnipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite\noperations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on\n20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify\n5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz.

Based on the result, the calculation of\nreproduced correlation through path decompositions and subsequent comparison to\nthe empirical correlation indicated that the path model fits the empirical\ndata. The identified factor significantly influenced the number of confirmed\ncases of COVID-19. Therefore, the number of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19\nmay reduce as the amount of relative humidity increases; relative humidity will\nincrease as the amount of air temperature decreases; and the amount of air\ntemperature will decrease as the amount of air pressure decreases. Thus, it is\nrecommended that policy-making bodies consider the result of this study when\nimplementing programs for COVID-19 and increase public awareness on the effects\nof weather condition, as it is one of the factors to control the number of\nCOVID-19 cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 06:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

In particular, the interplay of constructive\nand destructive interference with the characteristic exchange statistics of\nindistinguishable particles give rise to the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, where\nthe bunching of bosons can lead to a perfect suppression of two-particle\ncoincidences between the output ports of a balanced beam splitter. Conversely,\nin the case of two fermions, anti-bunching can systematically enhance these\ncoincidences up to twice the baseline value of distinguishable particles. As\nsuch, the respective emergence of dips or peaks in the HOM experiment may at\nfirst glance appear to be indicative of the bosonic/fermionic nature of the\nincident particles. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that the\ntwo-particle coincidence statistics of two bosons can instead be seamlessly\ntuned from the expected case of suppression to substantial enhancement by an\nappropriate choice of the observation basis. To this end, our photonic setting\nleverages birefringent polarization couplers to selectively introduce\ndissipation in the photons polarization degree of freedom. Notably, the\nmechanism underpinning this this highly unusual behaviour does not act on the\nindividual phases accumulated by pairs of particles along specific paths, but\ninstead allows them to jointly evade losses, while indistinguishable photons\nare prevented from being simultaneously detected in orthogonal modes.

The theory of Gouesbet and Gr\\'ehan [Part. Part. Syst.\nCharact. 17 213-224 (2000)] is used to derive an energetic model of the\nscattering transient. The spreading and extinction of the pulse is decoupled\nfrom the transient of scattering to describe each phenomenon individually. The\ntransient of scattering is modeled with the Lorenz-Mie Theory, thus also valid\nfor a relative refractive index lower than one, contrary to the Debye series\nexpansion which does not converge close to the critical angle. To this aim, the\nScattering Impulse Response Function (SIRF) allows to detect the different\nmodes of scattering transient in time and direction. The present approach is\nmore generic and can simulate clouds of air bubbles in water. Two Monte-Carlo\napproaches are proposed. The first is a pure Monte Carlo approach where the\ndelay due to the scattering is randomly drawn at each event, while the second\nis based on the transport of the whole scattering signal. They are both\nembedded in the Monte Carlo code Scatter3D [JOSA A 24, 2206-2219 (2007)]. Both\nmodels produce equivalent trends and are validated against published numerical\nresults. They are applied to the multiple scattering of ultra short pulse by a\ncloud of bubble in water in the forward direction. The pulse spread due to the\npropagation in water is computed for a wide range of traveled distances and\npulse durations, and the optimal pulse duration is given to minimize the pulse\nspread at a given distance. The main result is that the scattered photons exit\nthe turbid medium earlier than the ballistic photons and produce a double peak\nrelated to the refraction in the bubble.

Our\nfirst objective is to make stochastic predictions of the WHPA within the\nBayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) framework, which aims to find a direct\nrelationship between predictor and target using machine learning. This\nrelationship is learned from a small set of training models (400) sampled from\nthe prior distribution of K. The associated 400 pairs of simulated predictors\nand targets are obtained through forward modelling. Newly collected field data\ncan then be directly used to predict the approximate posterior distribution of\nthe corresponding WHPA. The uncertainty range of the posterior WHPA\ndistribution is affected by the number and position of data sources (injection\nwells). Our second objective is to extend BEL to identify the optimal design of\ndata source locations that minimizes the posterior uncertainty of the WHPA.\nThis can be done explicitly, without averaging or approximating because once\ntrained, the BEL model allows the computation of the posterior uncertainty\ncorresponding to any new input data. We use the Modified Hausdorff Distance and\nthe Structural Similarity index metrics to estimate the posterior uncertainty\nrange of the WHPA. Increasing the number of injection wells effectively reduces\nthe derived posterior WHPA uncertainty. Our approach can also estimate which\ninjection wells are more informative than others, as validated through a k-fold\ncross-validation procedure. Overall, the application of BEL to experimental\ndesign makes it possible to identify the data sources maximizing the\ninformation content of any measurement data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 09:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

For the sustainable subsequent use or transfer to a new primary\nuse, many contaminated sites and soil information have to be permanently\nmanaged. In most cases, this information is available in the form of expert\nreports in unstructured data collections or file folders, which in the best\ncase are digitized. Due to size and complexity of the data, it is difficult for\na single person to have an overview of this data in order to be able to make\nreliable statements. This is one of the most important obstacles to the rapid\ntransfer of these areas to after-use. An information-based approach to this\nissue supports fulfilling several Sustainable Development Goals regarding\nenvironment issues, health and climate action. We use a stack of Optical\nCharacter Recognition, Text Classification, Active Learning and Geographic\nInformation System Visualization to effectively mine and visualize this\ninformation. Subsequently, we link the extracted information to geographic\ncoordinates and visualize them using a Geographic Information System. Active\nLearning plays a vital role because our dataset provides no training data. In\ntotal, we process nine categories and actively learn their representation in\nour dataset. We evaluate the OCR, Active Learning and Text Classification\nseparately to report the performance of the system. Active Learning and text\nclassification results are twofold: Whereas our categories about restrictions\nwork sufficient ($>$.85 F1), the seven topic-oriented categories were\ncomplicated for human coders and hence the results achieved mediocre evaluation\nscores ($<$.70 F1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 10:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 10:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 10:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 12:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Since it is a common effect for photography and usually appears as a\nslight intensity variation, people usually regard it as a part of a photo and\nwould not even want to post-process it. Due to this natural advantage, in this\nwork, we study vignetting from a new viewpoint, i.e., adversarial vignetting\nattack (AVA), which aims to embed intentionally misleading information into\nvignetting and produce a natural adversarial example without noise patterns.\nThis example can fool the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) but is imperceptible to humans. To this end, we first propose the\nradial-isotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RI-AVA) based on the physical\nmodel of vignetting, where the physical parameters (e.g., illumination factor\nand focal length) are tuned through the guidance of target CNN models. To\nachieve higher transferability across different CNNs, we further propose\nradial-anisotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RA-AVA) by allowing the\neffective regions of vignetting to be radial-anisotropic and shape-free.\nMoreover, we propose the geometry-aware level-set optimization method to solve\nthe adversarial vignetting regions and physical parameters jointly. We validate\nthe proposed methods on three popular datasets, i.e., DEV, CIFAR10, and Tiny\nImageNet, by attacking four CNNs, e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121,\nand MobileNet-V2, demonstrating the advantages of our methods over baseline\nmethods on both transferability and image quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 10:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

We describe a\nmodel in which meaningful scene structures are extracted from the image by an\niterative process, combining bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) networks,\ninteracting through a symmetric bi-directional communication between them\n(counter-streams structure). The model constructs a scene representation by the\niterative use of three components. The first model component is a BU stream\nthat extracts selected scene elements, properties and relations. The second\ncomponent (cognitive augmentation) augments the extracted visual representation\nbased on relevant non-visual stored representations. It also provides input to\nthe third component, the TD stream, in the form of a TD instruction,\ninstructing the model what task to perform next. The TD stream then guides the\nBU visual stream to perform the selected task in the next cycle. During this\nprocess, the visual representations extracted from the image can be combined\nwith relevant non-visual representations, so that the final scene\nrepresentation is based on both visual information extracted from the scene and\nrelevant stored knowledge of the world. We describe how a sequence of\nTD-instructions is used to extract from the scene structures of interest,\nincluding an algorithm to automatically select the next TD-instruction in the\nsequence. The extraction process is shown to have favorable properties in terms\nof combinatorial generalization, generalizing well to novel scene structures\nand new combinations of objects, properties and relations not seen during\ntraining. Finally, we compare the model with relevant aspects of the human\nvision, and suggest directions for using the BU-TD scheme for integrating\nvisual and cognitive components in the process of scene understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 11:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

Under very fast camera motion (e.g.,\n3m/s), the reconstruction can easily crumble even for the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Fast motion brings two challenges to depth fusion: 1) the high\nnonlinearity of camera pose optimization due to large inter-frame rotations and\n2) the lack of reliably trackable features due to motion blur. We propose to\ntackle the difficulties of fast-motion camera tracking in the absence of\ninertial measurements using random optimization, in particular, the Particle\nFilter Optimization (PFO). To surmount the computation-intensive particle\nsampling and update in standard PFO, we propose to accelerate the randomized\nsearch via updating a particle swarm template (PST). PST is a set of particles\npre-sampled uniformly within the unit sphere in the 6D space of camera pose.\nThrough moving and rescaling the pre-sampled PST guided by swarm intelligence,\nour method is able to drive tens of thousands of particles to locate and cover\na good local optimum extremely fast and robustly. The particles, representing\ncandidate poses, are evaluated with a fitness function defined based on\ndepth-model conformance. Therefore, our method, being depth-only and\ncorrespondence-free, mitigates the motion blur impediment as ToF-based depths\nare often resilient to motion blur. Thanks to the efficient template-based\nparticle set evolution and the effective fitness function, our method attains\ngood quality pose tracking under fast camera motion (up to 4m/s) in a realtime\nframerate without including loop closure or global pose optimization. Through\nextensive evaluations on public datasets of RGB-D sequences, especially on a\nnewly proposed benchmark of fast camera motion, we demonstrate the significant\nadvantage of our method over the state of the arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 11:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

It remains\nhard to deal with more complex tasks (e.g. segmentation, object detection) due\nto the small number of works on deep spiking neural networks for these tasks.\nThe objective of this paper is to make the first step towards modern computer\nvision with supervised spiking neural networks. We propose a deep convolutional\nspiking neural network for the localization of a single object in a grayscale\nimage. We propose a network based on DECOLLE, a spiking model that enables\nlocal surrogate gradient-based learning. The encouraging results reported on\nOxford-IIIT-Pet validates the exploitation of spiking neural networks with a\nsupervised learning approach for more elaborate vision tasks in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 12:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an\nobvious \\emph{mismatch} between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they\ngenerate proposals solely based on the detection confidence (i.e.,\nquery-agnostic), hoping that the proposals contain all instances mentioned in\nthe text query (i.e., query-aware). Due to this mismatch, chances are that\nproposals relevant to the text query are suppressed during the filtering\nprocess, which in turn bounds the matching performance. To this end, we propose\nVL-NMS, which is the first method to yield query-aware proposals at the first\nstage. VL-NMS regards all mentioned instances as critical objects, and\nintroduces a lightweight module to predict a score for aligning each proposal\nwith a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS operation to filter out\nproposals irrelevant to the text query, increasing the recall of critical\nobjects, resulting in a significantly improved matching performance. Since\nVL-NMS is agnostic to the matching step, it can be easily integrated into any\nstate-of-the-art two-stage matching methods.

Loosely speaking, higher means passing from\nconsidering symplectic 2-form to consider differential forms in higher degrees.\nThe goal of this thesis is to provide new explicit constructions and concrete\nexamples related to group actions on multisymplectic manifolds admitting\nhomotopy comomentum maps.\n  The first result is a complete classification of compact group actions on\nmultisymplectic spheres. The existence of a homotopy comomentum map about the\nlatter depends on the dimension of the sphere and the transitivity of the group\naction. Several concrete examples of such actions are also provided.\n  The second novel result is the explicit construction of the higher analogue\nof the embedding of the Poisson algebra of a given symplectic manifold into the\ncorresponding twisted Lie algebroid. It is also proved a compatibility\ncondition for such embedding for gauge-related multisymplectic manifolds in\npresence of a compatible Hamiltonian group action. The latter construction\ncould play a role in determining the multisymplectic analogue of the geometric\nquantization procedure.\n  Finally, a concrete construction of a homotopy comomentum map for the action\nof the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms on the multisymplectic\n3-dimensional Euclidean space is proposed. This map can be naturally related to\nhydrodynamics. For instance, it transgresses to the standard hydrodynamical\nco-momentum map of Arnold, Marsden and Weinstein and others. A slight\ngeneralization of this construction to a special class of Riemannian manifolds\nis also provided.

Several famous open problems relate to this notion; Ryser's conjecture on\ntransversals in latin squares, for instance, is equivalent to the statement\nthat every properly $n$-edge colored complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ has a\ncolor-balanced perfect matching. We contribute some results on the question\nposed by Kittipassorn and Sinsap (arXiv:2011.00862v1) whether every $k$-edge\ncolored color-balanced complete graph $K_{2kn}$ has a color-balanced perfect\nmatching $M$. For a perfect matching $M$ of $K_{2kn}$, a natural measure for\nthe total deviation of $M$ from being color-balanced is\n$f(M)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k|m_i(M)-n|$. While not every color-balanced complete\ngraph $K_{2kn}$ has a color-balanced perfect matching $M$, that is, a perfect\nmatching with $f(M)=0$, we prove the existence of a perfect matching $M$ with\n$f(M)=O\\left(k\\sqrt{kn\\ln(k)}\\right)$ for general $k$ and $f(M)\\leq 2$ for\n$k=3$; the case $k=2$ has already been studied earlier.

In this context, the pricing of\ngreenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First,\nto lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs.

Most of the facial expression\nrecognition methods have been proposed using mainly 2D images. These methods\nsuffer from several issues like illumination changes and pose variations.\nMoreover, 2D mapping from 3D images may lack some geometric and topological\ncharacteristics of the face. Hence, to overcome this problem, a multi-modal 2D\n+ 3D feature-based method is proposed. We extract shallow features from the 3D\nimages, and deep features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from the\ntransformed 2D images. Combining these features into a compact representation\nuses covariance matrices as descriptors for both features instead of\nsingle-handedly descriptors. A covariance matrix learning is used as a manifold\nlayer to reduce the deep covariance matrices size and enhance their\ndiscrimination power while preserving their manifold structure. We then use the\nBag-of-Features (BoF) paradigm to quantize the covariance matrices after\nflattening. Accordingly, we obtained two codebooks using shallow and deep\nfeatures. The global codebook is then used to feed an SVM classifier.

Providing both computation and communication as first\nclass constructs allows users to work on a high-level abstraction and apply\npowerful optimizations, such as fusion or overlapping of communication and\ncomputation. CoCoNeT enables us to optimize data-, model-and pipeline-parallel\nworkloads in large language models with only a few lines of code. Experiments\nshow CoCoNeT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed machine\nlearning implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 15:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 01:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 01:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 16:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

In\nrecent years, the analysis and mining of temporal networks have attracted\nsubstantial attention. Frequent pattern mining is considered an essential task\nin the network science literature. In addition to the numerous applications,\nthe investigation of frequent pattern mining in networks directly impacts other\nanalytical approaches, such as clustering, quasi-clique and clique mining, and\nlink prediction. In nearly all the algorithms proposed for frequent pattern\nmining in temporal networks, the networks are represented as sequences of\nstatic networks.

To address\nthese challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces\nto high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these\nmethods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In\nthis paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face\nrecognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to\nrestore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under\narbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a\nwell-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature\nrepresentation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and\nrestores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose\nresidual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module\n(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its\nreal-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate\nfrontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a\nstrong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization\nand face restoration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 03:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

It is fundamental to the Newtonian Paradigm that the set of\npossibilities that constitute the phase space is always definable and fixed\nahead of time.

Living cells, evolving via\nheritable variation and Natural selection, adaptively construct new in the\nuniverse possibilities. The new possibilities are opportunities for new\nadaptations thereafter seized by heritable variation and Natural Selection.\nSurprisingly, we can neither define nor deduce the evolving phase spaces ahead\nof time. We can use no mathematics based on Set Theory to do so. These ever-new\nadaptations with ever-new relevant variables constitute the ever-changing phase\nspace of evolving biospheres.
