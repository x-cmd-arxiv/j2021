Furthermore, an inaccurate\nreward function may lead to a biased behaviour which is far from an efficient\nand optimised behaviour. In this paper, we focus on training a single agent to\nscore goals with binary success/failure reward function in Half Field Offense\ndomain. As the major advantage of this research, the agent has no presumption\nabout the environment which means it only follows the original formulation of\nreinforcement learning agents. The main challenge of using such a reward\nfunction is the high sparsity of positive reward signals. To address this\nproblem, we use a simple prediction-based exploration strategy (called Curious\nExploration) along with a Return-based Memory Restoration (RMR) technique which\ntends to remember more valuable memories. The proposed method can be utilized\nto train agents in environments with fairly complex state and action spaces.\nOur experimental results show that many recent solutions including our baseline\nmethod fail to learn and perform in complex soccer domain. However, the\nproposed method can converge easily to the nearly optimal behaviour.

Previous\nstudies have reported that EH code is typically neglected, not well tested, and\nits misuse can lead to reliability degradation and catastrophic failures.\nHowever, little is known about the relationship between testing practices and\nEH testing effectiveness. In this exploratory study, we (i) measured the\nadequacy degree of EH testing concerning code coverage (instruction, branch,\nand method) criteria; and (ii) evaluated the effectiveness of the EH testing by\nmeasuring its capability to detect artificially injected faults (i.e., mutants)\nusing 7 EH mutation operators.

Our results show that\ninstructions and branches within $\\mathtt{catch}$ blocks and $\\mathtt{throw}$\ninstructions are less covered, with statistical significance than the overall\ninstructions and branches.

Conventional models of public goods\ngames posit solely individual self-interest as a motivation, even though\naltruistic motivations have long been known to play a significant role in\nagents' decisions. We introduce a novel extension of public goods games to\naccount for altruistic motivations by adding a term in the utility function\nthat incorporates the perceived benefits an agent obtains from the welfare of\nothers, mediated by an altruism graph. Most importantly, we view altruism not\nas immutable, but rather as a lever for promoting the common good.

Our definition is based on levelset zigzag\npersistence which involves four types of persistence intervals as opposed to\nthe two types in standard persistence. For each of the four types, we present a\npolynomial-time algorithm computing an optimal sequence of levelset persistent\n$p$-cycles for the so-called weak $(p+1)$-pseudomanifolds. Given that optimal\ncycle problems for homology are NP-hard in general, our results are useful in\npractice because weak pseudomanifolds do appear in applications. Our algorithms\ndraw upon an idea of relating optimal cycles to min-cuts in a graph that we\nexploited earlier for standard persistent cycles. Note that levelset zigzag\nposes non-trivial challenges for the approach because a sequence of optimal\ncycles instead of a single one needs to be computed in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 17:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

We build on the linewidth theory developed\nin the 1980s and 1990s but look from a modern perspective, in the sense that we\nchoose as our starting points the time-dependent coupled-wave equations for the\nforward and backward propagating fields and an expansion of the fields in terms\nof the stationary longitudinal modes of the open cavity. As a result, we obtain\nrather general expressions for the longitudinal excess factor of spontaneous\nemission ($K$-factor) and the effective $\\alpha$-factor including the effects\nof nonlinear gain (gain compression) and refractive index (Kerr effect), gain\ndispersion and longitudinal spatial hole burning in multi-section cavity\nstructures. The effect of linewidth narrowing due to feedback from an external\ncavity often described by the so-called chirp reduction factor is also\nautomatically included. We propose a new analytical formula for the dependence\nof the spontaneous emission on the carrier density avoiding the use of the\npopulation inversion factor. The presented theoretical framework is applied to\na numerical study of a two-section distributed Bragg reflector laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 19:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 19:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

An approach developed in computer\nscience for dealing with such problems is to devise approximation algorithms\nthat run in polynomial time, and provide solutions with provable guarantees on\ntheir quality in terms of the optimal unknown solution. Recently, several\nalgorithms for the Ising-spin glass problem on a graph that provide different\napproximation guarantees were introduced albeit without implementation. Also\nrecently, D-wave company constructed a physical realization of an adiabatic\nquantum computer, and enabled researchers to access it. D-wave is particularly\nsuited for computing an approximation for the ground state of an Ising spin\nglass on its chimera graph -- a graph with bounded degree. In this work, we\ncompare the performance of a recently developed approximation algorithm for\nsolving the Ising spin glass problem on graphs of bounded degree against the\nD-wave computer. We also compared a heuristic tailored specifically to handle\nthe fixed D-wave chimera graph. D-wave computer was able to find better\napproximations to all the random instances we studied. Furthermore the\nconvergence times of D-wave were also significantly better. These results\nindicate the merit of D-wave computer under certain specific instances.

This\nenvironment is characterized by frequent network partitioning, intermittent\nconnectivity, large or variable delay, asymmetric data rate, and low\ntransmission reliability. There have been routing protocols developed in DTN.\nHowever, those routing algorithms are design based upon specific assumptions.\nThe assumption makes existing algorithms suitable for specific environment\nscenarios. Different routing algorithm uses different relay node selection\ncriteria to select the replication node. Too Frequently forwarding messages can\nresult in excessive packet loss and large buffer and network overhead. On the\nother hand, less frequent transmission leads to a lower delivery ratio. In DTN\nthere is a trade-off off between delivery ratio and overhead. In this study, we\nproposed context-adaptive reinforcement learning based routing(CARL-DTN)\nprotocol to determine optimal replicas of the message based on the real-time\ndensity. Our routing protocol jointly uses a real-time physical context,\nsocial-tie strength, and real-time message context using fuzzy logic in the\nrouting decision. Multi-hop forwarding probability is also considered for the\nrelay node selection by employing Q-Learning algorithm to estimate the\nencounter probability between nodes and to learn about nodes available in the\nneighbor by discounting reward.

In order to obtain accurate\ninferences, the collected data must be informative about the unknown\nparameters. How to decide which data is most informative and how to efficiently\nsample it, is the notoriously challenging task of optimal experimental design\n(OED). In this context, the best, and often infeasible, scenario is when the\nfull input-to-output (ItO) map, i.e., an infinite amount of data, is available:\nThis is the typical setting in many theoretical inverse problems, which is used\nto guarantee the unique parameter reconstruction. These two different settings\nhave created a gap between computational and theoretical inverse problems. In\nthis manuscript we aim to bridge this gap while circumventing the OED task.\nThis is achieved by exploiting the structures of the ItO data from the\nunderlying inverse problem, using the electrical impedance tomography (EIT)\nproblem as an example. We leverage the rank-structure of the EIT model, and\nformulate the discretized ItO map, as an H-matrix. This suggests that one can\nrecover the full ItO matrix, with high probability, from a subset of its\nentries sampled following the rank structure: The data in the diagonal blocks\nis informative thus fully sampled, while data in the off-diagonal blocks can be\nsub-sampled. This recovered ItO matrix is then utilized to represent the full\nItO map, allowing us to connect with the problem in the theoretical setting\nwhere the unique reconstruction is guaranteed. This strategy achieves two\ngoals: I) it bridges the gap between the settings for the numerical and\ntheoretical inverse problems and II) it improves the quality of computational\ninverse solutions. We detail the theory for the EIT model, and provide\nnumerical verification to both EIT and optical tomography problems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 21:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Current literature mainly focuses on deriving ITRs from a\nsingle source population. We consider the observational data setting when the\nsource population differs from a target population of interest. We assume\nsubject covariates are available from both populations, but treatment and\noutcome data are only available from the source population. Although adjusting\nfor differences between source and target populations can potentially lead to\nan improved ITR for the target population, it can substantially increase the\nvariability in ITR estimation. To address this dilemma, we develop a weighting\nframework that aims to tailor an ITR for a given target population and protect\nagainst high variability due to superfluous covariate shift adjustments. Our\nmethod seeks covariate balance over a nonparametric function class\ncharacterized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and can improve many ITR\nlearning methods that rely on weights. We show that the proposed method\nencompasses importance weights and the so-called overlap weights as two extreme\ncases, allowing for a better bias-variance trade-off in between. Numerical\nexamples demonstrate that the use of our weighting method can greatly improve\nITR estimation for the target population compared with other weighting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 00:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

In contrast, the Homunculus remains at an almost constant\nbrightness. The coronagraph primarily suppresses the stellar continuum, to a\nlesser extent the wind lines, and not the circumstellar emission lines. This\nexplains why the absolute values of equivalent widths (EWs) of the emission\nlines in our direct view are larger than those seen in reflected by the\nHomunculus, why the direct view absolute EWs are decreasing with time, and why\nlower-excitation spectral wind lines formed at larger radii (e.g. FeII 4585A)\ndecrease in intensity at a faster pace than higher excitation lines that form\ncloser to the star (e.g. H\\delta).

Such a model\nrequires a firm grasp of the abstract principles on which a system is based, as\nwell as an understanding of the high-level nature of the representation of\nentities and processes. In this context, models can have distinct architectural\ncharacteristics. This paper discusses model multiplicity (e.g., unified\nmodeling language [UML]), model singularity (e.g., object-process methodology\n[OPM], thinging machine [TM]), and a heterogeneous model that involves\nmultiplicity and singularity. The basic idea of model multiplicity is that it\nis not possible to present all views in a single representation, so a number of\nmodels are used, with each model representing a different view. The model\nsingularity approach uses only a single unified model that assimilates its\nsubsystems into one system. This paper is concerned with current approaches,\nespecially in software engineering texts, where multimodal UML is introduced as\nthe general-purpose modeling language (i.e., UML is modeling). In such a\nsituation, we suggest raising the issue of multiplicity versus singularity in\nmodeling. This would foster a basic appreciation of the UML advantages and\ndifficulties that may be faced during modeling, especially in the educational\nsetting. Furthermore, we advocate the claim that a multiplicity of views does\nnot necessitate a multiplicity of models. The model singularity approach can\nrepresent multiple views (static, behavior) without resorting to a collection\nof multiple models with various notations. We present an example of such a\nmodel where the static representation is developed first. Then, the dynamic\nview and behavioral representations are built by incorporating a decomposition\nstrategy interleaved with the notion of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 03:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

A specific type of interaction\nis that of location-based alerts, where mobile users subscribe to a service\nprovider (SP) in order to be notified when a certain event occurs nearby.\nConsider, for instance, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where contact tracing\nhas been singled out as an effective means to control the virus spread. Users\nwish to be notified if they came in proximity to an infected individual.\nHowever, serious privacy concerns arise if the users share their location\nhistory with the SP in plaintext. To address privacy, recent work proposed\nseveral protocols that can securely implement location-based alerts. The users\nupload their encrypted locations to the SP, and the evaluation of location\npredicates is done directly on ciphertexts. When a certain individual is\nreported as infected, all matching ciphertexts are found (e.g., according to a\npredicate such as \"10 feet proximity to any of the locations visited by the\ninfected patient in the last week\"), and the corresponding users notified.\nHowever, there are significant performance issues associated with existing\nprotocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform\nthe matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of\nlocations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on\nHuffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted\nlocations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to\nsignificantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the\ngain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments\nthat the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is\nsubstantial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 03:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

The judge actively obtains the result rather than passively waiting\nfor it sent by a competitor. We give two TPIC constructions considering\n\\emph{Mixed adversaries}, who have with different capabilities. One is secure\nagainst a semi-honest adversary with low computation and communication cost,\nwhile the other is secure against a malicious adversary.\n  Basing on TPIC, we present multi-party comparisons through concrete\napplications, including a joint bidding scheme and a practical auction. Brief\nsecurity proofs and analysis for the applications are presented. In comparison,\nour auction scheme is more efficient with lower cost, making it feasible in\npractice rather than a theoretical design.

As the interactions between users and songs naturally construct\na complex network, community detection approaches can be applied to reveal\nusers' potential interests on songs by grouping relevant users & songs to the\nsame community. However, as the types of interaction could be heterogeneous, it\nchallenges conventional community detection methods designed originally for\nhomogeneous networks. Although there are existing works on heterogeneous\ncommunity detection, they are mostly task-driven approaches and not feasible\nfor specific music recommendation. In this paper, we propose a genetic based\napproach to learn an edge-type usefulness distribution (ETUD) for all\nedge-types in heterogeneous music networks. ETUD can be regarded as a linear\nfunction to project all edges to the same latent space and make them\ncomparable. Therefore a heterogeneous network can be converted to a homogeneous\none where those conventional methods are eligible to use.

GCNs incorporate the\ngraph structure information and the node (or edge) features through message\npassing and computes 'deep' node representations. Despite significant progress\nin the field, designing GCN architectures for heterogeneous graphs still\nremains an open challenge. Due to the schema of a heterogeneous graph, useful\ninformation may reside multiple hops away. A key question is how to perform\nmessage passing to incorporate information of neighbors multiple hops away\nwhile avoiding the well-known over-smoothing problem in GCNs. To address this\nquestion, we propose our GCN framework 'Deep Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (DHGCN)', which takes advantage of the schema of a heterogeneous graph\nand uses a hierarchical approach to effectively utilize information many hops\naway. It first computes representations of the target nodes based on their\n'schema-derived ego-network' (SEN). It then links the nodes of the same type\nwith various pre-defined metapaths and performs message passing along these\nlinks to compute final node representations. Our design choices naturally\ncapture the way a heterogeneous graph is generated from the schema. The\nexperimental results on real and synthetic datasets corroborate the design\nchoice and illustrate the performance gains relative to competing alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 06:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

IoT apps subscribe to events and upon\nreceipt, transmit actuation commands which trigger a set of actuators. Events\nand actuation commands follow paths in the IoT ecosystem such as\nsensor-to-edge, edge-to-cloud, and cloud-to-actuator, with different network\nand processing delays between these connections. Significant delays may occur\nespecially when an IoT system cloud interacts with other clouds. Due to this\nvariation in delays, the cloud may receive events in an incorrect order, and in\nturn, devices may receive and actuate misordered commands. In this paper, we\nfirst study eight major IoT platforms and show that they do not make strong\nguarantees on event orderings to address these issues. We then analyze the\nend-to-end interactions among IoT components, from the creation of an event to\nthe invocation of a command. From this, we identify and formalize the root\ncauses of misorderings in events and commands leading to undesired states. We\ndeploy 23 apps in a simulated smart home containing 35 IoT devices to evaluate\nthe misordering problem. Our experiments demonstrate a high number of\nmisordered events and commands that occur through different interaction paths.\nThrough this effort, we reveal the root and extent of the misordering problem\nand guide future work to ensure correct ordering in IoT systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 06:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

The algorithm is based on the perspective that, since the grocery\nitems are usually bought in bulk, a grocery recommender system should be\ncapable of recommending the items in bulk. The algorithm figures out the\npossible dishes a user may cook based on the items added to the basket and\nrecommends the ingredients accordingly. Our algorithm does not depend on the\nuser ratings. Customers usually do not have the patience to rate the groceries\nthey purchase. Therefore, algorithms that are not dependent on user ratings\nneed to be designed. Instead of using a brute force search, this algorithm\nlimits the search space to a set of only a few probably food categories. Each\nfood category consists of several food subcategories. For example, \"fried rice\"\nand \"biryani\" are food subcategories that belong to the food category \"rice\".\nFor each food category, items are ranked according to how well they can\ndifferentiate a food subcategory. To each food subcategory in the activated\nsearch space, this algorithm attaches a score. The score is calculated based on\nthe rank of the items added to the basket. Once the score exceeds a threshold\nvalue, its corresponding subcategory gets activated. The algorithm then uses a\nbasket-to-recipe similarity measure to identify the best recipe matches within\nthe activated subcategories only. This reduces the search space to a great\nextent. We may argue that this algorithm is similar to the content-based\nrecommender system in some sense, but it does not suffer from the limitations\nlike limited content, over-specialization, or the new user problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 06:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

This is accomplished\nthrough recent advances in design of non-iterative sampling methods to inverse\nscattering. The direct problem is formulated via the Biot equations in the\nfrequency domain where a network of discontinuities is illuminated by a set of\ntotal body forces and fluid volumetric sources, while monitoring the induced\n(acoustic and elastic) scattered waves in an arbitrary near-field\nconfiguration. A thin-layer approximation is deployed to capture the rough and\nmultiphase nature of interfaces whose spatially varying hydro-mechanical\nproperties are a priori unknown. In this setting, the well-posedness analysis\nof the forward problem yields the admissibility conditions for the contact\nparameters. In light of which, the poroelastic scattering operator and its\nfirst and second factorizations are introduced and their mathematical\nproperties are carefully examined. It is shown that the non-selfadjoint nature\nof the Biot system leads to an intrinsically asymmetric factorization of the\nscattering operator which may be symmetrized at certain limits. These results\nfurnish a robust framework for systematic design of regularized and convex cost\nfunctionals whose minimizers underpin the multiphysics imaging indicators.

Weighted shape graphs are the union of an\narbitrary number of component curves in Euclidean space with potential\nconnectivity constraints between some of their boundary points, together with a\nweight function defined on each component curve. The framework of higher order\ninvariant Sobolev metrics is particularly well suited for constructing notions\nof distances and geodesics between unparametrized curves. The main difficulty\nin adapting this framework to the setting of shape graphs is the absence of\ntopological consistency, which typically results in an inadequate search for an\nexact matching between two shape graphs. We overcome this hurdle by defining an\ninexact variational formulation of the matching problem between (weighted)\nshape graphs of any underlying topology, relying on the convenient measure\nrepresentation given by varifolds to relax the exact matching constraint. We\nthen prove the existence of minimizers to this variational problem when we\nchoose Sobolev metrics of sufficient regularity and a total variation (TV)\nregularization on the weight function. We propose a numerical optimization\napproach which adapts the smoothed fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding\n(SFISTA) algorithm to deal with TV norm minimization and allows us to reduce\nthe matching problem to solving a sequence of smooth unconstrained minimization\nproblems. We finally illustrate the capabilities of our new model through\nseveral examples showcasing its ability to tackle partially observed and\ntopologically varying data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 08:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 23:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

The ubiquitous presence of pulsations clearly\nindicates that thermal photons either come from a limited area, possibly heated\nby some external mechanism, or from the entire (cooling) surface but with an\ninhomogeneous temperature distribution. In a NS the thermal map is shaped by\nthe magnetic field topology, since heat flows in the crust mostly along the\nmagnetic field lines. Self-consistent surface thermal maps can hence be\nproduced by simulating the coupled magnetic and thermal evolution of the star.\nWe compute the evolution of the neutron star crust in three dimensions for\ndifferent initial configurations of the magnetic field and use the ensuing\nthermal surface maps to derive the spectrum and the pulse profile as seen by an\nobserver at infinity, accounting for general-relativistic effects. In\nparticular, we compare cases with a high degree of symmetry with inherently 3D\nones, obtained by adding a quadrupole to the initial dipolar field.

We also compare our spectrum with those obtained with\nVLT/UVES, covering a total period of 17 years. We disentangle turbulent and\nthermal broadening in many components spread over about 400 km/s in the z~2.19\nsub-DLA system.

A comparison with other high-z, low-metallicity absorbers\nreveals an anti-correlation between gas temperature and total HI column\ndensity. Although requiring confirmation, this could be the first observational\nevidence of a thermal decrease with galacto-centric distance, i.e., we may be\nwitnessing a thermal transition between the circum-galactic medium and the\ncooler ISM. We revisit the Mg isotopic ratios at z=0.45 and z=1.65 and\nconstrain them to be xi = (26Mg+25Mg)/24Mg <0.6 and <1.4 in these two systems,\nrespectively. These values are consistent with the standard Solar ratio, i.e.,\nwe do not confirm strong enhancement of heavy isotopes previously inferred from\nUVES data.

Clipped Double Q-learning, as an effective\nvariant of Double Q-learning, employs the clipped double estimator to\napproximate the maximum expected action value. Due to the underestimation bias\nof the clipped double estimator, performance of clipped Double Q-learning may\nbe degraded in some stochastic environments. In this paper, in order to reduce\nthe underestimation bias, we propose an action candidate based clipped double\nestimator for Double Q-learning. Specifically, we first select a set of elite\naction candidates with the high action values from one set of estimators. Then,\namong these candidates, we choose the highest valued action from the other set\nof estimators. Finally, we use the maximum value in the second set of\nestimators to clip the action value of the chosen action in the first set of\nestimators and the clipped value is used for approximating the maximum expected\naction value. Theoretically, the underestimation bias in our clipped Double\nQ-learning decays monotonically as the number of the action candidates\ndecreases. Moreover, the number of action candidates controls the trade-off\nbetween the overestimation and underestimation biases. In addition, we also\nextend our clipped Double Q-learning to continuous action tasks via\napproximating the elite continuous action candidates. We empirically verify\nthat our algorithm can more accurately estimate the maximum expected action\nvalue on some toy environments and yield good performance on several benchmark\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 09:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach called MRC-LSTM, which combines a Multi-scale Residual\nConvolutional neural network (MRC) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to\nimplement Bitcoin closing price prediction. Specifically, the Multi-scale\nresidual module is based on one-dimensional convolution, which is not only\ncapable of adaptive detecting features of different time scales in multivariate\ntime series, but also enables the fusion of these features. LSTM has the\nability to learn long-term dependencies in series, which is widely used in\nfinancial time series forecasting.

In the study, the impact of external\nfactors such as macroeconomic variables and investor attention on the Bitcoin\nprice is considered in addition to the trading information of the Bitcoin\nmarket. We performed experiments to predict the daily closing price of Bitcoin\n(USD), and the experimental results show that MRC-LSTM significantly\noutperforms a variety of other network structures.

On one hand, distributional collision\nresistant hash functions cannot be built from one-way functions in a black-box\nway, which may suggest that they are stronger. On the other hand, so far, they\nhave not yielded any applications beyond one-way functions.\n  Assuming distributional collision resistant hash functions, we construct\n\\emph{constant-round} statistically hiding commitment scheme.

To identify and\nquantify such influences, various balance indices were proposed in the\nphylogenetic literature and have been in use for decades.\n  However, so far no balance index was based on the number of \\emph{symmetry\nnodes}, even though symmetry nodes play an important role in other areas of\nmathematical phylogenetics and despite the fact that symmetry nodes are a quite\nnatural way to measure balance or symmetry of a given tree.\n  The aim of this manuscript is thus twofold: First, we will introduce the\n\\emph{symmetry nodes index} as an index for measuring balance of phylogenetic\ntrees and analyze its extremal properties. We also show that this index can be\ncalculated in linear time. This new index turns out to be a generalization of a\nsimple and well-known balance index, namely the \\emph{cherry index}, as well as\na specialization of another, less established, balance index, namely\n\\emph{Rogers' $J$ index}. Thus, it is the second objective of the present\nmanuscript to compare the new symmetry nodes index to these two indices and to\nunderline its advantages. In order to do so, we will derive some extremal\nproperties of the cherry index and Rogers' $J$ index along the way and thus\ncomplement existing studies on these indices.

For a proper description\nand understanding of these phenomena, one needs to descend to a very small\nscale, at which the discreteness of the material emerges. Fully-resolved\ndiscrete numerical models often suffer from excessive computing expenses when\nused for application-scale considerations. More efficient multiscale simulation\nprocedures are thus called for, capable of capturing the most significant\nmicroscopic phenomena while being computationally tractable. Two broad classes\nof methods are available in the literature. The first class considers the\nfully-resolved discrete system, which is subsequently reduced through suitable\nmathematical tools such as projection and reduced integration. The second class\nfirst homogenizes the discrete system into an equivalent continuum formulation,\ninto which the main phenomena are added through specific enrichments. This\npaper provides a thorough comparison of the two different modeling philosophies\nin terms of their theory, accuracy, and performance. To this goal, two typical\nrepresentatives are adopted: the Quasicontinuum method for the first class, and\nan effective continuum with an embedded cohesive zone model for the second\nclass. Two examples are employed to demonstrate capabilities and limitations of\nboth approaches: dislocation propagation and pile-up against a coherent phase\nboundary, and a three-point bending test of a concrete specimen with crack\npropagation. In both cases, the accuracy of the two methods is compared against\nthe fully-resolved discrete reference model.

This paper performs an in-depth\nanalysis of two market manipulations organized by communities over the\nInternet: The pump and dump and the crowd pump. The pump and dump scheme is a\nfraud as old as the stock market. Now, it got new vitality in the loosely\nregulated market of cryptocurrencies. Groups of highly coordinated people\narrange this scam, usually on Telegram and Discord. We monitored these groups\nfor more than 3 years detecting around 900 individual events. We analyze how\nthese communities are organized and how they carry out the fraud. We report on\nthree case studies of pump and dump. Then, we leverage our unique dataset of\nthe verified pump and dumps to build a machine learning model able to detect a\npump and dump in 25 seconds from the moment it starts, achieving the results of\n94.5% of F1-score. Then, we move on to the crowd pump, a new phenomenon that\nhit the news in the first months of 2021, when a Reddit community inflates the\nprice of the GameStop stocks (GME) of over 1,900% on Wall Street, the world's\nlargest stock exchange. Later, other Reddit communities replicate the operation\non the cryptocurrency markets. The targets were Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple\n(XRP). We reconstruct how these operations developed, and we discuss\ndifferences and analogies with the standard pump and dump. Lastly, we\nillustrate how it is possible to leverage our classifier to detect this kind of\noperation too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 10:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

However, exact analytical results remain scarce, especially for\nsystems out of equilibrium. In this work we examine a paradigmatic\none-dimensional fermionic system that consists of a uniform tight-binding chain\nwith an arbitrary scattering region near its center, which is subject to a DC\nbias voltage at zero temperature. The system is thus held in a current-carrying\nnonequilibrium steady state, which can nevertheless be described by a pure\nquantum state. Using a generalization of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture, we\npresent an exact calculation of the bipartite entanglement entropy of a\nsubsystem with its complement, and show that the scaling of entanglement with\nthe length of the subsystem is highly unusual, containing both a volume-law\nlinear term and a logarithmic term. The linear term is related to imperfect\ntransmission due to scattering, and provides a generalization of the\nLevitov-Lesovik full counting statistics formula. The logarithmic term arises\nfrom the Fermi discontinuities in the distribution function. Our analysis also\nproduces an exact expression for the particle-number-resolved entanglement. We\nfind that although to leading order entanglement equipartition applies, the\nfirst term breaking it grows with the size of the subsystem, a novel behavior\nnot observed in previously studied systems. We apply our general results to a\nconcrete model of a tight-binding chain with a single impurity site, and show\nthat the analytical expressions are in good agreement with numerical\ncalculations. The analytical results are further generalized to accommodate the\ncase of multiple scattering regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 10:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 10:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

The underlying simplifications have been debated ever since, recently\nin a series of papers by Hu et al. 2017a, 2017b, and 2019, who clarify the role\nof neglecting short-term relaxation modes of the body. However, the authors\nstill do not solve the governing equations in full, because they make\napproximations to the Liouville equation (LE). In this paper I use a time\ndomain approach and for previously studied test loads I solve both the\nrelaxation of the body and the LE in full. I also compute the energy balance of\ntrue polar wander (TPW) in order to analyze the existing LE approximations. For\nfast rotating bodies such as the Earth, I show that the rotation axis is always\naligned with the maximum principal axis of inertia (w||MMOI) once free\noscillations are damped. The w||MMOI assumption is also re-derived\ntheoretically. Contrary to previous beliefs, I demonstrate that it is not\nnecessarily linked to the quasi-fluid simplification of the body's viscoelastic\nresponse to loading and rotation, but that it is an expression of neglecting\nthe Coriolis and Euler forces in the equation of motion. For slowly rotating\nbodies such as Venus, the full LE together with energy analysis indicate that\nprevious estimates of TPW in the normal direction need to be revisited.

Magnetospheric accretion spins the NS up and adjusts its\nrotation axis, decreasing $\\alpha$ to nearly perfect alignment. Its effect upon\nthe magnetic angle is more subtle and relatively unstudied. In this work, we\nmodel the magnetic angle evolution of a rigid spherical accreting NS. We find\nthat the torque spinning the NS up may affect the magnetic angle while both\n$\\alpha$ and $\\chi$ significantly deviate from zero, and the spin-up torque\nvaries with the phase of the spin period. As the rotation axis of the NS is\nbeing aligned with the spin-up torque, the magnetic axis becomes misaligned\nwith the rotation axis. Under favourable conditions, magnetic angle may\nincrease by $\\Delta \\chi \\sim 15^\\circ-20^\\circ$. This orthogonalisation may be\nan important factor in the evolution of millisecond pulsars, as it partially\ncompensates the $\\chi$ decrease potentially caused by pulsar torques. If the\ndirection of the spin-up torque changes randomly with time, as in wind-fed\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries, both the rotation axis of the NS and its magnetic\naxis become involved in a non-linear random-walk evolution.

Its efficiency for fast tides has however long\nbeen controversial, when the tidal frequency exceeds the turnover frequency of\nconvective eddies. Recent numerical simulations indicate that convection can\nact like an effective viscosity which decays quadratically with tidal frequency\nfor fast tides, resulting in inefficient dissipation in many applications\ninvolving pre- and main-sequence stars and giant planets. A new idea was\nhowever recently proposed by Terquem (2021), who suggested Reynolds stresses\ninvolving correlations between tidal flow components dominate the interaction\ninstead of correlations between convective flow components as usually assumed.\nThey further showed that this can potentially significantly enhance tidal\ndissipation for fast tides in many applications.

This makes it\ncomputationally challenging to compute PIDs in practice and restricts their use\nto low-dimensional random vectors. To ease this burden, we consider the case of\njointly Gaussian random vectors in this paper.

Then, for all other multivariate Gaussian distributions,\nwe propose a convex optimization framework for approximately computing a\nspecific PID definition based on the statistical concept of deficiency.

Empirical evidence indicates that\nthe impacts of inter-subjective exchanges are dependent on the subjective\nmutual evaluation of the interlocutors. This paper aims to quantify, how\nsubjective evaluations of peers affect peer effects across different stages of\nPV adoption decision-making. The findings of a survey among potential and\ncurrent adopters in Germany(N=1,165)confirm two hypotheses. First, peer effects\nplay a role in residential PV adoption: the number of peer adopters in the\ndecision-maker's social circle has a positive effect on the decision-maker's\nbelief that their social network supports PV adoption; their ascription of\ncredibility on PV-related topics to their peers; and their interest in actively\nseeking information from their peers in all decision-making stages. Second,\nthere is a correlation between the perceived positive attributes of a given\npeer and the reported influence of said peer within the decision-making\nprocess, suggesting that decision-makers' subjective evaluations of peers play\nan important role in active peer effects. Decision-makers are significantly\nmore likely to engage in and be influenced by interactions with peers who they\nperceive as competent, trustworthy, and likeable. In contrast, attributes such\nas physical closeness and availability have a less significant effect. From a\npolicymaking perspective, this study suggests that the density and quality of\npeer connections empower potential adopters. Accordingly, peer consultation and\ncommunity-led outreach initiatives should be promoted to accelerate residential\nPV adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 12:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

While ``natural'' parallel repetition transformation is known to\nreduce the soundness error of some special cases of interactive arguments:\nthree-message protocols and public-coin protocols, it fails to do so in the\ngeneral case.\n  The only known round-preserving approach that applies to all interactive\narguments is Haitner's random-terminating transformation [SICOMP '13], who\nshowed that the parallel repetition of the transformed protocol reduces the\nsoundness error at a weak exponential rate: if the original $m$-round protocol\nhas soundness error $1-p$, then the $n$-parallel repetition of its\nrandom-terminating variant has soundness error $(1-p)^{p n / m^4}$ (omitting\nconstant factors). Hastad et al. [TCC '10] have generalized this result to\npartially simulatable interactive arguments, showing that the $n$-fold\nrepetition of an $m$-round $\\delta$-simulatable argument of soundness error\n$1-p$ has soundness error $(1-p)^{p \\delta^2 n / m^2}$. When applied to\nrandom-terminating arguments, the Hastad et al. bound matches that of Haitner.\n  In this work we prove that parallel repetition of random-terminating\narguments reduces the soundness error at a much stronger exponential rate: the\nsoundness error of the $n$ parallel repetition is $(1-p)^{n / m}$, only an $m$\nfactor from the optimal rate of $(1-p)^n$ achievable in public-coin and\nthree-message arguments. The result generalizes to $\\delta$-simulatable\narguments, for which we prove a bound of $(1-p)^{\\delta n / m}$. This is\nachieved by presenting a tight bound on a relaxed variant of the KL-divergence\nbetween the distribution induced by our reduction and its ideal variant, a\nresult whose scope extends beyond parallel repetition proofs. We prove the\ntightness of the above bound for random-terminating arguments, by presenting a\nmatching protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 12:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

The FC is decomposed into two contributions. The first one corresponds to\nthe geometry without compactification and the second one is induced by the\ncompactification. Depending on the values of the parameters, the total FC can\nbe either positive or negative. As a limiting case, the expression for the FC\non locally Minkowski spacetime is derived. It vanishes for a massless fermion\nfield and the nonzero FC on the AdS bulk in the massless case is an effect\ninduced by gravitation. This shows that the gravitational field may essentially\ninfluence the parameters space for phase transitions. For a massive field the\nFC diverges on the string as the inverse cube of the proper distance from the\nstring. In the case of a massless field, depending on the magnetic flux along\nthe string and planar angle deficit, the limiting value of the FC on the string\ncan be either finite or infinite. At large distances, the decay of the FC as a\nfunction of the distance from the string is power law for both cases of massive\nand massless fields. For a cosmic string on the Minkowski bulk and for a\nmassive field the decay is exponential. The topological part in the FC vanishes\non the AdS boundary.

While effective, they require exact knowledge\nof the label of each pixel in an image.\n  This study investigates how effective global geometric shape descriptors\ncould be, when used on their own as segmentation losses for training deep\nnetworks. Not only interesting theoretically, there exist deeper motivations to\nposing segmentation problems as a reconstruction of shape descriptors:\nAnnotations to obtain approximations of low-order shape moments could be much\nless cumbersome than their full-mask counterparts, and anatomical priors could\nbe readily encoded into invariant shape descriptions, which might alleviate the\nannotation burden. Also, and most importantly, we hypothesize that, given a\ntask, certain shape descriptions might be invariant across image acquisition\nprotocols/modalities and subject populations, which might open interesting\nresearch avenues for generalization in medical image segmentation.\n  We introduce and formulate a few shape descriptors in the context of deep\nsegmentation, and evaluate their potential as standalone losses on two\ndifferent challenging tasks. Inspired by recent works in constrained\noptimization for deep networks, we propose a way to use those descriptors to\nsupervise segmentation, without any pixel-level label. Very surprisingly, as\nlittle as 4 descriptors values per class can approach the performance of a\nsegmentation mask with 65k individual discrete labels. We also found that shape\ndescriptors can be a valid way to encode anatomical priors about the task,\nenabling to leverage expert knowledge without additional annotations.

We introduce the Gibbs free energy landscape and calculate the\ncorresponding $G_L$ for the dilaton black hole. On the one hand, we numerically\nsolve the Fokker-Planck equation constrained by only the reflecting boundary\ncondition. The effects of dilaton gravity on the probabilistic evolution of\ndilaton black holes are quite obvious. Firstly, the horizon radius difference\nbetween the large dilaton black hole and small dilaton black hole increases\nwith the parameter $\\alpha$. Secondly, with the increasing of $\\alpha$, the\nsystem needs much more time to achieve a stationary distribution. Thirdly, the\nvalue which $\\rho(r_l,t)$ and $\\rho(r_s,t)$ finally attain varies with the\nparameter $\\alpha$.

This calibration technique is\nbeneficial for long-term probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), which\nis often based on a mixture of instrumental and historical catalogs. The second\nmethod generalizes the concept of $m_c$, considering rate- and\nmagnitude-dependent detection probability, and allows for self-consistent\nestimation of ETAS parameters and high-frequency detection incompleteness. With\nthis approach, we aim to address the potential biases in parameter calibration\ndue to short-term aftershock incompleteness, embracing incompleteness instead\nof avoiding it. Using synthetic tests, we show that both methods can accurately\ninvert the parameters of simulated catalogs.

The traditional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach suggests a\nfirst-order phase transition, as there are two different competing order\nparameters. On the other hand, it is known that the theory has the property of\nself-duality which has been connected to the existence of a deconfined quantum\ncritical point (DQCP). The latter regime suggests that order parameters are not\nthe elementary building blocks of the theory, but rather consist of\nfractionalized particles that are confined in both phases of the transition and\nonly appear - deconfine - at the critical point. Nevertheless, many numerical\nMonte Carlo simulations disagree with the claim of a DQCP in the system,\nindicating instead a first-order phase transition. Here we establish from exact\nlattice duality transformations and renormalization group analysis that the\neasy-plane CP1 antiferromagnet does feature a DQCP.

While the ancient high-metallicity models were in fair agreement\nwith other solar observational indicators, it is no longer the case for\nlow-metallicity models. Recent collection of data are however promising to shed\na new light on it. For instance, the Borexino collaboration released in 2020\nthe first-ever complete estimate of neutrinos emitted in the CNO cycle.

In parallel, newly claimed detection of solar\ngravity modes of oscillations offers another opportunity of probing the\nstratification in the Sun's central layers.

In the process we also investigate several\nrelated problems. In particular, we explain how to get zero transmission and\nhow to design phase shifters. The approach is based on asymptotic analysis in\npresence of thin resonators. An essential point is that we work around\nresonance lengths of the resonators. This allows us to obtain effects of order\none with geometrical perturbations of width $\\varepsilon$. Various numerical\nexperiments illustrate the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 14:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Thus, the main goal of this work is to perform a\nsystematic assessment of the HD computing framework for the detection of\nepileptic seizures, comparing different feature approaches mapped to HD\nvectors. More precisely, we test two previously implemented features as well as\nseveral novel approaches with HD computing on epileptic seizure detection.

Our analysis shows a significant difference in detection\nperformance between approaches, but also that the ones with the highest\nperformance might not be ideal for wearable applications due to their high\nmemory or computational requirements. Furthermore, we evaluate a\npost-processing strategy to adjust the predictions to the dynamics of epileptic\nseizures, showing that performance is significantly improved in all the\napproaches and also that after post-processing, differences in performance are\nmuch smaller between approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 15:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

To complement this, we also briefly\npresent the Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method, as a valuable\ncomputational resource for condensed matter physics, and discuss its potential\napplications and advantages if used in photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 15:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 10:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

The UAVs are assumed as intelligent\nagents, which can explore their optimal three dimensional (3-D) deployment to\nmaximize the channel capacity of the multiple input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystem. Specifically, considering the limitations of each UAV in accessing the\nglobal information of the network, we focus on a decentralized control strategy\nby noting that each UAV in the swarm can only utilize the local information to\nachieve the optimal 3-D deployment. In this case, the optimization problem can\nbe divided into several optimization sub-problems with respect to the rank\nfunction. Due to the non-convex nature of the rank function and the fact that\nthe optimization sub-problems are coupled, the original problem is NP-hard and,\nthus, cannot be solved with standard convex optimization solvers.\nInterestingly, we can relax the constraint condition of each sub-problem and\nsolve the optimization problem by a formulated UAVs channel capacity\nmaximization game. We analyze such game according to the designed reward\nfunction and the potential function. Then, we discuss the existence of the pure\nNash equilibrium in the game. To achieve the best Nash equilibrium of the MIMO\nsystem, we develop a decentralized learning algorithm, namely decentralized\nUAVs channel capacity learning. The details of the algorithm are provided, and\nthen, the convergence, the effectiveness and the computational complexity are\nanalyzed, respectively. Moreover, we give some insightful remarks based on the\nproofs and the theoretical analysis. Also, extensive simulations illustrate\nthat the developed learning algorithm can achieve a high MIMO channel capacity\nby optimizing the 3-D UAV swarm deployment with the local information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 15:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Here we study compressible flows and compare clustering\nin both compressively (irrotationally) and vortically (solenoidally) forced\nturbulence. Vortically and compressively forced flows are driven stochastically\neither by solenoidal waves or by circular expansion waves, respectively. For\ncompressively forced flows, the power spectrum of the density of inertial\nparticles is a useful tool for displaying particle clustering relative to the\nfluid density enhancement. Power spectra are shown to be particularly sensitive\nfor studying large-scale particle clustering, while conventional tools such as\nradial distribution functions are more suitable for studying small-scale\nclustering. Our primary finding is that particle clustering through shock\ninteraction is particularly prominent in turbulence driven by spherical\nexpansion waves. It manifests itself through a double-peaked distribution of\nspectral power as a function of Stokes number. The two peaks are associated\nwith two distinct clustering mechanisms; shock interaction for smaller Stokes\nnumbers and the centrifugal sling effect for larger values. The clustering of\ninertial particles is associated with the formation of caustics. Such caustics\ncan only be captured in the Lagrangian description, which allows us to assess\nthe relative importance of caustics in vortically and compressively forced\nturbulence.

However,\nsince magnitudes and relative importance of weights are very different for\ndifferent layers of a neural network, existing methods rely on either manual\ntuning or handcrafted heuristic rules to find appropriate pruning rates\nindividually for each layer. This approach generally leads to suboptimal\nperformance. In this paper, by directly working on the probability space, we\npropose an effective network sparsification method called {\\it probabilistic\nmasking} (ProbMask), which solves a natural sparsification formulation under\nglobal sparsity constraint. The key idea is to use probability as a global\ncriterion for all layers to measure the weight importance. An appealing feature\nof ProbMask is that the amounts of weight redundancy can be learned\nautomatically via our constraint and thus we avoid the problem of tuning\npruning rates individually for different layers in a network. Extensive\nexperimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method\nis highly effective, and can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a\nsignificant margin, especially in the high pruning rate situation. Notably, the\ngap of Top-1 accuracy between our ProbMask and existing methods can be up to\n10\\%. As a by-product, we show ProbMask is also highly effective in identifying\nsupermasks, which are subnetworks with high performance in a randomly weighted\ndense neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 14:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Starting from a known probability distribution, the homotopy\nprocedure generates the unknown normalization of a target distribution. In the\ncontext of stationary distributions that are associated with physical systems\nthe method is an alternative way to estimate an unknown microcanonical\nensemble. The process is iterative and also generates samples from the target\ndistribution. In practice, the homotopy procedure does not circumvent using\nsample averages in the estimation of the normalization constant. The error in\nthe procedure depends on the errors incurred in sample averaging and the number\nof stages used in the computational implementation of the process. However, we\nshow that it is possible to exchange the number of homotopy stages and the\ntotal number of samples needed at each stage in order to enhance the\ncomputational efficiency of the implemented algorithm. Estimates of the error\nas a function of stages and sample averages are derived. These could guide\ncomputational efficiency decisions on how the calculation would be mapped to a\ngiven computer architecture. Consideration is given to how the procedure can be\nadapted to Bayesian estimation problems, both stationary and non-stationary.\nEmphasis is placed on the non-stationary problems, and in particular, on a\nsequential estimation technique known as particle filtering. It is shown that a\nmodification of the particle filter framework to include the homotopy process\ncan improve the computational robustness of particle filters. The homotopy\nprocess can ameliorate particle filter collapse, a common challenge to using\nparticle filters when the sample dimension is small compared with the state\nspace dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 15:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

For a few popular tasks such as power control, beamforming, and MIMO\ndetection, these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while requiring\nless computational efforts, less resources for acquiring channel state\ninformation (CSI), etc. However, it is often challenging for these approaches\nto learn in a dynamic environment.\n  This work develops a new approach that enables data-driven methods to\ncontinuously learn and optimize resource allocation strategies in a dynamic\nenvironment. Specifically, we consider an ``episodically dynamic\" setting where\nthe environment statistics change in ``episodes\", and in each episode the\nenvironment is stationary. We propose to build the notion of continual learning\n(CL) into wireless system design, so that the learning model can incrementally\nadapt to the new episodes, {\\it without forgetting} knowledge learned from the\nprevious episodes. Our design is based on a novel bilevel optimization\nformulation which ensures certain ``fairness\" across different data samples. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the CL approach by integrating it with two\npopular DNN based models for power control and beamforming, respectively, and\ntesting using both synthetic and ray-tracing based data sets. These numerical\nresults show that the proposed CL approach is not only able to adapt to the new\nscenarios quickly and seamlessly, but importantly, it also maintains high\nperformance over the previously encountered scenarios as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 07:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}
