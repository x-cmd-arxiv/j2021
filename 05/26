DL methods in their original forms are not\ncapable of respecting the underlying mathematical models or achieving desired\naccuracy even in big-data regimes. However, many data-driven science and\nengineering problems, such as inverse problems, typically have limited\nexperimental or observational data, and DL would overfit the data in this case.\nLeveraging information encoded in the underlying mathematical models, we argue,\nnot only compensates missing information in low data regimes but also provides\nopportunities to equip DL methods with the underlying physics, hence promoting\nbetter generalization.

The smoothness assumption\nis imposed to allow for the use of smoothing techniques that annihilate the\nnoise. At the same time, imposing the smoothness assumption excludes a\nconsiderable range of stochastic processes, most notably diffusion processes.\nUnder perfect observation of the sample paths, such processes would not need to\nbe excluded from the realm of functional data analysis. In this paper, we\nintroduce a careful modification of existing methods, dubbed the \"reflected\ntriangle estimator\", and show that this allows for the functional data analysis\nof processes with nowhere differentiable sample paths, even when these are\ndiscretely and noisily observed, including under irregular and sparse designs.\nOur estimator matches the established rates of convergence for processes with\nsmooth paths, and furthermore attains the same optimal rates as one would get\nunder perfect observation. Thus, with reflected triangle estimation, the scope\nof applicability of much of the methodology developed for\ndiscretely/irregularly/noisily/sparsely sampled functional data is considerably\nextended.

New\nmissions like CHEOPS aim to characterize previously detected exoplanets, and\npotentially to discover exomoons. In order to optimize search strategies, we\nneed to determine those planets which are the most likely to host moons. We\ninvestigate the tidal evolution of hypothetical moon orbits in systems\nconsisting of a star, one planet and one test moon. We study a few specific\ncases with ten billion years integration time where the evolution of moon\norbits follows one of these three scenarios: (1) \"locking\", in which the moon\nhas a stable orbit on a long time scale ($\\gtrsim$ 10$^9$ years); (2) \"escape\nscenario\" where the moon leaves the planet's gravitational domain; and (3)\n\"disruption scenario\", in which the moon migrates inwards until it reaches the\nRoche lobe and becomes disrupted by strong tidal forces. Applying the model to\nreal cases from an exoplanet catalogue, we study the long-term stability of\nmoon orbits around known exoplanets. We calculate the survival rate which is\nthe fraction of the investigated cases when the moon survived around the planet\nfor the full integration time (which is the age of the star, or if not known,\nthen the age of the Sun).The most important factor determining the long term\nsurvival of an exomoon is the orbital period of the planet. For the majority of\nthe close-in planets (<10 days orbital periods) there is no stable orbit for\nmoons. Between 10 and 300 days we find a transition in survival rate from about\nzero to 70\\%. Our results give a possible explanation to the lack of successful\nexomoon discoveries for close-in planets. Tidal instability causes moons to\nescape or being tidally disrupted around close-in planets which are mostly\nfavoured by current detection techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 16:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Computational modeling is a complementary useful and predictive tool\nthat overcomes these limitations. Considering the increasing interest in the\neffects of pesticides on behavioral traits, the aim of this study was to\nevaluate the effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF) on intra- and inter-specific\ninteractions of anuran tadpoles, complementing traditional ecotoxicological\ntools with a theoretical analysis verified by computational simulations.\nExperiments were developed under two consecutive phases: a first phase of\nexposure, and a second phase of interactions. The second phase consisted of\nevaluating the effects of CPF on intra- and inter-specific interactions of\nexposed C. ornata (Co) tadpoles acting as predators and unexposed Rhinella\nfernandezae (Rf) tadpoles acting as prey, under different predator-prey\nproportions. Also, intraspecific interactions of three Co tadpoles under\ndifferent conditions of exposure were evaluated. During the exposure phase,\nchlorpyrifos induced significant mortality from 48h, irregular swimming, tail\nflexure, and the presence of subcutaneous air. Also, it induced effects on the\nsounds emitted after 96h of exposure, registering less number of pulses and\nhigher dominant frequencies, and altered intra- and inter-specific\ninteractions. During the interaction phase, the larvae continued to show sound\neffects, however, the antipredator mechanism continued to be operating and\nefficient. Finally, it was possible to model the behavior of the larvae under\nthe effects of chlorpyrifos. We conclude that experimental data and\ncomputational modeling matched within errors. Therefore, computational\nsimulation is a valuable ecotoxicological tool that provides new information\nand allows predicting natural processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 16:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Further\nreducing quantum noise will require both lowering decoherence from losses as\nwell more sophisticated manipulations to counter the quantum back-action from\nradiation pressure. Both tasks require fully understanding the physical\ninteractions between squeezed light and the many components of km-scale\ninterferometers.

Interest in such modelling arises due to\nthe potential of wake steering as a strategy for mitigating power reduction and\nunsteady loading of downstream turbines in wind farms. We first estimate the\ndistribution of the shed vorticity at the wake edge due to both yaw offset and\nrotating blades. By considering the wake edge as an ideally thin vortex sheet,\nwe describe its evolution in time moving with the flow. Vortex sheet equations\nare solved using a power series expansion method, and an approximate solution\nfor the wake shape is obtained. The vortex sheet time evolution is then mapped\ninto a spatial evolution by using a convection velocity. Apart from the wake\nshape, the lateral deflection of the wake including ground effects is modelled.\nOur results show that there exists a universal solution for the shape of curled\nwakes if suitable dimensionless variables are employed. For the case of\nturbulent boundary layer inflow, the decay of vortex sheet circulation due to\nturbulent diffusion is included. Finally, we modify the Gaussian wake model by\nincorporating the predicted shape and deflection of the curled wake, so that we\ncan calculate the wake profiles behind yawed turbines.

Negotiations between DEAL and Elsevier began in 2016, and broke\ndown without a successful agreement in 2018; in this time, around 200 German\nresearch institutions cancelled their license agreements with Elsevier, leading\nElsevier to restrict journal access at those institutions from July 2018\nonwards. We investigated the effect of these access restrictions on\nresearchers' publishing and citing behaviours from a bibliometric perspective,\nusing a dataset of ~410,000 articles published by researchers at the affected\nDEAL institutions between 2012-2020. We further investigated these effects with\nrespect to the timing of contract cancellations with Elsevier, research\ndisciplines, collaboration patterns, and article open-access status. We find\nevidence for a decrease in Elsevier's market share of articles from DEAL\ninstitutions, from a peak of 25.3% in 2015 to 20.6% in 2020, with the largest\nyear-on-year market share decreases occurring in 2019 (-1.1%) and 2020 (-1.6%)\nfollowing the implementation of access restrictions.

We conclude that Elsevier access\nrestrictions have led to some reduced willingness of researchers at DEAL\ninstitutions to publish their research in Elsevier journals, but that\nresearchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier\narticles, with the implication that researchers use a variety of other methods\n(e.g. interlibrary loans, sharing between colleagues, or \"shadow libraries\") to\naccess scientific literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 16:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

To this end, the nearly\nlinear, tight correlation of far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosity of\nstar-forming galaxies is widely used. While the FIR is linked to massive star\nformation, which also generates shock-accelerated cosmic ray (CR) electrons and\nradio synchrotron emission, a detailed understanding of the underlying physics\nis still lacking. Hence, we perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical\n(MHD) simulations of isolated galaxies over a broad range of halo masses and\nSFRs using the moving-mesh code AREPO, and evolve the CR proton energy density\nself-consistently. In post-processing, we calculate the steady-state spectra of\nprimary, shock-accelerated and secondary CR electrons, which result from\nhadronic CR proton interactions with the interstellar medium. The resulting\ntotal radio luminosities correlate with the FIR luminosities as observed and\nare dominated by primary CR electrons if we account for anisotropic CR\ndiffusion. The increasing contribution of secondary emission up to 30 per cent\nin starbursts is compensated by the larger bremsstrahlung and Coulomb losses.\nCR electrons are in the calorimetric limit and lose most of their energy\nthrough inverse Compton interactions with star-light and cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) photons while less energy is converted to synchrotron\nemission. This implies steep steady-state synchrotron spectra in starbursts.\nInterestingly, we find that thermal free-free emission hardens the total radio\nspectra at high radio frequencies and reconciles calorimetric theory with\nobservations while free-free absorption explains the observed low-frequency\nflattening towards the central regions of starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

This makes it possible to start from a lattice theory and use rather\nelementary mathematics to isolate the entire algebraic structure of the\ncorresponding low-energy continuum theory.\n  The first half of this paper illustrates this approach through a persnickety\nstudy of (1 + 1)D continuum theories that emerge from the $\\mathbb{Z}_K$ clock\nmodel at large $K$. This leads to a direct lattice derivation of many known\ncontinuum results, such as the operator product expansion of vertex operators\nin the free scalar CFT. Many new results are obtained too. For example,\nself-consistency of the lattice-continuum correspondence leads to a rich, novel\nproposal for the symmetry breaking structure of the clock model at weak\ncoupling, deep in the BKT regime. This also makes precise what one means by\n\"continuous\" when saying that continuous symmetries cannot be broken in (1+1)D.\n  The second half of this paper is devoted to path integrals for continuum\ntheories of bosons and fermions defined in this finitary formalism. The path\nintegrals constructed here have both nonperturbative lattice definitions and\nmanifest continuum properties, such as symmetries under infinitesimal rotations\nor dilatations. Remarkably, this setup also makes it possible to generalize\nNoether's theorem to discrete symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 18:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

However, current\nreconstruction methods focus on extracting more information from the\npre-trained model but do not leverage network engineering. This work is the\nfirst to consider network engineering as an approach to design the\nreconstruction method. Specifically, we propose the AutoReCon method, which is\na neural architecture search-based reconstruction method.

Our calculations show that acoustic longitudinal\n(LA), flexural (FA), and twisting (TW) modes in nanotubes exhibit a distinct\ndissipative behavior in the long-wavelength limit, $|k| \\rightarrow 0$, which\nmanifests itself in scattering rates that scale as $\\Gamma_{\\rm{LA}}\\sim\n|k|^{-1/2}$, $\\Gamma_{\\rm{FA}}\\sim k^0$, and $\\Gamma_{\\rm{TW}}\\sim |k|^{1/2}$.\nThese scaling relations are a consequence of the harmonic lattice approximation\nand critically depend on the condition that tubes are free of mechanical\nstrain.

However, in some regions, ideal vaccination coverage in dogs\nis not obtained due to low participation in the MDVC. Travel distance to the\nvaccination sites has been identified as an important barrier to participation.\nWe aim to increase MDVC participation by optimally placing fixed point\nvaccination locations to minimize walking distance to the nearest vaccination\nlocation. We quantified participation probability based on walking distance to\nthe nearest vaccination point using a Poisson regression model. The regression\nwas fit with survey data collected from 2016-2019. We then used a computational\nrecursive interchange technique to solve the facility location problem to find\na set of optimal placements of fixed point vaccination locations. Finally, we\ncompared predicted participation of optimally placed vaccination sites to\nhistorical participation data from surveys collected from 2016-2019. We\nidentified the p-median algorithm to solve the facility location problem as\nideal for fixed point vaccination placement. We found a predicted increase in\nMDVC participation if vaccination locations are placed optimally. We also found\na more even vaccination coverage with optimized vaccination sites; however, the\nworkload in some optimized locations increased significantly. We developed a\ndata-driven computational algorithm to combat an ongoing rabies epidemic by\noptimally using limited resources to maximize vaccination coverage. The main\npositive effects we expect if this algorithm is to be implemented would be\nincreased overall vaccination coverage and increased spatial evenness of\ncoverage. A potential negative effect could be the presence of long waiting\nlines as participation increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 18:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Super-zethrenes are also considered to exhibit an\nopen-shell ground state. Zethrenes may thus serve as model compounds to\ninvestigate nanoscale pi-magnetism. However, their synthesis is extremely\nchallenging due to their high reactivity.

Using single-molecule scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy, we show that super-nonazethrene exhibits an\nopen-shell singlet ground state featuring a large spin polarization-driven\nelectronic gap of 1 eV. We obtain real-space maps of the frontier molecular\norbitals, and find that they correspond to singly occupied molecular orbitals.\nIn consistence with the emergence of an open-shell ground state,\nhigh-resolution tunneling spectroscopy reveals inelastic singlet-triplet spin\nexcitations in super-nonazethrene, characterized by a strong intramolecular\nmagnetic exchange coupling of 51 meV. Further insights are gained by mean-field\nand many-body perturbation theory calculations.

For the case of a rotating helix moving through a fluid\nat a low Reynolds number, the method amounts to replacing the original helix\n(in the limit of small pitch) by a cylinder, but with a special kind of partial\nslip boundary conditions replacing the non-slip boundary conditions on the\noriginal helix. These boundary conditions are constructed to reproduce\nfar-field velocities of the original problem, and are defined by a few\nparameters (slipping lengths) that can be extracted from a problem in planar\nrather than cylindrical geometry. We derive the chiral propulsion coefficients\nfor spirals, helicoids, helically modulated cylinders, and some of their\ngeneralizations using the introduced method. In the case of spirals, we compare\nour results with the ones derived by Lighthill and find a very good agreement.\nThe proposed method is general and can be applied to any helical shape in the\nlimit of a small pitch. We have established that for a broad class of helical\nsurfaces the dependence of the chiral propulsion on the helical angle $\\theta$\nis universal, $\\chi\\sim \\cos\\theta\\sin 2\\theta$ with the maximal propulsion\nachieved at the universal angle $\\theta_m = \\tan^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2})\\approx\n35.26^\\circ$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 19:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Instead, many turn to LIDAR localization,\nbut this comes at the expense of building LIDAR maps that can be costly to\nmaintain. Another possibility is to use semantic cues such as lane lines and\ntraffic lights to achieve localization, but these are usually not continuously\nvisible. This issue can be remedied by combining semantic cues with GPS to fill\nin the gaps. However, due to elapsed time between mapping and localization, the\nlive GPS frame can be offset from the semantic map frame, requiring\ncalibration. In this paper, we propose a robust semantic localization algorithm\nthat self-calibrates for the offset between the live GPS and semantic map\nframes by exploiting common semantic cues, including traffic lights and lane\nmarkings. We formulate the problem using a modified Iterated Extended Kalman\nFilter, which incorporates GPS and camera images for semantic cue detection via\nConvolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results show that our proposed\nalgorithm achieves decimetre-level accuracy comparable to typical LIDAR\nlocalization performance and is robust against sparse semantic features and\nfrequent GPS dropouts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 19:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 22:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Although movements are ultimately executed at the\nlevel of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected\nto serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations\nthat extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with\nother agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise\nof learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,\nlonger-term planning and multi-agent coordination.

We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use\nof transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different\nlevels of abstraction.

We used the SPIPS algorithm, a\nrobust implementation of the parallax-of-pulsation method that combines\nphotometry, angular diameter, stellar effective temperature, and RV\nmeasurements in a global modelling of the pulsation. We obtained new\nphotometric measurements at mid-IR with the VLT/VISIR complemented with\nliterature data. We then compared the mean magnitude from 0.5$\\mu$m to 70$\\mu$m\nwith stellar atmosphere models to infer the IR excess, which we attribute to\nthe presence of a CSE. We report that at least 29% of our sample have a\ndetected IR excess. We estimated a mean excess of 0.08mag in K and 0.13mag in\nN. Other Cepheids possibly have IR excess, but they were rejected due to their\nlow detection level compared to a single-star model. We do not see any\ncorrelation between the IR excess and the pulsation period as previously\nsuspected for MW Cepheids, but a rather constant trend. We also do not find any\ncorrelation between the CO absorption and the presence of a CSE, but rather\nwith the stellar effective temperature, which confirms that the CO features\npreviously reported are mostly photospheric. No bias caused by the presence of\nthe CSE is detected on the average distance estimates from a SPIPS analysis\nwith a fitted colour excess. We also do not find correlation between the\npresence of IR excess and the evolution stage. We report a fraction of 29% of\nCepheids with an IR excess likely produced by the CSE.

Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as\nsearching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural\narchitecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture\nsearch' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded\nsignificant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for\na local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around\narchitectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.\n  In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to\narchitecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We\ndevelop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture\nwill achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.\nWe then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition\nitself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this\nexplanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep\nlearning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first\nline of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.\n  Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of\na neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a\nprimary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the\n'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.\nVia extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the\narchitecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful\npredictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is\nessential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually\nsimple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute,\nhas extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows\ninstructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled\nvia our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the\nmost powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural\nnetwork analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which\nwe use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.\n  Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties\nthat have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go\non to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of\nrandomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile\nour insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue\ncan significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning\ndeployment.\n  Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the\nvast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.\nWe study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision,\nloss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on\nperformance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we\nbelieve can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 20:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

To do this efficiently, the plankton can use a gyrotactic\nmechanism, aligning them with gravity to swim downwards, or against gravity to\nswim upwards. Many species show passive mechanisms for gyrotactic stability.\nFor example, bottom-heavy plankton tend to align upwards. This is efficient for\nupward migration in quiescent flows, but it is often sensitive to turbulence\nwhich upsets the alignment. Here we suggest a simple, robust active mechanism\nfor gyrotactic stability, which is only lightly affected by turbulence and\nallows alignment both along and against gravity. We use a model for a plankton\nthat swims with a constant speed and can actively steer in response to\nhydrodynamic signals encountered in simulations of a turbulent flow. Using\nreinforcement learning, we identify the optimal steering strategy. By using its\nsetae to sense its settling velocity transversal to its swimming direction, the\nswimmer can deduce information about the direction of gravity, allowing it to\nactively align upwards. The mechanism leads to a rate of upward migration in a\nturbulent flow that is of the same order as in quiescent flows, unless the\nturbulence is very vigorous. In contrast, passive swimmers with typical\nparameters of copepods show much smaller upward velocity in turbulence.\nSettling may even cause them to migrate downwards in vigorous turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 21:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 09:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

One\napproach investigators may take to infer about optimal DTRs is via Bayesian\ndynamic Marginal Structural Models (MSMs). These models represent the expected\noutcome under adherence to a DTR for DTRs in a family indexed by a parameter $\n\\psi $; the function mapping regimes in the family to the expected outcome\nunder adherence to a DTR is known as the value function. Models that allow for\nthe straightforward identification of an optimal DTR may lead to biased\nestimates. If such a model is computationally tractable, common wisdom says\nthat a grid-search for the optimal DTR may obviate this difficulty. In a\nBayesian context, computational difficulties may be compounded if a posterior\nmean must be calculated at each grid point. We seek to alleviate these\ninferential challenges by implementing Gaussian Process ($ \\mathcal{GP} $)\noptimization methods for estimators for the causal effect of adherence to a\nspecified DTR.

That is, $p$-fraction of the interactions are random, while\n$(1-p)$-fraction are adversarial. The aim of our model is to bridge the gap\nbetween a uniformly random scheduler (which is too idealistic) and an\nadversarial scheduler (which is too strict).\n  We focus on the fundamental problem of leader election in population\nprotocols.

Then we studied the\ncorrelation of optical-to-radio offsets with the observing (radio) frequency,\nsource morphology, magnitude, redshift, and source type. The deviation among\noptical-to-radio offsets determined in the different radio bands is less than\n0.5 mas, but there is statistical evidence that the optical-to-radio offset is\nsmaller at K band compared to S/X band for sources showing extended structures.\nThe optical-to-radio offset was found to statistically correlate with the\nstructure index.

A central challenge in this setting is that the unknown\ntarget policy itself may not exhibit low-dimensional behavior, and so there is\na potential for the representation learning objective to alias states in which\nthe target policy acts differently. Circumventing this challenge, we derive a\nrepresentation learning objective that provides an upper bound on the\nperformance difference between the target policy and a lowdimensional policy\ntrained with max-likelihood, and this bound is tight regardless of whether the\ntarget policy itself exhibits low-dimensional structure.

As a distributed system,\nblockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the\ntechnologys adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions\nand blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits\nscalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing\nsolutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization,\nlimiting the technologys original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a\ndistributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for\nblockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high\nscalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains\nfrom broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains\nwhere all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of\nIoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks\nwhich in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers:\ni) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced\nalong with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks,\nfrom the source to the destination, and ii) verification layer where a set of\nrandomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The\nperformance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing\noverhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet\noverhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the\nprocessing overhead remains scale-independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 00:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Energy\nharvesting, biomedical devices, flexible electronics and sensors are some other\napplications enabled by electro-active soft materials. The phenomenon of\nflexoelectricity is an enticing alternative that refers to the development of\nelectric polarization in dielectrics when subjected to strain gradients. In\nparticular, flexoelectricity offers a direct linear coupling between a highly\ndesirable deformation mode (flexure) and electric stimulus. Unfortunately,\nbarring some exceptions, the flexoelectric effect is quite weak and rather\nsubstantial bending curvatures are required for an appreciable\nelectro-mechanical response. Most experiments in the literature appear to\nconfirm modest flexoelectricity in polymers although perplexingly, a singular\nwork has measured a \"giant\" effect in elastomers under some specific\nconditions. Due to the lack of an understanding of the microscopic\nunderpinnings of flexoelectricity in elastomers and a commensurate theory, it\nis not currently possible to either explain the contradictory experimental\nresults on elastomers or pursue avenues for possible design of large\nflexoelectricity. In this work, we present a statistical-mechanics theory for\nthe emergent flexoelectricity of elastomers consisting of polar monomers. The\ntheory is shown to be valid in broad generality and leads to key insights\nregarding both giant flexoelectricity and material design. In particular, the\ntheory shows that, in standard elastomer networks, combining stretching and\nbending is a mechanism for obtaining giant flexoelectricity, which also\nexplains the aforementioned, surprising experimental discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 01:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

However, obtaining such clean speech data is not\nstraightforward - especially, if only considering publicly available datasets.\nAt the same time, a lot of material for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with\nthe desired acoustic/speaker/sampling rate characteristics is publicly\navailable except being clean, i.e., it also contains background noise as this\nis even often desired in order to have ASR systems that are noise-robust.\nHence, using such data to train SE systems is not straightforward.

In addition, they are hardly able to control\nthe degree of makeup during transferring or to transfer a specified part in the\ninput face. In this work, we propose the PSGAN++, which is capable of\nperforming both detail-preserving makeup transfer and effective makeup removal.\nFor makeup transfer, PSGAN++ uses a Makeup Distill Network to extract makeup\ninformation, which is embedded into spatial-aware makeup matrices. We also\ndevise an Attentive Makeup Morphing module that specifies how the makeup in the\nsource image is morphed from the reference image, and a makeup detail loss to\nsupervise the model within the selected makeup detail area. On the other hand,\nfor makeup removal, PSGAN++ applies an Identity Distill Network to embed the\nidentity information from with-makeup images into identity matrices. Finally,\nthe obtained makeup/identity matrices are fed to a Style Transfer Network that\nis able to edit the feature maps to achieve makeup transfer or removal. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our PSGAN++, we collect a Makeup Transfer In the\nWild dataset that contains images with diverse poses and expressions and a\nMakeup Transfer High-Resolution dataset that contains high-resolution images.\nExperiments demonstrate that PSGAN++ not only achieves state-of-the-art results\nwith fine makeup details even in cases of large pose/expression differences but\nalso can perform partial or degree-controllable makeup transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 04:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

CFR solves games by travsersing the full game tree iteratively,\nwhich limits its scalability in larger games. When applying CFR to solve\nlarge-scale games in previously, large-scale games are abstracted into\nsmall-scale games firstly. Secondly, CFR is used to solve the abstract game.\nAnd finally, the solution strategy is mapped back to the original large-scale\ngame. However, this process requires considerable expert knowledge, and the\naccuracy of abstraction is closely related to expert knowledge. In addition,\nthe abstraction also loses certain information, which will eventually affect\nthe accuracy of the solution strategy. Towards this problem, a recent method,\n\\textit{Deep CFR} alleviates the need for abstraction and expert knowledge by\napplying deep neural networks directly to CFR in full games. In this paper, we\nintroduces \\textit{Neural Network Counterfactual Regret Minimization (NNCFR)},\nan improved variant of \\textit{Deep CFR} that has a faster convergence by\nconstructing a dueling netwok as the value network.

A very interesting\ntool to analyze stability of general physical systems that are localized in\nspace is the configuration (or complexity) entropy (CE). This quantity,\ninspired in Shannon information entropy, is defined in terms of the energy\ndensity of the system in momentum space. The purpose of this work is to use the\nCE to investigate the stability of the soft wall background as a function of\nthe temperature. A nontrivial aspect is that the geometry is an anti-de Sitter\nblack hole, that has a singular energy density. In order to make it possible to\ncalculate the CE, we first propose a regularized form for the black hole energy\ndensity. Then, calculating the CE, it is observed that its behavior is\nconsistently related to the black hole instability in anti-de Sitter space.\nAnother interesting result that emerges from this analysis is that the\nregularized energy density shows a behavior similar to the Wien law, satisfied\nby black body radiation. That means: the momentum $ k_{max} $ where the energy\ndensity is maximum, varies with the temperature $T$ obeying the relation: $ T /\nk_{max} = constant $ in the deconfined phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 06:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

For estimating these sums, one of the\nmost salient quantities to understand is the character ratio\n  trace(\\pi(g)) / dim(\\pi), for an irreducible representation \\pi of G and an\nelement g of G. It turns out [Gurevich-Howe15, Gurevich-Howe17] that for\nclassical groups G over finite fields there are several (compatible) invariants\nof representations that provide strong information on the character ratios. We\ncall these invariants collectively rank. Rank suggests a new way to organize\nthe representations of classical groups over finite and local fields - a way in\nwhich the building blocks are the \"smallest\" representations. This is in\ncontrast to Harish-Chandra's philosophy of cusp forms that is the main\norganizational principle since the 60s, and in it the building blocks are the\ncuspidal representations which are, in some sense, the \"LARGEST\". The\nphilosophy of cusp forms is well adapted to establishing the Plancherel formula\nfor reductive groups over local fields, and led to Lusztig's classification of\nthe irreducible representations of such groups over finite fields. However,\nanalysis of character ratios might benefit from a different approach. In this\nnote we discuss further the notion of tensor rank for GL_n over a finite field\nF_q and demonstrate how to get information on representations of a given tensor\nrank using tools coming from the recently studied eta correspondence, as well\nas the well known philosophy of cusp forms, mentioned just above. A significant\ndiscovery so far is that although the dimensions of the irreducible\nrepresentations of a given tensor rank vary by quite a lot (they can differ by\nlarge powers of q), for certain group elements of interest the character ratios\nof these irreps are nearly equal to each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 07:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Since the synonymous relations between\nqueries and keywords are quite scarce, the traditional information retrieval\nframework is inefficient in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel\nquotient space-based retrieval framework to address this problem. Considering\nthe synonymy among keywords as a mathematical equivalence relation, we can\ncompress the synonymous keywords into one representative, and the corresponding\nquotient space would greatly reduce the size of the keyword repository. Then an\nembedding-based retrieval is directly conducted between queries and the keyword\nrepresentatives. To mitigate the semantic gap of the quotient space-based\nretrieval, a single semantic siamese model is utilized to detect both the\nkeyword--keyword and query-keyword synonymous relations. The experiments show\nthat with our quotient space-based retrieval method, the synonymous keyword\nretrieving performance can be greatly improved in terms of memory cost and\nrecall efficiency.

Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are thought to be in a transitory\nphase between O stars on the main-sequence and the Wolf-Rayet stage. Recent\nstudies suggest that they might be formed through binary interaction. Only a\nfew are known in binary systems but their multiplicity fraction is uncertain.\nAims. This study aims at deriving the binary fraction among the Galactic\n(confirmed and candidate) LBV population. We combine multi-epoch spectroscopy\nand long-baseline interferometry. Methods. We use cross-correlation to measure\ntheir radial velocities. We identify spectroscopic binaries through significant\nRV variability (larger than 35 km/s). We investigate the observational biases\nto establish the intrinsic binary fraction. We use CANDID to detect\ninterferometric companions, derive their parameters and positions. Results. We\nderive an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of 26 %. Considering period\nand mass ratio ranges from Porb=1 to 1000 days, and q = 0.1-1.0, and a\nrepresentative set of orbital parameter distributions, we find a bias-corrected\nbinary fraction of 62%. From interferometry, we detect 14 companions out of 18\nobjects, providing a binary fraction of 78% at projected separations between 1\nand 120 mas. From the derived primary diameters, and the distances of these\nobjects, we measure for the first time the exact radii of Galactic LBVs to be\nbetween 100 and 650 Rsun, making unlikely to have short-period systems.\nConclusions. This analysis shows that the binary fraction among the Galactic\nLBV population is large. If they form through single-star evolution, their\norbit must be initially large. If they form through binary channel that implies\nthat either massive stars in short binary systems must undergo a phase of fully\nnon-conservative mass transfer to be able to sufficiently widen the orbit or\nthat LBVs form through merging in initially binary or triple systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 07:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

They prune the search tree, and furthermore feed conservative\ncontact force estimates into the iterative solve behind an implicit time\nstepping. Implicit time stepping and non-analytical shapes often yield\nprohibitive high compute cost for rigid body simulations. Our approach reduces\nthese cost algorithmically by one to two orders of magnitude. It also exhibits\nhigh vectorisation efficiency due to its iterative nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 09:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 09:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

However, the inaccessibility of\npredictions/labels makes the white-box attack impractical to a real graph\nlearning system. This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and\nflexible sense -- we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding models\nwith black-box driven. We investigate the theoretical connections between graph\nsignal processing and graph embedding models and formulate the graph embedding\nmodel as a general graph signal process with a corresponding graph filter.\nTherefore, we design a generalized adversarial attacker: GF-Attack. Without\naccessing any labels and model predictions, GF-Attack can perform the attack\ndirectly on the graph filter in a black-box fashion. We further prove that\nGF-Attack can perform an effective attack without knowing the number of layers\nof graph embedding models.

This is due to its capability to induce large modulations of the\nsurface charge density by means of the electric-double-layer field-effect\ntransistor (EDL-FET) architecture, and has been proven to be capable of tuning\neven the properties of metallic systems. In this short review, I summarize the\nmain results which have been achieved so far in controlling the superconducting\n(SC) properties of thin films of conventional metallic superconductors by means\nof the ionic gating technique. I discuss how the gate-induced charge doping,\ndespite being confined to a thin surface layer by electrostatic screening,\nresults in a long-range \"bulk\" modulation of the SC properties by the coherent\nnature of the SC condensate, as evidenced by the observation of suppressions in\nthe critical temperature of films much thicker than the electrostatic screening\nlength, and by the pronounced thickness-dependence of their magnitude. I review\nhow this behavior can be modelled in terms of proximity effect between the\ncharge-doped surface layer and the unperturbed bulk with different degrees of\napproximation, and how first-principles calculations have been employed to\ndetermine the origin of an anomalous increase in the electrostatic screening\nlength at ultrahigh electric fields, thus fully confirming the validity of the\nproximity effect model.

Recently, a series of seminal studies suggested that\nnormalizing flows - a class of deep generative models - can form the basis of a\nsampling strategy that does not suffer from this 'critical slowing down'. The\ncentral idea is to use machine learning techniques to build (approximate)\ntrivializing maps, i.e. field transformations that map the theory of interest\ninto a 'simpler' theory in which the degrees of freedom decouple, and where the\nstatistical weight in the path integral is given by a distribution from which\nsampling is easy. No separate process is required to generate training data for\nsuch models, and convergence to the desired distribution is guaranteed through\na reweighting procedure such as a Metropolis test. In a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration on two-dimensional $\\phi^4$ theory, Albergo et al.\n(arXiv:1904.12072) modelled the trivializing map as a sequence of pointwise\naffine transformations. We pick up this thread, with the aim of quantifying how\nwell we can expect this approach to scale as we increase the number of degrees\nof freedom in the system. We make several modifications to the original design\nthat allow our models learn more efficient representations of trivializing maps\nusing much smaller neural networks, which leads to a large reduction in the\ncomputational cost required to train models of equivalent quality. After making\nthese changes, we find that sampling efficiency is almost entirely dictated by\nhow extensively a model has been trained, while being unresponsive to further\nalterations that increase model flexibility.

We use rest-frame\noptical spectroscopy from KMOS and MOSFIRE, and the UV features observed with\nMUSE, to determine the systemic redshifts, which are offset from Lyman alpha by\n346 km s$^{-1}$, with a 100 to 600 km s$^{-1}$ range.

This is mostly because in\nthis range, two competing mechanisms can efficiently produce gamma rays: the\ninverse Compton scattering of accelerated electrons, and interactions of\naccelerated protons with nuclei of the ISM. In addition to the acceleration of\nparticles from the thermal pool, the reacceleration of pre-existing CRs is\noften overlooked, and shall in fact also been taken into account. Especially,\nbecause of the distance to the SNR ($\\sim 1$ kpc), and the low density in which\nthe shock is currently expanding ($\\sim 10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$), the\nre-acceleration of CR electrons pre-existing in the ISM, can account for a\nsignificant fraction of the observed gamma-ray emission, and contribute to the\nshaping of the spectrum in the GeV-TeV range. Remarkably, this emission of\nleptonic origin is found to be close to the level of the gamma-ray signal in\nthe TeV range, provided that the spectrum of pre-exisiting cosmic ray electrons\nis similar to the one observed in the local interstellar medium. The overall\ngamma-ray spectrum of RX J1713.7-3946 is naturally produced as the sum of a\nleptonic emission from reaccelerated CR electrons, and a subdominant hadronic\nemission from accelerated protons. We also argue that neutrino observations\nwith next-generation detectors might lead to a detection even in the case of a\nlepto-hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 11:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 12:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group\ntogether passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several\nmetropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and\nenvironmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and CO2\nemissions.\n  Unfortunately, despite their advantages, not many people opt to use these\nridesharing services. We believe that increasing the user satisfaction from the\nservice will cause more people to utilize it, which, in turn, will improve the\nquality of the service, such as the waiting time, cost, travel time, and\nservice availability. One possible way for increasing user satisfaction is by\nproviding appropriate explanations comparing the alternative modes of\ntransportation, such as a private taxi ride and public transportation. For\nexample, a passenger may be more satisfied from a shared-ride if she is told\nthat a private taxi ride would have cost her 50% more. Therefore, the problem\nis to develop an agent that provides explanations that will increase the user\nsatisfaction.\n  We model our environment as a signaling game and show that a rational agent,\nwhich follows the perfect Bayesian equilibrium, must reveal all of the\ninformation regarding the possible alternatives to the passenger. In addition,\nwe develop a machine learning based agent that, when given a shared-ride along\nwith its possible alternatives, selects the explanations that are most likely\nto increase user satisfaction. Using feedback from humans we show that our\nmachine learning based agent outperforms the rational agent and an agent that\nrandomly chooses explanations, in terms of user satisfaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 12:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Link prediction is often used as a proxy to evaluate the\nquality of these embeddings. Given that the creation of benchmarks for link\nprediction is a time-consuming endeavor, most work on the subject matter uses\nonly a few benchmarks. As benchmarks are crucial for the fair comparison of\nalgorithms, ensuring their quality is tantamount to providing a solid ground\nfor developing better solutions to link prediction and ipso facto embedding\nknowledge graphs. First studies of benchmarks pointed to limitations pertaining\nto information leaking from the development to the test fragments of some\nbenchmark datasets. We spotted a further common limitation of three of the\nbenchmarks commonly used for evaluating link prediction approaches:\nout-of-vocabulary entities in the test and validation sets. We provide an\nimplementation of an approach for spotting and removing such entities and\nprovide corrected versions of the datasets WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10. Our\nexperiments on the corrected versions of WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10\nsuggest that the measured performance of state-of-the-art approaches is altered\nsignificantly with p-values <1%, <1.4%, and <1%, respectively.

The (1+1)~Evolutionary\nAlgorithm and RLS operate in a setting where the number of colors is bounded\nand we are minimizing the number of conflicts. Iterated local search algorithms\nuse an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and,\nconsequently, the smallest number of colors.\n  We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or\neven harder than optimization from scratch, i.e., starting with a random\ninitialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems.\nHowever, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for\nothers. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than\noptimizing from scratch. We further show that tailoring mutation operators to\nparts of the graph where changes have occurred can significantly reduce the\nexpected reoptimization time.

A\npossible way is via the Coulomb interaction, which then defines the Mott\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT). Another possibility is the MIT driven by\ndisorder, the so-called Anderson MIT. Here we analyze interacting particles in\ndisordered Hubbard chains $-$ thus comprising the Mott-Anderson physics $-$ by\ninvestigating the ground-state entanglement with density functional theory. The\nlocalization signature on entanglement is found to be a local minimum at a\ncertain critical density. Individually, the Mott (Anderson) MIT has a single\ncritical density whose minimum entanglement decreases as the interaction\n(disorder) enhances. While in the Mott MIT entanglement saturates at finite\nvalues, characterizing partial localization, in the Anderson MIT the system\nreaches full localization, with zero entanglement, for sufficiently strong\ndisorder. In the combined Mott-Anderson MIT, we find three critical densities\nreferring to local minima on entanglement. One of them is the same as for the\nAnderson MIT, but now the presence of interaction requires a stronger disorder\npotential to induce localization. A second critical density is related to the\nMott MIT, but due to disorder it is displaced by a factor proportional to the\nconcentration of impurities. The third local minimum on entanglement is unique\nto the concomitant presence of disorder and interaction, found to be related to\nan effective density phenomenon, thus referred to as a Mott-like MIT.

We propose a compressed sensing\nmethod for detecting two-qubit correlated dephasing errors, assuming only that\nthe correlations are sparse (i.e., at most s pairs of qubits have correlated\nerrors, where s << n(n-1)/2, and n is the total number of qubits). In\nparticular, our method can detect long-range correlations between any two\nqubits in the system (i.e., the correlations are not restricted to be\ngeometrically local).\n  Our method is highly scalable: it requires as few as m = O(s log n)\nmeasurement settings, and efficient classical postprocessing based on convex\noptimization. In addition, when m = O(s log^4(n)), our method is highly robust\nto noise, and has sample complexity O(max(n,s)^2 log^4(n)), which can be\ncompared to conventional methods that have sample complexity O(n^3). Thus, our\nmethod is advantageous when the correlations are sufficiently sparse, that is,\nwhen s < O(n^(3/2) / log^2(n)). Our method also performs well in numerical\nsimulations on small system sizes, and has some resistance to\nstate-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors.

Aligned to this goal,\nthis work puts forth a novel framework for learning dynamics after small-signal\ndisturbances by leveraging Gaussian processes (GPs). We extend results on\nlearning of a linear time-invariant system using GPs to the multi-input\nmulti-output setup. This is accomplished by decomposing power system swing\ndynamics into a set of single-input single-output linear systems with narrow\nfrequency pass bands. The proposed learning technique captures time derivatives\nin continuous time, accommodates data streams sampled at different rates, and\ncan cope with missing data and heterogeneous levels of accuracy. While Kalman\nfilter-based approaches require knowing all system inputs, the proposed\nframework handles readings of system inputs, outputs, their derivatives, and\ncombinations thereof collected from an arbitrary subset of buses. Relying on\nminimal system information, it further provides uncertainty quantification in\naddition to point estimates of system dynamics. Numerical tests verify that\nthis technique can infer dynamics at non-metered buses, impute and predict\nsynchrophasors, and locate faults under linear and non-linear system models\nunder ambient and fault disturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 15:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 14:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

To alleviate this issue, we propose spatial smoothing, a\nmethod that spatially ensembles neighboring feature map points of convolutional\nneural networks.

Our approach is\ncompatible with most existing parallelisms (e.g. data parallelism, pipeline\nparallelism and tensor parallelism), which means our sequence parallelism makes\n4D parallelism possible. More importantly, we no longer require a single device\nto hold the whole sequence. That is, with sparse attention, our sequence\nparallelism enables us to train transformer with infinite long sequence.\nSpecifically, we split the input sequence into multiple chunks and feed each\nchunk into its corresponding device (i.e. GPU). To compute the attention\noutput, we integrated ring-style communication with self-attention calculation\nand proposed Ring Self-Attention (RSA). Experiments show that sequence\nparallelism performs well when scaling with batch size and sequence length.\nCompared with tensor parallelism, our approach achieved $13.7\\times$ and\n$3.0\\times$ maximum batch size and sequence length respectively when scaling up\nto 64 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

In such large-scale and\nheterogeneous networks (HetNets), radio resource allocation and management\n(RRAM) becomes one of the major challenges encountered during system design and\ndeployment. In this context, emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\ntechniques are expected to be one of the main enabling technologies to address\nthe RRAM in future wireless HetNets. In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nin-depth, and comprehensive survey of the applications of DRL techniques in\nRRAM for next generation wireless networks. Towards this, we first overview the\nexisting traditional RRAM methods and identify their limitations that motivate\nthe use of DRL techniques in RRAM. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of\nthe most widely used DRL algorithms to address RRAM problems, including the\nvalue- and policy-based algorithms. The advantages, limitations, and use-cases\nfor each algorithm are provided. We then conduct a comprehensive and in-depth\nliterature review and classify existing related works based on both the radio\nresources they are addressing and the type of wireless networks they are\ninvestigating. To this end, we carefully identify the types of DRL algorithms\nutilized in each related work, the elements of these algorithms, and the main\nfindings of each related work. Finally, we highlight important open challenges\nand provide insights into several future research directions in the context of\nDRL-based RRAM.

The prediction of desiccation cracking\nin soils is challenging due to the lack of insights into the complex coupled\nhydro-mechanical process at the grain scale. In this paper, a new hybrid\ndiscrete-continuum numerical framework, capable of capturing hydro-mechanical\nbehaviour of soil at both grain and macro scales, is proposed for predicting\ndesiccation cracking in clayey soil. In this framework, a soil layer is\nrepresented by an assembly of DEM particles, each occupies an equivalent\ncontinuum space and carries physical properties governing unsaturated flow.\nThese particles move freely in the computational space following the discrete\nelement method (DEM), while their contact network and the continuum mixture\ntheory are used to model the unsaturated flow. The dependence of\nparticle-to-particle contact behaviour on water content is represented by a\ncohesive-frictional contact model, whose material properties are governed by\nthe water content. In parallel with the theoretical development is a series of\nexperiments on 3D soil desiccation cracking to determine essential properties\nand provide data for the validation of mechanical and physical behaviour. Very\ngood agreement in both physical behaviour (e.g. evolution of water content) and\nmechanical behaviour (e.g. occurrence and development of cracks, and\ndistribution of compressive and tensile strains) demonstrates that the proposed\nframework is capable of capturing the hydro-mechanical behaviour of soil during\ndesiccation. The capability of the proposed framework facilitates numerical\nexperiments for insights into the hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated\nsoils that have not been possible before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 23:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Based on this model,\nwe have statistically analysed the transitions of epileptic seizures by\nperforming tens of simulation trials.

This random presence of epileptic seizures is absent\nwhen the noise intensity continues to increase, accompanying with an increase\nin the epileptic depolarization block duration.
